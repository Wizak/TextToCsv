the true story book dedication to francis mccunn you like the things i used to like the things im fond of still the sound of fairy wands that strike men into beasts at will the cruel stepmother the fair stepdaughter kind and leal the bull and bear so debonair the trenchant fairy steel you love the world where brute and fish converse with man and bird where dungeons open at a wish and seas dry at a word that merry world today we leave we list an owertrue tale of hearts that sore for charlie grieve when handsome princes fail of gallant races overthrown of dungeons ill to climb theres no such tale of trouble known in all the fairy time there montezuma still were king there charles would wear the crown and there the highlanders would ding the hanoverian down in fairyland the rightful cause is never long awinning in fairyland the fairy laws are prompt to punish sinning for fairylands the land of joy and this the world of pain so back to fairyland my boy well journey once again introduction it is not without diffidence that the editor offers the true story book to children we have now given them three fairy books and their very kind and flattering letters to the editor prove not only that they like the three fairy books but that they clamour for more what disappointment then to receive a volume full of adventures which actually happened to real people there is not a dragon in the collection nor even a giant witches here play no part and almost all the characters are grown up on the other hand if we have no fairies we have princes in plenty and a sweeter young prince than tearlach as far as this part of his story goes the editor flatters himself that you shall nowhere find not in grimm or dasent or perrault still it cannot be denied that true stories are not so good as fairy tales they do not always end happily and what is worse they do remind a young student of lessons and schoolrooms a child may fear that he is being taught under a specious pretence of diversion and that learning is being thrust on him under the disguise of entertainment prince charlie and corts may be asked about in examinations whereas no examiner has hitherto set questions on blue beard or heart of ice or the red etin of ireland there is to be honest no way of getting over this difficulty but the editor vows that he does not mean to teach anybody and he has tried to mix the stories up so much that no clear and consecutive view of history can possibly be obtained from them moreover when history does come in it is not the kind of history favoured most by examiners they seldom set questions on the conquest of mexico for example that is a very long story but to the editors taste it is simply the best true story in the world the most unlikely and the most romantic for who could have supposed that the newfound world of the west held all that wealth of treasure emeralds and gold all those people so beautiful and brave so courteous and cruel with their terrible gods hideous human sacrifices and almost christian prayers that a handful of spaniards themselves mistaken for children of a white god should have crossed the sea should have found a lovely lady as in a fairy tale ready to lead them to victory should have planted the cross on the shambles of huitzilopochtli after that wild battle on the temple crest should have been driven in rout from and then recaptured the venice of the west the lake city of mexico all this is as strange as unlooked for as any story of adventures in a new planet could be no invention of fights and wanderings in nomans land no search for the mines of solomon the king can approach for strangeness and romance this tale which is true and vouched for by spanish conquerors like bernal diaz and by native historians like ixtlilochitl and by later missionaries like sahagun corts is the great original of all treasurehunters and explorers in fiction and here no feigned tale can be the equal of the real as mr prescotts admirable history is not a book much read by children nor even by grownups for that matter the editor hopes children will be pleased to find the adventures in anahuac in this collection miss edgeworth tells us in orlandino how much the tale delighted the young before mr prescott wrote that excellent narrative of the worlds chief adventure may it please still as it did when the century was young the adventures of prince charlie are already known in part to boys and girls who have read the tales of a grandfather for pleasure and not as a school book but here mrs mccunn has treated of them at greater length and more minutely the source here is in these seven brown octavo volumes all written in the closest hand which are a treasure of the advocates library in edinburgh the author is mr forbes a bishop of the persecuted episcopalian church in scotland mr forbes collected his information very carefully closely comparing the narratives of the various actors in the story into the boards of his volumes are fastened a scrap of the princes tartan waistcoat a rag from his sprigged calico dress a bit of his brogues a twopenny treasure that has been wept and prayed over by the faithful nobody in a book for children would have the heart to tell the tale of the princes later years of a moody heartbroken degraded exile but in the hills and the isles bating a little wilfulness and foolhardiness and the affair of the broken punchbowl prince charles is a model for princes and all men brave gay muchenduring goodhumoured kind royally courteous and considerate even beyond what may be gathered from this part of the book while the loyalty of the highlanders as in the case of mackinnon flogged nearly to death was proof against torture as well as against gold it is the sobieski strain not the stuart that we here admire in prince charles it is a piety a loyalty a goodness like gordons that we revere in old lord pitsligo in another story many of the tales are concerned with fighting for that is the most dramatic part of mortal business these english captives who retake a ship from the turks these heroes of the shannon and the chesapeake were doubtless good men and true in all their lives but the light of history only falls on them in war the immortal three hundred of thermopyl would also have been unknown had they not died to a man for the sake of the honour of lacedmon the editor conceives that it would have been easy to give more local colour to the sketch of thermopyl to have dealt in description of the immortals drawn from the friezes in susa lately discovered by french enterprise but the story is greek and the greeks did not tell their stories in that way but with a simplicity almost bald yet who dare alter and improve the narrative of herodotus in another most romantic event the finding of vineland the good by leif the lucky our materials are vague with the vagueness of a dream later fancy has meddled with the truth of the saga english readers no doubt best catch the charm of the adventure in mr rudyard kiplings astonishingly imaginative tale called the best story in the world for the account of isandhlwana and rorkes drift an owertrue tale the editor has to thank his friend mr rider haggard who was in south africa at the time of the disaster and who has generously given time and labour to the task of ascertaining as far as it can be ascertained the exact truth of the melancholy but finally not inglorious business the legend of two great cricket matches is taken in part from lillywhites scores and mr robert lytteltons spirited pages in the badminton book of cricket the second match the editor writes of as he who saw it to quote caxton on dares phrygius these legends prove that a match is never lost till it is won some of the true stories contain we may surmise traces of the imaginative faculty the escapes of benvenuto cellini of trenck and of casanova must be taken as the heroes chose to report them benvenuto and casanova have no firm reputation for veracity again the escape of csar borgia is from a version handed down by the great alexandre dumas and we may surmise that alexandre allowed it to lose nothing in the telling he may have given it a sword and a cocked hat as was sir walters wont about kaspar hausers mystery we can hardly speak of the truth for the exact truth will never be known the depositions of the earliest witnesses were not taken at once some witnesses altered their evidence in later years parts of the records of nuremberg are lost in suspicious circumstances the duchess of clevelands book kaspar hauser is written in defence of her father lord stanhope the charges against lord stanhope that he aided in or connived at the slaying of kaspar because kaspar was the true heir of the house of baden are as childish as they are wicked but the duchess hardly allows for the difficulties in which we find ourselves if we regard kaspar as absolutely and throughout an impostor this however is not the place to discuss an historical mystery this true story is told as a romance founded on fact the hypothesis that kaspar was a son and heir of the house of baden seems to the editor to be absolutely devoid of evidence to madame von platt stuart the author owes permission to quote the striking adventures of her father or of her uncle on the flooded findhorn the lays of the deer forest which contain this tale in the volume of notes were written by john sobieski stuart and by charles edward stuart and the editor is uncertain as to which of those gentlemen was the hero of these perilous crossings of the highland river many other good tales legends and studies of natural history and of highland manners may be found in the lays of the deer forest apart from the curious interest of the poems on the whole with certain exceptions the editor has tried to find true stories rather out of the beaten paths of history the narrative of john tanner for instance is probably true but the book in which his adventures were published is now rather difficult to procure for a boy among the red indians two cricket matches the spartan three hundred the finding of vineland the good and the escapes of lord pitsligo the editor is himself responsible as far as they do not consist of extracts from the original sources miss may kendall translated or adapted casanovas escape and the piratical and algerine tales mrs lang reduced the narrative of the chevalier johnstone and did the escapes of csar borgia of trenck and cervantes while miss blackley renders that of benvenuto cellini mrs mccunn as already said compiled from the sources indicated the adventures of prince charles and she tells the story of grace darling the contemporary account is unluckily rather meagre miss alleyne did the kidnapping of the princes mrs plowden the story of kaspar hauser miss wright reduced the adventures of corts from prescott and mr rider haggard has already been mentioned in connection with isandhlwana here the editor leaves the true story book to the indulgence of children explaining once more that his respect for their judgment is very great and that he would not dream of imposing lessons on them in the shape of a christmas book no lessons are one thing and stories are another but though fiction is undeniably stranger and more attractive than truth yet true stories are also rather attractive and strange now and then and after all we may return once more to fairyland after this excursion into the actual workaday world contents page a boy among the red indians

huitzilopochtli montezuma assailed by missiles a boy among the red indians the earliest event of my life which i distinctly remember says john tanner is the death of my mother this happened when i was two years old and many of the attending circumstances made so deep an impression that they are still fresh in my memory i cannot recollect the name of the settlement at which we lived but i have since learned it was on the kentucky river at a considerable distance from the ohio my father whose name was john tanner was an emigrant from virginia and had been a clergyman when about to start one morning to a village at some distance he gave as it appeared a strict charge to my sisters agatha and lucy to send me to school but this they neglected to do until afternoon and then as the weather was rainy and unpleasant i insisted on remaining at home when my father returned at night and found that i had been at home all day he sent me for a parcel of small canes and flogged me much more severely than i could suppose the offence merited i was displeased with my sisters for attributing all the blame to me when they had neglected even to tell me to go to school in the forenoon from that time my fathers house was less like home to me and i often thought and said i wish i could go and live among the indians one day we went from cincinnati to the mouth of the big miami opposite which we were to settle here was some cleared land and one or two log cabins but they had been deserted on account of the indians my father rebuilt the cabins and inclosed them with a strong picket it was early in the spring when we arrived at the mouth of the big miami and we were soon engaged in preparing a field to plant corn i think it was not more than ten days after our arrival when my father told us in the morning that from the actions of the horses he perceived there were indians lurking about in the woods and he said to me john you must not go out of the house today after giving strict charge to my stepmother to let none of the little children go out he went to the field with the negroes and my elder brother to drop corn three little children besides myself were left in the house with my stepmother to prevent me from going out my stepmother required me to take care of the little child then not more than a few months old but as i soon became impatient of confinement i began to pinch my little brother to make him cry my mother perceiving his uneasiness told me to take him in my arms and walk about the house i did so but continued to pinch him my mother at length took him from me to nurse him i watched my opportunity and escaped into the yard thence through a small door in the large gate of the wall into the open field there was a walnuttree at some distance from the house and near the side of the field where i had been in the habit of finding some of the last years nuts to gain this tree without being seen by my father and those in the field i had to use some precaution i remember perfectly well having seen my father as i skulked towards the tree he stood in the middle of the field with his gun in his hand to watch for indians while the others were dropping corn as i came near the tree i thought to myself i wish i could see these indians i had partly filled with nuts a straw hat which i wore when i heard a crackling noise behind me i looked round and saw the indians almost at the same instant i was seized by both hands and dragged off betwixt two one of them took my straw hat emptied the nuts on the ground and put it on my head the indians who seized me were an old man and a young one these were as i learned subsequently manitoogeezhik and his son kishkauko illustration after i saw myself firmly seized by both wrists by the two indians i was not conscious of anything that passed for a considerable time i must have fainted as i did not cry out and i can remember nothing that happened to me until they threw me over a large log which must have been at a considerable distance from the house the old man i did not now see i was dragged along between kishkauko and a very short thick man i had probably made some resistance or done something to irritate this last for he took me a little to one side and drawing his tomahawk motioned to me to look up this i plainly understood from the expression of his face and his manner to be a direction for me to look up for the last time as he was about to kill me i did as he directed but kishkauko caught his hand as the tomahawk was descending and prevented him from burying it in my brains loud talking ensued between the two kishkauko presently raised a yell the old man and four others answered it by a similar yell and came running up i have since understood that kishkauko complained to his father that the short man had made an attempt to kill his little brother as he called me the old chief after reproving him took me by one hand and kishkauko by the other and dragged me betwixt them the man who had threatened to kill me and who was now an object of terror to me being kept at some distance i could perceive as i retarded them somewhat in their retreat that they were apprehensive of being overtaken some of them were always at some distance from us it was about one mile from my fathers house to the place where they threw me into a hickorybark canoe which was concealed under the bushes on the bank of the river into this they all seven jumped and immediately crossed the ohio landing at the mouth of the big miami and on the south side of that river here they abandoned their canoe and stuck their paddles in the ground so that they could be seen from the river at a little distance in the woods they had some blankets and provisions concealed they offered me some dry venison and bears grease but i could not eat my fathers house was plainly to be seen from the place where we stood they pointed at it looked at me and laughed but i have never known what they said after they had eaten a little they began to ascend the miami dragging me along as before it must have been early in the spring when we arrived at saugenong for i can remember that at this time the leaves were small and the indians were about planting their corn they managed to make me assist at their labours partly by signs and partly by the few words of english old manitoogeezhik could speak after planting they all left the village and went out to hunt and dry meat when they came to their huntinggrounds they chose a place where many deer resorted and here they began to build a long screen like a fence this they made of green boughs and small trees when they had built a part of it they showed me how to remove the leaves and dry brush from that side of it to which the indians were to come to shoot the deer in this labour i was sometimes assisted by the squaws and children but at other times i was left alone it now began to be warm weather and it happened one day that having been left alone as i was tired and thirsty i fell asleep i cannot tell how long i slept but when i began to awake i thought i heard someone crying a great way off then i tried to raise up my head but could not being now more awake i saw my indian mother and sister standing by me and perceived that my face and head were wet the old woman and her daughter were crying bitterly but it was some time before i perceived that my head was badly cut and bruised it appears that after i had fallen asleep manitoogeezhik passing that way had perceived me had tomahawked me and thrown me in the bushes and that when he came to his camp he had said to his wife old woman the boy i brought you is good for nothing i have killed him you will find him in such a place the old woman and her daughter having found me discovered still some signs of life and had stood over me a long time crying and pouring cold water on my head when i waked in a few days i recovered in some measure from this hurt and was again set to work at the screen but i was more careful not to fall asleep i endeavoured to assist them at their labours and to comply in all instances with their directions but i was notwithstanding treated with great harshness particularly by the old man and his two sons shemung and kwotashe while we remained at the hunting camp one of them put a bridle in my hand and pointing in a certain direction motioned me to go i went accordingly supposing he wished me to bring a horse i went and caught the first i could find and in this way i learned to discharge such services as they required of me i had been about two years at saugenong when a great council was called by the british agents at mackinac this council was attended by the sioux the winnebagoes the menomonees and many remote tribes as well as by the ojibbeways ottawwaws c when old manitoogeezhik returned from this council i soon learned that he had met there his kinswoman netnokwa who notwithstanding her sex was then regarded as principal chief of the ottawwaws this woman had lost her son of about my age by death and having heard of me she wished to purchase me to supply his place my old indian mother the otter woman when she heard of this protested vehemently against it i heard her say my son has been dead once and has been restored to me i cannot lose him again but these remonstrances had little influence when netnokwa arrived with plenty of whisky and other presents she brought to the lodge first a tengallon keg of whisky blankets tobacco and other articles of great value she was perfectly acquainted with the dispositions of those with whom she had to negotiate objections were made to the exchange until the contents of the keg had circulated for some time then an additional keg and a few more presents completed the bargain and i was transferred to netnokwa this woman who was then advanced in years was of a more pleasing aspect than my former mother she took me by the hand after she had completed the negotiation with my former possessors and led me to her own lodge which stood near here i soon found i was to be treated more indulgently than i had been she gave me plenty of food put good clothes upon me and told me to go and play with her own sons we remained but a short time at saugenong she would not stop with me at mackinac which we passed in the night but ran along to point st ignace where she hired some indians to take care of me while she returned to mackinac by herself or with one or two of her young men after finishing her business at mackinac she returned and continuing on our journey we arrived in a few days at shabawywyagun the husband of netnokwa was an ojibbeway of red river called tawgaweninne the hunter he was seventeen years younger than netnokwa and had turned off a former wife on being married to her tawgaweninne was always indulgent and kind to me treating me like an equal rather than as a dependent when speaking to me he always called me his son indeed he himself was but of secondary importance in the family as everything belonged to netnokwa and she had the direction in all affairs of any moment she imposed on me for the first year some tasks she made me cut wood bring home game bring water and perform other services not commonly required of the boys of my age but she treated me invariably with so much kindness that i was far more happy and content than i had been in the family of manitoogeezhik she sometimes whipped me as she did her own children but i was not so severely and frequently beaten as i had been before early in the spring netnokwa and her husband with their family started to go to mackinac they left me as they had done before at point st ignace as they would not run the risk of losing me by suffering me to be seen at mackinac on our return after we had gone twentyfive or thirty miles from point st ignace we were detained by contrary winds at a place called menaukoking a point running out into the lake here we encamped with some other indians and a party of traders pigeons were very numerous in the woods and the boys of my age and the traders were busy shooting them i had never killed any game and indeed had never in my life discharged a gun my mother had purchased at mackinac a keg of powder which as they thought it a little damp was here spread out to dry tawgaweninne had a large horsemans pistol and finding myself somewhat emboldened by his indulgent manner toward me i requested permission to go and try to kill some pigeons with the pistol my request was seconded by netnokwa who said it is time for our son to begin to learn to be a hunter accordingly my father as i called tawgaweninne loaded the pistol and gave it to me saying go my son and if you kill anything with this you shall immediately have a gun and learn to hunt since i have been a man i have been placed in difficult situations but my anxiety for success was never greater than in this my first essay as a hunter i had not gone far from the camp before i met with pigeons and some of them alighted in the bushes very near me i cocked my pistol and raised it to my face bringing the breech almost in contact with my nose having brought the sight to bear upon the pigeon i pulled trigger and was in the next instant sensible of a humming noise like that of a stone sent swiftly through the air i found the pistol at the distance of some paces behind me and the pigeon under the tree on which he had been sitting my face was much bruised and covered with blood i ran home carrying my pigeon in triumph my face was speedily bound up my pistol exchanged for a fowlingpiece i was accoutred with a powderhorn and furnished with shot and allowed to go out after birds one of the young indians went with me to observe my manner of shooting i killed three more pigeons in the course of the afternoon and did not discharge my gun once without killing henceforth i began to be treated with more consideration and was allowed to hunt often that i might become expert game began to be scarce and we all suffered from hunger the chief man of our band was called assinneboinainse the little assinneboin and he now proposed to us all to move as the country where we were was exhausted the day on which we were to commence our removal was fixed upon but before it arrived our necessities became extreme the evening before the day on which we intended to move my mother talked much of all our misfortunes and losses as well as of the urgent distress under which we were then labouring at the usual hour i went to sleep as did all the younger part of the family but i was wakened again by the loud praying and singing of the old woman who continued her devotions through great part of the night very early on the following morning she called us all to get up and put on our moccasins and be ready to move she then called wamegonabiew to her and said to him in rather a low voice my son last night i sung and prayed to the great spirit and when i slept there came to me one like a man and said to me netnokwa tomorrow you shall eat a bear there is at a distance from the path you are to travel tomorrow and in such a direction which she described to him a small round meadow with something like a path leading from it in that path there is a bear now my son i wish you to go to that place without mentioning to anyone what i have said and you will certainly find the bear as i have described to you but the young man who was not particularly dutiful or apt to regard what his mother said going out of the lodge spoke sneeringly to the other indians of the dream the old woman said he tells me we are to eat a bear today but i do not know who is to kill it the old woman hearing him called him in and reproved him but she could not prevail upon him to go to hunt i had my gun with me and i continued to think of the conversation i had heard between my mother and wamegonabiew respecting her dream at length i resolved to go in search of the place she had spoken of and without mentioning to anyone my design i loaded my gun as for a bear and set off on our back track i soon met a woman belonging to one of the brothers of tawgaweninne and of course my aunt this woman had shown little friendship for us considering us as a burthen upon her husband who sometimes gave something for our support she had also often ridiculed me she asked me immediately what i was doing on the path and whether i expected to kill indians that i came there with my gun i made her no answer and thinking i must be not far from the place where my mother had told wamegonabiew to leave the path i turned off continuing carefully to regard all the directions she had given at length i found what appeared at some former time to have been a pond it was a small round open place in the woods now grown up with grass and small bushes this i thought must be the meadow my mother had spoken of and examining around it i came to an open space in the bushes where it is probable a small brook ran from the meadow but the snow was now so deep that i could see nothing of it my mother had mentioned that when she saw the bear in her dream she had at the same time seen a smoke rising from the ground i was confident this was the place she had indicated and i watched long expecting to see the smoke but wearied at length with waiting i walked a few paces into the open place resembling a path when i unexpectedly fell up to my middle in the snow i extricated myself without difficulty and walked on but remembering that i had heard the indians speak of killing bears in their holes it occurred to me that it might be a bears hole into which i had fallen and looking down into it i saw the head of a bear lying close to the bottom of the hole i placed the muzzle of my gun nearly between his eyes and discharged it as soon as the smoke cleared away i took a piece of stick and thrust it into the eyes and into the wound in the head of the bear and being satisfied that he was dead i endeavoured to lift him out of the hole but being unable to do this i returned home following the track i had made in coming out as i came near the camp where the squaws had by this time set up the lodges i met the same woman i had seen in going out and she immediately began again to ridicule me have you killed a bear that you come back so soon and walk so fast i thought to myself how does she know that i have killed a bear but i passed by her without saying anything and went into my mothers lodge after a few minutes the old woman said my son look in that kettle and you will find a mouthful of beaver meat which a man gave me since you left us in the morning you must leave half of it for wamegonabiew who has not yet returned from hunting and has eaten nothing today i accordingly ate the beaver meat and when i had finished it observing an opportunity when she stood by herself i stepped up to her and whispered in her ear my mother i have killed a bear what do you say my son said she i have killed a bear are you sure you have killed him yes is he quite dead yes she watched my face for a moment and then caught me in her arms hugging and kissing me with great earnestness and for a long time i then told her what my aunt had said to me both going and returning and this being told to her husband when he returned he not only reproved her for it but gave her a severe flogging the bear was sent for and as being the first i had killed was cooked all together and the hunters of the whole band invited to feast with us according to the custom of the indians the same day one of the crees killed a bear and a moose and gave a large share of the meat to my mother illustration one winter i hunted for a trader called by the indians aneeb which means an elmtree as the winter advanced and the weather became more and more cold i found it difficult to procure as much game as i had been in the habit of supplying and as was wanted by the trader early one morning about midwinter i started an elk i pursued until night and had almost overtaken him but hope and strength failed me at the same time what clothing i had on me notwithstanding the extreme coldness of the weather was drenched with sweat it was not long after i turned towards home that i felt it stiffening about me my leggings were of cloth and were torn in pieces in running through the bush i was conscious i was somewhat frozen before i arrived at the place where i had left our lodge standing in the morning and it was now midnight i knew it had been the old womans intention to move and i knew where she would go but i had not been informed she would go on that day as i followed on their path i soon ceased to suffer from cold and felt that sleepy sensation which i knew preceded the last stage of weakness in such as die of cold i redoubled my efforts but with an entire consciousness of the danger of my situation it was with no small difficulty that i could prevent myself from lying down at length i lost all consciousness for some time how long i cannot tell and awaking as from a dream i found i had been walking round and round in a small circle not more than twenty or twentyfive yards over after the return of my senses i looked about to try to discover my path as i had missed it but while i was looking i discovered a light at a distance by which i directed my course once more before i reached the lodge i lost my senses but i did not fall down if i had i should never have got up again but i ran round and round in a circle as before when i at last came into the lodge i immediately fell down but i did not lose myself as before i can remember seeing the thick and sparkling coat of frost on the inside of the pukkwi lodge and hearing my mother say that she had kept a large fire in expectation of my arrival and that she had not thought i should have been so long gone in the morning but that i should have known long before night of her having moved it was a month before i was able to go out again my face hands and legs having been much frozen there is on the bank of the little saskawjewun a place which looks like one the indians would always choose to encamp at in a bend of the river is a beautiful landingplace behind it a little plain a thick wood and a small hill rising abruptly in the rear but with that spot is connected a story of fratricide a crime so uncommon that the spot where it happened is held in detestation and regarded with terror no indian will land his canoe much less encamp at the place of the two dead men they relate that many years ago the indians were encamped here when a quarrel arose between two brothers having sheshegwi for totems one drew his knife and slew the other but those of the band who were present looked upon the crime as so horrid that without hesitation or delay they killed the murderer and buried them together as i approached this spot i thought much of the story of the two brothers who bore the same totem with myself and were as i supposed related to my indian mother i had heard it said that if any man encamped near their graves as some had done soon after they were buried they would be seen to come out of the ground and either react the quarrel and the murder or in some other manner so annoy and disturb their visitors that they could not sleep curiosity was in part my motive and i wished to be able to tell the indians that i not only stopped but slept quietly at a place which they shunned with so much fear and caution the sun was going down as i arrived and i pushed my little canoe in to the shore kindled a fire and after eating my supper lay down and slept very soon i saw the two dead men come and sit down by my fire opposite me their eyes were intently fixed upon me but they neither smiled nor said anything i got up and sat opposite them by the fire and in this situation i awoke the night was dark and gusty but i saw no men or heard any other sound than that of the wind in the trees it is likely i fell asleep again for i soon saw the same two men standing below the bank of the river their heads just rising to the level of the ground i had made my fire on and looking at me as before after a few minutes they rose one after the other and sat down opposite me but now they were laughing and pushing at me with sticks and using various methods of annoyance i endeavoured to speak to them but my voice failed me i tried to fly but my feet refused to do their office throughout the whole night i was in a state of agitation and alarm among other things which they said to me one of them told me to look at the top of the little hill which stood near i did so and saw a horse fettered and standing looking at me there my brother said the ghost is a horse which i give you to ride on your journey tomorrow and as you pass here on your way home you can call and leave the horse and spend another night with us at last came the morning and i was in no small degree pleased to find that with the darkness of the night these terrifying visions vanished but my long residence among the indians and the frequent instances in which i had known the intimations of dreams verified occasioned me to think seriously of the horse the ghost had given me accordingly i went to the top of the hill where i discovered tracks and other signs and following a little distance found a horse which i knew belonged to the trader i was going to see as several miles travel might be saved by crossing from this point on the little saskawjewun to the assinneboin i left the canoe and having caught the horse and put my load upon him led him towards the tradinghouse where i arrived next day in all subsequent journeys through this country i carefully shunned the place of the two dead and the account i gave of what i had seen and suffered there confirmed the superstitious terrors of the indians i was standing by our lodge one evening when i saw a goodlooking young woman walking about and smoking she noticed me from time to time and at last came up and asked me to smoke with her i answered that i never smoked you do not wish to touch my pipe for that reason you will not smoke with me i took her pipe and smoked a little though i had not been in the habit of smoking before she remained some time and talked with me and i began to be pleased with her after this we saw each other often and i became gradually attached to her i mention this because it was to this woman that i was afterwards married and because the commencement of our acquaintance was not after the usual manner of the indians among them it most commonly happens even when a young man marries a woman of his own band he has previously had no personal acquaintance with her they have seen each other in the village he has perhaps looked at her in passing but it is probable they have never spoken together the match is agreed on by the old people and when their intention is made known to the young couple they commonly find in themselves no objection to the arrangement as they know should it prove disagreeable mutually or to either party it can at any time be broken off i now redoubled my diligence in hunting and commonly came home with meat in the early part of the day at least before night i then dressed myself as handsomely as i could and walked about the village sometimes blowing the pebegwun or flute for some time miskwabunokwa pretended she was not willing to marry me and it was not perhaps until she perceived some abatement of ardour on my part that she laid this affected coyness entirely aside for my own part i found that my anxiety to take a wife home to my lodge was rapidly becoming less and less i made several efforts to break off the intercourse and visit her no more but a lingering inclination was too strong for me when she perceived my growing indifference she sometimes reproached me and sometimes sought to move me by tears and entreaties but i said nothing to the old woman about bringing her home and became daily more and more unwilling to acknowledge her publicly as my wife about this time i had occasion to go to the tradinghouse on red river and i started in company with a halfbreed belonging to that establishment who was mounted on a fleet horse the distance we had to travel has since been called by the english settlers seventy miles we rode and went on foot by turns and the one who was on foot kept hold of the horses tail and ran we passed over the whole distance in one day in returning i was by myself and without a horse and i made an effort intending if possible to accomplish the same journey in one day but darkness and excessive fatigue compelled me to stop when i was within about ten miles of home when i arrived at our lodge on the following day i saw miskwabunokwa sitting in my place as i stopped at the door of the lodge and hesitated to enter she hung down her head but netnokwa greeted me in a tone somewhat harsher than was common for her to use to me will you turn back from the door of the lodge and put this young woman to shame who is in all respects better than you are this affair has been of your seeking and not of mine or hers you have followed her about the village heretofore now you would turn from her and make her appear like one who has attempted to thrust herself in your way i was in part conscious of the justness of netnokwas reproaches and in part prompted by inclination i went in and sat down by the side of miskwabunokwa and thus we became man and wife old netnokwa had while i was absent at red river without my knowledge or consent made her bargain with the parents of the young woman and brought her home rightly supposing that it would be no difficult matter to reconcile me to the measure in most of the marriages which happen between young persons the parties most interested have less to do than in this case the amount of presents which the parents of a woman expect to receive in exchange for her diminishes in proportion to the number of husbands she may have had i now began to attend to some of the ceremonies of what may be called the initiation of warriors this being the first time i had been on a warparty for the first three times that a man accompanies a warparty the customs of the indians require some peculiar and painful observances from which old warriors may if they choose be exempted the young warrior must constantly paint his face black must wear a cap or headdress of some kind must never precede the old warriors but follow them stepping in their tracks he must never scratch his head or any other part of his body with his fingers but if he is compelled to scratch he must use a small stick the vessel he eats or drinks out of or the knife he uses must be touched by no other person the young warrior however long and fatiguing the march must neither eat nor drink nor sit down by day if he halts for a moment he must turn his face towards his own country that the great spirit may see that it is his wish to return home again it was tanners wish to return home again and after many dangerous and disagreeable adventures he did at last when almost an old man come back to the whites and tell his history which as he could not write was taken down at his dictation footnotes the totem is the crest of the indians from tanners captivity new york casanovas escape in july casanova di seingalt a venetian gentleman who by reason of certain books of magic he possessed fell under the displeasure of the church was imprisoned by order of the inquisition in a cell in the ducal palace the cell in which he was imprisoned was one of seven called the leads because they were under the palace roof which was covered neither by slates nor bricks but great heavy sheets of lead they were guarded by archers and could only be reached by passing through the hall of council the secretary of the inquisition had charge of their key which the gaoler after going the round of the prisoners restored to him every morning four of the cells faced eastward over the palace canal the other three westward over the court casanovas was one of the three and he calculated that it was exactly above the private room of the inquisitors for many hours after the gaoler first turned the key upon casanova he was left alone in the gloomy cell not high enough for him to stand upright in and destitute even of a couch he laid aside his silk mantle his hat adorned with spanish lace and a white plume for when roused from sleep and arrested by the inquisition he had put on the suit lying ready in which he intended to have gone to a gay entertainment the heat of the cell was extreme the prisoner leaned his elbows on the ledge of the grating which admitted to the cell what light there was and fell into a deep and bitter reverie eight hours passed and then the complete solitude in which he was left began to trouble him another hour another and another but when night really fell to take casanovas own account i became like a raging madman stamping cursing and uttering wild cries after more than an hour of this furious exercise seeing no one not hearing the least sign which could have made me imagine that anyone was aware of my fury i stretched myself on the ground but my bitter grief and anger and the hard floor on which i lay did not prevent me from sleeping the midnight bell woke me i could not believe that i had really passed three hours without consciousness of pain without moving lying as i was on my left side i stretched out my right hand for my handkerchief which i remembered was there groping with my hand heavens suddenly it rested upon another hand icy cold terror thrilled me from head to foot and my hair rose i had never in all my life known such an agony of fear and would never have thought myself capable of it three or four minutes i passed not only motionless but bereft of thought then recovering my senses i began to think that the hand i touched was imaginary in that conviction i stretched out my arm once more only to encounter the same hand which with a cry of horror i seized and let go again drawing back my own i shuddered but being able to reason by this time i decided that while i slept a corpse had been laid near me for i was sure there was nothing when i lay down on the floor but whose was the dead body some innocent sufferer perhaps one of my own friends whom they had strangled and laid there that i might find before my eyes when i woke the example of what my own fate was to be that thought made me furious for the third time i approached the hand with my own i clasped it and at the same instant i tried to rise to draw this dead body towards me and be certain of the hideous crime but as i strove to prop myself on my left elbow the cold hand i was clasping became alive and was withdrawn and i knew that instant to my utter astonishment that i held none other than my own left hand which lying stiffened on the hard floor had lost heat and sensation entirely that incident though comic did not cheer casanova but gave him matter for the darkest reflections since he saw himself in a place where if the unreal seemed so true reality might one day become a dream in other words he feared approaching madness but at last came daybreak and byandby the gaoler returned asking the prisoner if he had had time to find out what he would like to eat casanova was allowed to send for all he needed from his own apartments in venice but writingimplements any metal instruments whatever even knife and fork and the books he mentioned were struck from his list the inquisitors sent him books which they themselves thought suitable and which drove him he said to the verge of madness he was not illtreated having a daily allowance given him to buy what food he liked which was more than he could spend but the loss of liberty soon became insupportable for months he believed that his deliverance was close at hand but when november came and he saw no prospect of release he began to form projects of escape and soon the idea of freeing himself however wild and impossible it seemed took complete possession of him illustration byandby he was allowed half an hours daily promenade in the corridor galetas outside his cell a dingy ratinfested place into which old rubbish was apt to drift one day casanova noticed a piece of black marble on the floor polished an inch thick and six inches long he picked it up stealthily and without any definite intention managed to hide it away in his cell another morning his eyes fell upon a long iron bolt lying on the floor with other old odds and ends and that also concealed in his dress he bore into his cell when left alone he examined it carefully and realised that if pointed it would make an excellent spontoon he took the black marble and after grinding one end of the bolt against it for a long while he saw that he had really succeeded in wearing the iron down for fifteen days he worked till he could hardly stir his right arm and his shoulder felt almost dislocated but he had made the bolt into a real tool or if necessary a weapon with an excellent point he hid it in the straw of his armchair so carefully that to find it one must have known that it was there and then he began to consider what use he should make of it he was certain that the room underneath was the one in which on entering he had seen the secretary of the inquisition and which was probably opened every morning a hole once made in the floor he could easily lower himself by a rope made of the sheets of his bed and fastened to one of the bedposts he might hide under the great table of the tribunal till the door was opened and then make good his escape it was probable indeed that one of the archers would mount guard in this room at night but him casanova resolved to kill with his pointed iron the great difficulty really was that the hole in the floor was not to be made in a day but might be a work of months and therefore some pretext must be found to prevent the archers from sweeping out the cell as they were accustomed to do every morning some days after alleging no reason he ordered the archers not to sweep this omission was allowed to pass for several mornings and then the gaoler demanded casanovas reason he answered that the dust settled on his lungs and made him cough and might give him a mortal disease laurent the gaoler offered to throw water on the floor before sweeping it but casanovas arguments against the dampness of the atmosphere that would result were equally ingenious laurents suspicions however were roused and one day he ordered the room to be swept most carefully and even lit a candle and on the pretence of cleanliness searched the cell thoroughly casanova seemed indifferent but the next day having pricked his finger he showed his handkerchief stained with blood and said that the gaolers cruelty had brought on so severe a cough that he had actually broken a small bloodvessel a doctor was sent for who took the prisoners part and forbade sweeping out the cell in future one great point was gained but the work could not begin yet owing to the fearful cold the prisoner would have been forced to wear gloves and the sight of a worn glove might have excited suspicion so he occupied himself with another stratagem the creation little by little of a lamp for the solace of the endless winter nights one by one the gaoler himself unsuspectingly brought the different ingredients oil was imported in salads wick the prisoner himself made from threads pulled from the quilt and in time the lamp was complete the very unwelcome sojourn of a jewish usurer like himself captive of the inquisition in his cell forced casanova to delay his projects of escape till after easter when the jew was imprisoned elsewhere no sooner had he left than casanova by the light of the lamp constructed with so much difficulty began his task drawing his bed away he set to work to bore through the plank underneath gathering the fragments of wood in a napkin which the next morning he contrived to empty out behind a heap of old cahier books in the corridor and after six hours labour pulling back his bed which concealed all trace of it from the gaolers eyes the first plank was two inches thick the next day he found another plank beneath it and he pierced this only to find a third plank it was three weeks before he dug out a cavity large enough for his purpose in this depth of wood and his disappointment was great when underneath the planks he came to a marble pavement which resisted his one tool but he remembered having read of a general who had broken with an axe hard stones which he first made brittle by vinegar and this casanova possessed he poured a bottle of strong vinegar into the hole and the next day whether it was the effect of the vinegar or of his stronger resolution he managed to loosen the cement which bound the pieces of marble together and in four hours had destroyed the pavement and found another plank which however he believed to be the last at this point his work was once more interrupted by the arrival of a fellow prisoner who only stayed however for eight days a more serious delay was caused by the fact that unwittingly a part of his work had been just above one of the great beams that supported the ceiling and he was forced to enlarge the hole by onefourth but at last all was done through a hole so thin as to be quite imperceptible from below he saw the room underneath there was only a thin film of wood to be broken through on the night of his escape for various reasons he had fixed on the night of august but hear his own words on the th writes casanova there happened what makes me shudder even as i write precisely at noon i heard the rattling of bolts a fearful beating of my heart made me think that my last moment had come and i flung myself on my armchair stupefied laurent entered and said gaily sir i have come to bring you good news on which i congratulate you at first i thought my liberty was to be restored i knew no other news which could be good and i saw that i was lost for the discovery of the hole would have undone me but laurent told me to follow him i asked him to wait till i got ready no matter he said you are only going to leave this dismal cell for a light one quite new where you can see half venice through the two windows where you can stand upright where but i cannot bear to write of it i seemed to be dying i implored laurent to tell the secretary that i thanked the tribunal for its mercy but begged it in heavens name to leave me where i was laurent told me with a burst of laughter that i was mad that my present cell was execrable and that i was to be transferred to a delightful one come come you must obey orders he exclaimed he led me away i felt a momentary solace in hearing him order one of his men to follow with the armchair where my spontoon was still concealed that was always something if my beautiful hole in the floor that i had made with such infinite pains could have followed me too but that was impossible my body went my soul stayed behind as soon as laurent saw me in the fresh cell he had the armchair set down i flung myself upon it and he went away telling me that my bed and all my other belongings should be brought to me at once for two hours casanova was left alone in his new cell utterly hopeless and expecting to be consigned for the rest of his life to one of the palace dungeons from which no escape could be possible then the gaoler returned almost mad with rage and demanded the axe and all the instruments which the prisoner must have employed in penetrating the marble pavement calmly without stirring casanova told him that he did not know what he was talking about but that if he had procured tools it could only have been from laurent himself who alone had entrance to the cell such a reply did not soften the gaolers anger and for some time casanova was very badly treated everything was searched but his tool had been so cleverly concealed that laurent never found it fortunately it was the gaolers interest not to let the tribunal know of the discovery he had made he had the floor of the cell mended without the knowledge of the secretary of the inquisition and when this was done and he found himself secure from blame casanova had little difficulty in making peace with him and even told him the secret of the lamps construction fortunately out of the tribunals allowance to the prisoner enough was always left after he had provided for his own needs for a gift or bribe to the gaoler but laurent did not relax his vigilance and every morning one of the archers went round the cell with an iron bar giving blows to walls and floor to assure himself that there was nothing broken but he never struck the ceiling a fact which casanova resolved to turn to account at the first opportunity one day the prisoner ordered his gaoler to buy him a particular book and laurent objecting to an expense which seemed to him quite needless offered to borrow him a book of one of the other prisoners in exchange for one of his own here at last was an opportunity casanova chose a volume out of his small library and gave it to the gaoler who returned in a few minutes with a latin book belonging to one of the other prisoners pen and ink were forbidden but in this book casanova found a fragment of paper and he contrived with the nail of his little finger dipped in mulberry juice to write on it a list of his library and returned the volume asking for a second the second came and in it a short letter in latin the correspondence between the prisoners had really begun the writer of the latin letter was the monk balbi imprisoned in the leads with a companion count andr asquin he followed it by a much longer one giving the history of his own life and all that he knew of his fellowprisoners casanova formed a very poor opinion of father balbis character from his letters but assistance of some kind he must have since the gaoler must needs discover any attempt to break through the ceiling unless that attempt was made from above but casanova soon thought of a plan by which balbi could break through his ceiling undiscovered i wrote to him he relates that i would find some means of sending him an instrument with which he could break through the roof of his cell and having climbed upon it go to the wall separating his roof from mine breaking through that he would find himself on my roof which also must be broken through that done i would leave my cell and he the count and i together would manage to raise one of the great leaden squares that formed the highest palace roof once outside that i would be answerable for the rest but first he must tell the gaoler to buy him forty or fifty pictures of saints and by way of proving his piety he must cover his walls and ceiling with these putting the largest on the ceiling when he had done this i would tell him more i next ordered laurent to buy me the new folio bible that was just printed for i fancied its great size might enable me to conceal my tool there and so send it to the monk but when i saw it i became gloomy the bolt was two inches longer than the bible the monk wrote to me that the cell was already covered according to my direction and hoped i would lend him the great bible which laurent told him i had bought but i replied that for three or four days i needed it myself at last i hit upon a device i told laurent that on michaelmas day i wanted two dishes of macaroni and one of these must be the largest dish he had for i meant to season it and send it with my compliments to the worthy gentleman who had lent me books laurent would bring me the butter and the parmesan cheese but i myself should add them to the boiling macaroni i wrote to the monk preparing him for what was to happen and on st michaels day all came about as i expected i had hidden the bolt in the great bible wrapped in paper one inch of it showing on each side i prepared the cheese and butter and in due time laurent brought me in the boiling macaroni and the great dish mixing my ingredients i filled the dish so full that the butter nearly ran over the edge and then i placed it carefully on the bible and put that with the dish resting on it into laurents hand warning him not to spill a drop all his caution was necessary he went away with his eyes fixed on his burden lest the butter should run over and the bible with the bolt projecting from it were covered and more than covered by the huge dish his one care was to hold that steady and i saw that i had succeeded presently he came back to tell me that not a drop of butter had been spilt father balbi next began his work detaching from the roof one large picture which he regularly put back in the same place to conceal the hole in eight days he had made his way through the roof and attacked the wall this was harder work but at last he had removed six and twenty bricks and could pass through to casanovas roof this he was obliged to work at very carefully lest any fracture should appear visible below one monday as father balbi was busy at the roof casanova suddenly heard the sound of opening doors it was a terrible moment but he had time to give the alarm signal two quick blows on the ceiling then laurent entered bringing another prisoner an ugly illdressed little man of fifty in a black wig who looked like what he was a spy of the inquisition casanova soon learned the history of soradici for this was the spys name and when his new companion was asleep he wrote to balbi the account of what had happened for the present evidently the work must be given up no confidence whatever could be placed in soradici yet soon casanova thought of a plan of making use even of this traitor first he ordered laurent to buy him an image of the virgin mary holy water and a crucifix next he wrote two letters addressed to friends in venice letters in which he made no complaint but spoke of the benevolence of the inquisition and the blessing that his trials had been to him these letters which even if they reached the hands of the secretary could do him no possible harm he entrusted to soradici in case he should soon be set free exacting the spys solemn oath on the crucifix and the image of the virgin not to betray him but to give the letters to his friends soradici took the oath required of him and sewed the letters into his vest none the less casanova felt confident that he would be betrayed and this was exactly what happened two days after the spy was sent for to the secretary and when he returned to the cell his companion soon discovered that he had given up the letters casanova affected the utmost anguish and despair he flung himself down before the image of the virgin and demanded vengeance on the monster who had ruined him by breaking so solemn a pledge then he lay down with his face to the wall and for the whole day uttered no single word to the spy who terrified at his companions prayer for vengeance entreated his forgiveness but when the spy slept he wrote to father balbi and told him to go on with his work the next day beginning at exactly three oclock and working four hours the next day after the gaoler had left them bearing with him the book of father balbi in which the prisoners letter was concealed casanova called his companion the spy by this time was really ill with terror for he believed that he had provoked the wrath of the virgin mary by breaking his oath he was ready to do anything his companion told him to do and weak enough to credit any falsehood casanova put on a look of inspiration and said learn that at break of day the holy virgin appeared to me and commanded me to forgive you you shall not die the grief that your treachery caused me made me pass all the night sleepless since i knew that the letters you had given to the secretary would prove my ruin and my one consolation was to believe that in three days i should see you die in this very cell but though my mind was full of my revenge unworthy of a christian at break of day the image of the blessed virgin that you see moved opened her lips and said soradici is under my protection i would have you pardon him in reward of your generosity i will send one of my angels in figure of a man who shall descend from heaven to break the roof of the cell and in five or six days to release you today this angel will begin his work at three oclock and will work till half an hour before the sun sets for he must return to me by daylight when you escape you will take soradici with you and you will take care of him all his life on condition that he quits the profession of a spy for ever with these words the blessed virgin disappeared at first even the spys credulity would hardly be persuaded that casanova had not dreamed but when at the appointed hour the sound of the angel working in the roof was really to be heard when it lasted four hours and ceased again as foretold all his doubt vanished and he was ready to follow casanova blindly the thought of once more betraying him never entered his mind he believed that the blessed virgin herself was on the side of his companion the angel would appear casanova told him on the evening of october and at the hour appointed father balbi not looking in the least like an angel came feet foremost through the ceiling casanova embraced him left him to guard the spy and himself ascending through the roof crossed over into the other cell and greeted the monks fellowprisoner count andr who had all this time kept their secret but being old and infirm had no desire to fly with them the next thing was to return into the garret above the two cells and set to work to break through the palace roof itself most of this task fell to casanova till he reached the great sheet of lead surmounting the planks and there the monks help was necessary uniting their strength they raised it till an opening was made wide enough to pass through but outside the moonlight was too strong and they would have been seen from below had they ventured on the roof they returned into the cell and waited casanova had made strong ropes by tying together sheets towels and whatever else would serve now since there was nothing to be done till the moon sank he sat down and wrote a courteous letter to the inquisition explaining his reasons for attempting to escape the spy too cowardly to risk his life in so daring a venture and beginning to see that he had been imposed upon begged casanova on his knees to leave him behind praying for the fugitives and this casanova was thankful to do for soradici could only have encumbered him father balbi though for the last hour he had been heaping reproaches on his friends rashness was less of a coward than the spy and as the time had come to start he followed casanova they crept out on the roof and began cautiously to ascend it halfway up the monk begged his companion to stop saying that he had lost one of the packages tied round his neck was it the package of cord asked casanova no replied the monk but a black coat and a very precious manuscript then said casanova resisting a sudden temptation to throw balbi after his packet you must be patient and come along the monk sighed and followed soon they had reached the highest point of the roof and here balbi contrived to lose his hat which rolled down the roof failed to lodge in the gutter and fell into the canal below the poor fellow grew desperate and said it was a bad omen casanova soothed him and left him seated where he was while he himself went to investigate his faithful tool in his hand now fresh difficulties began for a long time casanova could find no way of reentering the palace except into the cell they had quitted he was growing hopeless when he saw a skylight that he was sure was too far away from their starting point to belong to any of the cells he made his way to it it was barred with a fine iron grating that needed a file and casanova only had one tool sitting on the roof of the skylight he nearly abandoned himself to despair till the bell striking midnight suddenly roused him it was the first of november all saints day the day on which he had long had a curious foreboding that he should recover his liberty fired with hope he set his tool to work at the grating and in a quarter of an hour he had wrenched it away entire he set it down by the skylight and went back for the monk they regained the skylight together casanova let down his companion through the skylight by the cord and found that the floor was so far away that he himself dared not risk the leap and though the cord was still in his hands he had nowhere to fasten it the monk inside could give him no help and not knowing what to do he set out on another voyage of discovery it was successful for in a part of the roof which he had not yet visited he found a ladder left by some workmen and long enough for his purpose indeed it seemed likely to be too long for when he tried to introduce it into the skylight it only entered as far as the sixth round and then was stopped by the roof however with a superhuman effort casanova hanging to the roof below the skylight managed to lift the other end of the ladder nearly in the action flinging himself down into the canal but he had succeeded in forcing the ladder farther in and the rest was comparatively easy he climbed up again to the skylight lowered the ladder and in another moment was standing by his companions side they found themselves in a garret opening into another room well barred and bolted but just then casanova was past all exertion he flung himself on the ground the packet of cord under his head and fell into a sleep of utter exhaustion it was dawn when he was roused at last by the monks despairing efforts for two hours the latter had been shaking him and even shouting in his ears without the slightest effect casanova rose saying this place must have a way out let us break everything there is no time to lose they found at last a door of which casanovas tool forced the lock and which led them into the room containing the archives or records of the venetian republic from this they descended a staircase then another and so made their way into the chancellors office here casanova found a tool which secretaries used to pierce parchment and which was some little help to them for he found it impossible to force the lock of the door through which they had next to part and the only way was to break a hole in it casanova set to work at the part of the door that looked most likely to yield while his companion did what he could with the secretarys instrument they pushed rent tore the wood the noise that they made was alarming but they were compelled to risk it in half an hour they had made a hole large enough to get through the monk went first being the thinner he pulled casanova after him dusty torn and bleeding for he had worked harder than father balbi who still looked respectable they were now in a part of the palace guarded by doors against which no possible effort of theirs could have availed the only way was to wait till they were opened and then take flight casanova tranquilly changed his tattered garments for a suit which he had brought with him arranged his hair and made himself look except for the bandages he had tied round his wounds much more like a strayed reveller than an escaped prisoner all this time the monk was upbraiding him bitterly and at last tired of listening casanova opened a window and put out his head adorned with a gay plumed hat the window looked out upon the palace court and casanova was seen at once by people walking there he drew back his head thinking that he had brought destruction upon himself but after all the accident proved fortunate those who had seen him went immediately to tell the authority who kept the key of the hall at the top of the grand staircase at whose window casanovas head had appeared that he must unwittingly have shut someone in the night before such a thing might easily have happened and the keeper of the keys came immediately to see if the news were true presently the door opened and quite at his ease the keeper appeared key in hand he looked startled at casanovas strange figure but the latter without stopping or uttering a word passed him and descended the stairs followed by the frightened monk they did not run nor did they loiter casanova was already in spirit beyond the confines of the venetian republic still followed by the monk he reached the waterside stepped into a gondola and flinging himself down carelessly promised the rowers more than their fare if they would reach fusina quickly soon they had left venice behind them and a few days after his wonderful escape casanova was in perfect safety beyond italy adventures on the findhorn the following adventures in crossing the findhorn are extracted from lays of the deer forest by john sobieski and charles edward stuart london i had lost my boat in the last speat it was the third which had been taken away in that year and until i obtained another i was obliged to ford the river i went one day as usual there was a dark bank of cloud lying in the west upon beanndrineachain but all the sky above was blue and clear and the water moderate as i crossed into the forest i merely wanted a buck and therefore only made a short circuit to the edge of dunfhearn and rolled a stone down the steep into the deep wooded den as it plunged into the burn below i heard the bound of feet coming up but they were only two small does and i did not speak to them but amused myself with watching their uneasiness and surprise as they perked into the bosky gorge down which the stone had crashed like a ninepounder and as their white targets jinked over the brae i went on to try the western terraces illustration there is a smooth dry brae opposite to logie cumming called braigh choilichchoille great part of the slope of which is covered with a growth of brackens from five to six feet high mixed with large masses of foxgloves of such luxuriance that the stems sometimes rise five from a single root and more than seven feet in height of which there is often an extent of five feet of blossoms loaded with a succession of magnificent bells as we crossed below this beautiful covert i observed dreadnought suddenly turn up the wind towards it i immediately made for the crest beyond where the bank rises smooth and open and whence i had a free sweep of the summit and of both sides i had just reached the top when the dog entered the thicket of the ferns and i saw their tall heads stir about twenty yards before him followed by a roar from his deep tongue and a fine buck bolted up the brae i gave a short whistle to stop him and immediately he stood to listen but behind a great spruce fir which then with many others formed a noble group upon the summit of the terrace the sound of the dog dislodged him in an instant and he shot out through the open glade when i followed him with the rifle and sent him over on his horns like a wheel down the steep and splash like a round shot into the little rill at its foot we brittled him on the knog of an old pine and rewarded the dog and drank the dochfalla when having occasion to send the piper to the other side of the wood and being so near home i shouldered the roe and took the way for the ford of craigdarach a strong wide broken stream with a very bad bottom but the nearest then passable as i descended the bruachgharbh dreadnought stopped and looked up into a pine then approaching the tree searched it all round with his nose i scanned the branches but could see nothing except an old hawks nest which had been disused long ago and if it had not i do not understand how it should be interesting to a hound the dog however continued to investigate the stump and stem of the fir gaze into the branches turning his head from side to side and setting up his ears like a cockedhat i laid down the buck and unslung my double gun and threw a stick at the nest when out shot a large pinemartin and like a squirrel sprung along the branches from tree to tree till i brought him to the ground dreadnought examined him with a sort of wrinkle in his whiskers and turned away and sat down in dignified abstraction while i remounted the buck and braced the martin to his feet with the little ialchas or footstraps used for trussing the legs of the roe we then resumed our path for the ford as i descended through the boatshaw i heard a heavy sound from the water but when i came out from the birches upon the green bank on its brink i saw that the river had come down and was just lipping with the top of the stone the sight of whose head was the mark for the last possibility of crossing as i looked upon its contracting ring i perceived that the stream was still growing there was no time to be lost for the alternative now was to go round by the bridge of daltulich a circuit of four miles and i knew that before i reached the next good ford the water would be a continuous rapid probably six feet deep i decided therefore upon trying the chance where i was dreadnought who had gone about thirty yards up the stream to take the deep water in the pool of craigdarach had observed my hesitation with one leg out and one in the water and was standing on the point of the rock waiting the result as soon as i made another step he plunged into the river and in a few moments was rolling on the bank of silver sand thrown up by the backwater upon the opposite side of the river as i advanced through the stream he looked at me occasionally and i at him and the beautiful smooth sand and green bank upon his side for by that time i began to wish i was there too i was then in pretty deep water for a ford but still some distance from the deepest part my kilt was floating round me in the boiling water and the strong eddy formed by the stream running against my legs gulped and gushed with increasing weight i moved slowly and carefully for the whole ford was filled with large round slippery stones from the size of a sixtypound shot to a twohundredweight shell i stopped to rest and looked back to the ford mark it was wholly gone and i saw only the broad smooth wave of water which slipped over its head ten paces more and i should be through the deepest part i stepped steadily and rigidly but i wanted the use of my balancing limbs and the freedom of my breath for the barrels of the double gun and rifle which were slung at my back were passed under my arms to keep them out of the water and i was also obliged to hold the legs of the buck which loaded with the woodcat were crossed upon my breast at every step the round and slidering stones endangered my footing rendered still more unsteady by the upward pressure of the water in this struggle the current gave a great gulp and a wave splashed up over my guns i staggered downwards with the stream and could not recover a sure footing for several yards at last i secured my hold against a large fixed stone and paused to rest after a little i made another effort to proceed the water was now running above my belt and at the first step which i made from the stone i found that it deepened abruptly before me i felt that in six inches more that strong stream would lift me off my legs and with great difficulty i gained about two yards up the current to ascertain if the depth was continuous but the bottom still shelved before me and as i persisted in attempting it i was turned round by the stream the waves were leaping through the deep channel before me and having no arms to balance my steps i began to think of the bonnie banks on either side the river in this jeopardy poor dreadnought had not been unconcerned at the first moment of my struggle he had gone down the great stony beach which lay before me and sitting down by the water watched me with great anxiety and at last began to whine and whimper and tremble with agitation but when he saw me stagger down the stream he rose went in up to his knees howled pawed the water and lapped the waves with impatience meanwhile i was obliged to come to a rest with my left foot planted strongly against a stone for the mere resistance to the pressure of water which rushing with a white foam from my side was sufficient exertion without the weight of the buck and the two guns which amounted to more than seventy pounds after a few moments pause i made a last effort to reach the east bank but it was now impossible and i turned to make an attempt to regain the tarnaway side i was at least thirty yards lower down than when i entered the stream and the water was rushing and foaming all round me another stagger nearly carried me off my feet and in the exertion to keep them a thick transpiration rose upon my forehead my ears began to sing and my head to swim while disordered in their balance the buck and the guns almost strangled me i looked down the channel the water was running in a white broken rapid into the black pool below and swept with a wide foaming backwater under the steep rock which turned its force the soft green bank before me was sleeping beneath the shade of the weeping birches where bluebells and primroses grew thick in the short smooth turf and though they had long shed their blossoms the bright patches of their clusters were yet visible among the tall foxgloves which still retained the purple bells upon their tops the bank looked softer and greener and more inviting than ever it had done before but my eyes grew dim and my limbs faint with that last struggle i felt for my dirk knife for a desperate rolling swim for life seemed now inevitable and steadying myself in the stream i cut loose the straps of the buck and the slings of the guns and retaining them only with my hands held them ready to let go as soon as i should be taken off my legs when they were free i dipped my hand in the water and laved it over my brow and face the singing of my ears ceased and my sight came clear and i discovered that i had lost my bonnet in the struggle and distinguished the white cockade dancing like a little cailleach of foam in the vortex of the pool below being now morally relieved from the weight of the roe and guns though resolved to preserve them to the last i resumed my attempt for the west bank but when i reached a similar distance to that which i had gained for the other i found an equally deep channel before me and that the diminished water by which i had been encouraged was only the shoaling of a long bank which extended with the stream i now saw that before i joined my bonnet which still danced and circled in the pool below there was only one effort left to struggle up the stream and reach the point from which i had taken the water but this was a desperate attempt for at every step i had to find a safe footing at the upper side of some stone and then with all my strength to force myself against the current but often the stones gave way and loosening from their bed went rolling and rumbling down the rapid and i was driven back several feet to recommence the same struggle the river also was still increasing and the flat sand which was dry when i left it was now a sheet of water while i was thus wrestling with the stream i saw dreadnought enter not at his usual place in the pool but at the tail just above the run of the stream in which i was struggling he came whimpering over and crossed about a yard or two above me but instead of making for the bank he turned in the water and swam towards me the stream however was too strong for him and carried him down i called and waved to the forest and he turned and steered for its bank but did not reach the shelving sand till he was well tumbled in the top of the rapid out of which he only emerged in time to catch a little backwater which helped him on to the shore the attempt of the dog to reach me had passed while i rested and when he gained the bank i resumed my effort to make the shallower water illustration dreadnoughts eye was turned towards me as he came dripping up the bank and seeing me move forward he ran before me to the waters edge at the right entrance of the ford whining and howling and baying as if he knew as well as i that it was the place to make for in a few steps the stones became less slippery and the bottom more even and i began to think that i might gain it when at the rocky point above i saw a white mass of foam loaded with brushwood sticks and rubbish borne along by a ridge of yellow curdling water at least two feet higher than the stream i gathered all my strength and made a struggle for the bank opposite to where i was the water was already above my belt and rushing between my arms as i bore up the guns i felt myself lifted off my legs again i held the ground the green bank was only a few yards distant but the deep water was close below and the yellow foaming flood above as i staggered on i heard it coming down crumpling up and crackling the dead boughs which it bore along i stumbled upon a round stone and nearly fell backward but it was against the stream which forced me forward i felt the spray splash over my head i was nearly blind and deaf i made a desperate effort with the last strength which i had left and threw myself gasping on the bank dreadnought sprang forward jumped over and over me whined and kissed my face and hands and tried to turn me over with his snout and scratched and pawed me to make me speak but i could not yet and gasped and choked and felt as if my heart would burst i lay dripping and panting with my arms stretched out on the grass unable to move except with the convulsive efforts of my breath at last i sat up but i could scarcely see a thin gauzy cloud was over my eyes a heavy pressure rung in my ears my feet still hung in the water which was now sweeping a wide white torrent from bank to bank and running with a fierce current through both the pools below the backwater where my bonnet had danced no longer remained all was carried clear out in one long rush down to the cluag benedictum sit nomen domini i thought as i crossed myself i stretched out my hand and plucked the nearest flowers and smelled their sweet greenwood scent with inexpressible delight i never thought that flowers looked so beautiful or had half so much perfume though they were only the pale wild blossoms of the fading year i placed them in my breast and have them still and never look upon them without repeating de profundis clamavi ad te domine illustration the findhorn such were the hazards on the fords of the findhorn but even by boat the struggle was sometimes no less arduous though it enabled us to cross the water at a height otherwise impassable of which the following passage is an example one evening i was returning with the piper and the old hound which had accompanied me at the ford as we descended towards the pool of cluag where i had left the coble quietly moored in the morning dreadnought frequently turned and looked at me with hanging ears and a heavy cheerless eye and when we came to the path which led down to the river he stopped and dropped behind and followed at my heel though usually he trotted on before and instead of waiting for the boat took the water which he preferred to the coble when we came out from the trees upon the steep bank above the river i understood his altered manner from rock to rock the stream was running a white furious rushing torrent and the little boat tugging and jibbing on her chain and swinging and bobbing upon the top of the froth like the leaves which danced upon the eddy dreadnought had heard the sound of the river and knew what there was at work before us the boat was moored near the throat of the pool in the backwater of a little bay now entirely filled with froth and foam up to the gunwale of the coble which was defended by a sharp point of rock from whose breakwater the stream was thrown off in a wild shooting torrent within the bay the reaction of the tide formed a quick backwater which raised the stream without nearly two feet higher than the level within and at times sucked the boat on to the point where she was struck in the stem by the gushing stream and sent spinning round at the full swing of her tether donald looked at me there was no alternative but the bridge of daltullich more than four miles about with two bucks to carry and ourselves well run since four oclock in the morning i stood for some moments considering the chances and the manifest probability of going down the stream immediately after emerging from the little mooring bay there was a terrific rush of water discharged through the narrow throat of the pool and raised to the centre in a white fierce tumbling ridge for which the shortness of the pool afforded no allowance for working while the little backwater which in ordinary cases caught us on the opposite side and took us into the bank was lost in a flood which ran right through the basin like a milllead can you swim donald said i mechanically swim sir said he who knew how often i had seen him tumbled by the waves both in salt water and fresh oh yes i know you can but i was thinking of that stream ougudearbh replied donald but it was myself that never tried it yon way and what do you think of her faith thighearna you know best but if you try it i shall not stay behind we had often ridden the water together by day and night in flood and fair and narrow as the pool was i thought we could get through it we threw in a broken branch to prove the speed of the current but it leaped through the plunging water like a greyhound and was away in a moment down to the fierce white battling vortex of the scuddach where there was no salvation for thing alive a few moments it disappeared in the wild turmoil and then came up beyond white and barked and shivered like a splintered bone donald however saw that i was going to try the venture and he was already up the bank unlocking the chain without a word the bucks were deposited in the stern of the boat the guns laid softly across them covered with a plaid and dreadnought followed slowly and sternly and laid himself down with an air as if like don alphonso of castile the body trembled at the dangers into which the soul was going to carry it i took the oars there were no directions to be given donald knew how to cross the pool and every other where we were used to ferry the boats head was brought round to the stream for it was necessary to run her into it with the impulse of the backwater to shoot her forward or she would have been drawn back stern foremost into the eddy where the jaw of the water over the point of the rock would have swamped us in an instant donald knelt at the bows and held fast by a light painter till i cried ready when the little shallop sprung from the rope tilted away like a seabird and glided towards the roaring torrent i looked over my shoulder donald was gripping the bows his teeth set fast but a gleam of light was in his eye as we plunged headlong into the bursting stream a blow like the stroke of a mighty wooden hammer lifted the boat into the surf there was a crack as if her bows were stove in and she shot shivering through the pool filled with water to our knees and sending the spray over us like a sheet the rocks and trees seemed to fly away the roaring water spouted and boiled as it lifted up the boat which spun round like a leaf with her starboard gunwale lipping with the waves but a few seconds swept us through the pool and we were flying into the mad tumbling thunder of the rapid below i kept the larboard bow to the stream and pulled with all my might but i thought she did not move the eddy of the great midstream seemed to fix her in the ridge of the torrent and take her along with it the oars bent like willows to the strain a boiling gush from below lifted her bows and threw her gunwale under the froth i thought we were gone but i redoubled the last desperate strokes and we shot out of the foaming ridge towards the opposite bank rolling and leaping and plunging into the throat of the rapid donald sat like a tiger ready for the spring and as we neared the shore bounded on the grass with the chain this checked the speed of the boat i unshipped the oars and sprung out just as the coble came crash alongside the bank then swirling round her head flew out to the stream dragging donald along the grass after her i jumped into the water and caught hold of the bow for two minutes the struggle was doubtful and she continued to drag us along at last donald reached the stump of a tree and running round it made a turn of the chain and brought her up we sat down and wiped our faces and looked at each other in silence the incredibly short space of time which had elapsed since we stood on the other side with the mysterious future before us and now to be sitting on this and call it the past was like a dream the tumult the flying shoot the concussion at parting and arriving seemed like an explosion as if we had been blown up and thrown over i dont think that boat will ever go back again thighearna said donald why not did you not feel her twist and hear her split when we came into the burst of the stream replied donald i dont know said i i felt and heard a great many things but there was no time to think what they were oh it was not thinking that i was answered donald but the water came squirting up in my face through her ribs and i held on by both bows expecting at every stroke to see them open and let me through we got up and examined the boats bottom there was a yawning rent from the stem to the centre and part of the torn planks lapped one over the other by the twist the bows being only held together by the iron band which bound the gunwale footnote the woodcocks brae from the frequency with which they breed there the story of grace darling a careful reader of the times on the morning of tuesday september might have found if he cared to look a certain paragraph in an obscure corner headed the wreck of the forfarshire it is printed in the small type of that period the story is four days old for in those days news was not flashed from one end of the country to the other and moreover the story is very incomplete on the evening of wednesday september the steamship forfarshire left hull for dundee carrying a cargo of iron and having some forty passengers on board the ship was only eight years old the master john humble was an experienced seaman and the crew including firemen and engineers was complete but even before the vessel left the dock one passenger at least had felt uneasily that something was wrong that there was an unusual commotion among officials and sailors still no alarm was given and at dusk the vessel steamed prosperously down the humber the next day thursday the th the weather changed the wind blowing nnw and increasing towards midnight to a perfect gale on the morning of friday the th a sloop from montrose making for south shields saw a small boat labouring hard in the trough of the sea the montrose vessel bore down on it and in spite of the state of the weather managed to get the boats crew on board they were nine men in all the sole survivors as they believed themselves to be of the crew and passengers of the forfarshire which was then lying a total wreck on longstone one of the outermost of the farne islands it was a wretched story they had to tell of lives thrown away through carelessness and negligence unredeemed as far as their story went by any heroism or unselfish courage while still in the humber and not twenty miles from hull it was found that one of the boilers leaked but the captain refused to put about the pumps were set to work to fill the boiler and the vessel kept on her way though slowly not passing between the farne islands and the mainland till thursday evening it was eight oclock when they entered berwick bay the wind freshened and was soon blowing hard from the nnw the motion of the vessel increased the leakage and it was now found that there were holes in all the three boilers two men were set to work the pumps one or two of the passengers also assisting but as fast as the water was pumped into the boilers it poured out again the bilge was so full of steam and boiling water that the firemen could not get to the fires still the steamer struggled on labouring heavily for the sea was running very high at midnight they were off st abbs head when the engineers reported that the case was hopeless the engines had entirely ceased to work the ship rolled helplessly in the waves and the rocky coast was at no great distance they ran up the sails fore and aft to try and keep her off the rocks and put her round so that she might run before the wind and as the tide was setting southward she drifted fast with wind and tide torrents of rain were falling and in spite of the wind there was a thick fog some of the passengers were below others were on deck with crew and captain knowing well their danger about three the noise of breakers was distinctly heard a little way ahead and at the same time a light was seen away to the left glimmering faintly through the darkness it came home to the anxious crew with sickening certainty that they were being driven on the farne islands now these islands form a group of desolate whinstone rocks lying off the northumbrian coast they are twenty in number some only uncovered at low tide and all offering a rugged iron wall to any illfated boat that may be driven upon them even in calm weather and by daylight seamen are glad to give them a wide berth the master of the forfarshire in this desperate strait attempted to make for the channel which runs between the islands and the mainland it was at best a forlorn chance it was hopeless here the vessel refused to answer her helm on she drove in the darkness nearer and nearer came the sound of the breakers the fear and agitation on board the boat grew frantic women wailed and shrieked the captains wife clung to him weeping the crew lost all instinct of discipline and thought of nothing but saving their skins between three and four the shock came a hideous grinding noise a strain and shiver of the whole ship and she struck violently against a great rock in the awful moment which followed five of the crew succeeded in lowering the larboard quarterboat and pushed off in her the mate swung himself over the side and also reached her and a passenger rushing at this moment up from the cabin and seeing the boat already three yards from the ship cleared the space with a bound and landed safely in her though nearly upsetting her by his weight she righted and the crew pulled off with the desperate energy of men rowing for their lives the sight of agonised faces the shrieks of the drowning were lost in the darkness and in the howling winds and the boat with the seven men on board was swept along by the rapidlyflowing tide such was the story the exhausted boats crew told next morning to their rescuers on board the montrose sloop and the rest of the ships company what of them had they all gone down by the island crag with never a hand stretched out to help them hardly had the boat escaped from the stranded vessel when a great wave struck her on the quarter lifted her up bodily and dashed her back on the rock she struck midships on the sharp edge and broke at once into two pieces the after part was washed clean away with about twenty passengers clinging to it the captain and his wife being among them a group of people about nine in number were huddled together near the bow they with the whole fore part of the ship were lifted right on to the rock in the fore cabin was a poor woman mrs dawson with a child on each arm when the vessel was stranded on the rock the waves rushed into the exposed cabin but she managed to keep her position cowering in a corner first one and then the other child died from cold and exhaustion and falling from the fainting mother were swept from her sight by the waves but the poor soul herself survived all the horrors of the night illustration grace darling it was now four oclock the storm was raging with unabated violence and it was still two hours to daybreak about a mile from longstone the island on which the vessel struck lies brownsman the outermost of the farne islands on which stands the lighthouse at this time the keeper of the lighthouse was a man of the name of william darling he was an elderly almost an old man and the only other inmates of the lighthouse were his wife and daughter grace a girl of twentytwo on this friday night she was awake and through the raging of the storm heard shrieks more persistent and despairing than those of the wildest seabirds in great trouble she rose and awakened her father the cries continued but in the darkness they could do nothing even after day broke it was difficult to make out distant objects for a mist was still hanging over the sea at length with a glass they could discern the wreck on longstone and figures moving about on it between the two islands lay a mile of yeasty sea and the tide was running hard between them the only boat on the lighthouse was a clumsily built jollyboat heavy enough to tax the strength of two strong men in ordinary weather and here there was but an old man and a young girl to face a raging sea and a tide running dead against them darling hesitated to undertake anything so dangerous but his daughter would hear of no delay on the other side of that rough mile of sea men were perishing and she could not stay where she was and see them die so off they set in the heavy coble the old man with one oar the girl with the other rowing with straining breath and beating hearts any moment they might be whelmed in the sea or dashed against the rocks even if they got the crew off it would be doubtful if they could row them to the lighthouse the tide was about to turn and would be against them on their homeward journey death seemed to face them on every side when close to the rock there was imminent danger of their being dashed to pieces against it steadying the boat an instant darling managed to jump on to the rock while grace rapidly rowed out a little and kept the boat from going on the rocks by rowing continually it is difficult to imagine how the nine shipwrecked people exhausted and wearied as they were were got into the boat in such a sea especially as the poor woman mrs dawson was in an almost fainting condition but finally got on board they all were fortunately one or two of the rescued crew were able to assist in the heavy task of rowing the boat back to brownsman the storm continued to rage for several days after and the whole party had to remain in the lighthouse moreover a boatload which had come to their rescue from north shields was also stormstayed twenty guests in all so that the housewifely powers of grace and her mother were taxed to the utmost it is told of this admirable girl that she was the tenderest and gentlest of nurses and hostesses as she was certainly one of the most singularly courageous of women she could never be brought to look upon her exploit as in any way remarkable and when byandby honours and distinctions were showered upon her and people came from long distances to see her she kept through it all the dignity of perfect simplicity and modesty close to bamborough on a windy hill lie a little grey church and a quiet churchyard at all seasons high winds from the north sea blow over the graves and fret and eat away the soft grey sandstone of which the plain headstones are made so great is the wear and tear of these winds that comparatively recent monuments look like those which have stood for centuries on one of these stones lies a recumbent figure with what looks not unlike a lance clasped in the hand and laid across the breast involuntarily one thinks of the stone crusaders who lie in their armour clasping their halfdrawn swords awaiting the resurrection morning it is the monument of grace darling who here lies at rest with her oar still clasped in her strong right hand the shannon and the chesapeake among the captains of british gun frigates who ardently longed for a meeting with one of the american guns in our war with the united states was captain philip bowesbere broke of the shannon the desire sprang from no wish to display his own valour only to show the world what wonderful deeds could be done when the ship and crew were in all respects fitted for battle he had put his frigate in fighting order taught his men the art of attack and defence and out of a crew not very well disposed and got together in a rather haphazard manner had made a company as pleasant to command as it was dangerous to meet with this desire in march captain broke sailed from halifax on a cruise in boston bay but to his disappointment two american frigates the weather being foggy left the harbour without his having a chance to encounter them two remained however and one of these the chesapeake commanded by captain james lawrence was nearly ready for sea when her preparations were complete captain broke addressed to her commanding officer a letter of challenge having previously sent a verbal message which had met with no reply as the chesapeake appears now ready for sea began this letter i request you will do me the favour to meet the shannon with her ship to ship to try the fortune of our respective flags he then gave an account of the shannons forces which were somewhat inferior to the chesapeakes the chesapeake had men the shannon men and boys and the american vessel also had the advantage in guns i entreat you sir captain broke concluded not to imagine that i am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the chesapeake or that i depend only upon your personal ambition for your acceding to this invitation we have both nobler motives favour me with a speedy reply we are short of provisions and water and cannot stay long here this letter he entrusted to captain plocum a discharged prisoner but it so happened that before his boat reached the shore the american frigate left it captain lawrence having received permission from commodore bairbridge to sail and attack the shannon in response to captain brokes verbal challenge some manoeuvring between the two ships took place but at last in the evening of june the chesapeake with three ensigns flying steered straight for the shannons starboard quarter besides the ensigns she had flying at the fore a large white flag inscribed with the words sailors rights and free trade with the idea perhaps that this favourite american motto would damp the energy of the shannons men the shannon had a union jack at the fore an old rusty blue ensign at the mizzen peak and two other flags rolled up ready to be spread if either of these should be shot away she stood much in need of paint and her outward appearance hardly inspired much belief in the order and discipline that reigned within at twenty minutes to six captain lawrence came within fifty yards of the shannons starboard quarter and gave three cheers ten minutes after the shannon fired her first gun then a second then the chesapeake returned fire and the remaining guns on the broadside of each ship went off as fast as they could be discharged four minutes before six the chesapeakes helm probably from the death of the men stationed at it being for the moment unattended to the ship lay with her stem and quarter exposed to her opponents broadside which did terrible execution at six oclock the chesapeake and shannon being in close contact the chesapeake endeavouring to make a little ahead was stopped by becoming entangled with the anchor of the shannon captain broke now ran forward and seeing the chesapeakes men deserting the quarterdeck guns he ordered the two ships to be lashed together the great guns to cease firing and lieutenant watt to bring up the quarterdeck men who were to act as boarders this was done instantly and at two minutes past six captain broke leaped aboard the chesapeake followed by twenty men and reached her quarterdeck here not an officer or man was to be seen upon the chesapeakes gangways twentyfive or thirty americans made a slight resistance but were quickly driven towards the forecastle several fled over the bows some it is believed plunged into the sea the rest laid down their arms and submitted lieutenant watt with others followed quickly hardly had he stepped upon the taffrail of the chesapeake when he was shot through the foot by a musket ball but rising in spite of it he ordered one of the shannons pounders to be directed at the chesapeakes mizzen top whence the shot had come the second division of the marines now rushed forward and while one party kept down the americans who were ascending the main hatchway another party answered a destructive fire which still continued from the main and mizzen tops the chesapeakes main top was presently stormed by midshipman william smith this gallant young man deliberately passed along the shannons foreyard which was braced up to the chesapeakes mainyard and thence into her top all further annoyance from the chesapeakes mizzen top was put a stop to by another of the shannons midshipmen who fired at the americans from the yardarm as fast as his men could load the muskets and hand them to him after the americans upon the forecastle had submitted captain broke ordered one of his men to stand sentry over them and sent most of the others aft where the conflict was still going on he was in the act of giving them orders when the sentry called out lustily to him on turning the captain found himself opposed by three of the americans who seeing they were superior to the british then near them had armed themselves afresh captain broke parried the middle fellows pike and wounded him in the face but instantly received from the man on the pikemans right a blow with the buttend of a musket which bared his skull and nearly stunned him determined to finish the british commander the third man cut him down with his broadsword but at that very instant was himself cut down by mindham one of the shannons seamen can it be wondered if all concerned in this breach of faith fell victims to the indignation of the shannons men it was as much as captain broke could do to save from their fury a young midshipman who having slid down a rope from the chesapeakes foretop begged his protection while in the act of tying a handkerchief round his commanders head mindham pointing aft called out there sir there goes up the old ensign over the yankee colours captain broke saw it hoisting with what feelings may be imagined and was instantly led to the chesapeakes quarterdeck where he sat down that act of changing the chesapeakes colours proved fatal to a gallant british officer and four or five fine fellows of the shannons crew we left lieutenant watt just as having raised himself on his feet after his wound he was hailing the shannon to fire at the chesapeakes mizzen top he then called for an english ensign and hauling down the american flag bent owing to the ropes being tangled the english flag below instead of above it observing the american stripes going up first the shannons people reopened their fire and directing their guns with their accustomed precision at the lower part of the chesapeakes mizzen mast killed lieutenant watt and four or five of their comrades before the flags had got halfway to the mizzen peak they were pulled down and hoisted properly and the men of the shannon ceased their fire an unexpected fire of musketry opened by the americans who had fled to the hold killed a fine young marine william young on this lieutenant falkiner ordered three or four muskets that were ready to be fired down the hold and captain broke from the quarterdeck told the lieutenant to summon the americans replied we surrender and all hostilities ceased almost immediately after captain brokes senses failed him from loss of blood and he was conveyed on board his own ship between the discharge of the first gun and the time of captain brokes boarding only eleven minutes had passed and in four minutes more the chesapeake was completely his as a rule however this good fortune did not attend our arms in the conflict with the american marine captain snelgrave and the pirates in the year i being appointed commander of the bird galley arrived at the river sierra leone on the north coast of guinea there were at the time of our unfortunate arrival in that river three pirate ships who had then taken ten english ships in that place the first of these was the rising sun one cochlyn commander who had not with him above twentyfive men the second was a brigantine commanded by one le bouse a frenchman whose crew had formerly served with cochlyns under the pirate moody the third was a large ship commanded by captain davis with a crew of near one hundred and fifty men this davis was a generous man nor had he agreed to join with the others when i was taken by cochlyn which proved a great misfortune to me for i found cochlyn and his crew to be a set of the basest and most cruel villains that ever were i come now to give an account of how i was taken by them it becoming calm about seven oclock and growing dark we anchored in the rivers mouth soon after which i went to supper with the officers that usually ate with me about eight oclock the officer of the watch upon deck sent me word he heard the rowing of a boat whereupon we all immediately went on deck and the night being very dark i ordered lanterns and candles to be got ready supposing the boat might come from the shore with some white gentlemen that lived there as free merchants i ordered also by way of precaution the first mate mr jones to go into the steerage to put things in order and to send me twenty men on the quarterdeck with firearms and cutlasses which i thought he went about for i did not in the least suspect mr jones would have proved such a villain as he did afterwards as it was dark i could not yet see the boat but heard the noise of the rowing very plain whereupon i ordered the second mate to hail the boat to which the people in it answered they belonged to the two friends captain elliot of barbadoes at this one of the officers who stood by me said he knew that captain very well i replied it might be so but i would not trust any boat in such a place and ordered him to hasten the first mate with the people and arms on deck by this time our lanterns and candles were brought up and i ordered the boat to be hailed again to which the people in it answered they were from america and at the same time fired a volley of small shot at us which showed the boldness of these villains for there were in the boat only twelve of them as i understood afterwards who knew nothing of the strength of our ship which was indeed considerable we having sixteen guns and fortyfive men on board but as they told me after we were taken they depended on the same goodfortune as in the other ships they had taken having met with no resistance for the people were generally glad of an opportunity of entering with them which last was but too true when they first began to fire i called aloud to the first mate to fire at the boat out of the steerage portholes which not being done and the people i had ordered upon deck with small arms not appearing i was extremely surprised and the more when an officer came and told me the people would not take arms i went down into the steerage where i saw a great many of them looking at one another little thinking that my first mate had prevented them from taking arms i asked them with some roughness why they had not obeyed my orders saying it would be the greatest reproach in the world to us all to be taken by a boat some of them answered that they would have taken arms but the chest they were kept in could not be found by this time the boat was along the ships side and there being nobody to oppose them the pirates immediately boarded us and coming on the quarterdeck fired their pieces several times down into the steerage giving one sailor a wound of which he died afterwards at last some of our people bethought themselves to call out for quarter which the pirates granting their quartermaster came down into the steerage asking where the captain was i told him i had been so till now on that he asked me how i durst order my people to fire at their boat out of the steerage i answered i thought it my duty to defend my ship if my people would have fought on that he presented a pistol to my breast which i had but just time to parry before it went off so that the bullet passed between my side and arm the rogue finding he had not shot me turned the buttend of the pistol and gave me such a blow on the head as stunned me so that i fell on my knees but immediately recovering myself i jumped out of the steerage upon the quarterdeck where the pirate boatswain was he was a bloodthirsty villain having a few days before killed a poor sailor because he did not do something as soon as he ordered him this cruel monster was asking some of my people where their captain was so at my coming upon deck one of them pointed me out though the night was very dark yet there being four lanterns with candles he had a full sight of me whereupon lifting up his broadsword he swore that no quarter should be given to any captain that defended his ship at the same time aiming a full stroke at my head to avoid it i stooped so low that the quarterdeck rail received the blow and was cut in at least an inch deep which happily saved my head from being cleft asunder and the sword breaking at the same time with the force of his blow on the rail it prevented his cutting me to pieces by good fortune his pistols that hung at his girdle were all discharged otherwise he would doubtless have shot me but he took one of them and endeavoured to beat out my brains which some of my people observing cried for gods sake dont kill our captain for we never were with a better man this turned the rage of him and two other pirates on my people and saved my life but they cruelly used my poor men cutting and beating them unmercifully one of them had his chin almost cut off and another received such a wound on the head that he fell on the deck as dead but afterwards by the care of our surgeon he recovered then the quartermaster coming on deck took me by the hand and told me my life was safe provided none of my people complained of me i answered that i was sure none of them could by this time the pirate ship had drawn near for they had sent their boat before to discover us and on approaching without asking any questions gave us a great broadside believing as it proved afterwards that we had taken their boat and people so the quartermaster told them through the speakingtrumpet that they had taken a brave prize with all manner of good victuals and fresh provisions on board just after this cochlyn the pirate captain ordered them to dress a quantity of these victuals so they took many geese turkeys fowls and ducks making our people cut their heads off and pull the great feathers out of their wings but they would not stay till the other feathers were pulled off all these they put into our great furnace which would boil victuals for five hundred negroes together with several westphalia hams and a large pig this strange medley filled the furnace and the cook was ordered to boil them out of hand as soon as the pirate ship had done firing i asked the quartermasters leave for our surgeon to dress my poor people that had been wounded and i likewise went to have my arm dressed it being very much bruised by the blow given me by the pirate boatswain just after that a person came to me from the quartermaster desiring to know what oclock it was by my watch which judging to be a civil way of demanding it i sent it him immediately desiring the messenger to tell him it was a very good gold watch when it was delivered to the quartermaster he held it up by the chain and presently laid it down on the deck giving it a kick with his foot saying it was a pretty football on which one of the pirates caught it up saying he would put it in the common chest to be sold at the mast by this time i was loudly called upon to go on board the pirate ship and there was taken to the commander who asked me several questions about my ship saying she would make a fine pirate manofwar as soon as i had done answering the captains questions a tall man with four pistols in his girdle and a broadsword in his hand came to me on the quarterdeck telling me his name was james griffin and we had been schoolfellows though i remembered him very well yet having formerly heard it had proved fatal to some who had been taken by pirates to own any knowledge of them i told him i could not remember any such person by name on that he mentioned some boyish pranks that had formerly passed between us but i still denying any knowledge of him he told me that he supposed i took him to be one of the pirates crew because i saw him dressed in that manner but that he was a forced man and since he had been taken though they spared his life they had obliged him to act as master of the pirate ship and the reason of his being so armed was to prevent their illusing him for there were hardly any among the crew but what were cruel villains but he would himself take care of me that night when i should be in the greatest danger because many of their people would soon get drunk with the good liquors found in my ship i then readily owned my former acquaintance with him and he turned to captain cochlyn and desired that a bowl of punch might be made so we went into the cabin where there was not chair nor anything else to sit upon for they always kept a clear ship ready for an engagement so a carpet was spread on the deck on which we sat down crosslegged and captain cochlyn drank my health desiring that i would not be cast down at my misfortune for my ships company in general spoke well of me and they had goods enough left in the ships they had taken to make a man of me then he drank several other healths among which was that of the pretender by the name of king james the third it being by this time midnight my schoolfellow desired the captain to have a hammock hung up for me to sleep in for it seemed everyone lay rough as they call it that is on the deck the captain himself not being allowed a bed this being granted and soon after done i took leave of the captain and got into my hammock but i could not sleep in my melancholy circumstances moreover the execrable curses i heard among the ships company kept me awake though mr griffin according to his promise walked by me with his broadsword in his hand to protect me from insults some time after it being about two oclock in the morning the pirate boatswain that attempted to kill me when taken came on board very drunk and being told i was in a hammock he came near me with his cutlass my generous schoolfellow asked him what he wanted he answered to kill me for i was a vile dog then griffin bade the boatswain keep his distance or he would cleave his head asunder with his broadsword nevertheless the bloodthirsty villain came on to kill me but mr griffin struck at him with his sword from which he had a narrow escape and then he ran away so i lay unmolested till daylight illustration i come now to relate how mr simon jones my first mate and ten of my men entered with the pirates the morning after we were taken he came to me and told me that his circumstances were bad at home moreover he had a wife whom he could not love and for these reasons he had entered with the pirates and signed their articles i was greatly surprised at this declaration and told him i believed he would repent when too late and indeed i saw the poor man afterwards despised by his brethren in iniquity and have been told he died a few months after they left sierra leone however i must do him the justice to own he never showed any disrespect to me and the ten people he persuaded to enter with him remained very civil to me but i learned afterwards from one of them that before we came to sierra leone jones had said that he hoped we should meet with pirates and that it was by his contrivance that the chest of arms was hid out of the way when we were taken and when i called on the people in the steerage to fire on the pirate boat jones prevented them declaring that this was an opportunity he had long wished for and that if they fired a musket they would all be cut to pieces moreover to induce them to enter with the pirates he had assured them that i had promised to enter myself so it was a wonder i escaped so well having such a base wretch for my first officer as soon as the fumes of the liquor were out of the pirates heads they went on board the prize as they called my ship and all hands went to work to clear it by throwing over bales of woollen goods with many other things of great value so that before night they had destroyed between three and four thousand pounds worth of the cargo money and necessaries being what they wanted the sight of this much grieved me but i was obliged in prudence to be silent that afternoon there came on board to see me captain henry glynn with whom i was acquainted who resided at sierra leone but though an honest generous person was on good terms with the pirates he brought with him the captains of the two other pirate ships and captain davis generously said he was ashamed to hear how i had been used for their reasons for going apirating were to revenge themselves on base merchants and cruel commanders but none of my people gave me the least ill character and indeed it was plain that they loved me this was by no means relished by cochlyn however he put a good face on it that night the boatswain came down into the steerage where he had seen me sitting with the ships carpenter but since we happened to have changed places and it had grown so dark he could not distinguish our faces he thinking i sat where he had seen me before presented a pistol and drew the trigger swearing he would blow my brains out by good fortune the pistol did not go off but only flashed in the pan by the light of which the carpenter observing that he should have been shot instead of me it so provoked him that he ran in the dark to the boatswain and having wrenched the pistol out of his hand he beat him to such a degree that he almost killed him the noise of the fray being heard on board the pirate ship that lay close to us a boat was sent from her and they being told the truth of the matter the officer in her carried away this wicked villain who had three times tried to murder me i had one bundle of my own things left to me in which was a black suit of clothes but a pirate who was tolerably sober came in and said he would see what was in it he then took out my black suit a good hat and wig and some other things whereon i told him i hoped he would not deprive me of them for they would be of no service to him in so hot a country but would be of great use to me as i hoped soon to return to england i had hardly done speaking when he lifted up his broadsword and gave me a blow on the shoulder with the flat side of it whispering in my ear at the same time i give you this caution never to dispute the will of a pirate for supposing i had cleft your skull asunder for your impudence what would you have got by it but destruction i gave him thanks for his warning and soon after he put on the clothes which in less than half an hour after i saw him take off and throw overboard for some of the pirates seeing him dressed in that manner had thrown several buckets of claret upon him this persons true name was francis kennedy the next day understanding that the three pirate captains were on shore at my friend captain glynns i asked leave to go to them which was granted and next day i went on board in company with them captain davis desired cochlyn to order all his people on the quarterdeck and made a speech to them on my behalf which they falling in with it was resolved to give me the ship they designed to leave to go into mine with the remains of my cargo and further the goods remaining in the other prizes worth with my own several thousand pounds then one of the leading pirates proposed that i should go along with them down the coast of guinea where i might exchange the goods for gold and that no doubt as they went they should take some french and portuguese vessels and then they might give me as many of their best slaves as would fill the ship that then he would advise me to go to the island of st thomas and sell them there and after rewarding my people in a handsome manner i might return with a large sum of money to london and bid the merchants defiance this proposal was approved of but it struck me with a sudden damp so i began to say it would not be proper for me to accept of such a quantity of other peoples goods as they had so generously voted for me on which i was interrupted by several who began to be very angry illustration some of the pirates had thrown several buckets of claret upon him on this captain davis said i know this man and can easily guess his thoughts for he thinks if he should act in the manner you have proposed he will ever after lose his reputation now i am for allowing everybody to go to the devil their own way so desire you will give him the remains of his own cargo and let him do with it what he thinks fitting this was readily granted and now the tide being turned they were as kind to me as they had at first been severe and we employed ourselves in saving what goods we could and through the influence of captain davis one of the ships the pirates had taken called the bristol snow was spared from burning for they burned such prizes as they had no use for and i was set entirely at liberty and went to the house of captain glynn who when the pirates left the river of sierra leone together with other english captains who had been hiding from the pirates in the woods their ships having been taken helped me to fit up the bristol snow that we might return to england in it and we left the river sierra leone the th day of may and came safe to bristol where i found a letter from the owner of the ship i had gone out with who had heard of my misfortune and most generously comforted me giving money for my poor sailors and promising me command of another ship a promise which he soon after performed i shall now inform the reader what became of my kind schoolfellow griffin and my generous friend davis the first got out of the hands of the pirates by taking away a boat from the stern of the ship he was in when on the coast of guinea and was driven on shore there but afterwards he went passenger to barbadoes in an english ship where he was taken with a violent fever and so died as for davis he sailed to the island princess belonging to the portuguese which is in the bay of guinea here the people soon discovered they were pirates by their lavishness but the governor winked at it because of the great gain he made by them but afterwards someone putting it into his mind that if the king of portugal heard of this it would be his ruin he plotted to destroy davis and when before sailing captain davis came on shore with the surgeon and some others to bid farewell to the governor they found no governor but many people with weapons were gathered together in the street who at a word from the governors steward fired at davis and his men the surgeon and two others were killed on the spot but davis though struck by four shots went on running towards the boat but being closely pursued a fifth shot made him fall and the portuguese being amazed at his great strength and courage cut his throat that they might be sure of him thus fell captain davis who allowing for the course of life he had been unhappily engaged in was a most generous humane person illustration the spartan three hundred this is the story of the greatest deed of arms that was ever done the men who fought in it were not urged by ambition or greed nor were they soldiers who knew not why they went to battle they warred for the freedom of their country they were few against many they might have retreated with honour after inflicting great loss on the enemy but they preferred with more honour to die it was four hundred and eighty years before the birth of christ the great king as the greeks called xerxes the persian monarch was leading the innumerable armies of asia against the small and divided country of greece it was then split into a number of little states not on good terms with each other and while some were for war and freedom and ruin if ruin must come with honour others were for peace and slavery the greeks who determined to resist persia at any cost met together at the isthmus of corinth and laid their plans of defence the asiatic army coming by land would be obliged to march through a narrow pass called thermopyl with the sea on one side of the road and a steep and inaccessible precipice on the other here then the greeks made up their minds to stand they did not know till they had marched to thermopyl that behind the pass there was a mountain path by which soldiers might climb round and over the mountain and fall upon their rear as the sea on the right hand of the pass of thermopyl lies in a narrow strait bounded by the island of euboea the greeks thought that their ships would guard their rear and prevent the persians from landing men to attack it their army encamped in the pass having wide enough ground to manoeuvre in between the narrow northern gateway so to speak by which the invaders would try to enter and a gateway to the south their position was also protected by an old military wall which they repaired the greek general was leonidas the spartan king he chose three hundred men all of whom had sons at home to maintain their families and to avenge them if they fell now the manner of the spartans was this to die rather than yield however sorely defeated or overwhelmed by numbers they never left the ground alive and unvictorious and as this was well known their enemies were seldom eager to attack such resolute fighters besides the spartans leonidas led some three or four thousand men from other cities and he was joined at thermopyl by the locrians and a thousand phocians perhaps he may have had six or eight thousand soldiers under him while the persians may have outnumbered them by the odds of a hundred to one why you may ask did the greeks not send a stronger force the reason was very characteristic they were holding their sports at the time racing running boxing jumping and they were also about to be engaged in another festival they would not omit or put off their games however many thousand barbarians might be knocking at their gates there is something boyish and something fine in this conduct but we must remember too that the games were a sacred festival and that the gods might be displeased if they were omitted leonidas then thought that at least he could hold the pass till the games were over and his countrymen could join him but when he found on arriving at thermopyl that he would have to hold two positions the pass itself and the mountain path of whose existence he had not been aware then some of his army wished to return home but leonidas refused to let them retreat and bade the phocians guard the path across the hills while he sent home for reinforcements he could not desert the people whom he had come to protect meanwhile the greek fleet was also alarmed but was rescued by a storm which wrecked many of the persian vessels xerxes was now within sight of thermopyl he sent a horseman forward to spy out the greek camp and this man saw the spartans amusing themselves with running and wrestling and combing their long hair outside the wall they took no notice of him and he returning told xerxes how few they were and how unconcerned xerxes then sent for demaratus an exiled king of sparta in his camp and asked what these things meant o king said demaratus this is what i told you of yore when you laughed at my words these men have come to fight you for the pass and for that battle they are making ready for it is our country fashion to comb and tend our hair when we are about to put our heads in peril xerxes would not believe demaratus he waited four days and then in a rage bade his best warriors the medes and cissians bring the greeks into his presence the medes who were brave men and had their defeat at marathon ten years before to avenge fell on but their spears were short their shields were thin and they could not break a way into the stubborn forest of bronze and steel in wave upon wave all day long they dashed against the greeks and left their best lying at the mouth of the pass thereby was it made clear to all men and not least to the king that men are many but heroes are few next day xerxes called on his bodyguard the ten thousand immortals and they came to close quarters but got no more glory than the medes thrice the king leaped from his chair in dismay as thrice the greeks drove the barbarians in rout and on the third day they had no better fortune but there was a man a malian whose name is a scorn to this hour he was called epialtes he betrayed to xerxes the secret of the mountain path probably for money he later fled to thessaly with a price on his head but returned to anticyra and there he was slain by athenades then xerxes was glad beyond measure when he heard of the path and sent his men along the path by night they found the phocians guarding it but the phocians disgracefully fled to the higher part of the mountain the persians disdaining to pursue them marched to the pass behind the spartan camp and the greeks were now surrounded in van and rear but news of this had come to leonidas and his army was not of one mind as to what they should do some were for retreating and abandoning a position which it was now impossible to hold leonidas bade them depart but for him and his countrymen it was not honourable to turn their backs on any foe he sent away the soothsayer or prophet megistias but he returned and bade his son go home the thespians to their immortal honour chose to bide the brunt with leonidas there thus remained what was left of the three hundred their personal attendants seven hundred thespians and some thebans about whose conduct it is difficult to speak with certainty as accounts differ leonidas on this last day of his life did not wait to be attacked in front and rear but sallying into the open himself assailed the persians they drove the barbarians like cattle with their spears the captains of the barbarians drove them back on the spears with whips many fell from the path into the sea and there perished and many more were trodden down and died beneath the feet of their own companions but the spears of the greeks broke at last in their hands so they drew their swords and rushed to yet closer quarters in this charge fell leonidas the bravest man says the greek historian of men whose names i know and he knew the names of all the three hundred over the body of leonidas fell the two brothers of xerxes for they fought for the corpse and four times the greeks drove back the persians now came up the persians with the traitor epialtes attacking the greeks in the rear now was their last hour come so they bore the body of the king within the wall there they occupied a little mound in a sea of enemies and there each man fought till he died stabbing with his dagger when his sword was broken and biting and striking with the fist when the daggerpoint was blunted among them all none made a better end than eurytus he was suffering from a disease of the eyes but he bade them arm him and lead him into the thick of the battle of another dieneces it is told that hearing the arrows of the persians would darken the sun he answered good news we shall fight in the shade one man only aristodemus who also was suffering from a disease of the eyes did not join his countrymen but returned to sparta there he was scouted for a coward but in the following year he fell at plata excelling all the spartans in deeds of valour this is the story of the three hundred the marble lion erected where leonidas fell has perished and perished has the column engraved with their names but their glory is immortal footnote herodotus illustration prince charlies wanderings chapter i the flight april it was an april afternoon grey and cold with gleams of watery sunshine for in the wilds of badenoch the spring comes but slowly and through april on to may the mountains are as black and the moors as sombre and lifeless as in the dead of winter in a remote corner of this wild track stood in a grey stone house with marshlands in front severe and meagre as the houses were at that time in the highlands upstairs in a room by herself a little girl of ten was looking out of the window she had been sent up there to be out of the way for this was a very busy day in the household of gortuleg the master mr fraser was entertaining the chief of his clan old lord lovat who in these anxious days when the prince was at inverness and the duke of cumberland at aberdeen had thought fit to retire into the wilds of badenoch to the house of his faithful clansman illustration downstairs the astute old man of eighty was sitting in his armchair by the fire plotting how he could keep in with both parties and secure his own advantage whichever side might win by some strange infatuation the household at gortuleg were cheerful and elate a battle was imminent nay might have been fought even now and they were counting securely on another success to the princes army so the ladies of the family staunch jacobites every one of them as indeed most ladies were even in distinctly whig households were busy preparing a feast in honour of the expected victory the little girl sat alone upstairs hearing the din and commotion and looking out on the vacant marshland outside suddenly and completely the noise ceased below and the child seized her opportunity and crept downstairs all was still in the big livingroom only in the dim recess of the fireplace the old lord was sitting a silent brooding figure in his deep armchair the rest of the household men and women gentle and simple were all crowded in the doorway breathlessly intent on something outside threading her way through them the child crept outside the circle and looked eagerly to see what this might be across the grey marshes horsemen were riding riding fast though the horses strained and stumbled and the riders had a weary dispirited air it is the fairies was the idea that flashed through her brain and in a moment she was holding her eyelids open with her fingers for she knew that the good people if they do show themselves are only visible between one winking of the eyes and another but this vision did not pass away and surely never were fairy knights in such a sorry plight as was this travelstained dishevelled company that drew rein at the door of gortuleg the leader of the band was a young man in highland dress tall and fair and with that air of which his followers fondly complained afterwards that no disguise could conceal it at the sight of him arriving in this plight at their doors a great cry of consternation broke from the assembled household there was no need to tell the terrible news the prince was a fugitive a battle had been lost and the good cause was for ever undone it was no time for idle grieving immediate relief and refreshment must be provided and the prince sent forward without delay on his perilous flight the ladies tore off their laces and handkerchiefs to bind up wounds and wine was brought out for the fugitives there is no certain account of charless interview with lord lovat we do not know whether the cunning old man turned and upbraided the prince in his misfortune or whether the instincts of a highland gentleman overcame for a moment the selfishness of the old chief anyway this was no time to bandy either upbraidings or compliments forty minutes of desperate fighting on the field of culloden that morning had broken for ever the strength of the jacobite cause hundreds lay dead where they fell hundreds were prisoners in the hands of the most relentless of enemies hundreds were fleeing in disarray to their homes among the mountain fastnesses for the prince the only course seemed to be flight to the west coast there surely some vessel might be found to convey him to france there to await better times and to secure foreign allies a price was on his head his enemies would certainly be soon on his traces he dared not delay longer than to snatch a hasty meal and drink some cups of wine at gortuleg the party broke up and went their several ways the prince was accompanied by the irish officers of his household sir thomas sheridan oneal and osullivan gentlemenadventurers who had accompanied him from france and whose advice in his day of triumph had often been injudicious let it be said for them that they were at least faithful and devoted when his fortunes were desperate as guide went a certain edward burke who fortunately for the party knew every yard of rugged ground between inverness and the western sea during all the time that he shared the princes wanderings this edward burke acted as his valet giving him that passionate devotion which charles seems to have inspired in all who knew him personally at this time reduced now to a handful of weary wounded men the princes party continued their flight through the chilly april night at two oclock next morning they had passed the blackened ruins of fort george as dawn broke they drew rein at the house of invergarry but the gallant chief of the macdonells was away and the hospitable house was deserted and silent the very rooms were without furniture or any accommodation and the larder was bare of provisions but wearied men are not fastidious and without waiting to change their clothes they rolled themselves up in their plaids on the bare boards and slept the sleep of utter weariness it was high noon before they woke up again woke up to find breakfast unexpectedly provided for the faithful burke had risen betimes and drawn two fine salmon from the nets set in the river here for greater security the prince and his valet changed clothes and the journey was continued through lochiels country the next stage was at the head of loch arkaig where they were the guests of a certain cameron of glenpean a stalwart courageous farmer whom the prince was destined to see more of in his wanderings here the country became so wild and rugged that they had to abandon their horses and clamber over the high and rocky mountains on foot in his boyhood in italy the prince had been a keen sportsman and had purposely inured himself to fatigue and privations these habits stood him now in good stead he could rival even the lightfooted highlanders on long marches over rough ground the coarsest and scantiest meals never came amiss to him he could sleep on the hard ground or lie hid in bogs for hours with a stout heart and a cheerful spirit here on the night of saturday the th among the mountains that surround loch morar no better shelter could be found than a shieling used for shearing sheep the next day sunday the th they came down to the coast and found refuge in the hospitable house of borodale belonging to mr angus macdonald a clansman of clanranalds nine months before when the prince had landed from france and had thrown himself without arms or following on the loyalty of his highland friends this angus macdonald had been proud to have him as his guest one of his sons john had joined the princes army and had fought under his own chief young clanranald this young man was at this time supposed to have been killed at culloden though in fact he had escaped unhurt when the prince therefore entered this house of mourning he went up to mrs macdonald and asked her with tears in his eyes if she could endure the sight of one who had caused her such distress yes said the highhearted old highlandwoman i would be glad to have served my prince though all my sons had perished in his service for in so doing they would only have done their duty while resting here at borodale charles sent his final orders to the remnant of his gallant army which under their chiefs had drawn to a head at ruthven they were to disperse he wrote and secure their own safety as best they could they must wait for better times when he hoped to return bringing foreign succours heartbreaking orders these were for the brave men who had lost all in the princes cause and who were now proscribed and homeless fugitives charles and the handful of men who accompanied him had expected that once safely arrived at the coast their troubles would be over and the way to france clear but at borodale they learned that the western seas swarmed with english ships of war and with sloops manned by the local militia a thorough search was being made of every bay and inlet of the mainland and of every island even to the outer hebrides and further to remote st kilda this disconcerting news was brought by young clanranald and mr neas macdonald of kinloch moidart the parisian banker who had accompanied charles from france the latter had just returned from an expedition to south uist where he had more than once narrowly escaped being taken by some vigilant english cruiser it was impossible he urged for a ship of any size to escape through such a closelydrawn net the idea of starting directly for france must be abandoned but could the prince escape to the outer islands and there secure a suitable vessel he might be out upon the wide seas before his departure was discovered it was therefore decided that the little party should cross the minch in an open boat and make for the long island for this expedition the very man was forthcoming in the person of the highland pilot who had accompanied mr macdonald to south uist this was old donald macleod of guatergill in skye a trader of substance and a man of shrewdness and experience in spite of being a macleod he was a staunch jacobite and had joined the princes army at inverness he had a son a mere lad at school in that place this boy hearing that a battle was likely to take place flung aside his book borrowed a dirk and a pistol and actually fought in the battle of culloden more lucky than most he escaped from the fight tracked the prince to borodale and arrived in time to take his place as one of the eight rowers whom his father had collected for the expedition the boat belonged to the missing john macdonald for the borodale family gave life and property equally unhesitatingly in the princes service on april in the deepening twilight the party started from lochnanuagh hardly had they set out when they were overtaken by a terrible storm the worst storm donald declared that he had ever been out in and he was an experienced sailor the prince demanded vehemently that the boat should be run on shore but donald knowing the rockbound coast answered that to do so would be to run on certain death their one chance was to hold out straight to sea it was pitch dark the rain fell in torrents they had neither lantern compass nor pump on board charles lay at the bottom of the boat with his head between donalds knees no one spoke a word every moment they expected to be overwhelmed in the waves or dashed against a rock and for several hours the vessel rushed on in the darkness but as god would have it to use donalds words by peep of day we discovered ourselves to be on the coast of the long isle we made directly for the nearest land which was rossinish in benbecula here they found only a deserted hut low dark and destitute of window or chimney the floor was clay and when they had lit a fire the peat smoke was blinding and stifling still they could dry their clothes and sleep even though it were on a bed no better than a sail spread on the hard ground here they rested two days and then found a more comfortable refuge in the island of scalpa where the tacksman although a campbell was a friend of donald macleods and received them hospitably chapter ii on the long island the object of the expedition was of course to find some vessel big enough to carry the prince and his friends over to france such ships were to be had in stornoway and donald macleod being a man well known in these parts undertook to secure a vessel and pilot under the pretence of going on a trading expedition to the orkneys the prince and his party were to remain at scalpa till donald should send for them on may came the message that vessel and pilot were in readiness and that they should come to stornoway without a moments delay owing to the wind being ahead it was impossible to go by sea and the prince and his two irish followers were forced to go the thirty miles to stornoway on foot no footpath led through the wastes of heavy boggy moorlands the rain fell with an even downpour and the guide stupidly mistook the way and added eight long highland miles to the distance they were thoroughly drenched exhausted and famished when donald met them at a place a mile or two out of stornoway having cheered their bodies with bread and cheese and brandy and their souls with the hopeful prospect of starting the next day for france he took them to a house in the neighbourhood kildun where the mistress though a macleod was like most of her sex an ardent jacobite leaving the prince and his friends to the enjoyment of food dry clothes a good fire and the prospect of comfortable beds for tired limbs donald went back to stornoway in hopeful spirits to complete his arrangements for taking the prince on board another twentyfour hours and the ship would have weighed anchor and the worst difficulties would be left behind but as soon as he entered stornoway he saw that something was wrong three hundred men of the militia were in arms and the whole place was in an uproar the secret had leaked out one of the boats crew getting tipsy had boasted that the prince was at hand with five hundred men ready to take by force what he could not obtain by goodwill the inhabitants of stornoway were all mackenzies pledged by their chief seaforth to loyal support of the government it is eternally to their honour that all that they demanded was that the prince should instantly remove himself from their neighbourhood not one amongst them seems to have suggested that a sum of l was to be gained by taking the prince prisoner so complete was donalds confidence in their honesty that he did not hesitate to say to a roomful of armed militiamen he has only two companions with him and when i am there i make a third and yet let me tell you gentlemen that if seaforth himself were here he durst not put a hand to the princes breast donald doubtless looked pretty formidable as he said these words at any rate the honest mackenzies had no sinister intentions only they vehemently insisted that the party should depart at once and what was worse absolutely refused to give them a pilot in vain donald offered l fear made them obdurate and so depressed and crestfallen donald returned to kildun and urged the prince to instant flight but not even the fear of immediate capture could induce the three wearied men to set out again in the wet and darkness to plod over rocks and morasses with no certain goal so donald had to control his fears and impatience till next day at eight next morning they started in the boat hospitable mrs macleod insisting on their taking with them beef meal and even the luxuries of brandy butter and sugar the weather being stormy they landed on a little desert island called eiurn which the stornoway fishermen used as a place for drying fish between some fish which they found drying on the rocks and mrs macleods stores they lived in comparative luxury for the next few days ned burke the valet was told off as cook but he soon found that the prince was far more skilful in the art of cookery than himself it was his royal highness who suggested the luxury of butter with the fish and who made a quite original cake by mixing the brains of a cow with some meal giving orders to birsle the bannock weel or it would not do at all donald used to declare that in all his life he never knew anyone better at a shift than the prince when he happened to be at a pinch like many another unfortunate man whether prince or peasant charles found unfailing comfort in tobacco he seems to have smoked nothing more splendid than clay pipes and as in his wanderings these behoved to break he used to take quills and putting one into the other and all into the end of the cutty this served to make it long enough and the tobacco to smoke cool donald records another characteristic little trait of the prince at this time on quitting the island he insisted on leaving money on the rocks to pay for the fish they had consumed in the meantime the situation was growing more and more dangerous rumours had got abroad that the prince was in the long island and the search was being actively pursued two english menofwar were stationed near the island and sloops and gunboats ran up every bay and sound while bodies of militia carried on the search by land these from their intimate knowledge of the country would have been the more formidable enemy of the two if many of their officers had not had a secret sympathy with the jacobite cause and very lukewarm loyalty to the government for several days the princes boat had been so constantly pursued that it was impossible for the crew to land they ran short of food and were reduced to eating oatmeal mixed with salt water a nauseous mixture called in gaelic drammach at last they ran into a lonely bay in benbecula where they were free from pursuit it is characteristic of the princes irrepressible boyishness that he and the boatmen here went lobsterhunting with great enjoyment and success without help at this juncture the little party must either have starved or fallen into the hands of their enemies charles therefore sent a message to the old chief of clanranald the largest proprietor in south uist begging him to come and see him nine months before when the prince had landed on that island on his way from france the old gentleman had refused to see him pleading old age and infirmity his brother macdonald of boisdale had seen the prince and had vehemently urged him to give up so hopeless a design and to return to france and when he found that all persuasion was in vain had roundly refused to promise him any assistance from his brothers clan and though young clanranald had indeed joined the princes standard it was with many misgivings and against his better judgment but now in the hour of charless total abandonment and distress this gallant family laid aside all selfish prudence the old chief in spite of age and illhealth came immediately to the wretched hut where charles had taken refuge bringing with him spanish wines provisions shoes and stockings he found the young man whom he reverenced as his rightful king in a hut as big as and no cleaner than a pigstye haggard and worn with hardship and hunger his shirt as dougal graham the servant was quick to observe was as dingy as a dishclout that last little detail of misery appealed strongly to the womanly heart of lady clanranald who immediately sent six good shirts to the prince for the next three weeks charles enjoyed a respite under the vigilant protection of clanranald and his brother boisdale they found a hidingplace for him in the foresthouse of glencoridale a hut rather bigger and better than most by a system of careful spies and watchers they kept the prince informed of every movement of the enemy it was the month of june june as it is in the north when days are warm and sunny and the evening twilight is prolonged till the early dawn and there is no night at all south uist beyond all other islands of the hebrides abounds in game of all kinds and the prince was always a keen sportsman he delighted his followers by shooting birds on the wing he fished though it was only seafishing from a boat and he shot reddeer on the mountains once when ned burke was preparing some collops from a deer the prince had shot a wild starvedlooking lad approached and seeing the food thrust his hand into the dish without either with your leave or by your leave and began devouring it like a savage ned in a rage very naturally began to beat the boy but the gentle prince interfered and reminded his servant of the christian duty of feeding the hungry adding i cannot see anyone perish for lack of food or raiment if i have it in my power to help them having been fed and clothed the wretched boy went off straight to a body of militia in the neighbourhood and tried to betray the prince to them fortunately his appearance and manners were such that no one believed him and he was laughed at for his pains out of at least a hundred souls gentle and simple who knew of the princes hidingplace this young judas was the only one who dropped the slightest hint of his whereabouts nor was it only among the jacobite clans that charles found devoted and vigilant friends the two most powerful chiefs in the northwest of scotland were at this time macleod of macleod and sir alexander macdonald of mugstatt or mouggestot in skye these two had to the great disappointment of the jacobites declared for the government and had shown considerable zeal in trying to suppress the rising but in the very household of mugstatt charles had a romantic and zealous adherent in the person of lady margaret sir alexander macdonalds wife a daughter of the house of eglintoun she had been brought up in jacobite principles and now in the absence of her husband did all she could to help the prince in his distress through the help of a certain mr hugh macdonald of belshair she kept charles informed of the enemys movements and sent him newspapers towards the end of june the government authorities were pretty certain that the prince was hiding somewhere in the long island and attention began to be concentrated on that spot two more english cruisers were sent there under captains scott and fergusson men who had learnt lessons of cruelty from the greatest master of that art the duke of cumberland and militia bands patrolled the whole island it was quite necessary to remove the prince from glencoridale and the faithful belshair was at once despatched by lady margaret to consult with charles about his further movements this mr macdonald of belshair arranged with macdonald of boisdale one of the shrewdest as well as kindest of the princes friends that they should meet at the foresthouse of glencoridale the meeting in spite of hardships and danger and a worse than uncertain future was a merry one the two highland gentlemen dined with the prince on sooty beef and apparently a plate of butter and the talk was cheerful and free forgetful of the gloomy prospects of the jacobite cause and ignoring the victorious enemies encamped within a few miles of them they talked hopefully of future meetings at st jamess the prince declaring that if he had never so much ado he would be at least one night merry with his highland friends but st jamess was far enough off from coridale and in the meantime it became daily more certain that there was no longer safety for the prince in uist the pleasant life in the foresthouse had to be broken up and for the next ten weary days the little party lived in their boat eluding as well as they could their enemies by sea and by land their difficulties were much increased and their spirits sadly disturbed by the fact that their generous friend boisdale had been taken prisoner it is one of the most singular facts of the princes wanderings that as soon as he lost one helpful friend another immediately rose up to take his place this time an ally was found literally in the enemys camp one of the officers in command of the militia in benbecula was a certain hugh macdonald of armadale in skye a clansman of sir alexanders but like many another macdonald a jacobite at heart it is very uncertain how far he was personally responsible for the plan that was at this time being formed for the princes escape donald macleod and others of the princes party were certain that charles had met and talked with him at rossinish and had presented him with his pistols this gentleman had a stepdaughter a certain flora macdonald a girl of remarkable character courage and discretion she generally lived with her mother at armadale in skye but just now she was paying a visit to her brother in south uist it is difficult to make out how or when or by whom the idea was first started that this lady should convey the prince to skye disguised as her servant but it appears that she had had more than one interview with oneal on the subject on saturday june being closely pursued by the implacable captain scott charles parted with his faithful little band of followers in uist paying the boatmen as generously as his slender purse would allow with two clean shirts under his arm and with only oneal as his companion he started for benbecula arriving at midnight in a small shieling belonging to macdonald of milton by good fortune as oneal puts it we met with miss flora macdonald whom i formerly knew it is a little difficult to believe that young ladies of miss floras discretion were in the habit of frequenting lonely shielings far from their homes at midnight at a time when the whole country was infested with soldiers nor does the beginning of her interview with oneal sound like the language of surprise then i told her i brought a friend to see her and she with some emotion asked me if it was the prince i answered that it was and instantly brought him in among all the stout highland hearts which were ready to risk everything for him charles never found one more brave and pitiful than that of the girl who was introduced to him in this strange and perilous situation the plan was at once proposed to her that she should convey the prince with her to skye disguised in female attire as her maid flora was no mere romantic miss eager for adventure and carried away by her feelings she was quite aware of the danger she would bring on herself and more especially on her friends by this course it was with some reluctance that she at last gave her consent but once her word was pledged she was ready to go to the death if need were and threw all her feminine ingenuity into carrying out the scheme they arranged that she was to go next day to consult with lady clanranald and to procure feminine attire as a disguise for the prince as soon as all was prepared they were to meet at rossinish in benbecula in the meantime oneal undertook to come and go between the prince and miss macdonald to report progress and convey messages the two men seem to have returned to a hidingplace in the neighbourhood of glencoridale and miss flora returned to milton she had to pass one of the narrow sea fords next day on her way to ormaclade the clanranalds house this ford was guarded by a body of militia and having no passport she and her servant neil mackechan were taken prisoners the situation was awkward in the extreme and every hours delay was an added danger to her great relief she learned that the officer in command who was expected that morning was her stepfather mr hugh macdonald on his arrival he was or affected to be extremely surprised to find his stepdaughter a prisoner in the guardroom but with a complaisance very remarkable in an officer of the government he drew her out passports for herself for her servant neil and for a new irish servant betty burke whom she desired to take with her to skye so great was macdonalds interest in this unknown betty that he actually wrote a letter to his wife in skye recommending the girl i have sent your daughter from this country he wrote lest she should be frightened by the troops lying here she has got one betty burke an irish girl who she tells me is a good spinster if her spinning pleases you you may keep her till she spins all your lint in spite of the gravity of the situation one cannot help thinking that flora and her stepfather must have had a good deal of amusement concocting this circumstantial and picturesque falsehood as soon as she was set at liberty flora went to ormaclade where lady clanranald entered heartily into the plan among her stores they chose a light coloured quilted petticoat a flowered gown lilac flowers on a white ground to be particular an apron and a long duffle cloak fortunately highland women are tall and large for the princes height feet inches though moderate for a man looked ungainly enough in petticoats illustration it was friday the th before the way was clear for flora and lady clanranald to meet the prince at the rendezvous at rossinish in benbecula the four intervening days had been full of difficulties for charles and oneal the fords between the two islands were so well guarded that there was no chance of their being able to cross them on foot they had no boat and the hours were passing for them in an agony of suspense at last they risked asking a chance boat which was passing to set them across and accomplished the passage in safety but when they did arrive at the hut at rossinish cold wet and wearied they found that a party of militia were encamped within half a mile and that the soldiers came every morning to that very hut for milk charles was by this time accustomed to the feeling that he was carrying his life in his hands at daybreak he had to leave the hut to make room for his pursuers all day he had to lie in an unsheltered fissure of a rock where the rain the heavy relentless rain of the west highlands poured down on him if it did clear at all then that other plague of the highlands swarms of midges nearly drove him distracted on friday the militiamen moved off and the way being clear lady clanranald miss flora macdonald and a certain mrs macdonald of kirkibost came to visit him and oneal in their hut bringing the female attire with them these loyal ladies found their lawful sovereign roasting a sheeps liver on a spit but neither discomfort danger nor dirt could do away with the courtly charm of his manner or the fine gaiety of his address he placed miss macdonald on his right hand he always gave his preserver the seat of honour and lady clanranald at his left and the strange little dinnerparty proceeded merrily but before it was finished a messenger broke in to tell lady clanranald that the infamous captain fergusson had arrived at ormaclade and was demanding the mistress of the house with angry suspicion the prince had now to part with oneal in spite of the poor fellows entreaties to be allowed to remain with him miss macdonald had only passports for three and the danger was urgent he was a faithful and affectionate friend this oneal if a little boastful and muddleheaded he could shortly afterwards have escaped to france as osullivan did in a french ship if he had not insisted on going to skye to try to fetch off the prince he missed the prince and fell into the hands of captain fergusson chapter iii in skye on saturday june the prince put on his female attire for the first time and very strange he must have felt as he sat in flowered calico on wet slippery rocks trying to keep himself warm beside a fire kindled on the beach it was eight in the evening when they started and the storm broke on them as soon as they were out at sea the whole party was distressed and anxious apparently except charles himself who sang songs and told stories to keep up the spirits of his companions long afterwards flora macdonald loved to tell how chivalrously and considerately he looked after her comfort on that dangerous journey going round the north end of the isle of skye they came ashore close to mugstatt sir alexander macdonalds place that chief was himself away at fort augustus with the duke of cumberland but his wife lady margaret who as we have seen was a staunch friend to the prince was at home still in her position it was most undesirable that charles should present himself at her house miss macdonald and her servant neil went up to the house the garden sloped down to the part of the shore where they had landed leaving betty burke sitting on the boxes in her flowered gown and duffle cloak miss macdonald had good reason to congratulate herself on her prudence when she found lady margarets drawingroom full of guests among these was mrs macdonald of kirkibost but she was already in the secret mr macdonald of kingsburgh was also there but he was a man of such a chivalrous spirit and so kindly in his disposition that the secret would have been safe with him even if he had not been as he was a staunch jacobite at heart far more formidable was a third guest young lieutenant macleod a militia officer who with a small body of men was stationed at mugstatt for the express purpose of examining every boat that might arrive from the long island he certainly neglected this duty as far as miss macdonalds boat was concerned possibly out of complaisance to her hostess lady margaret possibly because the young ladys careless demeanour disarmed all suspicion the situation was a most anxious one for miss macdonald she had to carry on an easy flow of chat with a young officer while all the time she could think of nothing but betty burke sitting on her box on the shore every moment was precious and nothing was being done at last during dinner she managed to confide the whole situation to kingsburgh and while she kept the lieutenant engaged the latter left the room and sent for lady margaret to speak to him on business he was her husbands factor and there was nothing to excite remark in his wanting a private talk with her on learning the news she for a moment lost her head and screamed out that they were undone but with much sense and kindness kingsburgh reassured her saying that if necessary he would take the prince to his own house adding with a touch of his characteristic chivalry that he was now an old man and it made very little difference to him whether he should die with a halter round his neck or await a death which could not be far distant as for the immediate future the first idea that occurred both to lady margaret and kingsburgh was let us send for donald roy this donald was a brother of the macdonald of belshair who had visited the prince at coridale he had been out with the princes army and was now living with a surgeon near mugstatt trying to recover from a serious wound in his foot received at culloden this donald must have been a good fellow popular and liked by all for even in those dangerous times he seems to have lived on an intimate footing with the very militia officers who were sent to search for hidden jacobites no man could have been more suited for kingsburghs purpose than donald not only was he sensible honourable and brave but as an acknowledged jacobite he had less to lose if discovered and as a young and amiable man his person could not fail to be acceptable to the prince on his arrival he found kingsburgh and lady margaret walking up and down the garden o donald cried the lady we are undone for ever after much rapid anxious talk the three agreed that the safest place for the prince would be the island of rasay old rasay had been out and was in hiding his second son was recovering from a wound received at culloden and the eldest though he had kept quiet from motives of prudence was quite as keen a jacobite as the other two their eagerness to serve the prince could be relied on and as the island had been recently devastated by the government soldiers it was not likely to be visited again donald roy undertook to see young macleod of rasay and to make arrangements for meeting the prince at portree next day while kingsburgh promised to carry the prince off with him to his own house and to send him next day under safe guidance to portree in this way whatever happened lady margaret would not be compromised so the garden conclave broke up and the three separated lady margaret returned to her drawingroom where poor woman she sadly disconcerted miss macdonald by nervously going in and out of the room however the lieutenant seems to have been too much taken up with his companion to notice his hostesss demeanour donald roy in spite of his lame foot set off for portree in search of young rasay and old kingsburgh hurried off to look for charles carrying refreshments with him not finding him on the shore below the garden the old man walked on rather anxiously till seeing some sheep running he concluded that someone must have disturbed them and went to the spot a tall ungainly woman in a long cloak started forward to meet him brandishing a big knotted stick as soon as kingsburgh named himself the prince knew that he had found a friend and placed himself in his hands with the frank confidence he always showed in dealing with his highland followers a confidence which they so nobly justified after the prince had had something to eat and drink the pair set out to walk to kingsburgh a considerable distance off unfortunately it was sunday and they met many country people returning from church who were all eager to have a little business chat with sir alexanders factor he got rid of most of them by slyly reminding them of the sacredness of the day for the princes awkward movements and masculine stride made his disguise very apparent they may call you the pretender cried kingsburgh between annoyance and amusement but i never knew anyone so bad at your trade at the first stream they had to cross the prince lifted his skirts with a most masculine disregard of appearances and to mend matters when he came to the next let his petticoats float in the water with a most unfeminine disregard of his clothes halfway on their road miss macdonald rode past them on horseback accompanied by mrs macdonald of kirkibost and the latters maid look look cried that damsel what strides the jade takes i dare say shes an irishwoman or else a man in womans clothes miss macdonald thought it best to quicken her pace and make no reply she was already at kingsburgh when the prince and his host arrived there at about eleven oclock all the household were in bed a message was sent up to mrs macdonald to tell her of the arrival of guests but she very naturally refused to get up and merely sent her compliments to miss macdonald and begged she would help herself to everything she wanted when however her husband came up to her room and gravely requested her to come down and attend to his guest she felt that something was wrong nor did it allay her fears when her little daughter ran up crying that the most odd muckle illshakenup wife she had seen in all her life was walking up and down in the hall mrs macdonald entered the main room with some misgiving and in the uncertain firelight saw a tall ungainly woman striding up and down the figure approached her and according to the manners of the time saluted her the rough touch of the unshaven lip left no doubt on the ladys mind her husbands guest was certainly a man in disguise probably a proscribed jacobite she hurried out of the room and met kingsburgh in the hall it did not occur to this good woman to upbraid her husband for bringing danger on his family her first question was do you think the stranger will know anything about the prince my dear said kingsburgh very gravely taking her hands in his this is the prince himself the prince cried mrs macdonald rather overwhelmed then we shall all be hanged we can die but once said her husband could we ever die in a better cause then returning to the homely necessities of the hour he begged her to bring bread and cheese and eggs bread and cheese and eggs to set before royalty this disgrace to her housewifery affected mrs macdonald almost as feelingly as the danger they were in the idea too of sitting down at supper with her lawful sovereign caused the simple lady the greatest embarrassment however she was prevailed upon to take the seat at the princes left hand while miss macdonald had her usual place at his right after the ladies had retired charles lighted his cutty and he and kingsburgh had a comfortable chat and a bowl of punch over the fire indeed good food good fires and good company were such congenial luxuries after the life he had been leading that charles sat on and on in his chair and the hospitable kingsburgh had at last to insist upon his guest going to bed hour after hour the prince slept on next morning kingsburgh being unwilling to disturb the one good rest he might have for weeks miss macdonald was growing impatient and mrs macdonald anxious and at last kingsburgh consented to rouse him at about one oclock portree was seven miles off and had to be reached before dark it was decided that the prince might resume male attire en route but in case of exciting suspicion among the servants he had still to masquerade as betty burke till he left the house mrs macdonald her daughter and miss flora all came up to assist at his toilet for deil a preen could he put in as his hostess expressed herself he laughed so heartily over his own appearance that they could hardly get his dress fastened before he left the room he permitted flora macdonald to cut off a lock of his hair which she divided with mrs macleod what is a still more touching proof of the devotion of these two good women is that they carefully took off the sheets of the princes bed vowing that these should be neither washed nor used again till they should serve each of them as windingsheets kingsburgh accompanied his guests part of the way assisted charles to change his dress in a little wood and then with tears bade him farewell flora macdonald rode on to portree by another road leaving her servant neil mackechan and a little herdboy to act as guides to the prince in the meantime donald roy had been active in the princes service at portree he had met young rona macleod of rasay and his brother murdoch and as he had expected found them eager to face any danger or difficulty for their prince they had a cousin rather older than themselves malcolm macleod who had been a captain in the princes army he entered into the scheme as heartily as the other two and only suggested prudently that rona should leave the matter to himself and murdoch who were already as black as black can be but rona was not to be baulked of his share of the danger and glory of serving the prince and vowed that he would go even if it should cost him his estate and his head so with two stout faithful boatmen they arrived within a mile of portree drew up their boat among the rocks where it could be hid and remained waiting for the prince while the night fell and the rain came down in sheets it had been arranged at mugstatt that donald roy was to meet the prince late on monday afternoon in the one publichouse that portree could boast this publichouse consisted of one large dirty smoky room and people of all kinds kept going in and out and here donald took up his post flora macdonald was the first to arrive and she donald roy and malcolm macleod sat together over the fire waiting anxiously it was already dark when a small wet herdboy slipped in and going up to donald whispered that a gentleman wanted to see him the poor prince was standing in the darkness outside drenched to the skin as soon as they were at the inn donald insisted on his changing his clothes and malcolm at once gave him his own dry philibeg food they could get and water was brought in an old battered rusty tin from which the prince drank being afraid of arousing suspicion by any fastidiousness he also bought sixpennyworth of the coarsest tobacco and nearly betrayed his quality to the already suspicious landlord by a princely indifference to his change but malcolm prudently secured the bawbees and put them into the princes sporran miss flora now rose very sadly to go as she had to continue her journey that night the prince kissed her and said farewell with much suppressed emotion but with his usual hopefulness added that he trusted that they might yet meet at st jamess these constant partings from so many faithful warmhearted friends were among the hardest trials of charless wandering life he seems to have clung with special affection to donald roy and urged him again and again not to leave him but to go with him to rasay donald could only reply that the state of his wounded foot made it impossible this conversation took place as they plunged through wet and darkness from portree down to the shore where the boat was lying malcolm macleod who made a third in the little party had a spirit as firm and a heart as warm as donalds own and before the end of the week the prince was clinging with the same affection to this new friend the wild and desolate island of rasay offered the prince a comparatively secure hidingplace and the three macleods had both the will and the power to protect him and to provide a reasonable amount of comfort for him but a kind of restlessness seems to have come over the prince at this time it was only by being constantly on the move that he could escape from anxious and painful thoughts possibly he may have felt a little insecure in the midst of the clan macleod though he had met nowhere with more devotion than that of the three cousins he certainly seems to have bestowed far more affection and confidence on malcolm than on the other two on thursday he insisted on starting for skye in spite of the entreaties of the young macleods nor would he turn back when a storm broke and threatened to overwhelm them it was night before they landed at trotternish a night such as had become familiar to the prince dark and chill and pouring with rain they made for a byre on the property of mr nicholson of scorobeck young rasay went on in front to see that no one was there if there had been anyone in it what would you have done he asked the prince rather reproachfully for charless selfwill and foolhardiness must at times have been very trying to those who were risking life and estate for him in the byre they lighted a fire dried their clothes and slept for some hours the next day rona being away the prince asked murdoch if he would accompany him into the country of the mackinnons in the south of skye the old chief of that clan had been in the princes army and charles felt that he would be safe amongst them murdochs wound prevented his undertaking such a journey it was thirty miles over the wildest part of skye but malcolm could go and his cousin assured the prince that he could nowhere find a more faithful and devoted servant so the pair set out in the morning for their wild tramp to prevent discovery the prince affected to be malcolms servant walked behind him and further to disguise himself put his periwig in his pocket and bound a dirty cloth round his head a disguise specially calculated one would think to excite attention the two young men talked frankly and confidentially making great strides in friendship as they went along once a covey of partridges rose and with a true british instinct for sport at all hazards the prince raised his gun and would have fired if malcolm had not caught his arm they were careful to pass through the hostile macleod country at night and at break of day arrived in strath the country of the mackinnons malcolm macleod had a sister married to a mackinnon an honest warmhearted follow who had followed his chief and served as captain in the princes army to his house they directed their steps mackinnon himself was away but his wife received her brother and his friend with the utmost kindness the prince passed for a certain lewis caw a surgeons apprentice who was actually skulking in skye at the time and acted his part of humble retainer so well that poor malcolm was quite embarrassed and the rough servantlass treated him with the contempt highland servants seem to have for their own class if lowland bodies both the tired travellers lay down to sleep and when malcolm awoke late in the afternoon he found the sweettempered prince playing with mrs mackinnons little child ah little man he cried in a moment of forgetfulness you may live to be a captain in my service yet or you an old sergeant in his said the indignant nurse jealous of her charges position next day malcolm went out to meet his brotherinlaw he had absolute confidence in mackinnons faithfulness and loyalty but he feared that his warmhearted feelings might lead him into indiscretions which would betray the prince and in spite of all warnings mackinnon could not restrain his tears when he saw his prince under his roof in such a wretched plight it was important that charles should be at once taken to the mainland and john mackinnon went off at noon to the house of the chief of the mackinnons to borrow a boat this old man was a fine type of a highland gentleman it was his daily probably his only prayer that he might die on the field of battle fighting for his king and country he was simpleminded brave and faithful and though now between sixty and seventy as active and courageous as any young man john had received injunctions not to betray the princes presence in the neighbourhood to the laird but to keep such a piece of news from his chief was quite beyond honest johns powers nothing would restrain the old man from going off at once with his wife to pay their homage to the prince nor would he hear of anyone conducting charles to the mainland but himself illustration prince charlies wanderings the black lines indicating land and the dotted lines sea journeys at eight oclock that night the little party embarked the prince took a most affecting farewell of malcolm macleod with courtly punctilio he sent a note to donald roy to tell of his safe departure then pressed ten guineas almost his last on his friends acceptance smoked a last pipe with him and finally presented him with the invaluable cutty chapter iv on the mainland to understand the princes proceedings for the next few weeks it is necessary to have a clear idea of the country which was the scene of his wanderings from loch hourn which opens opposite sleat in skye on the north down to loch shiel on the south a little group of wild and rugged peninsulas run out into the atlantic called respectively knoydart morar arisaig and moidart between these deep narrow lochs run far inland loch nevis lies between knoydart and morar loch morar a freshwater loch cuts off the peninsula of the same name from arisaig and this again is separated from moidart by lochs nanuagh and aylort and loch shiel separates the whole group from ardnamurchan in the south the wild inaccessible nature of the country the deep valleys and many rocky hollows in the hills offered many hidingplaces but a glance at the map will show that a vigilant enemy by stationing menofwar in all the lochs and drawing a cordon of soldiers from the head of loch hourn to the head of loch shiel could draw the net so tightly that escape would be nearly impossible in these first days of july however the search was still chiefly confined to the long island and skye and charles got a clear start of his enemies on july in the early morning he and his faithful mackinnons landed at a place named mallach on loch nevis and spent the next three days in the open they were in a good deal of perplexity as to their next movements and when charles learned that old clanranald was staying in the neighbourhood at the home of his kinsman scothouse he sent to ask his advice and help expecting confidently to find the old faithful kindness that had helped him in uist but the old gentleman had had enough of danger and suffering in the princes cause his son was a fugitive his brother a prisoner he himself was in hiding the sudden appearance of mackinnon startled him into a state of nervous terror and he declared querulously that he could do no more nor knew anyone else who could give any help mackinnon returned indignant and mortified but the prince received the news philosophically well mr mackinnon we must do the best we can for ourselves it was the first rebuff he had met with but a day or two later he found the same lukewarm spirit in mr macdonald of morar a former friend the poor man had had his house burnt over his head and was living with his family in a wretched hut and probably thought that he had suffered enough for the cause this desertion cut the prince to the quick i hope mackinnon he cried addressing john that you will not desert me too the old chief thought that the words were addressed to him i will never leave your royal highness in the hour of danger he declared with tears and johns reply was no less fervent there was one house in the neighbourhood where the prince could always count on a welcome whether he came at midnight at cockcrow or at noon whether as a prince on his way to win a crown or as a beggar with neither home nor hope the hospitable house of borodale was a mass of blackened ruins but the laird my kind old landlord as the prince fondly called him and his two sons had still strong hands shrewd heads and warm hearts ready for the princes service from morar the prince and the two mackinnons walked through the summer night over the wildest mountain track and arrived at borodale in the early morning old angus was still in bed when they knocked at the door of the bothy where the family was living he came to the door wrapt in his blanket when mackinnon explained who it was that desired his hospitality the old mans welcome came prompt and unhesitating i have brought him here said mackinnon and will commit him to your charge i have done my duty do you do yours i am glad of it said angus and shall not fail to take care of him i shall lodge him so securely that all the forces in great britain shall not find him illustration so john mackinnon having done all he could parted from the prince with the same affectionate sorrow that had marked the farewells of all his faithful highlanders he was caught on his return to skye by the cruel captain scott and five days later was brought back to lochnanuagh a prisoner on board an english manofwar opposite the place where the ship cast anchor was a fissure in the rock and halfway up was what looked like a mere grassy bank in reality it was a small hut roofed with sods so contrived that no one unless he were in the secret would have suspected it of being anything but a grassy slope here the prince had spent the preceding night but as soon as the ship entered the loch he betook himself to the hills he was accompanied by old borodale and his son john the young man who had been supposed to have died at culloden a cousin of borodales macdonald of glenaladale had always been a special friend of the princes he joined him now in the wilds resolved to share all his worst dangers though he had to leave his wife and five weak pretty children unprotected and living in a bothy the only home the english soldiers had left them the first plan these brave men concerted together was to carry the prince into lochiels country where young clanranald had promised to provide him a hidingplace on their way however they heard that a body of soldiers were approaching from loch arkaig which completely blocked their way on that side that same night old borodale learnt that general campbell with several ships was in loch nevis captain scott was still in lochnanuagh and parties from these ships were searching every foot of ground in their neighbourhoods at the same time troops had been landed at the head of loch hourn and others simultaneously at the head of loch shiel between these two points the distance as the crow flies must be some twenty or fiveandtwenty miles but the wild mountainous nature of the country makes the actual distance far greater in spite of all difficulties the government troops in a few days had drawn a complete cordon from one point to the other this cordon consisted of single sentinels planted within sight of each other who permitted no one to pass unchallenged at night large fires were lighted and every quarter of an hour patrolling parties passed from one to the other to see that all the sentinels were on the alert charless case was almost desperate for several days he and his companions lived like hunted animals on the mountaintops they were frequently within sight of some camp of the enemy more than once they had to go precipitately down one side of a hill because the soldiers were coming up the other they changed their quarters at night sometimes marching long miles merely to reach some mountain which having been searched the day before was less likely to be visited again in the daytime the prince could snatch a few hours of troubled sleep in some rocky hollow while the rest of the party kept guard news of the enemys movements was brought them occasionally by secret friends under cover of darkness but even their approach was full of terror for the fugitives worst of all was their suffering from hunger the soldiers devoured and destroyed what meagre stores the country could boast and in spite of the generosity of the poorer clansmen no food could be had for four days the whole party lived on a few handfuls of dry meal and some butter on one occasion soldiers passed below their lair driving cattle the prince who was starving proposed to follow them and lift some of the cattle in the night his companions remonstrated but he led the party himself and secured the beef the guide and indeed the leader of the little band was a farmer donald cameron of glenpean but for this mans daring courage and his intimate knowledge of the country the prince must sooner or later have fallen into the hands of his enemies the circle was daily being drawn more closely round the prey and daily the fear of starvation stared them in the face should they wait to die like driven deer or make one desperate effort to break through the toils that surrounded them and either escape or die like men for brave men there could only be one answer to such a question on the night of july they determined to force their way through the cordon all that day the prince had lain in closest hiding on a hill on the confines of knoydart not a mile from the chain of sentinels he had slept some hours while two of the party had kept watch and the other two had gone and foraged for food bringing back two dry cheeses as the result old borodale had gone back at this time the party consisted of his son john glenaladale and his brother and cameron of glenpean all day parties of soldiers had been searching the neighbourhood and now the sentinel fires were alight all along the line of defence at nightfall the little band started walking silently and rapidly up a mountain called drumnachosi the way was very steep and the night very dark once crossing a little stream the princes foot slipped he stumbled and would have fallen down over a cliff had not cameron caught one arm and glenaladale the other and pulled him up from the top of the hill they could see the sentinel fires close in front of them and were near enough to hear the voices of the soldiers quite distinctly under cover of the friendly darkness they crept up another hill and came out opposite another fire at a point midway between these two posts a mountain torrent had made a deep fissure on the side of a hill on the further side could they break through the line and reach this riverbed the overhanging banks aided by the darkness of night would conceal their figures and following the stream they could cross over into wild broken country where they could hide themselves donald cameron with a fine highland gallantry undertook to make trial of the way first if he could reach the spot and return again to report all safe the rest of the party might make the attempt it had all to be done in a quarter of an hour for that was the interval at which the patrolling parties succeeded each other in dead silence they waited till the sentinels had past then as stealthily and rapidly as a cat cameron slipped down the hillside and disappeared into the darkness the rest stood breathless straining every nerve for the faintest sound no footfall or falling pebble broke the stillness and in a few long heavilyweighted minutes cameron returned and whispered that all was well it was two oclock now and the darkness was growing thinner they waited till the sentries had crossed again and had now their backs to the passage then they all moved forward in perfect silence reaching the torrent they sank on all fours and one after the other crept up the rocky bed without a sound the dreaded cordon was passed and in a short time they reached a place where they were completely hidden and could take a little muchneeded rest once clear of this chain of their enemies they turned northward to the glenelg country their plan was to go through the mackenzies country to poole ewe where they hoped to find a french vessel but the next day they learned from a wayfaring man that the only french ship which had been there had left the coast seeing that that plan was fruitless their next idea was to move eastward into the wilds of inverness and wait there till the way should be clear for the princes joining lochiel in badenoch illustration in glen sheil they parted with cameron of glenpean and here too they had a curious adventure which might have proved seriously inconvenient to them they had spent a whole hot august day hiding behind some rocks on a bare hillside the midges had tormented them and they were oppressed with thirst but had not ventured from their hidingplace even to look for water at sunset a boy appeared bringing quarts of goats milk he was the son of a certain macraw a staunch though secret friend in the neighbourhood glenaladale at this time carried the fortune of the little party some forty gold louis and a few shillings in his sporran he paid the lad for the milk and in his hurry did not notice that he had dropped his purse they had hardly gone an english mile before the loss was discovered and glenaladale insisted at all risks on going back to look for the purse he and his cousin did indeed find it lying at the expected place but though some shillings remained the louis were gone it was midnight before the indignant pair reached macraws house and the family were all asleep they roused the master however and fairly told him what had happened no shadow of doubt seems to have crossed the fathers mind no word of expostulation rose to his lips without a moments delay he returned to the house got hold of a rope hanging there and gripped his son by the arm in great passion saying you damned scoundrel this instant get these poor gentlemens money or by the heavens ill hang you to that very tree you see there the boy shivering with fear went instantly for the money which he had buried underground thirty yards from his fathers house this accident turned out most luckily for the prince he and glenaladales brother while awaiting the other two had hidden behind some rocks shortly after they were hidden they saw an officer and two soldiers coming along the very path they had intended to take but for the delay caused by their companions going back they must have fallen into the hands of their enemies they now turned eastward and after a long nights march found themselves in the wild tract of country called the braes of glenmoriston here charles was to find a new set of friends different indeed from the chivalrous kingsburgh and the highbred lady margaret but men who were as staunch and incorruptible as any of his former friends these were the famous seven men of glenmoriston men who had served in the princes army and who now lived a wild lawless life among the mountains at feud with everything that represented the existing law and order they have been described as a robber band but that title is misleading they were rather a small remnant of irreconcilable rebels who had vowed undying enmity and revenge against cumberland and his soldiers and indeed there was ample excuse for their hatred and violence in the cruelties they saw practised all round them sixty of their clansmen after surrendering themselves had been shipped off to the colonies all their own possessions and those of their neighbours had been seized and friends and kinsfolk had been brutally put to death swooping down like mountain eagles on detached bands of soldiers these seven men wreaked instant vengeance on oppressors and informers and carried off arms and baggage in the face of larger bodies of the enemy to these men ignorant reckless and lawless charles unhesitatingly confided his person a person on whose head a sum of thirty thousand pounds was set four of these men were in a cave coraghoth in the braes of glenmoriston when glenaladale brought charles to see them they had expected to see young clanranald and as soon as they saw the prince one of their number recognised him but had the presence of mind to address him as an old acquaintance by the name of maccullony when the four knew who their guest really was they bound themselves to be faithful to him by the dreadful highland oath praying that their backs might be to god and their faces to the devil and that all the curses the scriptures do pronounce might come upon them and their posterity if they did not stand firm to the prince in the greatest danger for about three weeks charles shared the life of these outlaws sleeping in caves and holes of the earth living on the wild deer of their shooting and the secret gifts of the peasantry they did not understand his english but the prince was beginning to pick up a little gaelic he was able at least to improve their cooking and reprove their swearing two services they liked afterwards to recall here too as elsewhere on his wanderings the prince gained the hearts of all his followers by his gracious gaiety and plucky endurance of hardships in the beginning of august his hopes had again turned to poole ewe but learning for a second time that no french ship could land on the closely guarded coast he and his friends determined to remain in the northern straths of invernessshire till the government troops should withdraw from the great glen the chain of lakes which now forms the caledonian canal and thus leave the way clear into badenoch where lochiel and macpherson of cluny were hiding a curious incident is supposed to have helped the prince at this time there had been among his life guards a handsome youth named roderick mackenzie son of a jeweller in edinburgh who in face and figure was startlingly like the prince this lad was actually skulking among the braes of glenmoriston at the time when the prince was surrounded in knoydart a party of soldiers tracked him to a hut which they surrounded flight was impossible and the poor boy stood at bay as he fell beneath their swordthrusts he cried out villains ye have slain your king whether these words were a curious last flash of vanity or whether he intended to serve the prince by a generous act of imposture can never be known the soldiers at any rate believed that they had secured the prize they carried off mackenzies head with them to fort augustus and the authorities seem for some time to have been under the impression that it was indeed that of the prince possibly it was owing to this that in the middle of august the government rather relaxed their vigilance along the great glen charles was eager to press at once into badenoch but the wary outlaws would only consent to taking him to the lochiel country between loch arkaig loch lochy and loch garry they travelled chiefly by night the season was very wet and the rivers were in flood and they had to cross the river garry highland fashion in a line with each mans arm on his neighbours shoulder for the water was running breasthigh at this time the princes condition was as bad as at any period of his wanderings his clothes were of the coarsest and they were in rags lady clanranalds six good shirts had long since disappeared it was as much as he could do to have a clean shirt once a fortnight the provisions they carried were reduced to one peck of meal in this state did the prince arrive in the familiar country round loch arkaig it was a year almost to the day since he had passed through that very country elate and hopeful at the head of his brave macdonalds and camerons he was now a fugitive illfed illclad with a price on his head the only thing that was unchanged was the faithful devotion of his highlanders cameron of clunes and macdonald of lochgarry or lochgarie though they were themselves skulking received the prince with the utmost kindness and found a hidingplace for him in a hut in a wood at the south side of loch arkaig here the outlaws left him only one of their number patrick grant remained till the prince should be supplied with money to reward their faithful service from this place also john macdonald and glenaladales brother returned to the coast where they were to keep a careful lookout and to send the prince news of any french ship which might appear glenaladale still remained but the princes thoughts were turning more and more towards badenoch where his friend lochiel was in comparatively secure hiding among all the gallant gentlemen who risked life and estate in this rising there is no figure more attractive than that of the gentle lochiel he had for years before the rebellion been the mainstay of the jacobite party no man in the highlands carried so much weight as he partly from his position but more from his talents and the charm of his character wise and gentle are the words that were applied to him and with all the qualities of a highbred gentleman he combined the simpler virtues of the highland clansman faithfulness courage and a jealous sense of personal honour from the very beginning he had seen the folly of the rising but when he had failed to convince charles of its hopelessness he had thrown himself into the movement as if it had been of his own devising never did he afterwards reproach charles by word or look for the illfated result he and his cousin macpherson of cluny were at this time hiding among the recesses of benalder the road to inverness ran by within a few miles and at a little distance lay lord loudouns camp but so great was the devotion of the clansmen so admirable their caution and secrecy that the english commander had not the slightest suspicion that the two most important jacobite fugitives had for three months been in hiding so near to him lochiel had been wounded in the feet at culloden and his lameness as well as his dangerous position prevented his going to look for the prince he had two brothers one a doctor and the other a clergyman both accomplished and bold men who had also been involved in the jacobite rebellion towards the end of august news having come to benalder that the prince was living near auchnacarry under the protection of cameron of clunes the two cameron brothers set off secretly for that country the prince with a son of clunes and the faithful outlaw patrick grant were at this time living in a hut in a wood close to loch arkaig it was early on the morning of august the prince and young clunes were asleep in the hut while patrick grant kept watch he must have got drowsy for waking with a start he saw a party of men approaching he rushed into the hut and roused the prince and his companion charles had long lived in expectation of such moments he kept his presence of mind completely decided that it was too late to fly and prepared to defend himself the fowlingpieces were loaded and got into position and they very nearly received their friends with a volley dr cameron in his narrative describes the princes appearance thus he was barefoot had an old black kilt coat on and philibeg and waistcoat a dirty shirt and a long red beard a gun in his hand and a pistol and dirk at his side still he was very cheerful and in good health another week they all waited in the neighbourhood of auchnacarry the ruined home of the lochiels at last a message reached them from benalder that the passes were free and that they might safely try to join lochiel having parted with his devoted friend glenaladale who returned to the coast the prince with dr cameron and lochgarry arrived on august at mellaneuir at the foot of benalder people in hiding have no means of discriminating their friends from their enemies at a little distance lochiel seeing a considerable party approaching believed that he was discovered and determined to make a good fight for it he as narrowly missed shooting charles as charles had missed shooting dr cameron the week before when however he recognised the figure in the coarse brown coat the shabby kilt and the rough red beard he hobbled to the door and wanted to receive the prince on his knees my dear lochiel remonstrated charles as he embraced him you dont know who may be looking down from these hills in the hut there was a sufficiency of mutton beef sausages bacon butter cheese c and an anker of whisky and the prince was almost overwhelmed by such an excess of luxury now gentlemen he said with a cheerful air now i live like a prince charless wardrobe was as usual most dilapidated and clunys three sisters set at once to work to make him a set of six shirts with their own fair hands doubtless sewing the most passionate loyalty and infinite regret into their seams the hidingplace where the prince was now concealed was a very curious hut contrived by cluny in one of the inmost recesses of the hills it was called the cage and was placed in a little thicket on the rocky slope of a hill the walls were formed by actual growing trees with stakes planted between them the whole woven together by ropes of heather and birch till you were close to the hut it looked merely like a thick clump of trees and bushes the smoke escaped along the rocks and the stone being of a bluish colour it could easily pass unnoticed this hut could only hold six persons at a time so the party generally divided in this way one man cooked the food four played cards and the last man looked on at the others and possibly smoked probably they played cards and talked and jested over the daily needs and hardships and spoke little of the disastrous times that lay behind them or the doubtful hopes that lay before them fearing lest the prince might have to remain in hiding all winter the ingenious cluny began to fit up a subterranean dwelling thickly boarded up where the party would have been in safety and shelter but in the meantime no efforts were lacking to find a means of escape lochiels brother the clergyman a man of great prudence went secretly to edinburgh and there procured a ship and sent it round to a port on the east coast to await the prince succour however had come from another quarter it was known to the prince and his followers that a certain colonel warren was fitting out a couple of ships in france for the purpose of bringing off the prince and daily they expected news of their arrival on september two ships lheureux and la princesse appeared at lochnanuagh old borodale and his two sons immediately fled to the hills leaving a faithful servant to find out and report to them who the strangers might be after nightfall twelve french officers came to the hut where they were hiding and told their errand information was at once sent to glenaladale who undertook to go to auchnacarry and send on the news through cameron of clunes he himself not knowing where the prince was hiding any delay even of a few hours might be fatal as the presence of the french ships must sooner or later become known to the authorities at fort augustus to his dismay glenaladale failed to find clunes and only by an accident met with an old woman who directed him to the place where the latter was hiding a messenger was at once despatched and he happening by a curious chance to meet with cluny and dr cameron on a dark night in badenoch gave them his message and an express was at once sent to the cage on september at one in the morning the party which now included cluny lochiel macpherson of breakachie and some others of the princes more important followers set off for the coast they travelled by night remaining in concealment by day but so lonely was the country so recklessly high were the princes spirits that one whole day he amused himself by flinging up caps into the air and shooting at them illustration again he passed through the wellknown country round loch arkaig past auchnacarry the home of the lochiels which was lying in ruins over the rugged hills where he had been hunted like a wild creature a few weeks before down to the familiar waters of lochnanuagh back to the warmhearted household of borodale a considerable number of jacobite gentlemen who had lain for months in hiding had been drawn to lochnanuagh by the report of the landing of the french ships amongst these were young clanranald glenaladale and macdonald of daleby on the princes ship there sailed with him lochgarry john roy stuart dr cameron and lochiel the gentlemen as well as commons were seen to weep though they boasted of being soon back with an irresistible force says the newspaper of the day for the greater part they never came back never saw again the homes they loved so well most were to spend a life of hope deferred and of desperate longings for home as dependents on a foreign court dr cameron was ten years later taken prisoner in london and executed the last man who suffered as a rebel lochiel died two years after he left scotland a heartbroken exile weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country footnotes i had three sons who now hae nane i bred them toiling sarely and i wad bare them a again and lose them a for charlie in this he resembled his father who on leaving scotland after the failure of sent money to argyll to compensate the country folk whose cottages had been burned in the war an act without precedent or imitation charles about introduced golf into italy according to lord elcho the authority for this is an unpublished anecdote in bishop forbess ms the lyon in mourning the authorities are chamberss jacobite memoirs selected from the ms lyon in mourning chamberss history of the rising of macdonald of glenaladales manuscript published in blackwoods magazine ewalds history of prince charles edward and the contemporary pamphlets anonymously published by dr burton on information derived from bishop forbes who collected it at first hand fastened on the interior of the cover of the lyon in mourning is a shred of the flowered calico worn by the prince in disguise two great matches the university matches between the elevens of oxford and cambridge are the most exciting that are played at lords the elevens have been so equal that neither university is ever more than one or two victories ahead of its opponent the players are at their best for activity and strength and the fielding is usually the finest that can anywhere be seen but of all university matches the most famous are those of and of for these were the most closely contested in cambridge had won for three years running they had on their side mr yardley one among the three best gentlemen bats who ever played the others being dr grace and mr alan steel in when cambridge won by runs mr yardley had only made and mr dale and mr money were the other pillars of cambridge batting they had mr thornton too the hardest of hitters who hit over the pavilion with a bat which did not drive when he played for eton against harrow on the oxford side were mr tylecote e f s a splendid bat mr ottaway one of the most finished bats of his day and mr pauncefote the oxford team was unlucky in its bowling as mr butler had strained his arm in one university match mr butler took all ten wickets in one innings he was fast with a high delivery and wickets were not so good then as they are now mr francis was also an excellent bowler not so fast as mr butler and mr belcher who bowled with great energy but did not excel as a bat was a useful man for cambridge mr cobden bowled fast mr ward was an excellent medium pace bowler mr moneys slows were sometimes fortunate and mr bourne bowled slow round cambridge went in first and only got mr yardley fell for being caught by mr butler off mr francis mr scotts was the largest score and mr thornton contributed while mr francis and mr belcher divided the wickets oxford was only runs better than cambridge so that you might call it anybodys match a good stand was made for the first wicket mr fortescue getting and mr hadow but there was no high scoring mr butler got which is not a bad score for a bowler but mr stewart and mr belcher who followed him got ducks and clearly the tail was not strong in batting the beginning of the cambridge second innings was most flattering to oxford when the fifth wicket fell cambridge had but runs or twelve on illustration tobin and money fryer and scott had made but among them but dale was in and yardley joined him mr dale was playing in perfect style and he needed to do so for mr francis was bowling his best then came an hour and a half or so of sorrow for oxford mr butler was tried and bowled eight overs for runs but his arm was hurt and he had to go off he got mr thorntons wicket but oxford were playing as tom sayers fought with a broken arm seven bowlers were put on but the end of it was that after making the first recorded in these matches mr yardley sent a hard hit to mr francis who caught and bowled him mr dale was splendidly caught at leg by mr ottaway off mr francis with one hand over the ropes he got there was but one other double figure mr thorntons oxford had to make to win and is never easy to get especially in a university match where so much depends on it and men are often nervous as you shall see mr hadow came to grief but mr ottaway and mr fortescue were not nervous bats mr ward bowled beautifully but they got and it was for one wicket and oxford were buoyant at however the second wicket fell and e f s joined mr ottaway he put on and ottaways defence was like a stone wall finally mr ward bowled mr tylecote to get and seven wickets to get them it seemed all over but shouting another wicket fell for to get and six wickets to fall mr hill came in and played like a printed book while mr ottaway was always there he played a ball to short leg and mr fryer held it so low down that mr ottaway appealed i dare say oxford men in the pavilion distinctly saw that ball touch the ground but the umpire did not to get and four wickets to fall but the last two wickets had scored exactly nothing in the first innings but mr francis could bat and he stayed while mr hill made when he was l b w to ward for a single four runs to get and three wickets to fall mr charles marshams face wore a look that his friends know well mr butler came in he scored well in the first innings and he could hit then came a bye four to get and three wickets to fall mr hill hit the next square good for a but mr bourne got at it and only a single was run three to get and three wickets to fall we did not get them mr cobden who had not done much took the ball mr hill made a single to cover point the next ball to mr butler was well up on the off stump mr butler drove at it mr bourne caught it and mr belcher walked in rather pale says mr lyttelton and if so it was unusual mr belcher was of a ruddy countenance he was yorked he took a yorker for a half volley let us pity mr stewart if he could escape that one ball the odds were that mr hill would make the runs next over mr pauncefote had told mr stewart to keep his bat immovable in the blockhole but he did not cobden scattered his bails to the breezes and smash went mr charles marshams umbrella against the pavilion brickwork cambridge had won by two this is called cobdens year and will be so called while cricket is played but in fact mr ward had taken six wickets for and these were all the best bats illustration the ball hit the middle stump mr butlers revenge came next year he took fifteen wickets and made the winning hit oxfords revenge came in in cambridge was terribly beaten they went in on a good wicket mr tabor first man in got when a shower came the first ball after the shower mr tabor hit at a dropping ball of mr langs and was bowled the whole side were then demolished by mr lang and mr ridley for and second innings while oxford got first innings in oxford had mr webbe an admirable bat as he is still mr lang who had been known to score mr ridley a cricketer of the first class mr royle the finest field with mr jardine ever seen mr game who had not quite come into his powers as a hitter and mr grey tylecote a good allround man also mr pulman a sterling cricketer and mr buckland a very useful player all round cambridge had mr george longman who could play anything but mr ridleys slows mr edward lyttelton one of the prettiest and most spirited bats in the world mr a p lucas whom it were superfluous to praise mr sims a hard hitter mr w j patterson a renowned bat and others in bowling oxford had mr ridley whose slows were rather fast and near the ground being as tall as mr spofforth and following his ball far up the pitch mr ridley was alarming to the nervous batsman he fielded his own bowling beautifully mr lang was a slow roundarm bowler with a very high delivery and a valuable twist from either side mr buckland was afterwards better known as a bowler mr royle could also deliver a dangerous ball the fast bowler was mr foord kelcey but he again was lame through an accident to his foot for cambridge mr sharpe and mr sims bowled lang and webbe went to the wicket for oxford and made a masterly stand the ball being cut and driven to the ropes in all directions mr webbe got mr lang while mr ridley contributed mr pulman and mr buckland the whole score was for the first wicket mr longmans was the best score for cambridge and mr edward lyttelton got total mr lang got five wickets for mr ridley mr buckland and mr foord kelcey divided the other four in the second oxford innings mr sharpe got six wickets for and the whole score was but in which mr pulmans was very useful mr royle mr game and mr webbe got and and mr grey tylecote not out contributed an invaluable the tail of the cambridge side made among them in the first innings not an assortment of ducks eggs cambridge went in with to get much like oxford in an over was bowled before seven oclock and resulted in a four to leg sharpe and hamilton who went in last first innings went in first in the second to avoid losing a good bat in the five minutes before drawing stumps one doubts if it was worth mr ridleys while to insist on that one over but such is the letter of the law the two victims in any case played rarely mr sharpe making and mr hamilton mr lucas however was bowled by mr buckland for two for mr longman came in and drove off mr lang and mr ridley mr royle then took the ball a fast changebowler he bowled three maidens and then settled mr sharpe at mr blacker at and mr longman at for with a fine breaking shooter such as you seldom see now twenty years ago a large percentage of balls shot dead mr greenfield and mr edward lyttelton stuck together at an awful yell went up midon had missed mr lyttelton a low hard catch but one which he would have taken nine times in ten at mr campbell caught mr greenfield off mr royle six down and to get then mr sims came in and another yell was heard midon had given mr lyttelton another letoff an easy thing he might have held in his mouth midon wished that the earth would open and swallow him presently mr lyttelton hit mr buckland a beautiful skimming smack to square leg mr webbe was standing deeper but running at full speed along the ropes sideways to the catch he held it low down a repetition of what he did unto mr lyttelton when they played for harrow and eton mr lyttelton had scored but not in his best manner there were now three wickets to fall for oxford seemed to have the advantage sims and patterson had added to win when a heavy shower came down lasted for an hour and a half and left oxford with a wet ball and a slippery ground the rain which favoured oxford in when cambridge collapsed was now on the cambridge side mr sims was determined to knock the runs off by a forcing game and these were the right tactics then ridley went on and his first slow bowled mr patterson clean mr macan came in and got a single to win then mr sims hit mr ridley over his head to the ropes for to win mr lang went on for mr royle a leg bye followed and then a noball to win mr lang then in a moment of despair as unusual measures were needed bowled a full pitch right at mr simss head mr sims naturally concluding that two more hits would finish the match hit at it as hard as he could mr pulman was standing by the ropes in the country and the ball soared towards him would it cross the ropes would pulman reach it he had a long way to run he reached it he held it and back went mr sims there remained mr smith in the same historical position as mr belcher there were six runs to get and mr macan his companion a good bat was not yet settled some one in the pavilion said his legs are trembling oxford wins mr smith unlike mr belcher stopped two of mr ridleys slows but not with enthusiasm to the third he played slowly forward the ball hit the middle stump and oxford won by six runs there was also a very good match in cambridge was far the better team and went in second innings for a small score but mr berkeley lefthand medium bowled so admirably that there were only two wickets to fall for the last run mr woods however was not nervous and hit the first ball he received for to the ropes still i am inclined to think that in these three matches the bowling of mr berkeley was the best for he had very little encouragement whereas with or so to get a bowler has a good chance and is on his mettle the moral is dont poke about in your blockhole but hit and when you bowl in an emergency aim at getting wickets by any means rather than at keeping down runs the story of kaspar hauser on may the town of nuremberg in bavaria presented a singularly deserted appearance as it was whitmonday and most of the inhabitants were spending their holiday in the country a cobbler who lived in umschlitt square was an exception to the general rule but towards four oclock he too thought that he would take a stroll outside the city walls when he came out of his door his curiosity was excited by a strange figure which was leaning as if unable to support itself against a wall near and uttering a moaning sound the figure was that of a young man of about seventeen dressed in a grey riding suit and wearing a pair of dilapidated boots he held a letter in one hand illustration the cobblers curiosity led him to approach the strange figure which moaned some incoherent sounds and held out the letter in its hand this was addressed to the captain of the th squadron of the th regiment of dragoons now stationed at nuremberg and as he lived quite near the cobbler thought the surest way of gratifying his own curiosity was to take the stranger there the poor creature stumbled and shuffled along behind his guide and reached the captains house quite worn out the captain was not at home but his servant pitying the sufferings of the stranger gave him a sack of straw to lie on in the stable and brought him some bread and meat and beer the meat and the beer he would not touch but ate the bread greedily and drank some water he then fell fast asleep towards eight oclock the captain came home and was told of his strange visitor and of the letter he had brought with him this letter was written in a feigned hand and said that the writer a poor labourer with ten children had received the boy in and had kept him shut up in his house for sixteen years not allowing him to see or know anything that he could keep him no longer and so sent him to the captain who could make a soldier of him hang him or put him up the chimney just as he chose he added that the boy knew nothing and could tell nothing but was quick at learning enclosed was a letter giving the date of the boys birth april and purporting to be written by the mother but the writing paper and ink all showed that the two letters were by the same person the captain could make nothing of this mysterious letter but went to the stable where he found the stranger still asleep after many pushes kicks and thumps he awoke when asked his name and where he came from he made some sounds which were at last understood to be want to be a soldier as father was dont know and horse home these sentences he repeated over and over again like a parrot and at last the captain decided to send his new recruit to the police office here he was asked his name where he came from c c but the result of the police inspectors questioning was the same the stranger repeated his three sentences and at last in despair of getting any sensible reply from him he was put into a cell in the west tower of the prison where vagrants were kept this cell he shared with another prisoner a butcher boy who was ordered to watch him carefully as the police naturally suspected him of being an impostor he slept soundly through the night and woke at sunrise he spent the greater part of the day sitting on the floor taking no notice of anything but at last the gaoler gave him a sheet of paper and a pencil to play with these he seized with pleasure and carried them off to a seat nor did he stop writing until he had covered the paper with letters and syllables arranged just as they would be in a copybook among the letters were three complete words kaspar hauser and reiter horse soldier kaspar hauser was evidently his name though he did not recognise it when called by it illustration the news of the strange arrival spread through the city the guardhouse where he spent part of the day was thronged by a curious crowd anxious to see this strange creature who looked at things without seeing them who could not bear a strong light who loathed any food but bread and water and who parrotlike repeated a couple of phrases which he evidently did not understand and one word horse to which he seemed to attach some meaning what they saw was a youth of about seventeen with fair hair and blue eyes the lower part of his face slightly projecting like a monkeys he was four feet nine inches in height broadshouldered with tiny hands and delicate little feet which had never worn shoes nor been put to their natural use for the soles were as soft as a babys he was dressed in grey ridingbreeches a round jacket which had been made out of a frockcoat by cutting off the skirts and wore a round felt hat bound with red leather in his pockets were some rags some tracts a rosary and a paper of gold sand everyone who saw him and watched him came to the same conclusion that his mind was that of a child of two or three while his body was nearly grown up and yet he was not halfwitted because he immediately began to pick up words and phrases had a wonderful memory and never forgot a face he had once seen or the name which belonged to it during the next two or three weeks he spent part of every day in the guardroom part with the family of the gaoler whose children taught him to talk and to walk as they did their own baby sister he was not afraid of anything swords were whirled round his head without his paying any attention to them he stretched out his hand to the flame of a lighted candle and cried when it burnt him and when he saw his face in a lookingglass looked behind it for the other person he was particularly pleased when anything bright or glittering was given to him whenever this happened he called out horse horse and made signs as if he wanted to hang it on to the neck of something at last one of the policemen gave him a wooden horse when his happiness was complete and he spent hours sitting on the floor playing with this horse and the dozens of horses which were given to him by his visitors as soon as they heard of his liking for them six or seven weeks passed in this way and all this time the town council were discussing what they would do with him at last they decided to adopt him as the child of nuremberg and to have him properly cared for and taught so that if possible something of his past might be learned he was taken away from the prison and put under the charge of professor daumer whose interest in the youth led him to undertake the difficult task of developing his mind so that it might fit his body the burgomaster issued a notice to the inhabitants that in future they would not be allowed to see kaspar hauser at all hours of the day and that the police had orders to interfere if the curiosity of visitors led them to annoy dr daumer and his household he entered dr daumers house on july and during the next five months made such astonishing progress that the delight of his teacher knew no bounds in order to satisfy public curiosity the burgomaster published in july a short account of hausers previous life gleaned from him by careful questioning it was to this effect he neither knows who he is nor where he came from for it was only at nuremberg that he came into the world he always lived in a hole where he sat on straw on the ground he never heard a sound nor saw any vivid light he awoke and he slept and awoke again when he awoke he found a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water beside him sometimes the water tasted nasty and then he fell asleep again and when he woke up found he had a clean shirt on he never saw the face of the man who came to him he had two wooden horses and some ribbons to play with was never ill never unhappy in his hole once only the man struck him with a stick for making too much noise with his horses one day the man came into his room and put a table over his feet something white lay on the table and on this the man made black marks with a pencil which he put into his fingers this the man did several times and when he was gone kaspar imitated what he had done at last he taught him to stand and to walk and finally carried him out of his hole of what happened next kaspar had no very clear idea until he found himself in nuremberg with the letter in his hand at first sight this story seems quite impossible but it is borne out by two or three things kaspars legs were deformed in just such a way as would happen in the case of a person who had spent years sitting on the ground he never walked properly to the end and had great difficulty in getting upstairs his feet showed no signs of use except the blisters made by his boots and his walk to nuremberg he could see in the dark easily and disliked light and finally for several months after he came to nuremberg he refused to eat anything but bread and water and was in fact made quite ill by the smell of meat beer wine or milk for the first four months of his stay with daumer his senses of sight taste hearing and smell were very acute he had got past the stage in which he disliked light and could now see much further than most people by day without however losing his power of seeing in the dark at the same time he could not distinguish between a thing and a picture of that thing and could not for a long time judge distances at all for he saw everything flat his favourite colours were red and yellow black and green he particularly disliked everything ugly was called green he could not be persuaded that a ball did not roll because it wished to do so or that his top did not spin of its own accord for a long time he saw no reason why animals should not behave like human beings and was much annoyed because the cat refused to sit up at table and to eat with its paws blaming its disobedience in not doing as it was told he further thought that a cow which had lain down in the road would do well to go home to bed if it were tired his sense of smell was very keen painfully so in fact for he was made quite ill by the smell of the dye in his clothes the smell of paper and of many other things which other people do not notice at all while the smell of a sweep a hundred yards off on the other side of the road upset him for a week on the other hand he could distinguish the leaves of trees by their smell by november he had made sufficient progress to make it possible for dr daumer to teach him other things besides the use of his senses he was encouraged to write letters and essays to use his hands in every way to draw to make papermodels to dig in the garden where he had a little plot of ground with his name in mustard and cress in fact to use his lately acquired knowledge the great difficulty was to persuade him to eat anything but bread and water but by slow degrees he learned to eat different forms of farinaceous food gruel bread and milk rice c into which a little gravy and meat was gradually introduced by the following may he could eat meat without being made ill by it but never drank anything but water except at breakfast when he had chocolate for the next eleven months he lived a happy simple life with his friend and tutor who mentions however that the intense acuteness of his senses was gradually passing away but that he had still the charming obedient childlike nature which had won all hearts in the summer public interest was aroused by the news that kaspar hauser was writing his life and the paper was eagerly looked forward to all went well until october when kaspar was discovered senseless in a cellar under dr daumers house with a wound in his forehead he was carried upstairs and put to bed when he kept on moaning man man tell mother mrs daumer tell professor man beat me black sweep for some days he was too ill to give any account of his wound but at last said that he had gone downstairs and was suddenly attacked by a man with a black face who hit him on the head that he fell down and when he got up the man was gone that he went to look for mrs daumer and as he could not find her finally hid in the cellar to be quite safe after this murderous attack it was no longer safe to leave him in dr daumers house so when well again he was removed to the house of one of the magistrates and constantly guarded by two policemen without whom he never went out he was not very happy here and after some months was put under the charge of herr von tucher june with whom he remained for eighteen months at first the arrangement answered admirably he was happy in his new home his only trouble being that he was sent to the grammar school and put into one of the upper forms where he had to learn latin a task which proved too hard for his brain by this time his face had quite lost the brutish character it had when he came to nuremberg and its expression was pleasant though rather sad unfortunately for himself he was one of the sights of nuremberg was always introduced to any stranger of distinction who came to the town and attracted even more attention than the kangaroo so that even his warmest friends were obliged to admit that he was rather spoiled at the beginning of an englishman lord stanhope came to nuremberg saw the foundling was curiously interested in him and wished to adopt him kaspar was very much flattered and drew unfavourable comparisons between this englishman who thought nothing too good for him and his guardians who were thinking of apprenticing him to a bookbinder lord stanhopes kindness turned his head and herr von tucher after repeated remonstrances resigned his guardianship in december with the full consent of the town council of nuremberg lord stanhope removed kaspar to ausbach and placed him under the care of dr mayer it was generally supposed that this was only preparatory to taking him to england ample funds were provided for his maintenance but the journey to england was again and again put off and at last there were signs that lord stanhope was not quite satisfied with his new plaything so much had been said about kaspars cleverness that his new teachers were disappointed to find that his acquirements were about those of a boy of eight they accused him of laziness and of deceit and he finding himself suspected and closely questioned as to everything he did took refuge in falsehood at last a government clerkship of the lowest class was procured for him but great complaints were made of his inattention to his duties mainly copying he was unhappy and when on a visit to nuremberg in the summer made plans for the happy time when he should be able to come back and live with his friends there for the people of ausbach though making him one of the shows of the place do not seem to have had that perfect belief in him shown by his earlier friends while his new guardians expected a great deal too much from him his chief friend in ausbach was the clergyman who had prepared him for confirmation who noticed in november that he was very much depressed but this passed away on the afternoon of december kaspar came to call on the clergymans wife and was particularly happy and bright three hours afterwards he staggered into his tutors house holding his hand to his side gasping out garden man stabbed give purse let it drop come and dragged the astonished dr mayer off to a public garden where a little purse was found on the ground in it was a piece of paper on which was written backwards in pencil these lines i come from the bavarian frontier i will even tell you my name m l o kaspar was taken home and put to bed when it was discovered that there was a deep stab in his left side for some hours he was too ill to be questioned but on the th he was able to tell his story on the th as he was coming out of the government buildings to go home to dinner he was accosted by a man who promised to tell him who his parents were if he would come to a spot in the public gardens he refused as he was going home to dinner but made an appointment for that afternoon after dinner he called on the clergymans wife and then went to the gardens where he found the man waiting for him the man led him to the uz monument which was at a little distance from the main path and shut in by trees here he made him take a solemn oath of secrecy and handed him the little purse which kaspar in his hurry to seize it let drop as he stooped to pick it up he was stabbed and when he lifted himself up the stranger was gone then he ran home for two days he was not supposed to be in any danger but fever set in the doctors gave no hope of his recovery and on the th he died his death caused great excitement not only in ausbach and nuremberg but throughout all germany the question as to whether he was an impostor or not was hotly debated those who favoured the former theory insisting that he had killed himself accidentally when he only meant to wound himself and so excite sympathy some of the doctors declared however that that was quite impossible for the wound was meant to kill and could only have been selfinflicted by a lefthanded person of great strength for it had pierced through a padded coat a large reward l was offered for the capture of the assassin but in vain and the spot of the murder was marked by an inscription in latin hic occultus occulto occisus est here the mystery was mysteriously murdered the same idea is repeated on his tombstone here lies k h the riddle of the age his birth was unknown his death mysterious his death was the signal for a violent paperwar between his friends and his enemies it raged hotly for years but his friends have never succeeded in proving who he was why after having been shut up for so long he was at last set free or why his death was after all necessary while his enemies have utterly failed to prove that he was an impostor footnotes probably the man had tied a piece of black crape over his face as a mask this is rather a picturesque than a critical story of kaspar hauser the evidence of the men who first met him shows that he could then speak quite rationally the curious will find a brief but useful account of him in the duchess of clevelands kaspar hauser macmillans an artists adventure nearly four hundred years ago a boy was born in italy who grew up to be one of the most accomplished artists of his own or any other age besides excelling as a sculptor modeller and medallist he was a musician an author and an admirable swordsman and popes kings and other great princes eagerly employed him and vied with each other to secure his services his name was benvenuto cellini under pope clement vii he took part in the defence of the castle of st angelo when it was besieged by the constable de bourbon and the pope reposed such confidence in cellini that he was entrusted with the task of removing all the gems in the treasury from their settings and concealing the stones in the thick folds of his clothing however i am not going to enlarge on benvenutos many talents but to tell you of a wonderful adventure which befell him in the very castle of st angelo he had helped to defend those were lawless days and cellini was a man of fiery temper to whom blows came more naturally than patience and forbearance so it came to pass that being told that a certain goldsmith named pompeo had been spreading false reports about him benvenuto fell upon him one fine day in the very midst of rome and promptly stabbed him to death this might possibly have been overlooked but a workman jealous of cellinis success and reputation accused the artist to the reigning pope paul iii of having purloined some of the jewels entrusted to his care during the siege and paul was not to be trifled with where the affairs of the treasury were concerned moreover a near relation of the popes was cellinis sworn enemy and this sufficed to seal his fate so when taking a walk one morning benvenuto suddenly found himself face to face with crespino the sheriff attended by his band of constables crespino advanced saying you are the popes prisoner crespino exclaimed benvenuto you must take me for some one else no no replied crespino i know you perfectly benvenuto and i have orders to carry you to the castle of st angelo where great nobles and men of talent like yourself are sent then he politely begged benvenuto to give up his sword and led him off to the castle where he was locked up in a room above the keep it was easy enough for benvenuto to refute the accusations brought against him nevertheless he was kept prisoner in spite of the intervention of the french ambassador who demanded his liberty in the name of francis i the governor of the castle was like cellini a florentine and at first showed himself full of kind attentions towards his countryman allowing him a certain amount of liberty on parole within the castle walls growing suspicious later he kept his prisoner closer but after a time he restored him to comparative liberty when benvenuto found how changeable the governors humour was he set himself to think over matters seriously for he reflected should a fresh fit of anger or suspicion cause him to confine me more strictly i should feel myself released from my word and it may be as well to be prepared accordingly he ordered some new coarse linen sheets to be brought him but when soiled he did not send them back when his servants asked for the sheets so as to have them washed he bade them say no more as he had given them to one of the poor soldiers on guard who would be sure to get into trouble if the matter were known by degrees he emptied the straw out of his mattress burning a little of it at a time in his fireplace and replacing it with the sheets which he cut into strips some inches wide as soon as he thought these strips were long enough for his purpose he told his servants that he had given all the sheets away and that in future they had better bring him finer linen which he would be sure to return now it so happened that every year the governor was subject to a most distressing illness which for the time being entirely deprived him of his reason when it began to come on he would talk and chatter incessantly each year he had some fresh hallucination at one time fancying himself an oiljar at another a frog and skipping about like one again another time he declared he was dead and wished to be buried and so year by year he was the victim of some new delusion this year he imagined he was a bat and as he walked about he uttered little halfsmothered cries like a bat and flapped his hands and moved his body as though about to fly his faithful old servants and his doctors noticed this and thinking change of ideas and variety of conversation might do him good they frequently fetched benvenuto to entertain him one day the governor asked benvenuto whether it had ever occurred to him to desire to fly and on being answered in the affirmative he inquired further how he should set about it benvenuto replied that the only flying creature it would be at all possible to imitate artificially was the bat on which the poor man cried out true true thats it thats the thing then turning round he said benvenuto if you had everything you required for it do you think you could fly oh yes said the artist if you will only leave me free to do it i will engage to make a pair of wings of fine waxed cloth and to fly from here to prati with them and i too exclaimed the governor i could do it too but the pope has ordered me to keep you like the apple of his eye and as i strongly suspect youre a cunning fellow i shall lock you well up and give you no chance of flying thereupon and in spite of all benvenutos entreaties and protestations the governor ordered him to be taken back to prison and more carefully guarded than ever seeing he could not help himself cellini exclaimed before the officers and attendants very well lock me up and keep me safe for i give you due warning i mean to escape in spite of everything no sooner was he shut up in his cell than he fell to turning over in his mind how this escape could be made and began minutely examining his prison and after discovering what he thought would be a sure way of getting out he considered how best he might let himself down from the top of this enormous donjon tower which went by the name of il mastio he began by measuring the length of the linen strips which he had cut and joined firmly together so as to form a sort of rope and he thought there would be enough for his purpose next he armed himself with a pair of pincers which he had taken from one of his guards who was fond of carpentering and who amongst his tools had a particularly large and strong pair of pincers which appeared so useful to benvenuto that he abstracted them and hid them in his mattress as soon as he thought himself safe from interruption he began to feel about for the nails in the ironwork of the door but owing to its immense thickness they were by no means easy to get at however he managed at length to extract the first nail then came the question how to conceal the hole left behind this he contrived by making a paste of rusty scrapings and wax which he modelled into an exact representation of the head of a nail and in this way he replaced each nail he drew by a facsimile of its head in wax great care was required to leave just a sufficient number of nails to keep the ironwork and hinges in their places but benvenuto managed this by first drawing the nails cutting them as short as he dared and then replacing them in such a way as to keep things together and yet to allow of their being easily drawn out at the last moment all this was by no means easy to contrive for the governor was constantly sending some one to make sure that his prisoner was safe the two men who were specially charged with this duty were rough and rude and one of them in particular took pains to inspect the whole room carefully every evening paying special attention to the locks and hinges cellini lived in constant terror lest it should occur to them to examine his bedding where besides the pincers he had hidden a long sharp dagger and some other instruments as well as his long strips of linen each morning he swept out and dusted his room and carefully made his bed ornamenting it with flowers which he got the soldier from whom he had taken the pincers to bring him when his two warders appeared he desired them on no account to go near or touch his bed for fear of soiling or disturbing it sometimes in order to tease him they would touch it and then he would shout ah you dirty rascals just let me get at one of your swords and see how ill punish you how dare you touch the bed of such a man as i am little care i about risking my own life for i should be certain to take yours leave me in peace with my grief and trouble or i will show you what a man can do when driven to desperation these words were repeated to the governor who forbade the gaolers touching cellinis bed or entering his room armed the bed once safe he felt as if all else must go right illustration he prepared to attack the sentry one night the governor had a worse attack than ever and in a fit of madness kept repeating that he certainly was a bat and that should they hear of benvenutos escape they must let him fly off too as he was sure he could fly better at night and would overtake the fugitive benvenuto said he is but a sham bat but as i am a real bat and he has been given into my keeping i shall soon catch him again depend on it this bad attack lasted several nights and the savoyard soldier who took an interest in benvenuto reported to him that the servants were quite worn out watching their sick master hearing this cellini resolved to attempt his escape at once and set hard to work to complete his preparations he worked all night and about two hours before dawn he with much care and trouble removed the hinges from the door the casing and bolts prevented his opening it wide so he chipped away the woodwork till at length he was able to slip through taking with him his linen ropes which he had wound on two pieces of wood like two great reels of thread having passed the door he turned to the right of the tower and having removed a couple of tiles he easily got out on the roof he wore a white doublet and breeches and white boots into one of which he had slipped his dagger taking one end of his linen rope he now proceeded to hook it carefully over an antique piece of tile which was firmly cemented into the wall this tile projected barely four fingers breadth and the band hooked over it as on a stirrup when he had made it firm he prayed thus o lord my god come now to my aid for thou knowest that my cause is righteous and that i am aiding myself then he gently let himself slide down the rope till he reached the ground there was no moon but the sky was clear and once down he gazed up at the tower from which he had made so bold a descent and went off in high spirits thinking himself at liberty which indeed was by no means the case on this side of the castle the governor had had two high walls built to inclose his stables and his poultryyard and these walls had gates securely bolted and barred on the outside in despair at these obstacles benvenuto roamed about at random cursing his bad luck when suddenly he hit his foot against a long pole which lay hidden in the straw with a good deal of effort he managed to raise it against the wall and to scramble up to the top here he found a sharply sloping coping stone which made it impossible to draw the pole up after him but he fastened a portion of the second linen band to it and by this means let himself down as he had done outside the donjon tower by this time benvenuto was much exhausted and his hands were all cut and bleeding however after a short rest he climbed the last inclosure and was just in the act of fastening his rope to a battlement when to his horror he saw a sentinel close to him desperate at this interruption and at the thought of the risk he ran he prepared to attack the sentry who however seeing a man advance on him with a drawn dagger and determined air promptly took to his heels and benvenuto returned to his rope another guard was near but hoping not to have been observed the fugitive secured his band and hastily slid down it whether it was fatigue or that he thought himself nearer the ground than he really was it is impossible to say but he loosened his hold and fell hitting his head and lay stretched on the ground for more than an hour the sharp freshness of the air just before sunrise revived him but his memory did not return immediately and he fancied his head had been cut off and that he was in purgatory by degrees as his senses returned he realised that he was no longer in the castle and remembered what he had done he put his hands to his head and withdrew them covered with blood but on carefully examining himself he found he had no serious wound though on attempting to move he discovered that his right leg was broken nothing daunted he drew from his boot his poniard with its sheath which had a large ball at the end the pressure of this ball on the bone had caused the fracture he threw away the sheath and cutting off a piece of the remaining linen band with his dagger he bound up his leg as best he could and then dagger in hand proceeded to drag himself along on his knees towards the gate of the town it was still closed but seeing one stone near the bottom which did not look very huge he tried to displace it after repeated efforts it shook and at length yielded to his efforts so forcing it out he squeezed himself through he had barely entered rome when he was attacked by a band of savage dogs who bit and worried him cruelly he fought desperately with his dagger and gave one dog such a stab that it fled howling followed by the rest of the pack leaving benvenuto free to drag himself as best he could towards st peters by this time it was broad daylight and there was much risk of discovery so seeing a watercarrier passing with his train of asses laden with jars full of water benvenuto hailed him and begged he would carry him as far as the steps of st peters i am a poor fellow said he who have broken my leg trying to get out of the window of a house where i went to see my ladylove as the house belongs to a great family i much fear i shall be cut to pieces if i am found here so pray help me off and you shall have a gold crown for your pains and benvenuto put his hand to his purse which was well filled the watercarrier readily consented and carried him to st peters where he left him on the steps from whence benvenuto began to crawl towards the palace of duke ottavio whose wife a daughter of the emperors had brought many of cellinis friends from florence to rome in her train she was well disposed towards the great artist and he felt that beneath her roof he would be in safety unluckily as he struggled along he was seen and recognised by a servant of cardinal cornaros who had apartments in the vatican the man hurried to his masters room woke him up and cried most reverend lord benvenuto is below he must have escaped from the castle and is all bleeding and wounded he appears to have broken his leg and we have no idea where he is going run at once exclaimed the cardinal and fetch him here to my room when benvenuto appeared the cardinal assured him he need have no fears and sent off for the first surgeons in rome to attend to him then he shut him up in a secret room and went off to try and obtain his pardon from the pope meantime a great commotion arose in rome for the linen ropes dangling from the great tower had attracted notice and all the town was running out to see the strange sight at the vatican cardinal cornaro met a friend to whom he related all the details of benvenutos escape and how he was at that very moment hidden in a secret chamber then they both went to the pope who as they threw themselves at his feet cried i know what you want with me holy father said the cardinals friend we entreat you to grant us the life of this poor man his genius deserves some consideration and he has just shown an almost superhuman amount of courage and dexterity we do not know what may be the crimes for which your holiness has seen fit to imprison him but if they are pardonable we implore you to forgive him the pope looking somewhat abashed replied that he had imprisoned benvenuto for being too presumptuous however he added i am well aware of his talents and am anxious to keep him near me and am resolved to treat him so well that he shall have no desire to return to france i am sorry he is ill bid him recover quickly and we will make him forget his past sufferings i am sorry to say the pope was not so good as his words for benvenutos enemies plotted against him and after a time he was once more shut up in his former prison from which however he was eventually delivered at the urgent request of the king of france who warmly welcomed the great artist to his court where he spent some years in high honour the tale of isandhlwana and rorkes drift illustration although but fourteen years have gone by since perhaps some people if they chance to be young have forgotten about the zulus and the story of our war with them so before beginning the tale of isandhlwana and rorkes drift it may be worth while to tell of these matters in a few words the zulus live in southeastern africa originally they were not one tribe but many though the same blood was in them all nobody knows whence they came or who were their forefathers but they seem to have sprung from an arab or semitic stock and many of their customs such as the annual feast of the first fruits resemble those of the jews at the beginning of this century there arose a warrior king called chaka who gathered up the scattered tribes of the zulus as a woodman gathers sticks and as of the frail brushwood the woodman makes a stout faggot that none can break so of these tribes chaka fashioned a nation so powerful that no other black people could conquer it the deeds of chaka are too many to write of here seldom has there been a monarch black or white so terrible or so absolute and never perhaps has a man lived more wicked or more clever out of nothing as the kafirs say he made the amazulu or the people of heaven so powerful that before he died he could send out an army of a hundred thousand men to destroy those whom he feared or hated or whose cattle he coveted these soldiers were never beaten if they dared to turn their back upon an enemy however numerous they were killed when the battle was done so that soon they learned to choose death with honour before the foe in preference to death with shame at the hands of the executioner where chakas armies went they conquered till the country was swept of people for hundreds of miles in every direction at length after he had killed or been the cause of the violent death of more than a million human beings in the year chakas own hour came for as the zulu proverb says the swimmer is at last borne away by the stream he was murdered by the princes of his house and his body servant umbopo or mopo but as he lay dying beneath their spear thrusts it is said that the great king prophesied of the coming of white men who should conquer the land that he had won what he said do you slay me my brothers dogs of mine own house whom i have fed thinking to possess the land i tell you that i hear the sound of running feet the feet of a great white people and they shall stamp you flat children of my father after the death of chaka his brother dingaan reigned who had murdered him in due course he was murdered also and his brother panda succeeded to the throne panda was a man of peace and the only one of the four zulu kings who died a natural death for though it is not commonly known the last of these kings our enemy cetywayo is believed to have met his end by poison in cetywayo was crowned king of zululand in succession to his father panda on behalf of the english government by sir theophilus shepstone he remained a firm friend to the british till sir bartle frere declared war on him in sir bartle frere made war upon the zulus because he was afraid of their power and the zulus accepted the challenge because we annexed the transvaal and would not allow them to fight the boers or the swazis they made a brave resistance and it was not until there were nearly as many english soldiers in their country armed with breechloading rifles as they had effective warriors left alive in it for the most part armed with spears only that at length we conquered them but their heart was never in the war they defended their country against invasion indeed but by cetywayos orders they never attacked ours had they wished to do so there was nothing to prevent them from sweeping the outlying districts of natal and the transvaal after our first great defeat at isandhlwana but they spared us and now i have done with dull explanations and will go on to tell of the disaster at isandhlwana or the place of the little hand and of the noble defence of rorkes drift on the th of january one of the british columns that were invading zululand broke its camp on the left bank of the buffalo river and marched by the road that ran from rorkes drift to the indeni forest encamping that evening under the shadow of a steepcliffed and lonely mountain called isandhlwana this force was known as number column and with it went lord chelmsford the general in command of the troops the buildings at rorkes drift were left in charge of sixty men of the nd battalion th regiment under the late colonel bromhead then a lieutenant and some volunteers and others the whole garrison being commanded on the occasion of the attack by lieutenant chard re on january colonel then major dartnell the officer in command of the natal mounted police and volunteers who had been sent out to effect a reconnaissance of the country beyond isandhlwana reported that the zulus were in great strength in front of him thereupon lord chelmsford ordered six companies of the nd battalion th regiment together with four guns and the mounted infantry to advance to his support this force under the command of colonel glyn and accompanied by lord chelmsford himself left isandhlwana at dawn on the nd a despatch having first been sent to lieutcolonel durnford re who was in command of some five hundred friendly natal zulus about half of whom were mounted and armed with breechloaders to move up from rorkes drift and strengthen the camp which was now in charge of lieutcolonel pulleine of the st battalion th regiment orders were given to colonel pulleine by the general that he was to defend the camp about ten oclock that morning colonel durnford arrived at isandhlwana and took over the command of the camp which was then garrisoned by seven hundred and seventytwo european and eight hundred and fiftyone native troops in all one thousand six hundred and twentythree men with two guns little did lord chelmsford and those with him guess in what state they would find that camp when they returned to it some eighteen hours later or that of those sixteen hundred men the great majority would then be dead meanwhile a zulu impi or army numbering about twenty thousand men or something more than onethird of king cetywayos entire strength had moved from the upindo hill on the night of january and taken up its position on a stony plain a mile and a half to the east of isandhlwana the impi was made up of the undi regiment about three thousand strong that formed its breast or centre the nokenke and umcityu regiments seven thousand strong that formed its right wing or horn and the imbonanbi and nkobamikosi regiments ten thousand strong forming its left horn or wing that night the impi slept upon its spears and watched in silence lighting no fires the king had reviewed it three days previously and his orders to it were that it should attack number column and drive it back over the buffalo but it had no intention of giving battle on the nd for the state of the moon was not propitious so said the doctors moreover the soldiers had not been moutied that is sprinkled with medicines to put a great heart into them and ensure their victory the intention of the generals was to attack the camp at dawn on the rd and the actual engagement was brought about by an accident before i tell of this or of the fight however it may be as well to describe how these splendid savages were armed and disciplined to begin with every corps had a particular headdress and fighting shields of one colour just as in our army each regiment has its own facings on the tunics these shields are cut from the hides of oxen and it is easy to imagine what a splendid sight was presented by a zulu impi twenty thousand strong divided into several regiments one with snowwhite shields and tall cranes feathers on their heads one with coalblack shields and black plumes and others with red and mottled shields and bands of fur upon their foreheads in their war with the english many of the zulus were armed with muzzleloading guns and rifles of the worst description of which they could make little use for few of them were trained to handle firearms a much more terrible weapon in their hands and one that did nearly all the execution at isandhlwana was the broadbladed shortshafted stabbing assegai this shape of spear was introduced by the great king chaka and if a warrior cast it at an enemy or even chanced to lose it in a fight he was killed when the fray was over before chakas day the zulu tribes used light assegais which they threw at the enemy from a distance and thus their ammunition was sometimes spent before they came to close quarters with the foe among the zulus every ablebodied man was enrolled in one or other of the regiments even the girls and boys were made into regiments or attached to them and though these did not fight they carried the mats and cooking pots of the army and drove the cattle for the soldiers to eat when on the march thus it will be seen that this people differed from any other in the world in modern days for whereas even the most courageous and martial of mankind look upon war as an exceptional state of affairs and an evil only to be undertaken in selfdefence or perhaps for purposes of revenge and aggrandisement the zulus looked on peace as the exceptional state and on warfare as the natural employment of man chaka taught them that lesson and they had learnt it well and so it came about that cetywayo was forced to allow the army to fight with us when sir bartle frere gave them an opportunity of doing so since their hearts were sick with peace and for years they had clamoured to be allowed to wash their spears saying that they were no longer men but had become a people of women indeed had the king not done so they would have fought with each other it is a terrible thing to be obliged year after year to keep quiet an army of some fifty or sixty thousand men who are too proud to work and clamour daily to be led to battle that they may die as their fathers died we may be sure that the heart of many a zulu warrior beat high as in dead silence he marched that night from the heights of upindo towards the doomed camp of isandhlwana since at last he was to satisfy the longing of his blood and fight to the death with a foe whom he knew to be worthy of him doubtless also the hearts of the white men beat high that night as they gathered round the fires of their camp little knowing that thousands of zulu eyes were watching them from afar or that the black rock looming above them was destined to stand like some great tombstone over their bones for ever englishmen also are a warlike race and there was honour and advancement to be won and it would seem that but few of those who marched into the zulu country guessed how formidable was the foe with whom they had to deal a horde of halfnaked savages armed with spears did not strike english commanders imperfectly acquainted with the history and nature of those savages as particularly dangerous enemies some there were indeed who having spent their lives in the country knew what was to be expected but they were set down as croakers and their earnest warnings of disaster to come were disregarded now let us return to the camp it will be remembered that colonel glyns force accompanied by general lord chelmsford had left at dawn about eight oclock a picket placed some yards distant reported that zulus were approaching from the northeast this information was despatched by mounted messengers to colonel glyns column lieutcolonel durnford with his mounted natives and a rocket battery arriving from rorkes drift about am took over the command of the camp from colonel pulleine according to the evidence of lieutenant cochrane given at the court of inquiry colonel pulleine thereupon stated to colonel durnford the orders that he had received to defend the camp and it would appear that either then or subsequently some altercation took place between these two officers in the issue however colonel durnford advanced his mounted force to ascertain the enemys movements and directed a company of the st battalion th regiment to occupy a hill about yards to the north of the camp other companies of the th were stationed at various points at a distance from the camp it may be well to explain here that to these movements of troops which so far as can be ascertained were made by the direct orders of colonel durnford must be attributed the terrible disaster that followed there are two ways of fighting a savage or undisciplined enemy the scientific way such as is taught in staff colleges and the unscientific way that is to be learned in the sterner school of experience we english were not the first white men who had to deal with the rush of the zulu impis the boers had encountered them before at the battle of the blood river and armed only with muzzleloading roers or elephant guns despite their desperate valour had worsted them with fearful slaughter but they did not advance bodies of men to this point or to that according to the scientific method they drew their ox waggons into a square lashing them together with reims or hideropes and from behind this rough defence with but trifling loss to themselves rolled back charge after charge of the warriors of dingaan had this method been followed by our troops at the battle of isandhlwana who had ample waggons at hand to enable them to execute the manoeuvre had the soldiers even been collected in a square beneath the cliff of the mountain it cannot be doubted but that armed as they were with breechloaders they would have been able to drive back not only the impi sent against them but if necessary the entire zulu army indeed that this would have been so is demonstrated by what happened on the same day at rorkes drift where a hundred and thirty men repelled the desperate assaults of three or four thousand why then it may be asked did colonel durnford a man of considerable colonial experience adopt the more risky if the more scientific mode of dealing with the present danger and this in spite of colonel pulleines direct intimation to him that his orders were to defend the camp as it chances the writer of this account who knew colonel durnford well and has the greatest respect for the memory of that good officer and honourable gentleman is able to suggest an answer to the problem which at the time was freely offered by the natal colonists a few years before it happened that colonel durnford was engaged upon some military operations against a rebellious native chief in natal coming into contact with the followers of this chief in the hope that matters might be arranged without bloodshed durnford ordered the white volunteers under his command not to fire with the result that the rebels fired killing several of his force and wounding him in the arm this incident gave rise to an irrational indignation in the colony and for a while he himself was designated by the ungenerous nickname of dont fire durnford it is alleged none can know with what amount of truth that it was the memory of this undeserved insult which caused colonel durnford to insist upon advancing the troops under his command to engage the zulus in the open instead of withdrawing them to await attack in the comparative safety of a laager the events following the advance of the various british companies at isandhlwana are exceedingly difficult to describe in their proper order since the evidence of the survivors is confused illustration it would appear however that durnfords mounted basutos discovered and fired on a portion of the umcityu regiment which forgetting its orders sprang up and began to charge thereon accepting the position the other zulu regiments joined the movement very rapidly and with the most perfect order the impi adopted the traditional zulu oxhead formation namely that of a centre and two horns the centre representing the skull of the ox in this order they advanced towards the english camp slowly and without sound up to this time there had been no particular alarm in the camp the day was bright and lovely with a hot sun tempered by a gentle breeze that just stirred the tops of the grasses and many men seem to have been strolling about quite unaware of their imminent danger although orders were given to collect the transport oxen which were at graze outside the camp not for the purpose of inspanning the waggons but to prevent them from being captured by the enemy one officer captain now colonel essex reports that after the company had been sent out he retired to his tent to write letters till about twelve oclock a sergeant came to tell him that firing was to be heard behind a hill in face of the camp he mounted a horse and rode up the slope to find the company firing on a line of zulus eight hundred paces away to their front this line was about a thousand yards long and shaped like a horn tapering towards the point it advanced slowly taking shelter with great skill behind rocks and opened a quite ineffective fire on the soldiers meanwhile the two guns were shelling the zulu centre with great effect the shells cutting lanes through their dense ranks which closed up over the dead in perfect discipline and silence the attack was now general all the impi taking part in it except a reserve regiment that sat down upon the ground taking snuff and never came into action and the undi corps which moved off to the right with the object of passing round the north side of the isandhlwana hill on came the zulus in silence and ever as they came the two horns crept further and further ahead of the black breast of their array hundreds of them fell beneath the fire of the breechloaders but they did not pause in their attack ammunition began to fail the soldiers and orders having reached them too late to concentrate on the camp they retired slowly to that position captain essex also rode back and assisted the quartermaster of the th to place boxes of ammunition in a mule cart till presently the quartermaster was shot dead at his side now the horns or nippers of the foe were beginning to close on the doomed camp and the friendly natives who knew well what this meant though as yet the white men had not understood their danger began to steal away by twos and threes and then breaking into open rout they rushed through the camp seeking the waggon road to rorkes drift then at last the zulu generals saw that the points of the horns had met behind the white men and the moment was ripe abandoning its silence and slow advance the breast of the impi raised the warcry and charged rolling down upon the red coats like a wave of steel so swift and sudden was this last charge that many of the soldiers had no time to fix bayonets for a few moments the scattered companies held the impi back and the black stream flowed round them then it flowed over them sweeping them along like human wreckage in a minute the defence had become an utter rout some of the defenders formed themselves into groups and fought back to back till they fell where they stood to be found weeks afterwards mere huddled heaps of bones hundreds of others fled for the waggon road to find that the undi regiment passing round the isandhlwana mountain had occupied it already back they rolled from the hedge of undi spears to fall upon the spears of the attacking regiments one path of retreat alone remained a dry and precipitous donga or watercourse and into this plunged a rabble of men white and black mules horses guns and waggons meanwhile the last act of the tragedy was being played on the field of death with a humming sound such as might be made by millions of bees the zulu swarms fell upon those of the soldiers who remained alive and after a desperate resistance stabbed them wherever the eye looked men were falling and spears flashing in the sunshine while the ear was filled with groans of the dying and the savage sgee sgee of the zulu warriors as they passed their assegais through and through the bodies of the fallen many a deed of valour was done there as white men and black grappled in the deathstruggle but their bones alone remained to tell the tale of them shortly after the disaster one of the survivors told the present writer of a duel which he witnessed between a zulu and an officer of the th regiment the officer having emptied his revolver set his back against the wheel of a waggon and drew his sword then the zulu came at him with his shield up turning and springing from side to side as he advanced presently he lowered the shield exposing his head and the white man falling into the trap aimed a fierce blow at it as it fell the shield was raised again and the sword sank deep into its edge remaining fixed in the tough oxhide this was what the zulu desired with a twist of his strong arm he wrenched the sword from his opponents hand and in another instant the unfortunate officer was down with an assegai through his breast in a few minutes it was done all resistance had been overpowered the wounded had been murdered for the zulu on the warpath has no mercy and the dead mutilated and cut open to satisfy the horrible native superstition then those regiments that remained upon the field began the work of plunder most of the bodies they stripped naked clothing themselves in the uniforms of the dead soldiers they stabbed the poor oxen that remained fastened to the trektows of the waggons and they drank all the spirits that they could find some of them it is said perishing through the accidental consumption of the medical stores then when the sun grew low they retreated laden with plunder taking with them the most of their dead of whom there are believed to have been about fifteen hundred for the martinis did their work well and our soldiers had not died unavenged all this while lord chelmsford and the division which he accompanied were in ignorance of what had happened within a few miles of them though rumours had reached them that a zulu force was threatening the camp the first to discover the dreadful truth was commandant lonsdale of the natal native contingent this officer had been ill and was returning to camp alone a fact that shows how little anything serious was expected he reached it about the middle of the afternoon and there was nothing to reveal to the casual observer that more than three thousand human beings had perished there that day the sun shone on the white tents and on the ox waggons around and about which groups of redcoated men were walking sitting and lying it did not chance to occur to him that those who were moving were zulus wearing the coats of english soldiers and those lying down soldiers whom the zulus had killed as commandant lonsdale rode a gun was fired and he heard a bullet whizz past his head looking in the direction of the sound he saw a native with a smoking rifle in his hand and concluding that it was one of the men under his command who had discharged his piece accidentally he took no more notice of the matter forward he rode till he was within ten yards of what had been the headquarter tents when suddenly out of one of them there stalked a great zulu bearing in his hand a broad assegai from which blood was dripping then his intelligence awoke and he understood the camp was in the possession of the enemy and those who lay here and there upon the grass like holiday makers in a london park on a sunday in summer were english soldiers indeed not living but dead turning his horse commandant lonsdale fled as swiftly as it could carry him more than a hundred rifleshots were fired after him but the zulu marksmanship was poor and he escaped untouched a while afterwards a solitary horseman met lord chelmsford and his staff returning he saluted and said the camp is in the possession of the enemy sir none who heard those words will forget them and few men can have experienced a more terrible shock than that which fell upon the english general in this hour illustration slowly and with all military precaution lord chelmsford and his force moved onward till at length when darkness had fallen they encamped beneath the fatal hill of isandhlwana here momentarily expecting to be attacked they remained all night amid the wreck the ruin and the dead but not till the following dawn did they learn the magnitude of the disaster that had overtaken our arms then they saw and in silence marched from that fatal field heading for rorkes drift and leaving its mutilated dead to the vulture and the jackal now let us follow the fate of the mob of fugitives who driven back from the waggon road by the undi plunged desperately into the donga near it the sole avenue of retreat which had not been besieged by the foe in the hope that they might escape the slaughter by following the friendly natives who were mixed up with them how many entered on that terrible race for life is not known but it is certain that very few won through indeed it is said that with the exception of some natives no single man who was not mounted lived to pass the buffalo river for five miles or more they rode and ran over paths that a goat would have found it difficult to keep his footing on while by them and mixed up with them went the destroying zulus very soon the guns became fixed among the boulders and one by one the artillerymen were assegaied on went the survivors hopeless yet hoping now a savage sprang on this man and now on that the assegai flashed up a cry of agony echoed among the rocks and a corpse fell heavily to the red earth still those whom it pleased providence to protect struggled forward clinging to their horses manes as they leaped from boulder to boulder till at length they came to a cliff beneath which the buffalo rolled in flood down this cliff they slid and stumbled few of them can tell how then driven to it by the pitiless spears they plunged into the raging river many were drowned in its waters some were shot in the stream some were stabbed upon the banks yet a few clinging to the manes and tails of their horses gained the opposite shore in safety among these were two men whose memory their country will not willingly let die who indeed it is the first time in our military history have been decreed the victoria cross although they were already dead lieutenants coghill and melvill of the th regiment one of these lieutenant coghill the writer of this sketch had the good fortune to know well a kindlierhearted and merrier young english gentleman never lived melvill and coghill were swept away upon the tide of flight down the dreadful path that led to fugitives drift but melvill bore with him the colours of the th regiment that were in his charge as adjutant not tied round his waist as has been reported but upon the pole to which they were attached he arrived in safety at the river but owing to the loss of his horse was unable to cross it and took refuge upon a rock in midstream still holding the colours in his hand coghill whose knee was disabled by an accident and who had reached the natal bank already saw the terrible position of his friend and brother officer and though spears flashed about him and bullets beat the water like hail with a courage that has rarely been equalled he turned his horse and swam back to his assistance the worst was over safety lay before him there behind him in the river was almost certain death but this gallant gentleman heeded none of these things for there also were the colours of his regiment and his drowning friend back he swam to the rock through the boiling current soon his horse was shot dead beneath him yet though none knows how the two of them came safe to shore the colours were lost indeed for they could no longer carry them and live but these never fell into the hands of their savage foes days afterwards they were searched for and found in the bed of the river breathless desperate lamed and utterly outworn the two friends struggled up the bank and the hill beyond but zulus had crossed that stream as well as the fugitive englishmen they staggered forward for a few hundred yards then unable to go further the friends stood back to back and the foe closed in upon them there they stood and there fighting desperately the heroes died peace be with them in that land to which they have journeyed and among men immortal honour to their names they sold their lives dearly for several zulus were found lying about their bodies about forty white men lived to cross the river at fugitives drift and these almost the only english survivors of the force at isandhlwana rode on still followed by zulus to the provision dept at helpmakaar some fifteen miles away where they mustered and entrenched themselves as best they were able expecting to be attacked at any moment but no attack was delivered the zulus being busily employed elsewhere some little distance from the banks of the buffalo and on the natal side near to a mountain called tyana stood two buildings erected by the rev mr witt rorkes drift from which no column had advanced being immediately in front of them one of these buildings had been utilised as a storehouse and hospital and in it were thirtyfive sick men the other was occupied by a company of the nd th regiment under the command of the late lieut bromhead on january the ponts at rorkes drift were left in charge of lieut chard re with a few men about a quarterpast three on that day an officer of lonsdales regiment lieut adendorff and a carbineer were seen galloping wildly towards the ponts on coming to the bank of the river they shouted to lieut chard to take them across and so soon as he reached them they communicated to him the terrifying news that the generals camp had been captured and destroyed by a zulu impi a few minutes later a message arrived from lieut bromhead who also had learned the tidings of disaster requesting lieut chard to join him at the commissariat store mounting his horse he rode thither to find lieut bromhead assisted by mr dolton of the commissariat and the entire force at his command amounting to about inclusive of the sick and the chaplain mr smith a norfolk man actively engaged in loopholing and barricading the house and hospital both of which buildings were thatched and in connecting them by means of a fortification of mealie bags and waggons having ridden round the position lieut chard returned to the drift sergeant milne and mr daniells who managed the ponts offered to moor them in the middle of the stream and with the assistance of a few men to defend them from their decks this gallant suggestion being rejected as impracticable lieut chard withdrew to the buildings with the waggon and those under his command they arrived there about and shortly afterwards an officer of durnfords native horse rode up accompanied by about mounted men and asked for orders he was requested to send out outposts in the direction of the enemy and having checked their advance as much as possible to fall back when forced so to do upon the buildings and assist in their defence posts were then assigned to each man in the little garrison and this done the defensive preparations went on all doing their utmost for they felt that the life of every one of them was at stake threequarters of an hour went by and the officer of durnfords horse rode up reporting that the zulus were advancing in masses and that his men were deserting in the direction of helpmakaar at this time some natives of the natal contingent under the command of capt stephenson also retired an example which was followed by that officer himself lieuts chard and bromhead now saw that their lines of defence were too large for the number of men left to them and at once began the erection of an inner entrenchment formed of biscuit boxes taken from the stores when this wall was but two boxes high suddenly there appeared five or six hundred zulus advancing at a run against the southern side of their position these were soldiers of the undi regiment the same that had turned the isandhlwana mountain cutting off all possibility of retreat by the waggon road who when they knew that the camp was taken had advanced to destroy the guard of rorkes drift on they came to be met presently by a terrible and concentrated fire from the martinis many fell but they did not stay till when within yards of the wall the cross fire from the store took them in flank their loss was now so heavy that checking their advance some of them took cover among the ovens cookhouse and outbuildings whence they in turn opened fire upon the garrison hundreds more rushing round the hospital came at full speed against the northwest fortification of sacks filled with corn in vain did the martinis pump a hail of lead into them on they came straight to the frail defence striving to take it at the point of the assegai but here they were met by british bayonets and a fire so terrible that even the courage of the zulus could not prevail against it and they fell back that is those of them who were left alive by this time the main force of the undi had arrived two thousand of them perhaps and having lined an overlooking ledge of rocks took possession of the garden of the station and the bush surrounding it from all of which the fire though badly directed was so continuous that at length the little garrison of white men were forced back into their inner entrenchment of biscuit boxes creeping up under cover of the bush the zulus now delivered assault after assault upon the wall each of these fierce rushes was repelled with the bayonets wielded by the brave white men on its further side the assegais clashed against the rifle barrels everywhere the musketry rang and rolled the savage warcries and the cheers of the englishmen rose together through the din while british soldier and zulu warrior thrust and shot and tore at each other across the narrow wall that wall which all the undi could not climb now it grew dark for the night was closing in the spears flashed dimly and in place of smoke long tongues of flame shot from the rifle barrels illumining the stern faces of those who held them as lightning does but soon there was to be light if any had leisure to observe they may have seen flakes of fire flying upwards from the dim bush and wondered what they were they were bunches of burning grass being thrown on spears to fall in the thatch of the hospital roof presently something could be seen on this roof that shone like a star it grew dim then suddenly began to brighten and to increase till the starlike spot was a flame and a hoarse cry passed from man to man of o god the hospital is on fire the hospital was on fire and in it were sick men some of whom could not move it was defended by a garrison a handful of men and at one and the same time these must bear away the sick to the store building and hold the burning place against the zulus who now were upon them they did it but not all of it for this was beyond the power of mortal bravery and devotion when the thatch blazed above them room after room did privates williams and hook r and w jones and some few others hold with the white arm for their ammunition was spent against the assegais of the zulus while their disabled comrades were borne away to the store building beneath the shelter of the connecting wall one of them lost his life here others were grievously wounded but dead or alive their names should always be remembered among their countrymen ay and always will yet they could not save them every one the fire scorched overhead and the assegais bit deep in front and ever as foes fell fresh ones sprang into their places and so fighting furiously those few gallant men were thrust back alas leaving some helpless comrades to die by fire and the spear it would be of little use to follow step by step all the events of that night all night long the firing went on varied from time to time by desperate assaults all night long the little band of defenders held back the foe all were weary some of them were dead and more wounded but they fought on by the light of the burning hospital wasting no single shot to and fro went the bearded clergyman with prayers and consolations upon his lips and a bag of cartridges in his hands and to and fro also went chard and bromhead directing all things by degrees the englishmen were driven back the hospital and its approaches were in the hands of the foe and now they must retire to the inner wall of the cattle kraal but they collected sacks of mealies and built two redoubts which gave them a second line of fire and let the zulus do what they would storm the place they could not nor could they serve it as they had served the hospital and destroy it by fire at length the attacks slackened the firing dwindled and died and the dawn broke that same dawn which showed to general lord chelmsford and those with him all the horror of isandhlwanas field here also at rorkes drift it revealed death and to spare but for the most part the corpses were those of the foe some four hundred of whom lay lost in their last sleep around the burning hospital in the bush and beneath the walls of cornsacks four hundred killed by one hundred and thirtynine white men all told of whom thirtyfive were sick when the defence began the little band had suffered indeed for fifteen of them were dead and twelve wounded some mortally but seeing what had been done the loss was small had the zulus once won an entrance over the last entrenchment of biscuit boxes not a man would have remained alive surely biscuits were never put to a nobler or a stranger use the daylight had come and the enemy vanished with the night retreating over a hill to the southwest but as the defenders of rorkes drift guessed he had no intention of abandoning his attack therefore they knew that this was no time to be idle sallying out of their defences they collected the arms of the dead zulus then returned and began to strip the roof of the store of its thatch which was a constant source of danger to them seeing that fire is a deadlier foe even than the assegai they were thus engaged when again the zulus appeared to make an end of them once more the weary soldiers took up their positions and a while passed now they perceived that the undi which had been advancing slowly commenced to fall back a movement that they were at a loss to understand till a shout from those who were engaged in stripping the roof told the glad news that english troops were advancing to their relief these were the remains of no column moving down from isandhlwana little did the general and those with him expect to find a soul living at rorkes drift for they also had seen the sullen masses of the undi retreating from the post and the columns of smoke rising from the burning hospital confirmed their worst fears what then was their joy when they perceived a union jack flying amidst the smoke and heard the ring of a british cheer rising from the shattered walls and the defences of sacks of corn forward galloped col russell and his mounted men and in five minutes more those who remained of the garrison were safe and the defence of rorkes drift was a thing of the past another glorious page ready to be bound into that great book which is called the deeds of englishmen nearly six months passed before all the dead at isandhlwana were reverently buried strange were the scenes that those saw whose task it was to lay them to their rest here hidden by the rank grass in one heap behind the officers tents lay the bodies of some seventy men who had made their last stand at this spot lower down the hill lay sixty more another band of about the same strength evidently had taken refuge among the rocks of the mountains and defended themselves there till their ammunition was exhausted and their ring broken by the assegai all about the plain lay englishmen and zulus as they had died in the dread struggle here side by side amidst rusted rifles and bent assegais here their bony arms still locked in the last hug of death and yonder the zulu with the white mans bayonet through his skull the soldier with the zulus assegai in what had been his heart one man was found who when his cartridges were spent and his rifle was broken had defended himself to the end with a tenthammer that lay among his bones and another was stretched beneath the precipice from the crest of which he had been hurled illustration well they buried them where they were discovered and there they sleep soundly beneath the shadow of isandhlwanas cliff and now a few words more and this true story will be finished we conquered the zulus at last at a battle called ulundi where they hurled themselves in vain upon the bullets and bayonets of the british square to the end they fought bravely for their king and country and though they were savages and like all savages cruel when at war they were also gallant enemies and deserve our respect the king himself cetywayo was hunted down captured and sent into captivity afterwards there was what is called a popular movement on his behalf in england and he was sent back to zululand with permission to rule half the country meanwhile after the conclusion of the war our government would not take the land and a settlement was effected under which thirteen chiefs were put in authority over the country as might have been expected these chiefs fought with each other and many men were killed when cetywayo returned the fighting became fiercer than ever since those who had tasted power refused to be dispossessed until at last he was finally defeated and it is believed poisoned by his own side to whom he had ceased to be serviceable meanwhile also the dutch boers taking advantage of the confusion occupied a great part of zululand which they still hold indeed they would long ago have taken it all had not the english government seeing the great misery to which its everchanging policy had reduced the unhappy zulus assumed authority over the remainder of the country from that day forward there has been no more killing or trouble in british zululand which is ruled by sir melmoth osborn kcmg and the queen has no more contented subjects than the zulus nor any who pay their taxes with greater regularity but the zulus as a nation are dead and never again will a great impi such as swept away our troops at isandhlwana be seen rushing down to war their story is but one scene in the vast drama which is being enacted in this generation and which some of you who read these lines may live to see not accomplished indeed but in the way of accomplishment the drama of the building up of a great anglosaxon empire in africa an empire that within the next few centuries may well become one of the mightiest in the world we have made many and many a mistake but still that empire grows in spite of the errors of the home government the obstinacy of the boers the power of native chiefs and the hatred of portuguese still it grows already it is about as big as europe and it is only a baby yet a baby begotten by the genius and courage of individual englishmen when the child has become a giant yes even in those faroff ages when it is a very old giant a king among the nations we may be sure that from generation to generation men will show their sons the mountain that was called isandhlwana or the place of the little hand and a certain spot on the banks of the buffalo river and tell the tale of how beneath that hill the wild zulus of the ancient times overwhelmed the forces of the early english settlers of how for a long night through a few men of those forces held two grassthatched sheds against their foes savage might and of how some miles away two heroes named melville and coghill died together whilst striving to save the colours of their regiment from the grasp of the victorious children of heaven now it may interest you to know that these last words are written with a pen that was found among the bones of the dead at isandhlwana h rider haggard footnote col bromhead died recently how leif the lucky found vineland the good this is the story of the first finding of america by the icelanders nearly five hundred years before columbus they landed on the coast and stayed for a short time where they landed is uncertain thinking that it was in new england the people of boston have erected a statue of leif in their town the story was not written till long after leifs time and it cannot all be true dead men do not return and give directions about their burial as we read here we have omitted a silly tale of a onefooted man in the middle ages people believed that onefooted men lived in africa they thought vineland was near africa so they brought the fable into the saga hundreds of years before columbus discovered america there lived in iceland a man named eric the red his father had slain a man in norway and fled with his family to iceland eric too was a dangerous man his servants did mischief on the farm of a neighbour who slew them then eric slew the farmer and also holmgang hrafn a famous duellist of whom the country was well rid eric was banished from that place and in his new home had a new quarrel he lent some furniture to a man who refused to restore it eric therefore carried off his goods and the other pursued him they fought and eric killed him for this he was made an outlaw and went sailing to discover new countries he found one where he settled calling it greenland because he said people would come there more readily if it had a good name one thorbiorn among others sailed to greenland but came in an unlucky time for fish were scarce and some settlers were drowned at that day some of the new comers were christians some still worshipped the old gods thor and woden and practised magic these sent for a prophetess to tell them what the end of their new colony would be it is curious to know what a real witch was like and how she behaved so we shall copy the story from the old icelandic book illustration when she came in the evening with the man who had been sent to meet her she was clad in a darkblue cloak fastened with a strap and set with stones quite down to the hem she wore glass beads around her neck and upon her head a black lambskin hood lined with white catskin in her hands she carried a staff upon which there was a knob which was ornamented with brass and set with stones up about the knob circling her waist she wore a girdle of touchwood and attached to it a great skin pouch in which she kept the charms which she used when she was practising her sorcery she wore upon her feet shaggy calfskin shoes with long tough latchets upon the ends of which there were large brass buttons she had catskin gloves upon her hands the gloves were white inside and lined with fur when she entered all of the folk felt it to be their duty to offer her becoming greetings she received the salutations of each individual according as he pleased her yeoman thorkel took the sibyl by the hand and led her to the seat which had been made ready for her thorkel bade her run her eyes over man and beast and home she had little to say concerning all these the tables were brought forth in the evening and it remains to be told what manner of food was prepared for the prophetess a porridge of goats beestings was made for her and for meat there were dressed the hearts of every kind of beast which could be obtained there she had a brass spoon and a knife with a handle of walrus tusk with a double hasp of brass around the haft and from this the point was broken and when the tables were removed yeoman thorkel approaches the prophetess thorbiorg and asks how she is pleased with the home and the character of the folk and how speedily she would be likely to become aware of that concerning which he had questioned her and which the people were anxious to know she replied that she could not give an opinion in this matter before the morrow after that she had slept there through the night and on the morrow when the day was far spent such preparations were made as were necessary to enable her to accomplish her soothsaying she bade them bring her those women who knew the incantation which she required to work her spells and which she called warlocks but such women were not to be found thereupon a search was made throughout the house to see whether anyone knew this incantation then says gudrid thorbiorns daughter although i am neither skilled in the black art nor a sibyl yet my fostermother halldis taught me in iceland that spellsong which she called warlocks thorbiorg answered then art thou wise in season gudrid replies this is an incantation and ceremony of such a kind that i do not mean to lend it any aid for that i am a christian woman thorbiorg answers it might so be that thou couldst give thy help to the company here and still be no worse woman than before however i leave it with thorkel to provide for my needs thorkel now so urged gudrid that she said she must needs comply with his wishes the women then made a ring round about while thorbiorg sat up on the spelldas gudrid then sang the song so sweet and well that no one remembered ever before to have heard the melody sung with so fair a voice as this the sorceress thanked her for the song and said she has indeed lured many spirits hither who think it pleasant to hear this song those who were wont to forsake us hitherto and refuse to submit themselves to us many things are now revealed to me which hitherto have been hidden both from me and from others and i am able to announce that this period of famine will not endure longer but the season will mend as spring approaches the visitation of disease which has been so long upon you will disappear sooner than expected after this thorbiorn sailed to the part of greenland where eric the red lived and there was received with open arms eric had two sons one called thorstein the other leif the lucky and it was leif who afterwards discovered vineland the good that is the coast of america somewhere between nova scotia and new england he found it by accident he had been in norway at the court of king olaf who bade him proclaim christianity in greenland as he was sailing thither leif was driven by tempests out of his course and came upon coasts which he had never heard of where wild vines grew and hence he called that shore vineland the good the vine did not grow of course in iceland but leif had with him a german tyrker and one day when they were on shore tyrker was late in joining the rest he was very much excited and spoke in the german tongue saying i have found something new vines and grapes then they filled their boat full of grapes and sailed away he also brought away some men from a wreck and with these and the message of the gospel he sailed back to greenland to his father eric the red and from that day he was named leif the lucky but eric had no great mind to become a christian he had been born to believe in thor and his own sword next year leifs brother thorstein set out to find vineland and eric first burying all his treasures started with him but he fell from his horse and broke his ribs and his company came within sight of ireland but vineland they did not see so they returned to ericsfirth in greenland and there passed the winter illustration there was much sickness and one woman died after her death she rose and they could only lay her by holding an axe before her breast thorstein erics son died also but in the night he arose again and said that christian burial should be given to men in consecrated ground for the manner had been to bury the dead in their farms with a long pole driven through the earth till it touched the breast of the corpse afterwards the priest came and poured holy water through the hole and not till then perhaps long after the death was the funeral service held after thorstein rose and spoke christian burial was always used in greenland next year came karlsefni from iceland with two ships and eric received him kindly and gave all his crew winter quarters in summer nothing would serve karlsefni but to search again for vineland the good they took three ships and one hundred and sixty men and south they sailed they passed flat stone land where there were white foxes and bear island where they saw a bear and forest land and a cape where they found the keel of a wrecked ship this they named keelness then they reached the wonder strands long expanses of sandy shore now karlsefni had with him two scotch or irish savages the swiftest of all runners whom king olaf had given to leif the lucky and they were fleeterfooted than deer they wore only a plaid and kilt all in one piece for the rest they were naked karlsefni landed them south of wonder strands and bade them run south and return on the third day to report about the country when they returned one carried a bunch of grapes the other ears of native wheat maize then they sailed on passed an isle covered with birds eggs and a firth which they called streamfirth from the tide in it beyond streamfirth they landed and established themselves there there were mountains thereabouts they occupied themselves exclusively with the exploration of the country they remained there during the winter and they had taken no thought for this during the summer the fishing began to fail and they began to fall short of food then thorhall the huntsman disappeared they had already prayed to god for food but it did not come as promptly as their necessities seemed to demand they searched for thorhall for three halfdays and found him on a projecting crag he was lying there and looking up at the sky with mouth and nostrils agape and mumbling something they asked him why he had gone thither he replied that this did not concern anyone they asked him then to go home with them and he did so soon after this a whale appeared there and they captured it and flensed it and no one could tell what manner of whale it was and when the cooks had prepared it they ate of it and were all made ill by it then thorhall approaching them says did not the redbeard that is thor prove more helpful than your christ this is my reward for the verses which i composed to thor the trustworthy seldom has he failed me when the people heard this they cast the whale down into the sea and made their appeals to god the weather then improved and they could now row out to fish and thenceforward they had no lack of provisions for they could hunt game on the land gather eggs on the island and catch fish from the sea next spring thorhall the heathen left them laughing at the wine which he had been promised and sailed north he and his crew were driven to ireland where they were captured and sold as slaves and that was all thorhall got by worshipping the red beard karlsefni sailed south and reached a rich country of wild maize where also was plenty of fish and of game here they first met the natives who came in a fleet of skincanoes they were swarthy men and illlooking and the hair of their heads was ugly they had great eyes and were broad of cheek the icelanders held up a white shield in sign of peace and the natives withdrew they may have been eskimo or red indians the winter was mild and open but spring had scarce returned when the bay was as full of native canoes as if ashes had been sprinkled over it they only came to trade and exchanged furs for red cloth nor did they seem to care whether they got a broad piece of cloth or a narrow one they also wanted weapons but these karlsefni refused to sell the market was going on busily when a bull that karlsefni had brought from greenland came out of the wood and began to bellow whereon the skraelings as they called the natives ran three weeks passed when the skraelings returned in very great force waving their clubs against the course of the sun whereas in peace they waved them with it karlsefni showed a red shield the token of war and fighting began it is not easy to make out what happened for there are two sagas or stories of these events both written down long after they occurred in one we read that the skraelings were good slingers and also that they used a machine which reminds one rather of gunpowder than of anything else they swung from a pole a great black ball and it made a fearful noise when it fell among karlsefnis men so frightened were they that they saw skraelings where there were none and they were only rallied by the courage of a woman named freydis who seized a dead mans sword and faced the skraelings beating her bare breast with the flat of the blade on this the skraelings ran to their canoes and paddled away in the other account karlsefni had fortified his house with a palisade behind which the women waited to one of them gudrid the appearance of a white woman came her hair was of a light chestnut colour she was pale and had very large eyes what is thy name she said to gudrid my name is gudrid but what is thine gudrid says the strange woman then came the sound of a great crash and the woman vanished a battle followed in which many skraelings were slain it all reads like a dream in the end karlsefni sailed back to ericsfirth with a great treasure of furs a great and prosperous family in iceland was descended from him at the time when the stories were written down but it is said that freydis who frightened the skraelings committed many murders in vineland among her own people the icelanders never returned to vineland the good though a bishop named eric is said to have started for the country in now in the story of corts you may read how the mexicans believed in a god called quetzalcoatl a white man in appearance who dwelt among them and departed mysteriously saying that he would come again and they at first took corts and his men for the children of quetzalcoatl so we may fancy if we please that bishop eric or one of his descendants wandered from vineland south and west across the continent and arrived among the aztecs and by them was taken for a god footnote the story is taken from the saga of eric the red and from the flatey book in mr reevess finding of wineland the good clarendon press the discovery of vineland was made about the year the saga of eric the red was written about but two hundred years before about ari the learned mentions vineland as quite familiar in his slandingabk there are other traces of vineland earlier than the manuscript of the saga of eric the red of course we do not know when that saga was first written down the oldest extant manuscript of it belonged to one hauk who died in the escapes of cervantes most people know of the terrible war waged even down to the present century between the christian ships cruising about the mediterranean and the dreaded moors or corsairs of the barbary coast it was a war that began in the name of religion the crescent against the cross but as far as we can learn from the records of both sides there was little to choose in the way that either party treated the captives a large number of these were chained to the oars of the galleys which were the ships of battle of the middle ages and sometimes the oars were so long and heavy that they needed forty men to each the rowers had food enough to give them the strength necessary for their work and that was all and the knowledge that they were exerting themselves for the downfall of their fellowchristians often of their fellowcountrymen must have made their labour a toil indeed often it happened that a mans courage gave way and he denied his faith and his country and rose to great honours in the service of the sultan the chief of the little kings who swarmed on the african coasts the records of the corsairs bristle with examples of these successful renegades many of them captured as boys who were careless under what flag they served as long as their lives were lives of adventure all the captives were not however turned into galley slaves some were taken to the towns and kept in prisons called bagnios waiting till their friends sent money to redeem them if this was delayed they were set to public works and treated with great severity so that their letters imploring deliverance might become yet more urgent the others known as the kings captives whose ransom might be promptly expected did no work and were kept apart from the rest it was on september that miguel cervantes the future author of don quixote fell into the hands of a greek renegade dali mami by name captain of a galley of twentytwo banks of oars cervantes the son of a poor but welldescended gentleman of castile had served with great distinction under don john of austria at the battle of lepanto four years earlier and was now returning with his brother rodrigo to spain on leave bearing with him letters from the commanderinchief don john the duke of sesa viceroy of sicily and other distinguished men testifying to his qualities as a soldier as valiant as he was unlucky and recommending philip ii to give him the command of a spanish company then being formed for italian service but all these honours proved his bane the spanish squadron had not sailed many days from naples when it encountered a corsair fleet and after a sharp fight cervantes and his friends were carried captive into algiers of course the first thing done was to examine each man as to his position in life and the amount of ransom he might be expected to bring and the letters found upon miguel cervantes impressed them with the notion that he was a person of consequence and capable of furnishing a large sum of money they therefore took every means of ensuring his safety loading him with chains appointing him guards and watching him day and night stone walls do not a prison make nor iron bars a cage cervantes never lost heart a moment but at once began to plan an escape for himself and his fellowcaptives but the scheme broke down owing to the treachery of the man in whom he had confided and the spaniards particularly cervantes were made to suffer a stricter confinement than before the following year the old cervantes sent over what money he had been able to raise on his own property and his daughters marriage portions for the ransom of his sons by the hands of the redemptorist fathers an order which had been founded for the sole purpose of carrying on this charitable work but when the sum was offered to dali mami he declared it wholly insufficient for purchasing the freedom of such a captive though it was considered adequate as the ransom of the younger brother rodrigo accordingly in august rodrigo cervantes set sail for spain bearing secret orders from his brother miguel to fit out an armed frigate and to send it by way of valencia and majorca to rescue himself and his friends but even before the departure of rodrigo cervantes had been laying other plans he had somehow or other managed to make acquaintance with the navarrese gardener of a greek renegade named azan who had a garden stretching down to the seashore about three miles east of algiers where cervantes was then imprisoned this gardener had contrived to use a cave in azans garden as a hiding place for some escaped christians and as far back as february about fifteen had taken refuge there under the direction of cervantes how they remained for so many months undiscovered and how they were all fed no one can tell but this part of the duty had been undertaken by a captive renegade called el dorador or the gilder to whom their secret had been confided meanwhile rodrigo had proved faithful to his trust he had equipped a frigate for sea under the command of a tried soldier viana by name who was familiar with the barbary coast it set sail at the end of september and by the th had sighted algiers from motives of prudence the boat kept to sea till nightfall when it silently approached the shore the captives hailed it with joy and were in the act of embarking when a fishing craft full of moors passed by and the rescue vessel was forced to put to sea meanwhile cervantes and the fugitives in the cave had to return disheartened into hiding and await another opportunity but once lost the opportunity was gone for ever before any fresh scheme could be concerted el dorador had betrayed the hiding place of the christians and their plan of escape to the cruel dey or king azan who saw in the information a means to satisfy his greed according to the law of the country he was enabled to claim the escaped slaves as his own property except cervantes for whom he paid crowns and with a company of armed men presented himself before the cave in this dreadful strait cervantes courage never faltered he told the trembling captives not to fear as he would take upon himself the entire responsibility of the plan then addressing azans force he proclaimed himself the sole contriver of the scheme and professed his willingness to bear the punishment the turks were struck dumb at valour such as this in the presence of the most dreadful torments and contented themselves with ordering the captives into close confinement at the bagnio hanging the gardener and bringing cervantes bound to receive his sentence from the dey azan himself the threats of impalement torture mutilation of every kind which cervantes well knew to be no mere threats had no effect upon his faithful soul he stuck to the story he had told and the dey wearied by so much constancy as the spanish historian says ended by loading him with chains and throwing him again into prison for some time he remained here strictly and closely guarded but his mind always active as to plans of escape at last however he managed to enter into relations with don martin de cordoba general of oran by means of a moor who undertook to convey letters asking for help for the spanish prisoners but his ill fortune had not yet deserted him the messenger fell into the hands of other moors who handed him over to azan and the wretched man was at once put to a cruel death by the deys orders curiously enough the sentence of lashes passed upon cervantes was never carried into effect disappointments and dangers only made cervantes more determined to free himself or die in the attempt but nearly two years dragged by before he saw another hope rise before him though he did everything he could in the interval to soothe the wretched lot of his fellowcaptives this time his object was to induce two valencia merchants of algiers to buy an armed frigate destined to carry cervantes and a large number of christians back to spain but at the last minute they were again betrayed this time by a countryman and again cervantes took the blame on his own shoulders and confessed nothing to the dey now it seemed indeed as if his last moment had come his hands were tied behind him and a cord was put round his neck but cervantes never swerved from the tale he had resolved to tell and at the close of the interview found himself within the walls of a moorish prison where he lay for five months loaded with fetters and chains and treated with every kind of severity though never with actual cruelty all this time his mind was busy with a fresh scheme nothing short of a concerted insurrection of all the captives in algiers numbering about who were to overpower the city and to plant the spanish flag on its towers his measures seem to have been taken with sufficient prudence and foresight to give them a fair chance of success bold as the idea was but treachery as usual caused the downfall of everything why under such repeated provocation the cruel azan aga did not put him to a frightful death it is hard to understand but in his captives story cervantes himself bears testimony to the comparative moderation of the deys behaviour towards him though suffering he says often if not indeed always from hunger and thirst the worst of all our miseries was the sight and sound of the tortures daily inflicted by our master on our fellowchristians every day he hanged one impaled another cut off the ears of a third and all this for so little reason or even for none at all that the very turks knew he did it for the mere pleasure of doing it and because to him cruelty was the natural employment of mankind only one man did he use well and that was a spanish soldier named saavedra and though this saavedra had struck blows for liberty which will be remembered by moors for many years to come yet azan never either gave him stripes himself nor ordered his servants to do so neither did he ever throw him an evil word while we trembled lest for the smallest of his offences the tyrant would have him impaled and more than once he himself expected it this straightforward account of matters inside the bagnio is the more valuable and interesting if we recollect that cervantes greatgrandmother was a saavedra and that the soldier alluded to in the text was really himself it is impossible to explain satisfactorily the sheathing of the tigers claws on his account alone did cervantes exercise unconsciously a mesmeric influence over azan did azan ascribe his captives defiance of death and worse than death to his bearing a charmed life or did he hold him to be a man of such consequence in his own country that it was well to keep him in as good condition as azans greed would permit we shall never know only there remains cervantes emphatic declaration that during the five long years of his captivity no mans hand was ever lifted against him meanwhile having no more money wherewith to ransom his son rodrigo de cervantes made a declaration of his poverty before a court of law and set forth miguels services and claims in march the old mans prayer was enforced by the appearance of four witnesses who had known him both in the levant and in algiers and could testify to the truth of his fathers statement and a certificate of such facts as were within his knowledge being willingly offered by the duke of sesa the king philip ii consented to furnish the necessary ransom but the illfortune which had attended cervantes in these past years seemed to stick to him now just when the negotiations were drawing to a conclusion his father suddenly died and it appeared as if the expedition of the redemptorist fathers would sail without him however his mother was happily a woman of energy and after managing somehow to raise three hundred ducats on her own possessions appealed to the king for help this he appears to have granted her at once and he gave her an order for ducats on some valencia merchandise but with their usual bad luck they only ultimately succeeded in obtaining about sixty which with her own three hundred were placed in the hands of the redemptorist fathers it was time the fact that the term of azans government of algiers had drawn to an end rendered him more than ever greedy for money and he demanded for cervantes double the price that he himself had paid and threatened if this was not forthcoming to carry his captive on board his own vessel which was bound for constantinople indeed this threat was actually put into effect and cervantes bound and loaded with chains was placed in a ship of the little squadron that was destined for turkish waters the good father felt that once in constantinople cervantes would probably remain a prisoner to the end of his life and made unheard of efforts to accomplish his release borrowing the money that was still lacking from some algerian merchants and even using the ransoms that had been entrusted to him for other captives then at last cervantes was set free and after five years was able to go where he would and return to his native country his work however was not yet done he somehow discovered that a spaniard named blanco de paz who had once before betrayed him was determined through jealousy to have him arrested the moment he set foot in spain and to this end had procured a mass of false evidence respecting his conduct in algiers it is not easy to see what cervantes could have done to incur the hatred of this man but about this he did not trouble himself to inquire and set instantly to consider the best way of bringing his schemes to naught he entreated his friend father gil to be present at an interview held before the notary pedro de ribera at which a number of respectable christians appeared to answer a paper of twentyfive questions propounded by cervantes himself as to the principal events of his five years of imprisonment and his treatment of his fellowcaptives armed with this evidence he was able to defy the traitor and to return in honour to his native land with the rest of his life we have nothing to do it was not we may be sure lacking in adventure for he was the kind of man to whom adventures come and as his inheritance was all gone he went back to his old trade and joined the army which philip was assembling to enforce his claim to the crown of portugal in this country as in all others to which his wandering life had led him he made many friends and took notice of what went on around him he was in all respects a man practical and vigorous in many ways the exact opposite of his own don quixote who saw everything enlarged and glorified and nothing as it really was but in other ways the true counterpart of his hero in his desire to give help and comfort wherever it was needed and to leave the world better than he found it the worthy enterprise of john foxe an englishman in delivering two hundred and sixtysix christians out of the captivity of the turks at alexandria january among our english merchants it is a common thing to traffic with spain for which purpose in there set out from portsmouth a ship called the three half moons with thirtyeight men on board and well armed the better to encounter any foes they might meet now drawing near the straits they found themselves beset by eight turkish galleys so that it was impossible for them to fly but they must either yield or be sunk this the owner perceiving manfully encouraged his company telling them not to faint in seeing such a heap of their foes ready to devour them putting them in mind also that if it were gods pleasure to give them into their enemies hands there ought not to be one unpleasant look among them but they must take it patiently putting them in mind also of the ancient worthiness of their countrymen who in the hardest extremities have always most prevailed with other such encouragement they all fell on their knees making their prayers briefly to god then stood up grove the master being a comely man with his sword and target holding them up in defiance against his enemies likewise stood up the owner boatswain purser and every man well armed now also sounded up the trumpets drums and flutes which would have encouraged any man however little heart he had in him then john foxe the gunner took him to his charge sending his bullets among the turks who likewise fired among the christians and thrice as fast but shortly they drew near so that the english bowmen fell to shooting so terribly among their galleys that there were twice as many of the turks slain as the whole number of the christians but the turks discharged twice as fast against the christians and so long that the ship was very sorely battered and bruised which the foe perceiving made the more haste to come aboard for this coming aboard many a turk paid dearly with his life but it was all in vain and board they did where they found a hot skirmish for the englishmen showed themselves men indeed and the boatswain was valiant above the rest for he fought among the turks like a mad lion and there was none of them that could stand in his face till at last there came a shot that struck him in the breast so that he fell down bidding them farewell and to be of good comfort and exhorting them rather to win praise by death than to live in captivity and shame this they hearing indeed intended to have done but the number and press of the turks was so great that they could not wield their weapons and so were taken when they intended rather to have died except only the masters mate who shrank from the fight like a notable coward illustration but so it was and the turks were victors though they had little cause of triumph then it would have grieved any hard heart to see these infidels wantonly illtreating the christians who were no sooner in the galleys than their garments were torn from their backs and they set to the oars i will make no mention of their miseries being now under their enemies raging stripes their bodies distressed with too much heat and also with too much cold but i will rather show the deliverance of those who being in great misery continually trust in god with a steadfast hope that he will deliver them near the city of alexandria being a harbour there is a shiproad very well defended by strong walls into which the turks are accustomed to bring their galleys every winter and there repair them and lay them up against the spring in this road there is a prison in which the captives and all those prisoners who serve in the galleys are confined till the sea be calm again for voyaging every prisoner being most grievously laden with irons on his legs giving him great pain into this prison all these christians were put and fast guarded all the winter and every winter as time passed the master and the owner were redeemed by friends but the rest were left in misery and halfstarved except john foxe who being a somewhat skilful barber made shift now and then by means of his craft to help out his fare with a good meal till at last god sent him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison so that he had leave to go in and out to the road paying a stipend to the keeper and wearing a lock about his leg this liberty six more had on the same conditions for after their long imprisonment it was not feared that they would work any mischief against the turks in the winter of the year all the galleys having reached port and their masters and mariners being at their own homes the ships themselves being stripped of their masts and sails there were in the prison two hundred and sixtyeight christian captives belonging to sixteen different nations among these were three englishmen one of them john foxe the others william wickney and robert moore and john foxe now having been thirteen or fourteen years under the bondage of the turks and being weary thereof pondered continually day and night how he might escape never ceasing to pray god to further his enterprise if it should be to his glory not far from the road at one side of the city there was a certain victuallinghouse which one peter unticare had hired paying a fee to the keeper of the prison this peter unticare was a spaniard and also a christian and had been a prisoner about thirty years never contriving any means to escape but keeping himself quiet without being suspected of conspiracy but on the coming of john foxe they disclosed their minds to each other about their loss of liberty and to this unticare john foxe confided a plan for regaining their freedom which plan the three englishmen continually brooded over till they resolved to acquaint five more prisoners with their secret this being done they arranged in three more days to make their attempt at escape whereupon john foxe and peter unticare and the other six arranged to meet in the prison on the last day of december and there they told the rest of the prisoners what their intention was and how they hoped to bring it to pass and having without much ado persuaded all to agree john foxe gave them a kind of files which he had hoarded together by means of peter unticare charging them every man to be free of his fetters by eight oclock on the following night the next night john foxe and his six companions all having met at the house of peter unticare spent the evening mirthfully for fear of rousing suspicion till it was time for them to put their scheme into execution then they sent peter unticare to the master of the road in the name of one of the masters of the city with whom he was well acquainted and at the mention of whose name he was likely to come at once desiring him to meet him there and promising to bring him back again the keeper agreed to go with unticare telling the warders not to bar the gate for he would come again with all speed in the meantime the other seven had provided themselves with all the weapons they could find in the house and john foxe took a rusty old sword without a hilt which he managed to make serve by bending the hand end of the sword instead of a hilt now the keeper being come to the house and seeing no light nor hearing any noise straightway suspected the plot and was turning back but john foxe standing behind the corner of the house stepped forth to him he perceiving it to be john foxe said o foxe what have i deserved of thee that thou shouldest seek my death thou villain quoth foxe hast been a bloodsucker of many a christians blood and now thou shalt know what thou hast deserved at my hands therewith he lifted up his bright shining sword cleared of its ten years rust and struck him so strong a blow that his head was cleft asunder and he fell stark dead to the ground thereupon peter unticare went in and told the rest how it was with the keeper and at once they came forth and with their weapons ran him through and cut off his head so that no man should know who he was then they marched towards the road and entered it softly there were six warders guarding it and one of them asked who was there then quoth foxe and his company all friends but when they were within it proved contrary for quoth foxe to his companions my masters here there is not a man to a man so look you play your parts they so behaved themselves indeed that they had despatched those six quickly then john foxe intending not to be thwarted in his enterprise barred the gate surely and planted a cannon against it they entered the gaolers lodge where they found the keys of the fortress and prison by his bedside and then they all got better weapons in this chamber was a chest holding a great treasure all in ducats which peter unticare and two more stuffed into their garments as many as they could carry but foxe would not touch them saying that it was his liberty and theirs he sought and not to make a spoil of the wicked treasure of the infidels yet these words did not sink into their hearts though they had no good of their gain now having provided themselves with the weapons they needed they came to the prison and unlocked its gates and doors and called forth all the prisoners whom they employed some in ramming up the gate some in fitting up a galley which was the best in the road in the prison were several warders whom john foxe and his company slew but this was perceived by eight more turks who fled to the top of the prison where foxe and his company had to reach them by ladders then followed a hot skirmish and john foxe was shot thrice through his apparel without being hurt but peter unticare and the other two who had weighed themselves down with the ducats so that they could not manage their weapons were slain among the turks there was one thrust through who fell from the top of the prison wall and made such a crying out that the inhabitants of a house or two that stood near came and questioned him and soon understood the case how the prisoners were attempting to escape then they raised both alexandria on the west side of the road and a castle at the end of the city next to the road and also another fortress on the north side of the road and now the prisoners had no way to escape but one that might seem impossible for them illustration then every man set to work some to their tackling some carrying arms and provisions into the galley some keeping the enemy from the wall of the road to be short there was no man idle nor any labour spent in vain so that presently the galley was ready and into it they all leaped hastily and hoisted sail but when the galley had set sail and was past the shelter of the road the two castles had full power over it and what could save it from sinking the cannon let fly from both sides and it was between them both yet there was not one on board that feared the shot that came thundering about their ears nor yet was any man scarred or touched for now god held forth his buckler and shielded this galley having tried their faith to the uttermost and they sailed away being not once touched with the glance of a shot and were presently out of the reach of the turkish cannon then might you see the turks coming down to the waterside in companies like swarms of bees trying to make ready their galleys which would have been a quick piece of work seeing that they had in them neither oars nor sails nor anything else yet they carried them in but some into one galley some into another for there was much confusion among them and the sea being rough and they having no certain guide it was a thing impossible that they should overtake the prisoners for they had neither pilot mariners nor any skilful master that was ready at this pinch when the christians were safe out of the enemys coast john foxe called to them all telling them to fall down upon their knees thanking god for their delivery and beseeching him to aid them to the land of their friends then they fell straightway to labouring at the oars striving to come to some christian country as near as they could guess by the stars but the winds were so contrary now driving them this way now that that they were bewildered thinking that god had forsaken them and left them to yet greater danger and soon there were no victuals left in the galley and the famine grew to be so great that in twentyeight days there had died eight persons but it fell out that upon the twentyninth day they reached the isle of candy and landed at gallipoli where they were made much of by the abbot and monks and cared for and refreshed they kept there the sword with which john foxe had killed the keeper esteeming it a most precious jewel then they sailed along the cost to tarento where they sold the galley and went on foot to naples having divided the price but at naples they parted asunder going every man his own way and john foxe journeyed to rome where he was well entertained by an englishman and presented to the pope who rewarded him liberally and gave him letters to the king of spain and by the king of spain also he was well entertained and granted twenty pence a day thence desiring to return into his own country he departed in and being come into england he went into the court and told all his travel to the council who considering that he had spent a great part of his youth in thraldom extended to him their liberality to help to maintain him in age to their own honour and the encouragement of all truehearted christians illustration baron trenck most men who have escaped from prison owe their fame not to their flight but to the deeds which caused their imprisonment it may however safely be asserted that few people out of his own country would have heard of baron trenck had it not been for the wonderful skill and cunning with which he managed to cut through the stone walls and iron bars of all his many cages he was born at knigsberg in prussia in and entered the bodyguard of frederic ii in when he was about sixteen trenck was a young man of good family rich welleducated and according to his own account fond of amusement he confesses to having shirked his duties more than once for the sake of some pleasure even after the war of the austrian succession had broken out september and frederic strict though he was had forgiven him it is plain from this that the king must have considered that trenck had been guilty of some deadly treachery towards him when in after years he declined to pardon him for crimes which after all the young man had never committed trencks first confinement was in when he was thrown into the castle of glatz on a charge of corresponding with his cousin and namesake who was in the service of the empress maria theresa and of being an austrian spy at first he was kindly treated and allowed to walk freely about the fortifications and he took advantage of the liberty given him to arrange a plan of escape with one of his fellowprisoners the plot was however betrayed by the other man and a heavy punishment fell on trenck by the kings orders he was promptly deprived of all his privileges and placed in a cell in one of the towers which overlooked the ramparts lying ninety feet below on the side nearest the town this added a fresh difficulty to his chances of escape as in passing from the castle to the town he was certain to be seen by many people but no obstacles mattered to trenck he had money and then as now money could do a great deal so he began by bribing one of the officials about the prison and the official in his turn bribed a soapboiler who lived not far from the castle gates and promised to conceal trenck somewhere in his house still liberty must have seemed a long way off for trenck had only one little knife canif with which to cut through everything by dint of incessant and hard work he managed to saw through three thick steel bars but even so there were eight others left to do his friend the official then procured him a file but he was obliged to use it with great care lest the scraping sound should be heard by his guards perhaps they wilfully closed their ears for many of them were sorry for trenck but at all events the eleven bars were at last sawn through and all that remained was to make a rope ladder this he did by tearing his leather portmanteau into strips and plaiting them into a rope and as this was not long enough he added his sheets the night was dark and rainy which favoured him and he reached the bottom of the rampart in safety unluckily he met here with an obstacle on which he had never counted there was a large drain opening into one of the trenches which trenck had neither seen nor heard of and into this he fell in spite of his struggles he was held fast and his strength being at last exhausted he was forced to call the sentinel and at midday having been left in the drain for hours to make sport for the town he was carried back to his cell henceforth he was still more strictly watched than before though curiously enough his money never seems to have been taken from him and at this time he had about eighty louis left which he always kept hidden about him eight days after his last attempt fouquet the commandant of glatz who hated trenck and all his family sent a deputation consisting of the adjutant an officer and a certain major doo to speak to the unfortunate man and exhort him to patience and submission trenck entered into conversation with them for the purpose of throwing them off their guard when suddenly he snatched away doos sword rushed from his cell knocked down the sentinel and lieutenant who were standing outside and striking right and left at the soldiers who came flying to bar his progress he dashed down the stairs and leapt from the ramparts though the height was great he fell into the fosse without injury and still grasping his sword he scrambled quickly to his feet and jumped easily over the second rampart which was much lower than the first and then began to breathe freely as he thought he was safe from being overtaken by the soldiers who would have to come a long way round at this moment however he saw a sentinel making for him a short distance off and he rushed for the palisades which divided the fortifications from the open country from which the mountains and bohemia were easily reached in the act of scaling them his foot was caught tight between the bars and he was trapped till the sentinel came up and after a sharp fight got him back to prison for some time poor trenck was in a sad condition in his struggle with the sentinel he had been wounded while his right foot had got crushed in the palisades beside this he was watched far more strictly than before for an officer and two men remained always in his cell and two sentinels were stationed outside the reason of these precautions of course was to prevent his gaining over his guards singly either by pity or bribery his courage sank to its lowest ebb as he was told on all sides that his imprisonment was for life whereas long after he discovered the real truth that the kings intention had been to keep him under arrest for a year only and if he had had a little more patience three weeks would have found him free his repeated attempts to escape naturally angered frederic while on the other hand the king knew nothing of the fact which excused trencks impatience namely the belief carefully instilled in him by all around him that he was doomed to perpetual confinement it is impossible to describe in detail all the plans made by trenck to regain his freedom first because they were endless and secondly because several were nipped in the bud still the unfortunate man felt that as long as his money was not taken from him his case was not hopeless for the officers in command were generally poor and in debt and were always sent to garrison work as a punishment after one wild effort to liberate all the prisoners in the fortress which was naturally discovered and frustrated trenck made friends with an officer named schell lately arrived at glatz who promised not only his aid but his company in the new enterprise as more money would be needed than trenck had in his possession he contrived to apply to his rich relations outside the prison and by some means what we are not told they managed to convey a large sum to him suspicion however got about that trenck was on too familiar a footing with the officers and orders were given that his door should always be kept locked this occasioned further delay as false keys had secretly to be made before anything else could be done their flight was unexpectedly hastened by schell accidentally learning that he was in danger of arrest one night they crept unobserved through the arsenal and over the inner palisade but on reaching the rampart they came face to face with two of the officers and again a leap into the fosse was the only way of escape luckily the wall at this point was not high and trenck arrived at the bottom without injury but schell was not so happy and hurt his foot so badly that he called on his friend to kill him and to make the best of his way alone trenck however declined to abandon him and having dragged him over the outer palisade took him on his back and made for the frontier before they had gone five hundred yards they heard the boom of the alarm guns from the fortress while clearer still were the sounds of pursuit as they knew that they would naturally be sought on the side towards bohemia they changed their course and pushed on to the river neiss at this season partly covered with ice trenck swam over slowly with this friend on his back and found a boat on the other side by means of this boat they evaded their enemies and reached the mountains after some hours very hungry and almost frozen to death here a new terror awaited them some peasants with whom they took refuge recognised schell and for a moment the fugitives gave themselves up for lost but the peasants took pity on the two wretched objects fed them and gave them shelter till they could make up their minds what was best to be done to their unspeakable dismay they found that they were after all only seven miles from glatz and that in the neighbouring town of wunschelburg a hundred soldiers were quartered with orders to capture all deserters from the fortress this time however fortune favoured the luckless trenck and though he and schell were both in uniform they rode unobserved through the village while the rest of the people were at church and skirting wunschelburg crossed the bohemian frontier in the course of the day then follows a period of comparative calm in trencks history he travelled freely about poland austria russia sweden denmark and holland and even ventured occasionally across the border into prussia twelve years seem to have passed by in this manner till in his mother died and trenck asked leave of the council of war to go up to dantzic to see his family and to arrange his affairs curiously enough it appears never to have occurred to him that he was a deserter and as such liable to be arrested at any moment and this was what actually happened by order of the king trenck was taken first to berlin where he was deprived of his money and some valuable rings and then removed to magdeburg of which place duke ferdinand of brunswick was the governor here his quarters were worse than he had ever known them his cell was only six feet by ten and the window was high with bars without as well as within the wall was seven feet thick and beyond it was a palisade which rendered it impossible for the sentinels to approach the window on the other side the prisoner was shut in by three doors and his food which was not only bad but very scanty was passed to him through an opening one thing only was in his favour his cell was only entered once a week so he could pursue any work to further his escape without much danger of being discovered notwithstanding the high window the thick wall and the palisade notwithstanding too his want of money he soon managed to open negotiations with the sentinels and found to his great joy that the next cell was empty if he could only contrive to burrow his way into that he would be able to watch his opportunity to steal through the open door once free he could either swim the elbe and cross into saxony which lay about six miles distant or else float down the river in a boat till he was out of danger small as the cell was it contained a sort of cupboard fixed into the floor by irons and on these trenck began to work after frightful labour he at last extracted the heavy nails which fastened the staples to the floor and breaking off the heads which he put back to avoid detection he kept the rest to fashion for his own purposes by this means he made instruments to raise the bricks on this side also the wall was seven feet thick and formed of bricks and stones trenck numbered them as he went on with the greatest care so that the cell might present its usual appearance before the wednesday visit of his guards to hide the joins he scraped off some of the mortar which he smeared over the place as may be supposed all this took a very long time he had nothing to work with but the tools he himself had made which of course were very rough but one day a friendly sentinel gave him a little iron rod and a small knife with a wooden handle these were treasures indeed and with their help he worked away for six months at his hole as in some places the mortar had become so hard that it had to be pounded like a stone during this time he enlisted the compassion of some of the other sentinels who not only described to him the lie of the country which he would have to traverse if he ever succeeded in getting out of prison but interested in his behalf a jewess named esther heymann whose own father had been for two years a prisoner in magdeburg in this manner trenck became the possessor of a file a knife and some writing paper as the friendly jewess had agreed to convey letters to some influential people both at vienna and berlin and also to his sister but this step led to the ruin not only of trenck but of several persons concerned for they were betrayed by an imperial secretary of embassy called weingarten who was tempted by a bill for florins many of those guilty of abetting trenck in this fresh effort to escape were put to death while his sister was ordered to build a new prison for him in the fort de letoile and he himself was destined to pass nine more years in chains in spite of his fetters trenck was able in some miraculous way to get on with his hole but his long labour was rendered useless by the circumstance that his new prison was finished sooner than he expected and he was removed into it hastily being only able to conceal his knife he was now chained even more heavily than before his two feet being attached to a heavy ring fixed in the wall another ring being fastened round his body from this ring was suspended a chain with a thick iron bar two feet long at the bottom and to this his hands were fastened an iron collar was afterwards added to his instruments of torture besides torments of body nothing was wanting which could work on his mind his prison was built between the trenches of the principal rampart and was of course very dark it was likewise very damp and to crown all the name of trenck had been printed in red bricks on the wall above a tomb whose place was indicated by a deaths head illustration here again he tells us he excited the pity of his guards who gave him a bed and coverlet and as much bread as he chose to eat and wonderful as it may seem his health did not suffer from all these horrors as soon as he got a little accustomed to his cramped position he began to use the knife he had left and to cut through his chains he next burst the iron band and after a long time severed his leg fetters but in such a way that he could put them on again and no one be any the wiser nothing is more common in the history of prisoners than this exploit and nothing is more astonishing yet we meet with the fact again and again in their memoirs and biographies trenck at any rate appears to have accomplished the feat without much difficulty though he found it very hard to get his hand back into his handcuffs after he had disposed of his bonds he began to saw at the doors leading to the gallery these were four in number and all of wood but when he arrived at the fourth his knife broke in two and the courage that had upheld him for so many years gave way he opened his veins and lay down to die when in his despair he heard the voice of gefhardt the friendly sentinel from the other prison hearing of trencks sad plight he scaled the palisade and we are told expressly bound up his wounds though we are not told how he managed to enter the cell be that as it may the next day when the guards came to open the door they found trenck ready to meet them armed with a brick in one hand and a knife doubtless obtained from gefhardt in the other the first man that approached him he stretched wounded at his feet and thinking it dangerous to irritate further a desperate man they made a compromise with him the governor took off his chains for a time and gave him strong soup and fresh linen then after a while new doors were put to his cell the inner door being lined with plates of iron and he himself was fastened with stronger chains than those he had burst through for all this the watch must have been very lax as gefhardt soon contrived to open communications with him again and letters were passed through the window to which the prisoner had made a false and movable frame and forwarded to trencks rich friends his appeal was always answered promptly and amply more valuable than money were two files also procured from gefhardt and by their means the new chains were speedily cut through though as before without any apparent break having freed his limbs he began to saw through the floor of his cell which was of wood underneath instead of hard rock there was sand which trenck scooped out with his hands this earth was passed through the window to gefhardt who removed it when he was on guard and gave his friend pistols a bayonet and knives to assist him when he had finally made his escape all seemed going smoothly the foundations of the prison were only four feet deep and trencks tunnel had reached a considerable distance when everything was again spoilt a letter written by trenck to vienna fell into the hands of the governor owing to some stupidity on the part of gefhardts wife who had been entrusted to deliver it the letter does not seem to have contained any special disclosure of his plan of escape as the governor who was still duke ferdinand of brunswick could find nothing wrong in trencks cell except the false window frame the cut chains though examined somehow escaped detection from which we gather either that the officials were very careless or the carpenter very stupid perhaps both may have been the case for as the seven years war against austria was at this time raging sentinels and officers were frequently changed and prison discipline insensibly relaxed had this not been so trenck could never have been able to labour unseen but as it was he was merely deprived of his bed as a punishment for tampering with the window as soon as he had recovered from his fright and an illness which followed he returned to his digging it was necessary for him to bore under the subterranean gallery of the principal rampart which was a distance of thirtyseven feet and to get outside the foundation of the rampart beyond that was a door leading to the second rampart trenck was forced to work naked for fear of raising the suspicions of the officials by his dirty clothes but in spite of all his precautions and the wilful blindness of his guards who as usual were on his side all was at length discovered his hole was filled up and a years work lost the next torture invented for him was worse than any that had gone before he was visited and awakened every quarter of an hour in order that he might not set to work in the night this lasted for four years during part of which time trenck employed himself in writing verses and making drawings on his tin cups after the manner of all prisoners and in writing books with his blood as ink was forbidden we are again left in ignorance as to how he got paper he also began to scoop out another hole but was discovered afresh though nothing particular seems to have been done to him partly owing to the kindness of the new governor who soon afterwards died it had been arranged by his friends that for the space of one year horses should be ready for him at a certain place on the first and fifteenth of every month inspired by this thought he turned to his burrowing with renewed vigour and worked away at every moment when he thought he could do so unseen one day however when he had reached some distance he dislodged a large stone which blocked up the opening towards his cell his terror was frightful not only was the air suffocating and the darkness dreadful but he knew that if any of the guards were unexpectedly to come into his cell the opening must be discovered and all his toil again lost for eight hours he stayed in the tunnel paralysed by fear then he roused himself and by dint of superhuman struggles managed to open a passage on one side of the stone and to reach his cell which for once appeared to him as a haven of rest soon after this the war ended with the peace of paris and trencks hopes of release seemed likely to be realised he procured money from his friends and bribed the austrian ambassador in berlin to open negotiations on his behalf and while these were impending he rested from his labours for three whole months suddenly he was possessed by an idea which was little less than madness he bribed a major to ask for a visit from duke ferdinand of brunswick again governor of magdeburg offering to disclose his passage and to reveal all his plans of escape on condition that the duke would promise to plead for him with the king this message never reached the duke himself but some officers arrived ostensibly sent by him but in reality tools of the majors they listened to all he had to say and saw all he had to show then broke their word filled up the passage and redoubled the chains and the watch notwithstanding this terrible blow trencks trials were drawing to an end whether frederics heart was softened by his brilliant victories or whether trencks influential friends succeeded in making themselves heard we do not know but six months later he was set free on condition that he never tried to revenge himself on any one and that he never again should cross the frontiers of saxony or prussia the adventure of john rawlins in the year one john rawlins native of rochester sailed from plymouth in a ship called the nicholas which had in its company another ship of plymouth and had a fair voyage till they came within sight of gibraltar then the watch saw five sails that seemed to do all in their power to come up with the nicholas which on its part suspecting them to be pirates hoisted all the sail it could but to no avail for before the day was over the turkish ships of war for so they proved to be not only overtook the plymouth ships but made them both prisoners then they sailed for argier which when they reached the english prisoners were sold as slaves being hurried like dogs into the market as men sell horses in england and marched up and down to see who would give most for them and though they had heavy hearts and sad countenances yet many came to behold them sometimes taking them by the hand sometimes turning them round about sometimes feeling their arms and muscles and bargaining for them accordingly till at last they were sold john rawlins was the last who was sold because his hand was lame and he was bought by the very captain who took him named villa rise who knowing rawlins skill as a pilot bought him and his carpenter at a very low rate paying for rawlins seven pounds ten reckoned in english money then he sent them to work with other slaves but the turks seeing that through rawlins lame hand he could not do so much as the rest complained to their master who told him that unless he could obtain a ransom of fifteen pounds he should be banished inland where he would never see christendom again but while john rawlins was terrified with this stern threat of villa rise there was lying in the harbour another english ship that had been surprised by the pirates the exchange of bristol this ship was bought by an english turk who made captain of it another english turk and because they were both renegades they concluded to have english and dutch slaves to go in her so it came about that inquiring if any english slave were to be sold who could serve them as pilot they heard of john rawlins and forthwith bought him of his master villa rise by january the ship left argier with on board her sixtythree turks and moors nine english slaves and a french slave four dutchmen who were free and four gunners one english and one dutch renegade now the english slaves were employed for the most part under hatches and had to labour hard all of which john rawlins took to heart thinking it a terrible lot to be subject to such pain and danger only to enrich other men and themselves to return as slaves therefore he broke out at last with such words as these oh horrible slavery to be thus subject to dogs oh heaven strengthen my heart and hand and something shall be done to deliver us from these cruel mahometan dogs the other slaves pitying what they thought his madness bade him speak softly lest they should all fare the worse for his rashness worse said rawlins what can be worse i will either regain my liberty at one time or another or perish in the attempt but if you would agree to join with me in the undertaking i doubt not but we should find some way of winning glory with our freedom prithee be quiet they returned and do not think of impossibilities though if indeed you could open some way of escape so that we should not be condemned as madmen for trying as it were to pull the sun out of the heavens then we would risk our lives and you may be sure of silence after this the slavery continued and the turks set their captives to work at all the meanest tasks and even when they laboured hardest flogged and reviled them till more and more john rawlins became resolved to recover his liberty and surprise the ship so he provided ropes with broad spikes of iron and all the iron crows with which he could with the help of the others fasten up the scuttles gratings and cabins and even shut up the captain himself with his companions and so he intended to work the enterprise that at a certain watchword the english being masters of the gunnerroom and the powder would either be ready to blow the turks into the air or kill them as they came out one by one if by any chance they forced open the cabins then very cautiously he told the four free dutchmen of his plot and last of all the dutch renegades who were also in the gunnerroom and all these consented readily to so daring an enterprise so he fixed the time for the venture in the captains morning watch but you must understand that where the english slaves were there always hung four or five iron crows just under the gun carriages and when the time came it was very dark so that john rawlins in taking out his iron dropped it on the side of the gun making such a noise that the soldiers hearing it waked the turks and told them to come down at this the boatswain of the turks descended with a candle and searched everywhere making a great deal of stir but finding neither hatchet nor hammer nor anything else suspicious only the iron which lay slipped down under the guncarriages he went quietly up again and told the captain what had happened who thought that it was no remarkable thing to have an iron slip from its place but through this john rawlins was forced to wait for another opportunity when they had sailed further northward there happened another suspicious accident for rawlins had told his scheme to the renegade gunner who promised secrecy by everything that could induce one to believe in him but immediately after he left rawlins and was absent about a quarter of an hour when he returned and sat down again by him presently as they were talking in came a furious turk with his sword drawn who threatened rawlins as if he would certainly kill him this made rawlins suspect that the renegade gunner had betrayed him and he stepped back and drew out his knife also taking the gunners out of its sheath so that the turk seeing him with two knives threw down his sword saying he was only jesting but the gunner seeing that rawlins suspected him whispered something in his ear calling heaven to witness that he had never breathed a word of the enterprise and never would nevertheless rawlins kept the knives in his sleeve all night and was somewhat troubled though afterwards the gunner proved faithful and zealous in the undertaking all this time rawlins persuaded the captain who himself had little knowledge of seamanship to steer northward meaning to draw him away from the neighbourhood of other turkish vessels on february they descried a sail and at once the turks gave chase and made her surrender it proved to be a ship from near dartmouth laden with silk as it was stormy weather the turks did not put down their boat but made the master of the conquered ship put down his and come on board with five of his men and a boy while ten of the turks men among whom were one english and two dutch renegades belonging to the conspiracy went to man the prize instead illustration but when rawlins saw this division of his friends before they could set out for the other ship he found means to tell them plainly that he would complete his enterprise either that night or the next and that whatever came of it they must acquaint the four english left on the captured ship with his resolution and steer for england while the turks slept and suspected nothing for by gods grace in his first watch he would show them a light to let them know that the enterprise was begun or about to be begun so the boat reached the ship from dartmouth and next rawlins told the captain and his men whom the turks had sent down among the other prisoners of his design and found them willing to throw in their lot with him the next morning being february the prize from dartmouth was not to be seen the men indeed having followed rawlins counsel and steered for england but the turkish captain began to storm and swear telling rawlins to search the seas up and down for her which he did all day without success then rawlins finding a good deal of water in the hold persuaded the captain by telling him that the ship was not rightly balanced to have four of the guns brought aft that the water might run to the pump this being done and the guns placed where the english could use them for their own purpose the final arrangement was made the ship having three decks those that belonged to the gunnerroom were all to be there and break up the lower deck the english slaves who belonged to the middle deck were to do the same with that and watch the scuttles rawlins himself prevailed with the gunner to give him as much powder as would prime the guns and told them all there was no better watchword than when the signal gun was heard to cry for god and king james and saint george for england then all being prepared and every man resolute knowing what he had to do rawlins advised the gunner to speak to the captain that he might send the soldiers to the poop to bring the ship aft and weighing it down send the water to the pumps this the captain was very willing to do and so at two oclock in the afternoon the signal was given by the firing of the gun whose report tore and broke down all the binnacle and compasses but when the turks heard this and the shouts of the conspirators and saw that part of ship was torn away and felt it shake under them and knew that all threatened their destruction no bear robbed of her whelps was ever so mad as they for they not only called us dogs and cried in their tongue the fortune of war the fortune of war but they tried to tear up the planking setting to work hammers hatchets knives the oars of the boat the boat hook and whatever else came to hand besides the stones and bricks of the cookroom still trying to break the hatches and never ceasing their horrible cries and curses then rawlins seeing them so violent and understanding that the slaves had cleared the decks of all the turks and moors underneath began to shoot at them through different scoutholes with their own muskets and so lessened their number at this they cried for the pilot and so rawlins with some to guard him went to them and understood by their kneeling that they cried for mercy and begged to come down this they were bidden to do but coming down one by one they were taken and slain with their own curtleaxes and the rest perceiving this some of them leapt into the water still crying the fortune of war and calling their foes english dogs and some were slain with the curtleaxes till the decks were well cleared and the victory assured illustration at the first report of the gun and the hurlyburly on deck the captain was writing in his cabin and he came out with his curtleaxe in hand thinking by his authority to quell the mischief but when he saw that the ship was surprised he threw down his curtleaxe and begged rawlins to save his life telling him how he had redeemed him from villa rise and put him in command in the ship besides treating him well through the voyage this rawlins confessed and at last consented to be merciful and brought the captain and five more renegades into england when all was done and the ship cleared of the dead bodies john rawlins assembled his men and with one consent gave the praise to god using the accustomed services on shipboard and for want of books they lifted up their voices to god as he put it into their hearts or renewed their memories then did they sing a psalm and last of all embraced one another for playing the men in such a deliverance whereby their fear was turned into joy that same night they steered for england and arrived at plymouth on february and were welcomed with all gladness as for the ship from dartmouth that had arrived in penzance on february for the english had made the turks believe that they were sailing to argier till they came in sight of england then one of the turks said plainly that the land was not like cape vincent but the englishmen told them to go down into the hold and trim more to windward and they should see and know more tomorrow thereupon five of them went down very orderly while the english feigned themselves asleep but presently they started up and nailed down the hatches and so overpowered the turks and this is the story of this enterprise and the end of john rawlins voyage the chevalier johnstones escape from culloden the chevalier johnstone or de johnstone as he preferred to call himself was closely connected with the highland army hastily collected in for the purpose of restoring charles edward to his grandfathers throne he was aidedecamp to lord george murray generalissimo to the little force and seems to have known enough of warfare to be capable of appreciating his commanders skill he was also a captain in the regiment of the duke of perth and later when the petals of the white rose were trampled under foot he became an officer in the french service from his position therefore he was peculiarly fitted to tell the tale of those two eventful years and though only the son of a merchant johnstone was well connected and like many scottish gentlemen of that day had been bred in loyalty to the jacobite cause he was one of the first to join the prince when he had reached perth and it was from the prince himself that he received his company after the fight at prestonpans his life was all romance but the part on which it is our present purpose to dwell is the account he has left in his memoirs of his escape from the field of culloden and the terrible sufferings he went through for some months till he finally made his way safely to holland the battle of culloden he says was lost rather by a series of mistakes on our part than by any skilful manoeuvre of the duke of cumberland and every scot in arms knew too well the doom that awaited him at the butchers hands the halfstarved highlanders were no match for the wellfed english troops and when the day was lost and the rout became general each man sought to conceal himself in the fastnesses of the nearest mountains and as long as he put himself well out of reach was not particular as to the means he took to purchase safety illustration panics disclose strange and unexpected depths in mens minds and johnstone was in no respect superior to his fellows being no longer able to keep myself on my legs he relates and the enemy always advancing very slowly but redoubling their fire my mind was agitated and undecided whether i should throw away my life or surrender a prisoner which was a thousand times worse than death on the field of battle all at once i perceived a horse about thirty paces before me without a rider the idea of being yet able to escape gave me fresh strength and served as a spur to me i ran and laid hold of the bridle which was fast in the hand of a man lying on the ground whom i supposed dead but what was my surprise when the cowardly poltroon who was suffering from nothing but fear dared to remain in the most horrible fire to dispute the horse with me at twenty paces from the enemy all my menaces could not induce him to quit the bridle whilst we were disputing a discharge from a cannon loaded with grapeshot fell at our feet without however producing any effect upon this singular individual who obstinately persisted in retaining the horse fortunately for me finlay cameron an officer in lochiels regiment a youth of twenty years of age six feet high and very strong and vigorous happened to pass near us i called on him to assist me ah finlay said i this fellow will not give me up the horse finlay flew to me like lightning immediately presented his pistol to the head of this man and threatened to blow out his brains if he hesitated a moment to let go the bridle the fellow who had the appearance of a servant at length yielded and took to his heels having obtained the horse i attempted to mount him several times but all my efforts were ineffectual as i was without strength and completely exhausted i called again on poor finlay though he was already some paces from me to assist me to mount he returned took me in his arms with as much ease as if i had been a child and threw me on the horse like a loaded sack giving the horse at the same time a heavy blow to make him set off with me then wishing that i might have the good fortune to make my escape he bounded off like a roe and was in a moment out of sight we were hardly more than fifteen or twenty paces from the enemy when he quitted me as soon as i found myself at the distance of thirty or forty paces i endeavoured to set myself right on the horse put my feet in the stirrups and rode off as fast as the wretched animal could carry me illustration there is something peculiarly funny in the simplicity of this account of horsestealing with violence why a man should be more of a coward who clings to his own property and only means of safety than the person who deliberately deprives him of both is not easy to see but johnstone never doubts for one moment that what he does is always right and what anyone else does is always wrong and he goes on complacently to remark that he probably saved the life of the poltroon who held the horse in rousing him out of his panic fear for in less than two minutes the english army would have passed over him the shelter which johnstone made up his mind to seek was the castle of rothiemurchus the property of the grant family situated in the heart of the mountains and on the banks of the rapid spey but his troubles were not so easily over the english army barred the way and johnstone was forced to take the road to inverness again he was turned from his path by the dreaded sight of the british uniform and accompanied by a highlander whom he had met by chance he took refuge in a small cottage in fort augustus in spite of his peculiar views about courage johnstone was a man who generally managed to do whatever he had set his heart on he had resolved to go to rothiemurchus and to rothiemurchus he would go at last he arrived there but found to his great disappointment that the laird his old friend was away from home in his place was his eldest son who was urgent that johnstone should surrender himself a prisoner as lord balmerino had just done by his advice and under his escort johnstone replied that he would keep his liberty as long as he could and when it was no longer possible he would meet his fate with resignation we all know the end to which poor balmerino came but johnstone was more fortunate illustration his brotherinlaw the son of lord rollo had been made inspector of merchant ships in the town of banff and johnstone fondly hoped that by his help he might obtain a passage to some foreign country so he set off with three gentlemen of the name of gordon who had also been staying at rothiemurchus and rested the first night at the house of a shepherd near the mountain of cairngorm here he saw for the first time the stones which bear this name and though he is flying for his life he dwells with the delight of a collector on the beauty of the colours and even persuades his friends to put off their departure for a day in order that he may search for some specimens himself he contrived he tells us to find several beautiful topazes two of which he had cut as seals and presented to the duke of york brother of prince charles edward four days after leaving rothiemurchus banff was reached and the fugitives were sheltered by a presbyterian minister who was a secret adherent of the stuarts johnstone at once took the precaution of exchanging his laced highland dress for that of an old labourer quite ragged and exhaling a pestilential odour due apparently to its having been used for many years when he cleaned the stables of his master in this unpleasant disguise he entered the town of banff then garrisoned with four hundred english soldiers and went straight to the house of a former acquaintance mr duff after gaining admittance from the servant with some difficulty he found with dismay that his brotherinlaw was away from home and he could not therefore carry out his plan of embarking with his permission on board one of the merchant ships there seemed nothing for it therefore but for johnstone to return at daybreak to the house of mr gordon where he had spent the previous night at daybreak however he was roused by a fearful disturbance in the courtyard below occasioned by the quarrels of some stray soldiers for a moment he thought death was certain but the soldiers had no suspicion of his presence in the house and as soon as they had settled their affairs took themselves off elsewhere mr rollo proved a broken reed and the chevalier found after a few minutes talk with his brotherinlaw that if he wished to reach the continent he must not count on a passage in the merchant ships to help him he therefore after consultation with his friends came to the conclusion that his best plan was to make for the lowlands and to this end he set out for edinburgh as soon as possible of course this scheme was beset with difficulties and dangers of every kind the counties through which he would be forced to pass were filled with calvinists inspired with deadly hatred of the jacobite party to escape their hands was almost certainly to fall into those of the soldiery and over and above this government passports were necessary for those who desired to cross the firths of forth and tay but nothing daunted johnstone went his way he was passed in disguise from one house to another wellfed at the lowest possible prices he tells us of the landlady of a small inn who charged him threepence for an excellent young fowl and his bed till at last he found himself in the region of cortachy the country of the ogilvies who one and all were on the side of the prince at cortachy he was quite secure as long as no english soldiery came by and even if they did the mountains were full of hiding places and there was no risk of treachery at home two officers who had served in the french army brown and gordon by name had sought refuge here before him and lay concealed in the house of a peasant known as samuel they implored him not to run the risk of proceeding south till affairs had quieted down a little and he agreed to remain at samuels cottage till it seemed less dangerous to travel south it would be interesting to know what was the gratification beyond his hopes which johnstone gave samuel when they parted company some time after it ought to have been something very handsome considering the risks which the peasant had run in his behalf and also the fact that for several weeks johnstone and his two friends had shared the scanty fare of samuel and his family they had no other food than oatmeal and no other drink than the water of the stream which ran through the glen we breakfasted every morning on a piece of oatmeal bread which we were enabled to swallow by draughts of water for dinner we boiled oatmeal with water till it acquired a consistency and we ate it with horn spoons in the evening we poured boiling water on this meal in a dish for our supper even this frugal diet could not be swallowed long in peace for shortly after their arrival samuels daughter who lived at the mouth of the glen came to inform her father that some english troops had been seen in the neighbourhood and whenever there was any chance of their appearing in the glen johnstone and his friends had to take refuge in the mountains one day this woman arrived with the news that the soldiery were hovering dangerously near and had taken several notable prisoners upon this the fugitives decided to leave their shelter at daybreak the following morning and to make the best of their way to the highlands where they would be sure of finding some rocks and caverns to hide them from their foes this resolution once taken they all went early to bed and there johnstone had a dream which he relates with many apologies for his superstition he fancied himself in edinburgh safe from the snares of his enemies and with no fears for the future and describing his adventures and escapes since the battle of culloden to his old friend lady jane douglas the impression of peace and happiness and relief from anxiety was so strong that it remained with him after he woke and after lying turning the matter over in his mind for another hour informed samuel who had come to rouse him with the intelligence that his companions had already set off for the mountains that he had altered his plans and intended to go straight to edinburgh in vain the old man argued and entreated johnstone was determined and that same evening he set forth on horseback with samuel for his guide and made straight for the nearest arm of the sea which he describes though quite wrongly as being only eight miles from cortachy to reach this they were obliged to pass through forfar a town which being a calvinistic stronghold the chevalier can never mention without an abusive epithet but here poor samuel whose nerves had doubtless been strained by the perpetual watching and waiting of the last few weeks was frightened out of his senses by the barking of a dog and tried to throw himself from his horse at this juncture johnstone who knew that to be left without a guide in this strange place meant certain death interfered promptly he was continually struggling to get down he says but i prevented him by the firm hold i had of his coat i exhorted him to be quiet i reproached him i alternately entreated and menaced him but all in vain he no longer knew what he was about and it was to no purpose i assured him that it was only the barking of a dog he perspired at every pore and trembled like a person in an ague fortunately i had an excellent horse and galloped through forfar at full speed retaining always fast hold of his coat as soon as we were fairly out of the town as no persons had come out of their houses poor samuel began to breathe again and made a thousand apologies for his fears as the day broke and they drew near broughty ferry where johnstone intended to cross the firth of tay the chevalier dismounted and being obliged to part from his horse offered it as a present to samuel who declined the animal from motives of prudence it was then turned loose in a field the saddle and bridle being first thrown down a well and the wayfarers proceeded on their way only a few minutes later they were joined by an acquaintance of samuels who seems to have been of a curious turn of mind and crossquestioned him as to where he was going and why samuel with more readiness than could have been expected from his recent behaviour invented a story that sounded plausible enough explaining johnstone to be a young man whom he had picked up on the road and had taken into his service at low wages owing to his want of a character the stranger was satisfied and after a prolonged drink they separated when samuel informed johnstone that the man was one of the greatest knaves and cheats in the country and that they would assuredly have been betrayed if he had discovered who they were illustration they arrived at the ferry about nine in the morning and by samuels advice the chevalier immediately sought the help of mr graham a gentleman of jacobite family then living at duntroon after a warm welcome from mr graham who gave him all the entertainment he could without the knowledge of his servants a boat was engaged to convey him across the firth about nine that night mr graham did not however dare to be his guide down to the seashore but gave him careful directions as to his following an old woman who had been provided for this purpose but all mr grahams precautions would have been useless had not chance once more favoured the chevalier his protectress decided that it would be dangerous to allow him to loiter about the shore while the boat was getting ready for sea so she told her charge to wait for her on the road on top of the hill and she would return and fetch him when all was ready half an hour passed very slowly the sun was sinking and the chevalier grew impatient he left the road by which he had been sitting and lay down in a furrow a few yards off nearer the brow of the hill so that he might perceive his guide at the earliest moment scarcely had he changed his quarters than he heard the sound of horses and peeping cautiously out saw eight or ten horsemen pass in the very place he had just quitted no sooner were they out of sight than the old woman arrived trembling with fright ah she exclaimed in a transport of joy i did not expect to find you here she then explained that the horsemen were english dragoons and that they had so threatened the boatmen engaged by mr graham that they absolutely refused to fulfil their compact this was a terrible blow to the chevalier but he declined to listen to the old womans advice and return for shelter to mr graham and after much persuasion induced his guide to show him the way to the publichouse by the seashore here he was welcomed by the landlady whose son had been likewise out with the prince but neither her entreaties nor those of the chevalier could move the boatmen from their resolution they even resisted the prayers of the landladys two beautiful daughters till the girls disgusted and indignant with such cowardice offered to row him across themselves we left broughty ferry he writes in his memoirs at ten oclock in the evening and reached the opposite shore about midnight he then took an affectionate leave of his preservers and proceeded footsore as he was to walk to st andrews at this time johnstone seems to have felt more physically exhausted than at almost any other moment of his travels and it was only by dint of perpetually washing his sore and bleeding feet in the streams he passed that he managed to reach st andrews towards eight oclock he at once made his way to the house of his cousin mrs spence who herself a suspected person was much taken aback by the sight of him and hastily sent a letter to a tenant farmer living near the town to provide the fugitive with a horse which would carry him to wemyss a seaport town on the way to edinburgh the old university city does not appear to have made a favourable impression on the chevalier he declares that no town ever deserved so much the fate of sodom and gomorrah and this not from any particular wickedness on the part of the inhabitants but because they were supposed to be calvinists however his sentiments must have been confirmed when the farmer declined to take his horses out on a sunday and lame as he was johnstone had no choice but to set out on foot for wemyss halfway he suddenly remembered that close by lived an old servant of his family married to the gardener of mr beaton of balfour here he was housed and fed for twenty hours and then conducted by his host a rigid presbyterian to a tavern at wemyss kept by the motherinlaw of the gardener by her advice they applied to a man named salmon who though a rabid hanoverian could be trusted not to betray those who had faith in him it was hard work to gain over salmon who was proof against bribery but at last it was done by his recommendation johnstone was to lie till dawn in a cave near wemyss a place whose name means caves and with the first ray of light was to beg a passage to leith from some men who were with salmon part owners of a boat in this cave which notwithstanding its narrow entrance was deep and spacious the chevalier was glad to repose his weary bones but after dozing about an hour he was awakened by the most horrible and alarming cries that ever were heard his first thought was that salmon had betrayed him and he retreated to the interior of the cavern cocked his pistol and prepared to sell his life dearly soon however the swift movements accompanying the noise convinced him that it did not proceed from men for sometimes the object was about my ears and nearly stunned me and in an instant at a considerable distance at length i ceased to examine any more this horrible and incomprehensible phenomenon which made a noise in confusion like that of a number of trumpets and drums with a mixture of different sounds altogether unknown to me effectually aroused by the whining of the owls and bats for these of course were the authors of all this disturbance johnstone fixed his eyes on the sea to note the first entrance of the fishing boats into the harbour he then went down to the shore and began to make the bargain as directed by salmon and the fishermen agreed to land him at leith for halfacrown but alas once more his hopes were blighted he was in the act of stepping into the boat when salmons wife appeared on the scene and forbade her husband to go to leith that day still less to take a stranger there neither salmon nor johnstone dared insist for fear of rousing the womans suspicions and after a short retreat in the cave in order to collect his thoughts he returned to the tavern at wemyss to consult with the friendly landlady thanks to her and with the help of one or two people to whom she introduced him johnstone at last arrived at the house of one mr seton whose son had formerly served with johnstone in the army of the prince here he remained eight days vainly seeking to find a second man who could aid the fisherman who had already promised to put him across though it does not appear why johnstone who had already observed that he was able to row did not take an oar when his own head was at stake illustration at last affairs were brought to a crisis by rumours having got abroad of the presence of a fugitive on the coast things seemed in a desperate condition when young seton threw himself into the breach and agreed to help cousselain the fisherman to take the chevalier to leith they were actually launching the boat when the inhabitants of the village alarmed by the noise they made raised a cry that a rebel was escaping and the two oarsmen had barely time to conceal themselves without being discovered however in flat defiance of everyones advice and as it turned out in spite of the drunken state of cousselain johnstone resolved to repeat the attempt in an hours time taking in the end as he might have done at the beginning his place at the oar for a few moments they breathed freely then the wind got up and the waves and what was perhaps more dangerous the drunken cousselain who had been placed in the bottom of the boat we were obliged to kick him most unmercifully in order to keep him quiet observes johnstone and to threaten to throw him overboard if he made the least movement seton and myself rowed like galley slaves we succeeded in landing about six in the morning on a part of the coast a league and a half to the east of edinburgh near the battlefield of gladsmuir here he parted with his deliverers tenderly embracing young seton and presenting to the somewhat sober cousselain a gratification beyond his hopes after taking a little of the food with which mr seton had provided him he determined to seek refuge for a few days with an old governess mrs blythe wife of a small shipowner at leith blythe himself was another of the many rigid calvinists and sworn enemies of the house of stuart to whom johnstone entrusted his safety during his wanderings and never once had occasion to repent it mr blythe indeed combined the profession of calvinist with that of smuggler and had numerous hiding places in his house for the concealment of contraband goods which would prove equally serviceable as johnstone told him for the most contraband and dangerous commodity that he had ever had in his possession though johnstone had reached the goal of his desires his perils were by no means at an end english soldiers visited the house and could with difficulty be persuaded to admit the exemption pleaded by mr blythe in consequence of this event johnstone accepted the offer of an asylum made him by lady jane douglas in her place at drumsheugh half a league away so his dream came true and after all his wanderings he was safe with lady jane telling the story of his adventures he remained with her for two months unknown to anyone but his hostess and the gardener reading all day and only taking a walk at night when the household was in bed at the end of that time when lady jane and his father were of opinion that he might safely go to london and thence abroad fresh rumours as to his whereabouts began to arise and fearing the immediate visit of a detachment of english soldiers he was concealed for a whole day under a huge haycock so overcome by the heat that he could hardly breathe in spite of a bottle of water and another of wine with which he was provided this measure which after all was needless for no soldiers came was the last trial he had to undergo before leaving scotland and here we must part from him in france which he made his home he became the friend of many eminent men and was aidedecamp in canada to the marquis de montcalm but the end of his life was sad and he died in poverty footnotes p p p p p p p p p p from memoirs of the chevalier de johnstone longmans london the memoirs were written in french and deposited in the scots college at paris they were communicated to messrs longman by robert watson the adventurer who under napoleon was principal of the scots college the chevalier left a granddaughter who corresponded on the subject of the memoirs with sir walter scott the adventures of lord pitsligo when prince charles came to scotland in to seek his grandfathers crown no braver and no better man rode with him than lord pitsligo he was now sixtyseven years of age for he was born in ten years before james ii was driven out of england as a young man he had lived much in france where he became the friend of the famous fnelon author of tlmaque though much interested in the doctrines of fnelon lord pitsligo did not change his faith but remained a member of the persecuted episcopal church of scotland in france he met the members of the exiled royal family whom he never ceased to regard as his lawful monarchs though queen anne and later the first and second georges occupied the throne of england when the clans rose for king james the son of james ii in lord pitsligo then a man of twentyseven joined the forces under his kinsman lord marr his party was defeated and he went abroad he did not stay long with james in rome but was allowed to return to his estates in scotland here he lived very quietly beloved by rich and poor but in prince charles landed and the old lord believed it to be his duty to join him he had as he says no keen enthusiasm for the stuarts but to his mind they were his lawful rulers so aged was he and so infirm that when he left a neighbours house before setting out a little boy brought a stool to help him to mount his horse my little fellow he said this is the severest reproof i have yet met with for presuming to go on such an expedition lady pitsligo in vain reminded him of the failure of there never was a bridal he replied but the second day was the best the gentlemen of his county thought that they could not do wrong in following so learned and excellent a man so they all mounted the white cockade and rode with him he arrived just too late for the victory of preston pans it seemed said an eyewitness as if religion virtue and justice were entering the camp under the appearance of this venerable old man when he wrote home he said i had occasion to discover the princes humanity i ought to say tenderness this is giving myself no great airs for he showed the same dispositions to everybody in the fatigues of the campaign the prince who was young and strong insisted on lord pitsligos using his carriage while he himself marched on foot at the head of his army illustration after the defeat of culloden lord pitsligo hid among the mountains living on oatmeal moistened with hot water they had not even salt to their brose for as one of the highlanders said salt is touchy meaning expensive yet these men who could not even buy salt never betrayed their prince for the great reward of thirty thousand pounds nor any of the other gentlemen in hiding possibly they did not believe that there was so much money in the world lord pitsligo had made up his mind not to go abroad again but to live or die among his own people at one time he lay for days hidden in a damp hole under a little bridge and at other times concealed himself in the mosses and moors here the lapwings flitting and crying above him were like to have drawn the english soldiers to his retreat his wife gave him two great bags like those which beggars carried in these he would place the alms which were given to him and in this disguise he had many narrow escapes once he saw some dragoons on the road behind him but he was too old and too ill to run he was obliged to sit down and cough and one of the dragoons who were in search of him actually gave him some money as they passed by and condoled with him on the severity of his cough illustration lord pitsligo often hid in a cave on the coast of buchan here was a spring of water welling through the rock and he carved a little cistern for it to pass the time he was fed by a little girl too young to be suspected who carried his meals from a neighbouring farm one day he was sitting in the kitchen of the farm when some soldiers came in and asked the goodwife to guide them to lord pitsligos cave she said that travelling body will go with you and lord pitsligo conducted the soldiers to his hiding place left them there and walked back to the farm but the following adventure was perhaps his narrowest escape in march and of course long after all apprehension of a search had ceased information having been given to the then commanding officer at fraserburgh that lord pitsligo was at that moment in the house of auchiries it was acted upon with so much promptness and secrecy that the search must have proved successful but for a very singular occurrence mrs sophia donaldson a lady who lived much with the family repeatedly dreamt on that particular night that the house was surrounded by soldiers her mind became so haunted with the idea that she got out of bed and was walking through the room in hopes of giving a different current to her thoughts before she lay down again when day beginning to dawn she accidentally looked out at the window as she passed it in traversing the room and was astonished at actually observing the figures of soldiers among some trees near the house so completely had all idea of a search been by that time laid asleep that she supposed they had come to steal poultry jacobite poultryyards affording a safe object of pillage for the english soldiers in those days under this impression mrs sophia was proceeding to rouse the servants when her sister having awaked and inquiring what was the matter and being told of soldiers near the house exclaimed in great alarm that she feared they wanted something more than hens she begged mrs sophia to look out at a window on the other side of the house when not only soldiers were seen in that direction but also an officer giving instructions by signals and frequently putting his fingers on his lips as if enjoining silence there was now no time to be lost in rousing the family and all the haste that could be made was scarcely sufficient to hurry the venerable man from his bed into a small recess behind the wainscot of an adjoining room which was concealed by a bed in which a lady miss gordon of towie who was there on a visit lay before the soldiers obtained admission a most minute search took place the room in which lord pitsligo was concealed did not escape miss gordons bed was carefully examined and she was obliged to suffer the rude scrutiny of one of the party by feeling her chin to ascertain that it was not a man in a ladys nightdress before the soldiers had finished their examination in this room the confinement and anxiety increased lord pitsligos asthma so much and his breathing became so loud that it obliged miss gordon lying in bed to counterfeit and continue a violent coughing in order to prevent the high breathing behind the wainscot from being heard it may easily be conceived what agony she would suffer lest by overdoing her part she should increase suspicion and in fact lead to a discovery the ruse was fortunately successful on the search through the house being given over lord pitsligo was hastily taken from his confined situation and again replaced in bed and as soon as he was able to speak his accustomed kindness of heart made him say to his servant james go and see that these poor fellows get some breakfast and a drink of warm ale for this is a cold morning they are only doing their duty and cannot bear me any illwill when the family were felicitating each other on his escape he pleasantly observed a poor prize had they obtained it an old dying man that the friends who lived in the house the hourly witnesses of his virtues and the objects of his regard who saw him escape all the dangers that surrounded him should reckon him the peculiar care of providence is not to be wondered at and that the dream which was so opportune as the means of preventing his apprehension and probably of saving his life was supposed by some of them at last to be a special interposition of heavens protecting shield against his enemies need not excite surprise this was accordingly the belief of more than one to their dying hour illustration after some fifteen years the english government ceased to think lord pitsligo dangerous he was allowed to live unmolested at the house of his son where he died in in his eightyfifth year he was never heard to speak an ill word of any man living says one who knew him well and who himself spoke many ill words of others lord pitsligo left a little book of thoughts on sacred things which reminds those who read it of the meditations of general gordon his character as far as its virtues went is copied in the baron bradwardine in sir walter scotts novel of waverley footnotes dr king of st marys hall oxford from thoughts concerning mans condition and duties in this life by alexander lord pitsligo edinburgh blackwood the escape of csar borgia from the castle of medina del campo csar borgia forms with his father pope alexander vi and his sister lucrezia one of a trio who have become a proverb for infamy of every kind his father roderigo was by birth a spaniard and by education a lawyer in which profession he gained much distinction till suddenly with an impetuosity strange in a man who did everything by calculation he threw up his legal career for that of a soldier but the rough life was repugnant to one of his temperament which demanded ease and luxury so after a little active service when his courage during some sharp engagements was proved beyond a doubt he abandoned the army also and retired to live in comfort on the large fortune lately bequeathed to him by his father it required some pressing on the part of his uncle calixtus iii recently made pope to induce him to leave his native land and his secular existence for italy and a cardinalate but no sooner did he occupy his new position than a set of base qualities which had hitherto lain dormant suddenly developed themselves and from this moment he became one of the cleverest and most successful hypocrites of his age it was in the year that saw the landing of columbus in america and the death of lorenzo the magnificent at florence that the cardinal borgia obtained by means of huge bribes his election to the papal throne and took the name of alexander vi his first care was to establish for his own credits sake order and security in rome and this done he turned his thoughts to the aggrandisement of his family for when roderigo sailed for italy he was shortly followed by his four children francis csar lucrezia and geoffrey and their mother rosa vanozza all four but more particularly csar and lucrezia inherited in the highest degree their fathers beauty talents and wickedness honours of every kind were showered upon them marriages made and unmade to suit the requirements of the moment murders committed to ensure them wealth and possessions for eleven years the roll of crime grew heavier day by day till at last the chastisement came and the borgias who had invited several of the cardinals to supper for the purpose of poisoning them and seizing on their revenues were themselves served with the draught they had intended for their guests the pope died after eight days in mortal agony but owing to his having drunk less of the wine csar slowly recovered and resumed his old trade of arms the talents which had made him one of the first captains in italy caused him to be the dread of all his enemies and finally led to his capture by violation of a safeconduct at the hands of gonsalvo de cordova captain of the forces of ferdinand of spain it was in june that csar borgia general of the church and duke of romagna and valentinois was conducted to the castle of medina del campo in spain for two years csar waited in prison hoping that his old ally louis xii whose cousin mlle dalbret he had married would come to his assistance but he waited in vain and his courage began to give way when one day something happened which proved to him that he had still one friend left his faithful michelotto a soldier of fortune who had followed him to spain and was now hidden in the neighbourhood of the prison it was breakfast time and csar was in the act of cutting his bread when he suddenly touched a hard substance and found a file and a small bottle containing a narcotic and a note concealed in the loaf the note was from michelotto and informed csar that he and the count of benevento would hide themselves every night on the road between the castle and the village in company with three good horses and that he must make the best use he could of the file and the sleeping draught two years imprisonment had weighed too heavily on csar for him to waste a single moment in trying to regain his freedom he therefore lost no time in beginning to work on one of the bars of his window which opened on an inside court and soon contrived to cut through so far that a violent shake would enable him to remove it altogether but the window was nearly seventy feet above the ground while the only way of leaving the court was by a door reserved for the governor alone the key of which was always carried about his person by day it was suspended from his belt by night it was under his bolster to gain possession of this key was the most difficult part of the matter now in spite of the fact that he was a prisoner csar had invariably been treated with all the respect due to his name and rank every day at the dinner hour he was conducted from the room in which he was confined to the governors apartments and was received by him as an honoured guest don manuel himself was an old soldier who had served with distinction under ferdinand and while carrying out punctually his orders for csars safe custody he admired his military talents and listened with pleasure to the story of his fights he had often desired that csar should breakfast as well as dine with him but luckily for himself the prisoner perhaps aided by some presentiment had always refused this favour it was owing to his solitude that he was able to conceal the instruments for his escape sent by michelotto now it happened that the very same day that he had received them csar contrived to stumble and twist his foot as he was returning to his room when the hour of dinner came he tried to go down but declared that walking hurt him so much that he should be obliged to give it up so the governor paid him a visit instead and found him stretched on his bed the next day csar was no better his dinner was ordered to be served upstairs and the governor paid him a visit as before he found his prisoner so dull and bored with his own company that he offered to come and share his supper csar accepted the offer with gratitude and joy this time it was the prisoner who did the honours of the table and csar was particularly charming and courteous in manner the governor seized the opportunity of putting some questions as to his capture and inquired with the pride of a castilian noble who set honour above all what was the exact truth as to the way in which gonsalvo de cordova and ferdinand had broken their faith with him csar showed every disposition to give him satisfaction on this point but indicated by a sign that he could not speak freely before the valets this precaution was so natural that the governor could not seem offended at it and dismissed his attendants so that he and his companion remained alone when the door was shut csar filled his glass and that of the governor and proposed the kings health the governor emptied his glass at once and csar began his story but he had hardly told a third of it when in spite of its exciting adventures the eyes of his guest closed as if by magic and his head fell on the table in a deep sleep at the end of halfanhour the servants not hearing any noise entered the room and found the two boon companions one on the table and the other under it there was nothing very unusual about such an event to excite their suspicions so they contented themselves with carrying don manuel to his chamber and laying csar on his bed they then locked the door with great care leaving the prisoner alone illustration for a minute or two longer csar lay still apparently plunged in a profound slumber but when the sound of footsteps had completely died away he softly raised his head opened his eyes and moved towards the door rather slowly it is true but without seeming to feel any illeffects from his accident on the previous day he stood still for a few seconds with his ear at the keyhole then raising himself with a strange expression of triumph on his face he passed his hand over his forehead and for the first time since the guards had left the room breathed freely but there was no time to be lost and without a moments delay he fastened the door from the inside as securely as it was fastened without he next extinguished his lamp threw open his window and finished cutting through the bar this done he took off the bandages tied round his leg tore down the curtains both of his window and his bed and made them into strips adding to them sheets table cloths napkins and whatever else he could lay hands on at last he had a rope between fifty and sixty feet long which he secured firmly at one end to the bar next to the one that he had sawn away and mounting on the windowledge he began the most dangerous part of his expedition in trusting himself to this frail support happily csar was as strong as he was agile and slid down the whole length of the cord without accident but when he had reached the very end in vain he tried to touch the earth with his feet the rope was too short csars position was terrible the darkness of the night preventing his knowing how far he might be above the ground and his exertions had so fatigued him that he could not have gone back even had he wished there was no help for it and after muttering a short prayer he let go the rope and fell a distance of twelve or fifteen feet the danger he had escaped was too great for the fugitive to mind some slight bruises caused by his fall so he jumped up and taking his bearings made straight for the little door which stood between him and freedom when he reached it he felt in his pocket for the key and a cold sweat broke out on his face as he found it was not there had he forgotten it in his room or had he lost it in his descent collecting his thoughts as well as he could he soon came to the conclusion that it must have fallen out of his pocket as he climbed down the rope so he made his way a second time cautiously across the court trying to discover the exact spot where it might be by the aid of the wall of a cistern which he had caught hold of to raise himself from the ground but the lost key was so small and so insignificant that there was little chance that he would ever see it however it was his last resource and csar was searching for it with all his might when suddenly a door opened and the night patrol came out preceded by two torches at first csar gave himself up for lost then remembering the waterbutt that was behind him he at once plunged into it up to his neck watching with intense anxiety the movements of the soldiers who were advancing towards his hiding place they passed him within a few feet crossed the court and vanished through the door opposite but though all this had taken such a very short time the light of the torches had enabled csar to distinguish the key lying on the ground and hardly had the gate closed on the soldiers when he was once more master of his liberty halfway between the castle and the village the count of benevento and michelotto awaited him with a led horse csar flung himself on its back and all three set out for navarre where after three days hard riding they found an asylum with the king jean dalbret brother of csars wife footnote what follows is translated from dumas the kidnapping of the princes the following story is adapted from carlyles essay the prinzenraub about the year one of the electors of saxony friedrich der sanftmtige frederick the mild quarrelled with a certain knight named konrad von kaufungen friedrich had hired konrad or kunz as he was called to fight for him in a war against another elector in one of the battles kunz was taken prisoner to ransom himself he was obliged to pay gold gulden for which he thought friedrich ought to repay him friedrich refused to do so as kunz was not his vassal whom he was bound to protect but only a hired soldier who had to take all risks on himself kunz was very angry and threatened to revenge himself on the elector who took all his threats very calmly saying to him keep cool kunz dont burn the fish in the ponds but kunz was in bitter earnest he went away to an old castle called isenburg in bohemia on the saxon frontier where he lived for some time with his two squires mosen and schnberg plotting against the elector and his family he had moreover bribed one of the electors servants hans schwalbe to tell him all that was being done in his castle of altenburg in july schwalbe sent word to him that on the seventh day of the month the elector and most of his followers were going away to leipzig and would leave the electress and his two boys ernst and albrecht guarded only by a few servants and these he added would probably spend the evening drinking in the town now the castle of altenburg was built on a steep hill and one side of it overhung a precipice as this side was little guarded hans agreed to let down a ropeladder from one of the windows and thus enable kunz to get an entrance into the castle his plan then was to make his way to the sleeping room of the two little princes carry them off to his castle at isenburg and keep them till their father should grant his demands isenburg castle was about a days journey from the little town of altenburg so kunz and his two squires mosen and schnberg and a few other men started early on the th to ride to altenburg and when they reached it they hid themselves till nightfall about midnight kunz and his men went as quietly as possible to the foot of the cliff everyone seemed asleep in the castle and outside no sound was to be heard but the stealthy tramp of the armed men when they reached the rendezvous under the castle kunz gave his men their orders mosen schnberg and three or four more were to come with him into the castle and when inside to lock the doors of the electresss and the servants room while the rest were to guard the gates in order that no one should escape to give the alarm each was to be ready when once the princes were secured to ride away for isenburg as hard as possible then kunz whistled softly he listened for a moment another whistle answered his own and a ropeladder was slowly lowered from one of the windows kunz mounted it and made his way to the room where the two little princes were sleeping under the charge of an old governess he seized the eldest a boy of fourteen and carried him down the ladder and mosen followed with a second child in his arms this boy kept calling out i am not one of the princes i am their playfellow count von bardi let me go let me go thereupon telling the others to ride on with prince ernst in order to secure him kunz dashed up the ladder again and ran to the princes room where he found little prince albrecht hiding under the bed he caught him up and descended again with him as he went the electress roused by the boys cries and finding her door bolted rushed to the window and begged and implored him not to take her children my husband shall grant all your demands i swear to you she cried only leave me my children tell the elector madam laughed kunz looking up that i can burn the fish in the ponds then he mounted his horse which his servant was holding and away they rode as fast as the horses would carry them they had not ridden many miles before the clang of bells broke on their ears the alarm peal of the castle had awakened that of the town and in a few hours every bell in every belfry in saxony was ringing an alarm the sun rose and kunz and his followers plunged deeper into the forest riding through morasses and swamps over rough and stony ground anywhere to escape from the din of those alarm bells at last the ride for dear life was nearly over the band was within an hours journey of the castle of isenburg when prince albrecht declared that he was dying of thirst for the love of heaven give me something to drink sir knight he implored kunz bade the others ride on and giving his squire his horse to hold he dismounted lifted albrecht down and began looking for bilberries for him whilst he was doing so a charcoalburner with his dog came up he was much surprised to see such grand people in the forest and asked what are you doing with the young lord he has run away from his parents answered kunz impatiently can you tell me where bilberries are to be found here i do not know replied the charcoalburner still staring at the strangers anxious to make him leave them kunz turned angrily round on him and in doing so caught his spurs in the bushes and fell flat on his face albrecht caught hold of the charcoalburners arm save me he whispered eagerly i am the electors son this man has stolen me the squire struck at the prince with his sword but the charcoalburner warded aside the blow with his long pole and felled the man to the ground kunz fought fiercely with him but in answer to his summons for help and attracted by the barking of the dog a number of other charcoalburners appeared on the scene to help their comrade and kunz was disarmed and taken prisoner they marched him in triumph to the monastery of grnheim where he was secured in one of the cells and in a few days was sent to freiburg on the th he was tried and condemned to death it is said that a pardon was sent by the elector but if it were so it arrived too late and kunz was beheaded the rest of the robberband with prince ernst did not fare much better the alarm bells had aroused the whole country six of the men were captured and mosen and the others with prince ernst took refuge in a cave near zwickau not daring to venture out and half starving for want of food they lay there for three days in wretched plight then they learned accidentally from some woodmen whose conversation they overheard that kunz had been taken prisoner had been tried and by this time was in all probability beheaded as soon as they received this piece of intelligence they held a consultation and finally decided to send a message to the amtmann of zwickau offering to restore prince ernst if a free pardon were granted to them but threatening if this was refused they would at once kill him had they known that kunz was still alive they might have stipulated for his pardon as well but believing him dead they made no terms as regards his fate the amtmann had no choice but to accede to their demands when their proposal reached him prince ernst was given up mosen and the rest fled away nor were they ever heard of any more illustration when the brave charcoalburner georg schmidt was brought before the elector and his court the electress asked him how he had dared to fight the robberknight with no weapon but his pole madam he replied i gave him a sound drilling with my pole all the court laughed and thenceforward he was always called georg der triller the driller and his descendants took this name as their surname the only reward he would accept for his brave deed was leave for himself and his family to cut what wood they needed in the forest in which he lived the electress and the two princes made a pilgrimage to the shrine at the monastery of ebersdorf and there in the church they hung up the coats which they and kunz and the triller had worn on the memorable night when they were kidnapped and there it is said they may be seen at this day the conquest of montezumas empire the youth of corts long ago when henry viii was king of england and charles v was king of spain there lived a young spanish cavalier whose name was hernando corts his father don martin corts sent him to salamanca when he was about fourteen years old intending to have him educated as a lawyer but hernando cared nothing for books and after wasting two years at college returned home to the great annoyance of his parents who were glad enough when after another year of idleness he proposed to go and seek his fortune in the new world so lately discovered by columbus an exploring expedition was just being fitted out and hernando corts had quite made up his mind to join it when he unluckily fell from a high wall which he was climbing and before he had recovered from his injuries the ships had sailed without him two more years did he remain at home after this misadventure but at length when he was nineteen years old he joined a small fleet bound for the indian islands the vessel in which he sailed was commanded by one alonso quintero who when they reached the canary islands and all the other vessels were detained by taking in supplies stole out of the harbour under cover of the night meaning to reach hispaniola before his companions and so secure a better chance of trading however he met with a furious storm and was driven back to the port with his ship dismasted and battered the rest of the fleet generously consented to wait while his ship was being refitted and after a short delay they set out again but so soon as they neared the islands the faithless quintero again gave his companions the slip but with no better success for he met with such heavy gales that he entirely lost his reckoning and for many days they tossed about helplessly until one morning they were cheered by the sight of a white dove which settled upon the rigging taking the direction of the birds flight they soon reached hispaniola where the captain had the satisfaction of finding all the other ships had arrived before him and had sold all their cargoes corts as soon as he landed went to see ovando the governor of the island whom he had known in spain and presently was persuaded by him to accept a grant of land and settle down to cultivate it though at first he said i came to get gold not to till the ground like a peasant so six years passed during which the monotony of cortss life was only broken by occasional expeditions against the natives in which he learned to endure toil and danger and became familiar with the tactics of indian warfare at length in when diego velasquez the governors lieutenant undertook the conquest of cuba corts gladly accompanied him and throughout the expedition made himself a favourite both with the commander and the soldiers but when later on there arose discontent over the distribution of lands and offices the malcontents fixed upon corts as the most suitable person to go back to hispaniola and lay their grievances before the higher authorities this came to the ears of velasquez however and he at once seized corts whom he loaded with fetters and threw into prison luckily he soon succeeded in freeing himself from the irons and letting himself down from the window took refuge in the nearest church where he claimed the right of sanctuary velasquez who was very angry at his escape stationed a guard with orders to seize corts if he should leave the sanctuary and this he was soon careless enough to do as he stood outside the church an officer suddenly sprang upon him from behind and made him prisoner once more this time he was carried on board a ship which was to sail the next morning for hispaniola where he was to be tried but again he managed to escape by dragging his feet through the rings which fettered them and dropping silently over the ships side into a little boat under cover of the darkness as he neared the shore the water became so rough that the boat was useless and he was forced to swim the rest of the way but at last he got safely to land and again took refuge in the church after this he married a lady named catalina xuarez and by the aid of her family managed to make his peace with velasquez corts now received a large estate near st jago where he lived prosperously for some years and even amassed a considerable sum of money but at last news came of an exploring expedition which had set out in under grijalva the nephew of velasquez he had touched at various places on the mexican coast and had held a friendly conference with one cacique or chief who seemed desirous of collecting all the information he could about the spaniards and their motives in visiting mexico that he might transmit it to his master the aztec emperor presents were exchanged at this interview and in return for a few glass beads pins and such paltry trifles the spaniards had received such a rich treasure of jewels and gold ornaments that the general at once sent back one of his ships under the command of don pedro de alvarado to convey the spoil and acquaint the governor of cuba with the progress of the expedition and also with all the information he had been able to glean respecting the aztec emperor and his dominions now in those days nothing whatever was known about the interior of the country or of its inhabitants it was as strange to the explorers as another planet the wonders of mexico this was what they had to tell the governor far away towards the pacific ocean there stood in a beautiful and most fertile valley the capital of a great and powerful empire called by its inhabitants tenochtitlan but known to the europeans only by its other name of mexico derived from mexitli the wargod of the aztecs these aztecs seem to have come originally from the north and after many wanderings to have halted at length on the southwestern borders of a great lake of which there were several in the mexican valley this celebrated valley was situated at a height of about feet above the sea and was oval in form about leagues in circumference and surrounded by towering rocks which seemed to be meant to protect it from invasion it was in the year that the aztecs paused upon the shore of the lake and saw as the sun rose a splendid eagle perched upon a prickly pear which shot out of a crevice in the rock it held a large serpent in its claws and its broad wings were opened towards the rising sun the aztecs saw in this a most favourable omen and there and then set about building themselves a city laying its foundations upon piles in the marshy ground beside the lake and to this day the eagle and the cactus form the arms of the mexican republic illustration the little body of settlers increased rapidly in number and power and made their name terrible throughout the valley in which various other tribes had long been settled until at last they united themselves with the king of the tezcucans to aid him against a tribe called the tepanecs who had invaded his territory the allies were completely successful and this led to an agreement between the states of mexico tezcuco and tlacopan that they should support each other in all their wars and divide all the spoils between them this alliance remained unbroken for over a hundred years and under a succession of able princes the aztec dominion grew till at the coming of the spaniards it reached across the continent from the atlantic to the pacific ocean the aztecs had many wise laws and institutions and were indeed in some respects a highly civilised community when their emperor died a new one was chosen from among his sons or nephews by four nobles the one preferred was obliged to have distinguished himself in war and his coronation did not take place until a successful campaign had provided enough captives to grace his triumphal entry into the capital and enough victims for the ghastly sacrifices which formed an important part of all their religious ceremonies communication was held with the remotest parts of the country by means of couriers who trained to it from childhood travelled with amazing swiftness posthouses were established on the great roads and the messenger bearing his despatches in the form of hieroglyphical paintings ran to the first station where they were taken by the next messenger and carried forward being sent in one day a hundred or two hundred miles thus fish was served at the banquets of the emperor montezuma which twentyfour hours before had been caught in the gulf of mexico two hundred miles away thus too the news was carried when any war was going on and as the messengers ran to acquaint the court with the movements of the royal armies the people by the way knew whether the tidings were good or bad by the dress of the courier but the training of warriors was the chief end and aim of all aztec institutions their principal god was the god of war and one great object of all their expeditions was the capture of victims to be sacrificed upon his altars they believed that the soldier who fell in battle was transported at once to the blissful regions of the sun and they consequently fought with an utter disregard of danger the dress of the warriors was magnificent their bodies were protected by a vest of quilted cotton impervious to light missiles and over this the chiefs wore mantles of gorgeous featherwork and the richer of them a kind of cuirass of gold or silver plates their helmets were of wood fashioned like the head of some wild animal or of silver surmounted by plumes of variously coloured feathers sprinkled with precious stones beside which they wore many ornaments of gold and their banners were embroidered with gold and featherwork the aztecs worshipped thirteen principal gods and more than two hundred of less importance each of whom however had his day of festival which was duly observed at the head of all stood the wargod the terrible huitzilopochtli whose fantastic image was loaded with costly ornaments and whose temples in every city of the empire were the most splendid and stately the aztecs also had a legend that there had once dwelt upon the earth the great quetzalcoatl god of the air under whose sway all things had flourished and all people had lived in peace and prosperity but he had in some way incurred the wrath of the principal gods and was compelled to leave the country on his way he stopped at the city of cholula where a temple was dedicated to him of which the great ruins remain to this day when he reached the shores of the mexican gulf he embarked in his magic boat made of serpents skins for the fabulous land of tlapallan but before he bade his followers farewell he promised that he and his descendants would one day come again the aztecs confidently looked forward to the return of their benevolent god who was said to have been tall in stature with a white skin long dark hair and a flowing beard and this belief of theirs prepared the way as you will presently see for the success of corts the mexican temples or teocallis as they were called which means houses of god were very numerous there being several hundreds of them in each of the principal cities they looked rather like the egyptian pyramids and were divided into four or five stories each one being smaller than the one below it and the ascent was by a flight of steps at an angle of the pyramid this led to a sort of terrace at the base of the second story which passed quite round the building to another flight of steps immediately over the first so that it was necessary to go all round the temple several times before reaching the summit the top was a broad space on which stood two towers forty or fifty feet high which contained the images of the gods before these towers stood the dreadful stone of sacrifice and two lofty altars on which the sacred fires burned continually human sacrifices were adopted by the aztecs about two hundred years before the coming of the spaniards rare at first they became more and more frequent till at length nearly every festival closed with this cruel abomination the unhappy victim was held by five priests upon the stone of sacrifice while the sixth who was clothed in a scarlet mantle emblematic of his horrible office cut open his breast with a sharp razor of itztli a volcanic substance as hard as flint and tearing out his heart held it first up to the sun which they worshipped and then cast it at the feet of the god to whom the temple was devoted and to crown the horror the body of the captive thus sacrificed was afterwards given to the warrior who had taken him in battle who thereupon gave a great banquet and served him up amid choice dishes and delicious beverages for the entertainment of his friends when the great teocalli of huitzilopochtli was dedicated in the year no less than prisoners were thus sacrificed and in the whole kingdom every year the victims were never fewer than or as some old writers say the aztec writing was not with letters and words but consisted of little coloured pictures each of which had some special meaning thus a tongue denoted speaking a footprint travelling a man sitting on the ground an earthquake as a very slight difference in position or colour intimated a different meaning this writing was very difficult to read and in the aztec colleges the priests specially taught it to their pupils at the time of the coming of the spaniards there were numbers of people employed in this picturewriting but unfortunately hardly any of the manuscripts were preserved for the spaniards looking upon them as magic scrolls caused them to be burned by thousands in many mechanical arts the aztecs had made considerable progress their ground was well cultivated they had discovered and used silver lead tin and copper gold which was found in the riverbeds they cast into bars or used as money by filling transparent quills with gold dust they also made many fantastic ornaments of gold and silver and cast gold and silver vessels which they carved delicately with chisels some of the silver vases were so large that a man could not encircle them with his arms but the art in which they most delighted was the wonderful featherwork with the gorgeous plumage of the tropical birds they could produce all the effect of a beautiful mosaic the feathers pasted upon a fine cotton web were wrought into dresses for the wealthy hangings for their palaces and ornaments for their temples these then were the people of whom grijalva sent back to cuba a few vague reports and these and the accounts of the splendour of the treasure spread like wildfire through the island the governor having resolved to send out more ships to follow up these discoveries looked about him for a suitable person to command the expedition and share the expenses of it and being recommended by several of his friends to choose hernando corts he presently did so corts had now attained his hearts desire and at once began with the utmost energy to purchase and fit out the ships he used all the money he had saved and as much more as he could persuade his friends to lend him and very soon he was in possession of six vessels and three hundred recruits had enrolled themselves under his banner his orders were first to find grijalva and to proceed in company with him then to seek out and rescue six christians the survivors of a previous expedition who were supposed to be lingering in captivity in the interior and to bear in mind before all things that it was the great desire of the spanish monarch that the indians should be converted to christianity they were to be invited to give their allegiance to him and to send him presents of gold and jewels to secure his favour and protection the explorers were also to survey the coast acquaint themselves with the general features of the country and to barter with the natives the beginning of the expedition but before corts was ready to start a jealousy and distrust of him took possession of the mind of velasquez so that he determined to entrust the command of the fleet to someone else this came to the ears of corts and he with great promptitude assembled his officers secretly and that very night set sail with what supplies he was able to lay hands upon his ships being neither ready for sea nor properly provisioned when morning broke news was carried to velasquez that the fleet was under weigh and he rose hastily and galloped down to the quay corts rowed back to within speaking distance this is a courteous way of taking leave of me truly cried the governor pardon me answered corts time presses and there are some things that should be done before they are even thought of and with that he returned to his vessel and the little fleet sailed away to macaca where corts laid in more stores this was on november shortly afterwards he proceeded to trinidad a town on the south coast of cuba where he landed and setting up his standard invited all who would to join the expedition holding out to them great hopes of wealth to be gained volunteers flocked in daily including many young men of noble family who were attracted by the fame of corts among them were pedro de alvarado cristval de olid alonso de avila juan velasquez de leon alonso hernandez de puertocarrero and gonzalo de sandoval of all of whom you will hear again before the story is finished finally in february when all the reinforcements were assembled corts found he had eleven vessels one hundred and ten mariners five hundred and fiftythree soldiers and two hundred indians he also had sixteen horses ten large guns and four lighter which were called falconets corts before embarking addressed his little army saying that he held out to them a glorious prize and that if any among them coveted riches he would make them masters of such as their countrymen had never dreamed of and so they sailed away for the coast of yucatan the first thing that happened was that they were overtaken by a furious tempest and corts was delayed by looking after a disabled vessel and so was the last to reach the island of cozumel here he found that alvarado one of his captains had landed plundered a temple and by his violence caused the natives to fly and hide themselves inland corts much displeased severely reprimanded his officer and by the aid of an interpreter explained his peaceful intentions to two indians who had been captured then he loaded them with presents and sent them to persuade their countrymen to return which they presently did and the spaniards had the satisfaction of bartering the trifles they had brought for the gold ornaments of the natives next corts sent two ships to the opposite coast of yucatan where they were to despatch some indians inland to seek for and ransom the christian captives of whom he had gained some tidings from a trader and while they were gone he explored the island and induced the natives to declare themselves christians by the very summary method of rolling their venerated idols out of their temple and setting up in their stead an image of the virgin and child when the indians saw that no terrible consequences followed they listened to the teaching of the good priest father olmedo who accompanied the expedition though it is probable that they did not after all understand much of his instruction after eight days the two ships came back but with no news of the captives and corts sorrowfully decided that he could wait no longer he accordingly took in provisions and water and set sail again but before they had gone far one of the ships sprang a leak which obliged them to put back into the same port it was lucky that they did for soon after they landed a canoe was seen coming from the shore of yucatan which proved to contain one of the longlost spaniards who was called aguilas he had been for eight years a slave among the natives in the interior but his master tempted by the ransom of glassbeads hawkbells and such treasures had consented to release him when he reached the coast the ships were gone but owing to the fortunate accident of their return he found himself once more among his countrymen corts at once saw the importance of having him as an interpreter but in the end he proved to be of more use to the explorers than could have been at first imagined illustration again the fleet set out and coasted along the gulf of mexico till they reached the mouth of the rio de tabasco here corts landed but found that the indians were hostile and were drawn up in great force against him however after some hard fighting the spaniards were victorious and having taken possession of the town of tabasco corts sent messengers to the chiefs saying that if they did not at once submit themselves he would ravage the country with fire and sword as they had no mind for any more fighting they came humbly bringing presents and among them thirty slaves one of whom a beautiful mexican girl named malinche was afterwards of the utmost importance to the expedition she had come into the possession of the cacique of tabasco through some traders from the interior of the country to whom she had been secretly sold by her mother who coveted her inheritance corts now reembarked his soldiers and sailed away to the island of san juan de uloa under the lee of which they anchored and soon saw the light pirogues of the indians coming off to them from the mainland they brought presents of fruit and flowers and little ornaments of gold which they gladly exchanged for the usual trifles corts was most anxious to converse with them but found to his disappointment that aguilar could not understand their dialect in this dilemma he was informed that one of the slaves was a mexican and could of course speak the language this was malinche or as the spaniards always called her marina corts was so charmed with her beauty and cleverness that he made her his secretary and kept her always with him and she very soon learned enough spanish to interpret for him without the help of aguilar but at first they were both necessary and by their aid corts learned that his visitors were subjects of montezuma the great aztec emperor and were governed by tenhtlile one of his nobles corts having ascertained that there was abundance of gold in the interior dismissed them loaded with presents to acquaint their governor with his desire for an interview the next morning he landed on the mainland with all his force it was a level sandy plain and the troops employed themselves in cutting down trees and bushes to provide a shelter from the weather in this they were aided by the natives who built them huts with stakes and earth mats and cotton carpets and flocked from all the country round to see the wonderful strangers they brought with them fruits vegetables flowers in abundance game and many dishes cooked after the fashion of the country and these they gave to or bartered with the spaniards the next day came tenhtlile the governor with a numerous train and was met by corts and conducted to his tent with great ceremony all the principal officers were assembled and after a ceremonious banquet at which the governor was regaled with spanish wines and confections the interpreters were sent for and a conversation began tenhtlile first asked about the country of the strangers and the object of their visit corts replied that he was the subject of a powerful monarch beyond the seas who had heard of the greatness of the mexican emperor and had sent him with a present in token of his goodwill and with a message which he must deliver in person he concluded by asking when he could be admitted into montezumas presence to this the aztec noble replied haughtily how is it that you have been here only two days and demand to see the emperor then he added that he was surprised to hear that there could be another monarch as powerful as montezuma but if it were so his master would be happy to communicate with him and that he would forward the royal gift brought by the spanish commander and so soon as he had learned montezumas will would inform him of it tenhtlile then ordered his slaves to bring forward the present for the spanish general it consisted of ten loads of fine cotton several mantles of gorgeous featherwork and a wicker basket of golden ornaments corts received it with due acknowledgments and in his turn ordered the presents for montezuma to be brought forward these were an armchair richly carved and painted a crimson cloth cap with a gold medal and a quantity of collars bracelets and other ornaments of cutglass which in a country where glass was unknown were as valuable as real gems the aztec governor observed a soldier in the camp in a shining gilt helmet and expressed a wish that montezuma should see it as it reminded him of one worn by the god quetzalcoatl corts declared his willingness that the helmet should be sent and begged that the emperor would return it filled with the gold dust of the country that he might compare its quality with that of his own he also said that the spaniards were troubled with a disease of the heart for which gold was a sure remedy in fact he made his want of gold very clear to the governor while these things were passing corts observed one of tenhtliles attendants busy with a pencil and on looking at his work he found it was a sketch of the spaniards their costumes weapons and all objects of interest being correctly represented both in form and colour this was the celebrated picturewriting and the governor said that this man was drawing all these things for montezuma as he would get a much better idea of their appearance thus corts thereupon ordered out the cavalry and caused them to go through their military exercises upon the firm wet sands of the beach and the appearance of the horses which were absolutely unknown in mexico filled the natives with astonishment which turned to alarm when the general ordered the cannon to be fired and they saw for the first time the smoke and flame and beheld the balls crashing among the trees of the neighbouring forest and reducing them to splinters nothing of this sort was lost upon the painters who faithfully recorded every particular not omitting the ships the waterhouses as they called them which swung at anchor in the bay finally the governor departed as ceremoniously as he had come leaving orders with his people to supply the spanish general with all he might require till further instructions should come from the emperor in the meantime the arrival of the strangers was causing no small stir in the mexican capital a general feeling seems to have prevailed that the return of the white god quetzalcoatl was at hand and many wonderful signs and occurrences seemed to confirm the belief in the great lake of tezcuco without tempest earthquake or any visible cause became violently agitated overflowed its banks and pouring into the streets of mexico swept away many buildings by the fury of its waters in one of the towers of the great temple took fire equally without any apparent cause and continued to burn in defiance of all attempts to extinguish it in the following years three comets were seen and not long before the coming of the spaniards a strange light broke forth in the east resembling a great pyramid or flood of fire thickly powdered with stars at the same time low voices were heard in the air and doleful wailings as if to announce some strange mysterious calamity a lady of the royal house died was buried and rose again prophesying ruin to come after the conquest she became a christian montezuma terrified at these apparitions took counsel of nezahualpilli king of tezcuco who was a great proficient in astrology but far from obtaining any comfort from him he was still further depressed by being told that all these things predicted the speedy downfall of his empire when therefore the picturewritings showing the spanish invaders reached montezuma they caused him great apprehension and he summoned the kings of tezcuco and tlacopan to consult with them as to how the strangers should be received there was much division of opinion but finally montezuma resolved to send a rich present which should impress them with a high idea of his wealth and grandeur while at the same time he would forbid them to approach the capital after eight days at the most which however seemed a long time to the spaniards who were suffering from the intense heat of the climate the embassy accompanied by the governor tenhtlile reached the camp and presented to corts the magnificent treasure sent by montezuma one of the two nobles had been sent on account of his great likeness to the picture of corts which the aztec painter had executed for montezuma this resemblance was so striking that the spanish soldiers always called this chief the mexican corts after the usual ceremonious salutes the slaves unrolled the delicately wrought mats and displayed the gifts they had brought there were shields helmets and cuirasses embossed with plates and ornaments of pure gold with collars and bracelets of the same precious metal sandals fans plumes and crests of variegated feathers wrought with gold and silver thread and sprinkled with pearls and precious stones also imitations of birds and animals in wrought or cast gold and silver of exquisite workmanship and curtain coverlets and robes of cotton fine as silk of rich and varied hues interwoven with featherwork that rivalled the most delicate painting there were more than thirty loads of cotton cloth and the spanish helmet was returned filled to the brim with grains of gold but the things which excited the most admiration were two circular plates of gold and silver as large as carriagewheels one representing the sun was richly carved with plants and animals and was worth fiftytwo thousand five hundred pounds the spaniards could not conceal their rapture at this exhibition of treasure which exceeded their utmost dreams and when they had sufficiently admired it the ambassadors courteously delivered their message which was to the effect that montezuma had great pleasure in holding communication with so powerful a monarch as the king of spain but he could not grant a personal interview to the spaniards the way to his capital was too long and too dangerous therefore the strangers must return to their own land with the gifts he had sent them corts though much vexed concealed his annoyance and expressed his sense of the emperors munificence it made him he said only the more desirous of a personal interview so that he felt it was impossible that he should present himself again before his sovereign without having accomplished this great object of his journey he once more requested them to bear this message to their master with another trifling gift this they seemed unwilling to do and took their leave repeating that the generals wish could not be gratified the soldiers were by this time suffering greatly from the heat surrounded as they were by burning sands and evilsmelling marshes and swarms of venomous insects which tormented them night and day thirty of their number died and the discomfort of the rest was greatly increased by the indifference of the natives who no longer brought them such abundant supplies and demanded an immense price for what they did provide after ten days the mexican envoys returned bearing another rich present of stuffs and gold ornaments which though not so valuable as the first was yet worth three thousand ounces of gold beside this there were four precious stones somewhat resembling emeralds each of which they assured the spaniards was worth more than a load of gold and was destined as a special mark of respect for the spanish monarch since only the nobles of mexico were allowed to wear them unfortunately however they were of no value at all in europe montezumas answer was the same as before he positively forbade the strangers to approach nearer to his capital and requested them to take the treasure he had bestowed upon them and return without delay to their own country corts received this unwelcome message courteously but coldly and turning to his officers exclaimed this is a rich and powerful prince indeed yet it shall go hard but we will one day pay him a visit in his capital father olmedo then tried to persuade the aztec chiefs to give up their idolworship and endeavoured by the aid of marina and aguilar to explain to them the mysteries of his own faith but it is probable that he was not very successful the chiefs presently withdrew coldly and that same night every hut was deserted by the natives and the spaniards were left without supplies in a desolate wilderness corts thought this so suspicious that he prepared for an attack but everything remained quiet the general now decided to remove his camp to a more healthy place a little farther along the coast where the ships could anchor and be sheltered from the north wind but the soldiers began to grumble and be discontented and to say that it was time to return with their spoil and not linger upon those barren shores until they had brought the whole mexican nation about their ears fortunately at this juncture five indians made their appearance in the camp and were taken to the generals tent they were quite different from the mexicans in dress and appearance and wore rings of gold and bright blue gems in their ears and nostrils while a gold leaf delicately wrought was attached to the under lip marina could not understand their language but luckily she found that two of them could speak in the aztec tongue they explained that they came from cempoalla the chief town of a tribe called the totonacs and that their country had been lately conquered by the aztecs whose oppressions they greatly resented they also said that the fame of the spaniards had reached their master who had sent to request them to visit him in his capital it is easy to imagine how eagerly corts listened to this communication and how important it was to him hitherto as he knew absolutely nothing of the state of affairs in the interior of the country he had supposed the empire to be strong and united now he saw that the discontent of the provinces conquered by montezuma might be turned to his own advantage and that by their aid he might hope to succeed in his cherished scheme of subduing the emperor himself he therefore dismissed the totonacs with many presents promising soon to visit their city then with his usual energy and diplomacy he turned upon the immediate difficulties which beset him the discontent of the soldiers the jealousy of some of his officers and the fact that he had no warrant for his ambitious plans in the commission that he had received from velasquez by tact and cunning he managed to settle everything as he wished and set to work to establish a colony in the name of the spanish sovereign and appointed his chief friend puertocarrero to be one of its magistrates and montejo who was a friend of velasquez to be the other the new town was called villa rica de vera cruz the rich town of the true cross and as you see its governors and officials were appointed before a single house was built to them corts then resigned the commission which he had received from velasquez and the council which consisted chiefly of his own friends immediately reappointed him to be captaingeneral and chief justice of the colony with power to do practically just as he liked of course this caused a great commotion in the opposing party but corts put the leaders into irons and sent them on board one of the ships while he sent the soldiers on a foraging expedition into the surrounding country by the time these returned with supplies they had altered their minds and joined their companions in arms pledging themselves to a common cause while even the cavaliers on board the ship came to the same conclusion and were reconciled to the new government and were from that time staunch adherents to corts illustration peace being thus restored the army set out to march northwards to the place where it had been decided to build the town they crossed a river in rafts and broken canoes which they found upon its bank and presently came to a very different scene from the burning sandy waste which they had left the wide plains were covered with green grass and there were groves of palms among which the spaniards saw deer and various wild animals and flocks of pheasants and turkeys on their way they passed through a deserted village in the temples of which they found records in the picturewriting and also to their horror the remains of sacrificed victims as they proceeded up the river they were met by twelve indians sent by the cacique of cempoalla to show them the way to his town the farther they went the more beautiful did the country become the trees were loaded with gorgeous fruits and flowers and birds and butterflies of every hue abounded as they approached the indian city they saw gardens and orchards on each side of the road and were met by crowds of natives who mingled fearlessly with the soldiers bringing garlands of flowers in which they specially delighted to deck the generals helmet and to hang about the neck of his horse the cacique who was tall and very fat received corts with much courtesy and assigned to the army quarters in a neighbouring temple where they were well supplied with provisions and the general received a present of gold and fine cotton but in spite of all this friendliness he neglected no precautions stationing sentinels and posting his artillery so as to command the entrance the following morning corts paid the cacique a visit at his own residence and by the aid of marina a long conference was held in which the spanish general gained much important information and promised to aid the totonacs against montezuma and prevent him from carrying off their young men and maidens to be sacrificed to his gods the following day the army marched off again to the town of chiahuitztla which stood like a fortress on a crag overlooking the gulf though the inhabitants were alarmed at first they soon became friendly and the chiefs came to confer with corts and the cacique of cempoallo who had accompanied him carried in a litter just then there was a stir among the people and five men entered the marketplace where they were standing by their rich and peculiar dress they seemed to belong to a different race their dark glossy hair was tied in a knot at the top of the head and they carried bunches of flowers in their hands their attendants carried wands or fans to brush away the flies and insects from their lordly masters these persons passed the spaniards haughtily scarcely deigning to return their salutations and they were immediately joined by the totonac chiefs who seemed anxious to conciliate them by every sort of attention the general much astonished inquired of marina what this meant and she replied that these were aztec nobles empowered to receive tribute for montezuma soon after the chiefs returned in dismay saying that the aztecs were very angry with them for entertaining the spaniards without the emperors permission and had demanded twenty young men and maidens to be sacrificed to the gods as a punishment corts was most indignant at this insolence and insisted that the totonacs should not only refuse the demand but should also seize the aztec nobles and throw them into prison this they did but the spanish general managed to get two of them freed in the night and brought before him he then very cunningly made them believe that he regretted the indignity that had been offered them and would help them to get away safely and the next day would do his best to release their companions he also told them to report this to montezuma assuring him of the great respect and regard in which he was held by the spaniards them he sent them away secretly to the port and they were taken in one of the vessels and landed safely at a little distance along the coast the totonacs were furious at the escape of some of their prisoners and would at once have sacrificed the remainder had not corts expressed the utmost horror at the idea and sent them on board one of the ships for safe keeping whence he very soon allowed them to join their companions this artful proceeding had as we shall presently see just the effect it was meant to have upon montezuma by order of corts messengers were now sent to all the other totonac towns telling them of the defiance that had been shown to the emperor and bidding them also refuse to pay the tribute the indians soon came flocking into chiahuitztla to see and confer with the powerful strangers in the hope of regaining liberty by their aid and so cleverly had corts managed to embroil them with montezuma that even the most timid felt that they had no choice but to accept the protection of the spaniards and make a bold effort for the recovery of freedom corts accordingly made them swear allegiance to the spanish sovereign and then set out once more for the port where his colony was to be planted this was only half a league distant in a wide and fruitful plain and he was not long in determining the circuit of the walls and the site of the fort granary and other public buildings the friendly indians brought stone lime wood and bricks and in a few weeks a town rose up which served as a good startingpoint for future operations a retreat for the disabled a place for the reception of stores or whatever might be sent to or from the mothercountry and was moreover strong enough to overawe the surrounding country this was the first colony in new spain and was hailed with satisfaction by the simple natives who could not foresee that their doom was sealed when a white man set his foot upon their soil while the spaniards were still occupied with their new settlement they were surprised by another embassy from mexico when the account of the imprisonment of the royal collectors first reached montezuma his feelings of fear and superstition were swallowed up in indignation and he began with great energy to make preparations for punishing his rebellious vassals and avenging the insult offered to himself but when the aztec officers liberated by corts reached the capital and reported the courteous treatment they had received from the spanish commander he was induced to resume his former timid and conciliatory policy and sent an embassy consisting of two young nephews of his own and four of his chief nobles to the spanish quarters as usual they bore a princely gift of gold rich cotton stuffs and wonderful mantles of feather embroidery the envoys on coming before corts presented this offering with the emperors thanks to him for the courtesy he had shown to the captive nobles at the same time montezuma expressed his surprise and regret that the spaniards should have countenanced the rebellion he had no doubt he said that corts and his followers were the longlookedfor strangers and therefore of the same lineage as himself from deference to them he would spare the totonacs while they were present but the day of vengeance would come corts entertained the indians with frank hospitality taking care however to make such a display of his resources as should impress them with a sense of his power then he dismissed them with a few trifling gifts and a conciliatory message to the emperor to the effect that he would soon pay his respects to him in his capital when all misunderstanding between them would certainly be adjusted the totonacs were amazed when they understood the nature of this interview for in spite of the presence of the spaniards they had felt great apprehension as to the consequence of their rash act and now they felt absolutely in awe of the strangers who even at a distance could exercise such a mysterious influence over the terrible montezuma not long after the cacique of cempoalla appealed to corts to aid him against a neighbour with whom he had a quarrel the general at once marched to support him with a part of his force but when they reached the hostile city they were received in a most friendly manner and corts had no difficulty in reconciling the two chiefs to one another in token of gratitude the indian cacique sent eight noble maidens richly decked with collars and ornaments of gold whom he begged the general to give as wives to his captains corts seized the opportunity of declaring that they must first become christians and be baptized since the sons of the church could not be allowed to marry idolaters the chief replied that his gods were good enough for him and that he should at once resent any insults offered to them even if they did not avenge themselves by instantly destroying the spaniards however the general and his followers had seen too much already of the barbarous rites of the indian religion and its horrible sacrifices without hesitation they attacked the principal teocalli whereupon the cacique called his men to arms the priests in their bloodstained robes rushed frantically about among the people calling upon them to defend their gods and all was tumult and confusion corts acted with his usual promptitude at this crisis he caused the cacique and the principal inhabitants and the priests to be taken prisoners and then commanded them to quiet the people threatening that a single arrow shot at the spaniards should cost them their lives marina also represented the madness of resistance reminding the cacique that if he lost the friendship of the strangers he would be left alone to face the vengeance of montezuma this consideration decided him covering his face with his hands he exclaimed that the gods would avenge their own wrongs taking advantage of this tacit consent fifty soldiers rushed up the stairway of the temple and dragging the great wooden idols from their places in the topmost tower they rolled them down the steps of the pyramid amid the groans of the natives and the triumphant shouts of their comrades and then burnt them to ashes the totonacs finding that their gods were unable to prevent or even punish this profanation of their temple now believed that they were indeed less to be feared than the spaniards and offered no further resistance by cortss orders the teocalli was then thoroughly purified and an altar was erected surmounted by a great cross hung with garlands of roses and father olmedo said mass before the indians and spaniards who seem to have been alike impressed by the ceremony an old disabled soldier named juan de torres was left to watch over the sanctuary and instruct the natives in its services while the general taking a friendly leave of his totonac allies set out once more for villa rica to finish his arrangements before departing for the capital here he was surprised to find that a spanish vessel had arrived in his absence having on board twelve soldiers and two horses a very welcome addition to the tiny army corts now resolved to execute a plan of which he had been thinking for some time he knew very well that none of his arrangements about the colony would hold good without the spanish monarchs sanction and also that velasquez had great interest at court and would certainly use it against him therefore he resolved to send despatches to the emperor himself and such an amount of treasure as should give a great idea of the extent and importance of his discoveries he gave up his own share of the spoil and persuaded his officers to do the same and a paper was circulated among the soldiers calling upon all who chose to resign the small portion which was due to them that a present worthy of the emperors acceptance might be sent home it is only another proof of the extraordinary power which corts had over these rough soldiers who cared for nothing but plunder that not a single one refused to give up the very treasure which he had risked so much to gain illustration these are some of the wonderful things that were sent two collars made of gold and precious stones two birds made of green feathers with feet beaks and eyes of gold and in the same piece with them animals of gold resembling snails a large alligators head of gold two birds made of thread and featherwork having the quills of their wings and tails their feet eyes and the ends of their beaks of gold standing upon two reeds covered with gold which are raised on balls of featherwork and gold embroidery one white and the other yellow with seven tassels of featherwork hanging from each of them a large silver wheel also bracelets leaves and five shields of the same metal a box of featherwork embroidered on leather with a large plate of gold weighing seventy ounces in the midst a large wheel of gold with figures of strange animals on it and worked with tufts of leaves weighing three thousand eight hundred ounces a fan of variegated featherwork with thirtyseven rods plated with gold sixteen shields of precious stones with feathers of various colours hanging from their rims and six shields each covered with a plate of gold with something resembling a mitre in the centre besides all this there was a quantity of gold ore and many pieces of richly embroidered cotton cloth and featherwork he accompanied this present with a letter to the emperor in which he gave an account of all his adventures and discoveries and ended by beseeching him to confirm his authority as he was entirely confident that he should be able to place the castilian crown in possession of this great indian empire he also sent four slaves who had been rescued from the cage in which were kept the victims about to be sacrificed and some mexican manuscripts very soon after the departure of the treasureship corts discovered that there was a conspiracy among some of his followers who either did not like the way the general arranged matters or else were terrified at the prospect of the dangerous campaign that was before them they had seized one of the ships and got provisions and water stored and were on the eve of setting sail for cuba when one of their number repented of the part he had taken in the plot and betrayed it to corts who at once took measures for the arrest of the ringleaders two of whom were afterwards hanged this affair showed the general that there were some among his followers who were not heart and soul in the expedition and who might therefore fail him when he most needed them and might also cause their comrades to desert if there was any chance for them to escape he therefore determined to take the bold step of destroying the ships without the knowledge of his army accordingly he marched the whole army to cempoalla and when he arrived there he told his plan to a few of his devoted adherents who entirely approved of it through them he persuaded the pilots to declare the ships unseaworthy and then ordered nine of them to be sunk having first brought on shore their sails masts iron and all movable fittings when the news of this proceeding reached cempoalla it caused the deepest consternation among the spaniards who felt themselves betrayed and abandoned a mere handful of men arrayed against a great and formidable empire and cut off from all chance of escape they murmured loudly and a serious mutiny was threatened but corts whose presence of mind never deserted him managed to reassure them and to persuade them that he had only done what was really best for everyone and he so cunningly dwelt upon the fame and the treasure which they were on the eve of gaining that not one of them accepted the offer which he made to them of returning to cuba in the only remaining ship their enthusiasm for their leader revived and as he concluded his speech they made the air ring with their shouts of to mexico to mexico the march to mexico while he was still at cempoalla news came to corts from villa rica that four strange ships were hovering off the coast and that they refused to respond to repeated signals made to them by don juan de escalante who was in command of the garrison left in the town this greatly alarmed corts who was continually dreading the interference of his enemy the governor of cuba he rode hastily back to villa rica and almost without stopping to rest pushed on a few leagues northwards along the coast where he understood the ships were at anchor on his way he met with three spaniards just landed from them and learned that they belonged to a squadron fitted out by francisco de garay who had landed on the florida coast a year before and had obtained from spain authority over the countries he might discover in its neighbourhood corts saw he had nothing to fear from them but he did wish he could have induced the crews of the ships to join his expedition the three men he easily persuaded but those who remained on board feared treachery and refused to send a boat ashore finally by a stratagem corts succeeded in capturing three or four more out of a boats crew who came to fetch their comrades and with this small party of recruits he returned to cempoalla on august corts bade farewell to his hospitable indian friends and set out for mexico his force consisted of about four hundred foot and fifteen horse with seven pieces of artillery and in addition to these he had obtained from the cacique of cempoalla thirteen hundred warriors and a thousand porters to carry the baggage and drag the guns during the first day the army marched through the tierra caliente or hot region all around them fruit and flowers grew in the wildest profusion as indeed they did all the year round in that wonderful climate the air was heavy with perfume and bright birds and insects abounded but after some leagues travel over roads made nearly impassable by the summer rains they began to ascend gradually and at the close of the second day they reached xalapa from which they looked out over one of the grandest prospects that could be seen anywhere down below them lay the hot region with its gay confusion of meadows streams and flowering forests sprinkled over with shining indian villages while a faint line of light upon the horizon told them that there was the ocean they had so lately crossed beyond which lay their country which many of them would never see again to the south rose the mighty mountain called orizaba in his mantle of snow and in another direction the sierra madre with its dark belt of pinetrees stretched its long lines of shadowy hills away into the distance onward and upward they went and on the fourth day they arrived at the strong town of naulinco here the inhabitants entertained them hospitably for they were friendly with the totonacs and corts endeavoured through father olmedo to teach them something about christianity they seem to have listened willingly and allowed the spaniards to erect a cross for their adoration which indeed they did in most of the places where they halted the troops now entered upon a rugged narrow valley called the bishops pass and now it began to be terribly cold the snow and hail beat upon them and the freezing wind seemed to penetrate to their very bones the spaniards were partly protected by their armour and their thick coats of quilted cotton but the poor indians natives of the hot region and with very little clothing suffered greatly and indeed several of them died by the way the path lay round a bare and dreadfullooking volcanic mountain and often upon the edge of precipices three thousand feet in depth after three days of this dreary travelling the army emerged into a more genial climate they had reached the great tableland which spreads out for hundreds of miles along the crests of the cordilleras more than seven thousand feet above the sealevel the vegetation of the torrid and temperate regions had of course disappeared but the fields were carefully cultivated many of the crops were unknown to the spaniards but they recognised maize and aloes and various kinds of cactus suddenly the troops came upon what seemed to be a populous city even larger than cempoalla and with loftier and more substantial buildings of stone and lime there were thirteen teocallis in the town and in one place in the suburbs one of the spaniards counted the storedup skulls of a hundred thousand sacrificed victims the lord of the town ruled over twenty thousand vassals he was a tributary to montezuma and there was a strong mexican garrison in the place this was probably the reason of his receiving corts and his army very coldly and vaunting the grandeur of the mexican emperor who could he declared muster thirty great vassals each of whom commanded a hundred thousand men in answer to the inquiries of corts he told him about montezuma and his capital how more than twenty thousand prisoners of war were sacrificed every year upon the altars of his gods and how the city stood in the midst of a great lake and was approached by long causeways connected in places by wooden bridges which when raised cut off all communication with the country and many other strange things which were not of a kind to reassure the minds of the spaniards they hardly knew whether to believe the old cacique or not but at any rate the wonders they heard made them as one of their cavaliers said only the more earnest to prove the adventure desperate as it might appear illustration the natives were also very curious to know about the spaniards their horses and dogs and strange weapons and marina in answering their questions took care to expatiate upon the exploits and victories of her adopted countrymen and to state the extraordinary marks of respect they had received from montezuma this had its effect upon the cacique who presently sent the general some slaves to make bread for the soldiers and supplied them with the means of refreshment and rest which they needed so much after their toilful march the army rested in this city four or five days and even at the end of the last century the indians would still point out the cypress tree under the shelter of which the conquerors horse had been tied when the journey was resumed the way was through a broad green valley watered by a splendid river and shaded by lofty trees on either side of the river an unbroken line of indian dwellings extended for several leagues and on some rising ground stood a town which might contain five or six thousand inhabitants commanded by a fortress with walls and trenches here the troops halted again and met with friendly treatment in their last haltingplace corts had been advised by the natives to take the route to the ancient city of cholula the inhabitants of which were a mild race subjects of montezuma and given to peaceful arts who were likely to receive him kindly but his cempoallan allies declared that the cholulans were false and perfidious and counselled him to go to tlascala a valiant little republic which had managed to maintain its independence against the arms of mexico the tribe had always been friendly with the totonacs and had the reputation of being frank fearless and trustworthy the spanish general decided to try and secure their goodwill and accordingly despatched four of the principal cempoallans with a gift consisting of a cap of crimson cloth a sword and a crossbow to ask permission to pass through their country expressing at the same time his admiration of their valour and of their long resistance of the aztecs whose pride he too was determined to humble three days after the departure of the envoys the army resumed its march lingering somewhat by the way in hopes of receiving an answer from the indian republic but the messengers did not return which occasioned the general no little uneasiness as they advanced the country became rougher and the scenery bolder and at last their progress was arrested by a most remarkable fortification it was a stone wall nine feet high and twenty feet thick with a parapet a foot and a half broad at the top for the protection of those who defended it it had only one opening in the centre made by two semicircular lines of wall overlapping each other for the space of forty paces and having a passageway between ten paces wide so contrived as to be perfectly commanded by the inner wall this fortification which extended for more than two leagues rested at either end on the bold natural buttresses of the chain of mountains it was built of immense blocks of stone nicely laid together without cement and from the remains that still exist it is easy to imagine what its size and solidity must have been this singular structure marked the limits of tlascala and was intended the natives said as a barrier against mexican invasions the soldiers paused amazed and not a little apprehensive as to their reception in tlascala since a people who were capable of such a work as that would indeed prove formidable should they not be friendly but corts putting himself at the head of his cavalry shouted forward soldiers the holy cross is our banner and under that we shall conquer and so they marched through the undefended passage and found themselves in tlascala the tlascalan people belonged to the same great family as the aztecs and had planted themselves upon the western shore of lake tezcuco at about the same period at the close of the twelfth century there they remained many years until they had for some reason incurred the displeasure of all the surrounding tribes who combined to attack them and a terrible battle took place though the tlascalans were entirely victorious they were so disgusted by this state of things that they resolved to migrate and the greater number of them finally settled in the warm and fruitful valley overshadowed by the mountains of tlascala after some years the monarchy was divided first into two then four separate states each with its own chief who was independent in his own territory and possessed equal authority with the other three in all matters concerning the whole republic the affairs of which were settled by a council consisting of the four chiefs and the inferior nobles they were an agricultural people and the fertility of their new country was signified by its name tlascala meaning the land of bread presently their neighbours began to be envious of their prosperity and they were frequently obliged to defend themselves against the cholulans and were always successful but when axayacatl king of the aztecs sent demanding the same tribute and obedience from them which the other people of the country paid him threatening if they refused to destroy their cities and give their land to their enemies they answered proudly neither they nor their forefathers had ever paid tribute or homage to a foreign power nor ever would pay it if their country was invaded they knew how to defend it this answer brought upon them the forces of the mexican monarch and a pitched battle was fought in which the republic was again victorious but from that time hostilities never ceased between the two nations every captive was mercilessly sacrificed and the tlascalan children were trained from the cradle to hate the mexicans with a deadly hatred in this struggle the tlascalans received valuable support from a wild and warlike race from the north called the otomies some of them settled in the republic and having proved themselves courageous and faithful were entrusted with the defence of the frontier after montezuma became emperor of mexico greater efforts than before were made to subdue tlascala he sent a great army against it commanded by his favourite son but his troops were defeated and his son killed enraged and mortified montezuma made still greater preparations and invaded the valley with a terrific force but the tlascalans withdrew to the recesses of the hills and watching their opportunity swept down upon the enemy and drove them from their territory with dreadful slaughter nevertheless they were greatly harassed by these constant struggles with a foe so superior to themselves in numbers and resources the aztec armies lay between them and the coast cutting off all possibility of obtaining any supplies there were some things as cotton cacas and salt which they were unable to grow or manufacture of which they had been deprived for more than fifty years and their taste was so much affected by this enforced abstinence that they did not get used to eating salt with their food for several generations after the conquest this was the state of affairs in tlascala when the spaniards reached it and it is easy to see how important it was to corts to form an alliance with it but that was not an easy thing to do the tlascalans had heard about the christians and their victorious advance but they had not expected that they would come their way so they were much embarrassed by the embassy demanding a passage through their territories the council was assembled and a great difference of opinion was found among its members some believed that these were the whiteskinned bearded men whose coming was foretold and at all events they were enemies to mexico and might help them in their struggle against it others argued that this could not be the march of the strangers through the land might be tracked by the broken images of the indian gods and desecrated temples how could they be sure that they were not friends of montezuma they had received his embassies accepted his gifts and were even now on their way to his capital in company with his vassals this last was the opinion of an aged chief one of the four rulers of the republic his name was xicotencatl and he was nearly blind for he was over a hundred years old he had a son of the same name as himself an impetuous young man who commanded a powerful force of tlascalans and otomies on the eastern frontier where the great fortification stood the old chief advised that this force should at once fall upon the spaniards if they were conquered they would be at the mercy of the tlascalans but if by any mischance his son should fail the council could declare that they had nothing to do with the attack laying the whole blame of it upon the young xicotencatl meantime the cempoallan envoys were to be detained under pretence of assisting at a religious sacrifice by this time as we know corts and his gallant band had passed the rocky rampart from which for some reason or other the otomie guard was absent after advancing a few leagues he saw a small party of indians armed with sword and buckler who fled at his approach he made signs for them to halt but they only fled the faster the spaniards spurred their horses and soon succeeded in overtaking them when they at once turned and without showing the usual alarm at the horses and strange weapons of the cavaliers attacked them furiously the latter however were far too strong for them and they would soon have been cut to pieces had not a body of several thousand indians appeared coming quickly to their rescue corts seeing them hastily despatched a messenger to hurry up his infantry the indians having discharged their missiles fell upon the little band of spaniards striving to drag the riders from their horses and to tear their lances from their grasp they brought one cavalier to the ground who afterwards died of his wounds and they killed two horses cutting their necks through with one blow of their formidable broadswords this was a most serious loss to corts whose horses were so important and so few in number the struggle was a hard one and it was with no small satisfaction that the spaniards saw their comrades advancing to their aid no sooner had the main body reached the field of battle than hastily falling into position they poured such a volley from their muskets and crossbows as fairly astounded the enemy who made no further attempt to continue the fight but drew off in good order leaving the road open to the spaniards who were only too glad to get rid of their foes and pursue their way presently they met two tlascalan envoys accompanied by two of the cempoallans the former on being brought to the general assured him of a friendly reception in the capital and declared the late assault upon the troops to have been quite unauthorised corts received his message courteously pretending to believe that all was as he said as it was now growing late the spaniards quickened their pace anxious to reach a suitable campingground before nightfall and they chose a place upon the bank of a stream where a few deserted huts were standing these the weary and famishing soldiers ransacked in search of food but could find nothing but some animals resembling dogs which however they cooked and ate without ceremony seasoning their unsavoury repast with the fruit of the indian fig which grew wild in the neighbourhood after several desperate battles with the tlascalans corts finally won a great victory the next day as he usually did after gaining a battle the spanish commander sent a new embassy to the tlascalan capital making as before professions of friendship but this time threatening that if his offers were rejected he would visit their city as a conqueror razing their house to the ground and putting every inhabitant to the sword of course this message was given to the envoys by the aid of the lady marina who became day by day more necessary to corts and who was indeed generally admired for her courage and the cheerfulness with which she endured all the hardships of the camp and raised the drooping spirits of the soldiers while by every means in her power she alleviated the miseries of her own countrymen this time the ambassadors of corts received a respectful hearing from the deeply dejected council of tlascala for whom nothing remained but to submit four principal caciques were chosen to offer to the spaniards a free passage through the country and a friendly reception in the capital their friendship was accepted with many excuses for the past and the chiefs were further ordered to touch at the camp of xicotencatl the tlascalan general and require him to cease hostilities and furnish the white men with a plentiful supply of provisions illustration while the tlascalan envoys were still in the camp came a fresh embassy from montezuma tidings had been sent to him of each step in the progress of the spaniards and it was with great satisfaction that he had heard of their taking the road to tlascala trusting that if they were mortal men they would find their graves there great was his dismay therefore when courier after courier brought him news of their successes and how the most redoubtable warriors had been scattered by this handful of strangers his superstitious fears returned with greater force than ever and in his alarm and uncertainty he despatched five great nobles of his court attended by two hundred slaves to bear to corts a gift consisting of three thousand ounces of gold and several hundred robes of cotton and featherwork as they laid it at his feet they said that they had come to offer montezumas congratulations upon his victories and to express his regret that he could not receive them in his capital where the numerous population was so unruly that he could not be answerable for their safety the merest hint of the emperors wishes would have been enough to influence any of the natives but they made very little impression upon corts and seeing this the envoys proceeded in their masters name to offer tribute to the spanish sovereign provided the general would give up the idea of visiting the capital this was a fatal mistake and a most strange one for such a brave and powerful monarch to make for it amounted to an admission that he was unable to protect his treasures corts in replying expressed the greatest respect for montezuma but urged his own sovereigns commands as a reason for disregarding his wishes he added that though he had not at present the power of requiting his generosity as he could wish he trusted to repay him at some future day with good works you will hear before long how he kept his word the mexican ambassadors were anything but pleased at finding the war at an end and a firm friendship established between their mortal enemies and the spaniards and the general saw with some satisfaction the evidences of a jealousy between them which was his surest hope of success in undermining the mexican empire two of the aztecs presently returned to acquaint montezuma with the state of affairs the others remained with the spaniards corts being willing that they should see the deference paid to him by the tlascalans who were most anxious for his presence in their city illustration the city of tlascala lay about six leagues away from the spanish camp and the road led through a hilly region and across a deep ravine over which a bridge had just been built for the passage of the army they passed some towns by the way where they were received with the greatest hospitality the people flocked out to meet them bringing garlands of roses with which they decorated the spanish soldiers and wreathed about the necks of their horses priests in their white robes mingled with the crowd scattering clouds of incense from their censers and thus escorted the army slowly made its way through the gates of the city of tlascala here the press became so great that it was with difficulty that a passage was cleared for it the flat housetops were crowded with eager spectators while garlands of green boughs roses and honeysuckle were thrown across the streets and the air was rent with songs and shouts and the wild music of the national instruments presently the procession halted before the palace of the aged xicotencatl the father of the general and corts dismounted from his horse that the blind old man might satisfy his natural curiosity respecting him by passing his hand over his face he then led the way to a spacious hall where a banquet was served to the whole army after which quarters were assigned to them in a neighbouring teocalli the mexican ambassadors being at the desire of corts lodged next to himself that he might the better protect them in the city of their foes for some days the spaniards were feasted and entertained in four quarters of the city which was really like separate towns divided from one another by high walls in each of which lived one of the rulers of the republic surrounded by his own vassals but amid all these friendly demonstrations the general never for a moment relaxed the strict discipline of the camp and no soldier was allowed to leave his quarters without special permission at first this offended the tlascalan chiefs as they thought it showed distrust of them but when corts explained that this was only in accordance with the established military system of his country they began to think it admirable and the young xicotencatl proposed if possible to imitate it the spanish commander now turned his thoughts to the converting of the tlascalans but as they refused to part with their own gods though they were willing enough to add the god of the christians to their number he took the advice of the wise father olmedo and abandoned the idea for the time however a cross was erected in one of the great squares and there the spaniards held their religious services unmolested and it happened strangely enough that they had scarcely left the city when a thin transparent cloud settled like a column upon the cross wrapping it round and continuing through the night to shed a soft light about it this occurrence did more for the conversion of the natives than all the preaching of father olmedo several of the indian princesses were now baptized and given in marriage to the officers of corts one who was the daughter of xicotencatl became the wife of alvarado who was always a great favourite with the tlascalans from his gay manners joyous countenance and bright golden hair he gained the nickname of tonatiuh or the sun while corts who hardly ever appeared anywhere without the beautiful marina was called by the natives malinche which you will remember was her indian name while all this was happening came yet another embassy from montezuma loaded as usual with costly gifts this time he invited the spaniards to visit him in his capital assuring them that they would be welcome further he besought them to enter into no alliance with the base and barbarous tlascalans but he invited them to take the route of the friendly city of cholula where arrangements were being made by his orders for their reception the tlascalans were much concerned that corts should propose to go to mexico and what they told him fully confirmed all the reports he had heard of the power and ambition of montezuma of the strength of his capital and the number of his soldiers they warned him not to trust to his gifts and his fair words and when the general said that he hoped to bring about a better understanding between the emperor and themselves they replied that it was impossible however smooth his words he would hate them at heart they also heartily protested against the generals going to cholula the people they said though not brave in the open field were crafty they were montezumas tools and would do his bidding that city too was specially under the protection of the god quetzalcoatl and the priests were confidently believed to have the power of opening an inundation from the foundations of his shrine which should overwhelm their enemies in the deluge and lastly though many distant places had sent to testify their goodwill and offer their allegiance cholula only six leagues distant had done neither this consideration weighed more with the general than either of the preceding ones and he promptly despatched a summons to the city demanding a formal tender of its submission it was not long before deputies arrived from cholula profuse in expressions of goodwill and invitations to visit their city but the tlascalans pointed out that these messengers were below the usual rank of ambassadors which corts regarded as a fresh indignity he therefore sent a new summons declaring that if they did not at once send a deputation of their principal men he would treat them as rebels to his own sovereign the rightful lord of these realms this soon brought some of the highest nobles to the camp who excused their tardy appearance by saying that they had feared for their personal safety in the capital of their enemies the tlascalans were now more than ever averse to the projected visit a strong aztec force was known to be near cholula and the city was being actively prepared for defence corts too was disturbed by these circumstances but he had gone too far to recede without showing fear which could not fail to have a bad effect on his own men as well as on the natives therefore after a short consultation with his officers he decided finally to take the road to cholula this ancient city lay six leagues to the south of tlascala and was most populous and flourishing the inhabitants excelled in the art of working in metals and manufacturing cotton cloth and delicate pottery but were indisposed to war and less distinguished for courage than for cunning you will remember that it was in this place that the god quetzalcoatl had paused on his way to the coast and in his honour a tremendous pyramid had been erected probably by building over a natural hill and on the top of this rose a gorgeous temple in which stood an image of the god bedecked with gold and jewels to this temple pilgrims flocked from every corner of the empire and many were the terrible sacrifices offered there as indeed in all the other teocallis of which there were about four hundred in the city on the day appointed the spanish army set out for cholula followed by crowds of citizens who admired the courage displayed by this little handful of men in proposing to brave the mighty montezuma in his own territory an immense body of warriors had offered to join the expedition but corts thought it wise to accept only six thousand and even these he left encamped at some distance from cholula because the caciques of that city who came out to meet the spaniards objected to having their mortal enemies brought within its walls as the troops drew near the town they were met by swarms of men women and children all eager to catch a glimpse of the strangers whose persons horses and weapons were equally objects of intense curiosity to them they in their turn were struck by the noble aspect of the cholulans who were much superior in dress and general appearance to the other tribes they had encountered an immense number of priests swinging censers mingled with the crowd and as before they were decorated with garlands and bunches of flowers and accompanied by gay music from various instruments the spaniards were also struck by the width and cleanliness of the streets and the solidity of the houses they were lodged in the court of one of the many teocallis and visited by the great nobles of the city who supplied them plentifully with all they needed and at first paid them such attentions as caused them to believe that the evil apprehensions of the tlascalans had been merely suspicion and prejudice but very soon the scene changed messengers came from montezuma who shortly and pleasantly told corts that his approach occasioned much disquietude to their master and then conferred apart with the mexicans who were still in the spanish camp presently departing and taking one of them away with them from this time the cholulans visited the spanish quarters no more and when invited to do so excused themselves saying they were ill also the supply of provisions ran short and they said it was because maize was scarce naturally corts became very uneasy at this change and his alarm was increased by the reports of the cempoallans who told him that in wandering about the city they had seen several streets barricaded and in some places holes had been dug and a sharp stake planted upright in each and branches strewn to conceal them while the flat roofs of the houses were being stored with stones and other missiles some tlascalans also came in from their camp to inform him that a great sacrifice mostly of children had been held in a distant quarter of the town to secure the aid of the gods in some intended enterprise and numbers of the people had taken their wives and children out of the city these tidings confirmed the worst suspicions of corts but just then the lady marina made a discovery which changed his doubts into certainty the wife of one of the cholulan caciques had taken a great fancy to the mexican girl and continually urged her to visit her house hinting mysteriously that she would in this way escape a great danger which threatened the spaniards marina pretended to be delighted with this proposal and glad of the chance of escaping from the white men and by degrees she thus won the confidence of the cholulan who presently revealed the whole plot to her it originated she said with the aztec emperor who had bribed the caciques of cholula her husband among the number to assault the spaniards as they marched out of the city and to throw them into confusion all sorts of obstacles had been placed in their way a force of twenty thousand mexicans was already quartered near the city to support the cholulans and the spaniards would it was confidently expected fall an easy prey to their united enemies a sufficient number of them were to be reserved to be sacrificed in cholula and the rest led in fetters to the capital of montezuma while this conversation was taking place marina was making a show of collecting and packing up such dresses and jewels as she was to take with her to the house of her new friend but after a while she managed to slip away without exciting her suspicion and rushing to the general told him all corts at once caused the caciques wife to be seized and she repeated to him the same story that she had told to marina he was most anxious to gain further particulars of the conspiracy and accordingly induced two priests one of them a person of much influence to visit his quarters where by courteous treatment and rich presents he got from them a complete confirmation of the report the emperor had been in a state of pitiable vacillation since the arrival of the spaniards his first orders had been that they should be kindly received but on consulting his oracles anew he had obtained for answer that cholula would be the grave of his enemies and so positive of success were the aztecs that they had already sent into the city numbers of the poles with thongs attached to them with which to bind the prisoners corts now dismissed the priests bidding them observe the strictest secrecy which indeed they were likely to do for their own sakes he also requested that they would induce some of the principal caciques to grant him an interview in his quarters when they came he gently rebuked them for their want of hospitality and said that the spaniards would burden them no longer but would leave the city early the next morning he also asked that they would supply him with two thousand men to carry his artillery and baggage the chiefs after some consultation agreed to this as being likely to favour their own plans then he sent for the mexican ambassadors and acquainted them with his discovery of the plot saying that it grieved him much to find montezuma mixed up in so treacherous an affair and that the spaniards must now march as enemies against a monarch they had hoped to visit as a friend the ambassadors however asserted their entire ignorance of the conspiracy and their belief that montezuma also knew nothing of it the night that followed was one of intense anxiety every soldier lay down fully armed and the number of sentinels was doubled but all remained quiet in the populous city and the only sounds which reached their ears were the hoarse cries of the priests who from the turrets of the teocallis proclaimed through their trumpets the watches of the night with the first streak of morning light corts was on horseback directing the movements of his little band part of which he posted in the great square court a strong guard was placed at each of the three gates and the rest had charge of the great guns which were outside the enclosure and so placed as to command the roads which led to the teocalli the arrangements were hardly completed before the cholulan caciques appeared bringing a larger body of porters than had been demanded they were marched at once into the square which was as we have seen completely lined by the spanish troops corts then took the caciques aside and sternly and abruptly charged them with the conspiracy taking care to show that he knew every detail the cholulans were thunderstruck and gazed with awe upon the strangers who seemed to have the power of reading their most secret thoughts they made no attempt to deny the accusation but tried to excuse themselves by throwing the blame on montezuma corts however declared with still more indignation that such a pretence would not serve them and that he would now make such an example of them as should be a warning to the cities far and near and then the fatal signal the firing of a gun was given and in an instant every musket and crossbow was levelled at the unhappy cholulans as they stood crowded together in the centre they were completely taken by surprise having heard nothing of what was going forward and offered hardly any resistance to the spanish soldiers who followed up the discharge of their pieces by rushing upon them with their swords and mowing them down in ranks as they stood while this dreadful massacre was going on the cholulans from outside attracted by the noise began a furious assault upon the spaniards but the heavy guns opened fire upon them and swept them off in files as they rushed on and in the intervals of reloading the cavalry charged into their midst by this time the tlascalans had come up having by order of corts bound wreaths of sedge about their heads that they might be the more easily distinguished from the cholulans and they fell upon the rear of the wretched townsmen who thus harassed on all sides could no longer maintain their ground they fled some to the near buildings which were speedily set on fire others to the temples one strong body headed by the priests got possession of the great teocalli there was as you remember a tradition that if part of the wall was removed the god would send a flood to overwhelm his enemies now the cholulans strove with might and main and at last succeeded in wrenching away a few stones but dust not water followed in despair they crowded into the wooden turrets which surmounted the temple and poured down stones javelins and burning arrows upon the spaniards as they came swarming up the steps but the fiery shower fell harmlessly upon the steel headpieces of the soldiers and they used the blazing shafts to set fire to the wooden towers so that the wretched natives either perished in the flames or threw themselves headlong from the parapet in the fair city lately so peaceful and prosperous all was confusion and slaughter burning and plundering the division of spoil was greatly simplified by the fact that the tlascalans desired wearingapparel and provisions far more than gold or jewels they also took hundreds of prisoners but these corts afterwards induced them to release the work of destruction had gone on for some hours before the general yielded to the entreaties of the cholulan chiefs who had been saved from the massacre and of the mexican envoys and called off his men putting a stop as well as he could to further violence two of the caciques were also permitted to go to their countrymen with offers of pardon and protection to all who would return to their obedience and so by degrees the tumult was appeased presently corts helped the cholulans to choose a successor to their principal cacique who was among the slain and confidence being thus restored the people from the country round began to flock in the markets were again opened and the ordinary life of the city resumed though the black and smouldering ruins remained to tell the sad tale of the massacre of cholula this terrible vengeance made a great impression upon the natives and none trembled more than the mexican monarch upon his throne among the mountains he felt his empire melting away from him like a morning mist for some of the most important cities overawed by the fate of cholula now sent envoys to the spanish camp tendering their allegiance and trying to secure the favour of the conqueror by rich gifts of gold and slaves again did montezuma seek counsel from his gods but the answers he obtained were far from reassuring and he determined to send another embassy to corts to declare that he had nothing to do with the conspiracy at cholula as usual the envoys were charged with a splendid present of golden vessels and ornaments and among other things were artificial birds made in imitation of turkeys with plumage of worked gold there were also fifteen hundred robes of delicate cotton cloth the emperors message expressed regret for the late catastrophe and denied all knowledge of the plot which had he said brought a retribution upon its authors which they richly deserved and he explained the presence of the aztec force in the neighbourhood by saying that there was a disturbance that had to be quelled more than a fortnight had passed since the spaniards entered cholula and the general had after the city was once more restored to order tried to induce the people to give up their false gods but this they would not do willingly however he seized upon the great teocalli of which all the woodwork had been burned and built a church of the stone that remained and he opened the cages in which the wretched victims about to be sacrificed were imprisoned and restored them to liberty and then he thought it time to begin the march to mexico once more so the allied army of spaniards and tlascalans set out upon their journey through luxuriant plains and flourishing plantations met occasionally by embassies from different towns anxious to claim the protection of the white men and bringing rich gifts of gold to propitiate them they passed between the two enormous mountain peaks popocatapetl the hill that smokes and iztaccihuatl the white woman and presently encountered a blinding snowstorm from which they found shelter in one of the large stone buildings put up by the mexicans for the use of travellers and couriers and here they encamped for the night the next morning they reached the top of a range of hills where progress was comparatively easy and they had not gone far when turning sharply round the shoulder of a hill they saw spread out before them the lovely mexican valley the clearness of the air enabled them to see distinctly the shining cities the lakes woods fields and gardens and in the midst of all the fair city of mexico rose as it were from the waters of the great lake with its towers and temples white and gleaming and behind it the royal hill of chapoltepec the residence of the mexican kings crowned with the very same gigantic cypress trees which to this day fling their broad shadows across the land the spaniards gazed in rapture over the gay scene exclaiming it is the promised land but presently the evidences of a power and civilisation so far superior to anything they had yet encountered disheartened the more timid among them they shrank from the unequal contest and begged to be led back again to vera cruz but this was not the effect produced upon corts by the glorious prospect his desire for treasure and love of adventure were sharpened by the sight of the dazzling spoil at his very feet and with threats arguments and entreaties he revived the drooping spirits of his soldiers and by the aid of his brave captains succeeded in once more rousing them to enthusiasm and the march down the slope of the hill was gaily resumed illustration with every step of their progress the woods became thinner and villages were seen in green and sheltered nooks the inhabitants of which came out to meet and welcome the spaniards everywhere corts heard with satisfaction complaints of the cruelty and injustice of montezuma and he encouraged the natives to rely on his protection as he had come to redress their wrongs the army advanced but slowly and was soon met by another embassy from the emperor consisting of several aztec lords bringing a rich gift of gold and robes of delicate furs and feathers and offering four loads of gold to the general and one to each of his captains with a yearly tribute to the spanish sovereign if they would even then turn back from mexico but corts replied that he could not answer it to his sovereign if he were to return without visiting the emperor in his capital the spaniards came in the spirit of peace as montezuma would see for himself but should their presence prove burdensome to him it would be very easy for them to relieve him of it this embassy had been intended to reach the spaniards before they crossed the mountains and the dismay of the aztec emperor was great when he learned that it had failed and that the dreaded strangers were actually on their march across the valley they were so utterly unlike anything he had ever known before these strange beings who seemed to have dropped from another planet and by their superior knowledge and more deadly weapons overcome the hitherto unconquerable nations though a mere handful of men in comparison to the swarms of his own countrymen he felt himself to be the victim of a destiny from which nothing could save him all peace power and security seemed to be gone from him and in despair he shut himself up in his palace refusing food and trying by prayers and sacrifices to wring some favour from his gods but the oracles were dumb then he called a council of his chief nobles but a great difference of opinion arose amongst them cacama the emperors nephew king of tezcuco counselled him to receive the spaniards courteously as ambassadors of a foreign prince while cuitlahua his brother urged him to muster his forces and then and there drive back the invaders or die in the defence of his capital but montezuma could not rouse himself for this struggle he exclaimed in deep dejection of what avail is resistance when the gods have declared themselves against us yet i mourn for the old and infirm the women and children too feeble to fight or fly for myself and the brave men around me we must face the storm as best we may and he straightway sent off a last embassy with his nephew at its head to meet the spaniards and welcome them to mexico by this time the army had reached the first of the towns built on piles driven into the lake and were delighted with its fine stone houses with canals between them instead of streets up and down which boats passed continually laden with all kinds of merchandise though received with great hospitality corts still was strictly on his guard and neglected no precaution for the security of his men before he left this place a messenger came requesting him to wait for the arrival of the king of tezcuco who very soon afterwards appeared borne in a palanquin richly decorated with plates of gold and precious stones having pillars curiously wrought which supported a canopy of green plumes he was accompanied by a numerous retinue of nobles and inferior attendants and when he came into the presence of corts he descended from his palanquin and advanced towards him his officers sweeping the ground before him as he did so the prince was a handsome young man erect and dignified he made the usual mexican salutation to people of high rank touching the earth with his right hand and raising it to his head and said that he came as the representative of montezuma to bid the spaniards welcome to mexico and presented the general with three pearls of uncommon size and lustre corts embraced him and in return threw over his neck a chain of cut glass after this exchange of courtesies and the most friendly and respectful assurances on the part of corts the indian prince withdrew leaving the spaniards much impressed by his superiority in state and bearing to anything they had before seen in the country resuming their march along the southern shore of lake chalco through splendid woods and orchards glowing with unknown fruits the army came at length to a great dyke or causeway four or five miles long which divided the lake chalco from xochicalco on the west it was a lance in breadth at the narrowest part and in some places wide enough for eight horsemen to ride abreast and was solidly built of stone and lime as they passed along it they saw multitudes of indians darting up and down the lake in their light pirogues eager to catch a glimpse of the strangers and they were amazed at the sight of the floating islands covered with flowers and vegetables and moving like rafts over the waters all round the margin and occasionally far out in the lake they saw little towns and villages half buried in foliage and the whole scene seemed to them so new and wonderful that they could only compare it to the magical pictures of the old romances midway across the lake the army halted at the town of cuitlahuae which was not large but was remarkable for the beauty of its buildings the curiosity of the indians increased as the spaniards proceeded and they clambered up the causeway and lined the sides of the road so that the troops were quite embarrassed by them and corts was obliged to resort to commands and even menaces to clear a passage he found as he neared the capital a considerable change in the feeling shown towards the government and heard only of the pomp and magnificence of montezuma and nothing of his oppressions from the causeway the army descended on a narrow point of land which lay between the two lakes and crossing it reached the royal residence of iztapalapan this place was governed by the emperors brother who to do greater honour to corts had invited the neighbouring lords to be present at his reception and at the banquet which followed the spaniards were struck with admiration when after the usual ceremonies had been gone through and a gift of gold and costly stuffs had been presented they were led into one of the gorgeous halls of the palace the roof of which was of odorous cedarwood and the stone walls tapestried with brilliant hangings but indeed this was only one of the many beautiful things which they saw in this fairy city there were gardens cunningly planted and watered in every part by means of canals and aqueducts in which grew gorgeous flowers and luscious fruits there was an aviary filled with all kinds of birds remarkable for the brilliancy of their plumage and the sweetness of their songs but the most elaborate piece of work was a huge reservoir of stone full of water and stocked with all kinds of fish and by this all the fountains and aqueducts were supplied in this city of enchantment the army rested for the night within sight of the capital into which corts intended to lead them on the morrow the occupation of mexico illustration montezuma greets the spaniards with the first faint streak of dawn on the morning of november the spanish general was astir and mustering his followers and as the sun rose above the eastern mountains he set forth with his little troop of horsemen as a sort of advanced guard the spanish infantry followed then the baggage and finally the dark files of the tlascalan warriors the whole number cannot have amounted to seven thousand of which less than four hundred were spaniards for a short distance the army kept along the narrow tongue of land between the lakes and then entered upon the great dyke which crosses the salt waters of lake tezcuco to the very gates of the capital it was wide enough all the way for ten horsemen to ride abreast and from it the spaniards could see many towns and villages some upon the shores of the lake some built upon piles running far out into its waters these cities were evidently crowded with a thriving population and contained many temples and other important buildings which were covered with a hard white stucco glistening like enamel in the sunshine the lake was darkened with a swarm of canoes filled with indians who were eager to gaze upon the strangers and here and there floated those fairy islands of flowers which rose and fell with every undulation of the water and yet were substantial enough to support trees of a considerable size at the distance of half a league from the capital they encountered a solid fortification like a curtain of stone which was built across the dyke it was twelve feet high and had a tower at each end and in the centre a battlemented gateway through which the troops passed this place was called the fort of xoloc and was afterwards occupied by corts in the famous siege of mexico here they were met by several hundred aztec chiefs in their gay and fanciful costume some of them wore broad mantles of delicate feather embroidery and collars and bracelets of turquoise mosaic with which fine plumage was curiously mingled while their ears underlips and sometimes even their noses were adorned with pendants of precious stones or crescents of fine gold after the usual formal salutations which caused some delay the march was resumed and the army presently reached a wooden drawbridge which crossed an opening in the dyke meant to serve as an outlet for the water should it for any reason rise beyond its usual height as they left this bridge behind them the spaniards felt that they were indeed committing themselves to the mercy of montezuma who might by means of it cut them off from communication with the country and hold them prisoners in his capital they now beheld the glittering retinue of the emperor emerging from the great street which led through the heart of the city amidst a crowd of indian nobles preceded by three officers of state bearing golden wands they saw the royal palanquin blazing with burnished gold it was borne on the shoulders of nobles and over it a canopy of gorgeous featherwork powdered with jewels and fringed with silver was supported by four attendants also of high rank who were barefooted and walked with a slow measured pace with their eyes bent upon the ground as soon as the procession had come within a short distance of the spaniards the emperor descended from his palanquin and advanced under the canopy leaning upon the arms of his nephew and his brother the ground before him was strewn with cotton tapestry by his attendants and the natives who lined the sides of the causeway bent forward with their eyes fixed upon the ground as he passed whilst some of the humbler class prostrated themselves before him montezuma wore the usual broad girdle and square cloak of the finest cotton on his feet were sandals with soles of gold and leathern thongs ornamented with the same metal both cloak and sandals were sprinkled with pearls and precious stones principally emeralds and the green chalchivitl which was more highly esteemed by the aztecs than any jewel on his head he wore only a plume of royal green feathers a badge of his military rank he was at this time about forty years of age and was tall and thin and of a lighter complexion than is usual among his countrymen he moved with dignity and there was a benignity in his whole demeanour which was not to have been anticipated from the reports of his character which had reached the spaniards the army halted as montezuma drew near and corts dismounted and advanced to meet him with a few of the principal cavaliers the emperor received him with princely courtesy and expressed his satisfaction at seeing him in his capital corts responded by the most profound expressions of respect and gratitude for all montezumas munificence to the spaniards he then hung round the emperors neck a chain of coloured crystal making at the same time a movement as if to embrace him but was restrained by the two aztec lords who were shocked at the idea of such presumption montezuma then appointed his brother to conduct the spaniards to their quarters in the city and again entering his litter was borne off amid prostrate crowds in the same state in which he had come the spaniards quickly followed and with colours flying and music playing entered the southern portion of the city of mexico the great wide street facing the causeway stretched for some miles in nearly a straight line through the centre of the city in the clear atmosphere of the tableland it was easy to see the blue mountains in the distance beyond the temples houses and gardens which stood on either side of it but what most impressed the spaniards was the swarm of people who thronged every street canal and roof and filled every window and doorway to the aztecs it must indeed have been a strange sensation when they beheld the fairfaced strangers and for the first time heard their wellpaved streets ringing under the iron tramp of the horses those unknown animals which they regarded with superstitious terror but their wonder changed to anger when they saw their detested enemies the tlascalans stalking through their city with looks of ferocity and defiance as they passed along the troops frequently crossed bridges which spanned some of the numerous canals and at length they halted in a wide open space near the centre of the city close to the huge temple of the wargod facing the western gate of the temple enclosure stood a range of low stone buildings spreading over a large extent of ground once a palace belonging to the emperors father this was to be the lodging of the spaniards montezuma himself was waiting in the courtyard to receive them approaching corts he took from one of his slaves a massive collar made of the shells of a kind of crawfish much prized by the indians set in gold and connected by heavy golden links from this hung eight finelyworked ornaments each a span long made to resemble the crawfish but of fine gold this gorgeous collar he hung round the neck of the general saying this palace belongs to you malinche this was the name by which he always addressed him and your brethren rest after your fatigues for you have much need to do so in a little while i will visit you again so saying he withdrew with his attendants the generals first care was to inspect his new quarters the rooms were of great size and afforded accommodation for the whole army the tlascalans probably encamping in the outer courts the best apartments were hung with draperies of gaily coloured cotton and the floors were covered with mats or rushes there were also low stools carved from single pieces of wood and most of the rooms had beds made of the palmleaf woven into a thick mat with coverlets and sometimes canopies of cotton the general after a rapid survey assigned his troops their respective quarters and took as vigilant precautions for security as if he expected a siege he planted his cannon so as to command the approaches to the palace stationed sentinels along the walls and ordered that no soldier should leave his quarters under pain of death after all these precautions he allowed his men to enjoy the banquet prepared for them this over the emperor came again attended by a few nobles he was received with great deference by corts and with marinas aid they conversed while the aztecs and the cavaliers stood around in respectful silence montezuma made many inquiries concerning the country of the spaniards its sovereign and its government and especially asked their reasons for visiting mexico corts replied that they had desired to see its great monarch and to declare to him the true faith professed by the christians the emperor showed himself to be fully acquainted with all the doings of the spaniards since their landing and was curious as to their rank in their own country he also learned the names of the principal cavaliers and their position in the army at the conclusion of the interview the aztecs brought forward a gift of cotton robes enough to supply every man even including the tlascalans and gold chains and ornaments which were distributed in profusion among the spaniards that evening corts ordered a general discharge of artillery and the noise of the guns and the volumes of smoke filled the superstitious aztecs with dismay reminding them of the explosions of the great volcano on the following morning he asked permission to return the emperors visit and montezuma sent officers to conduct the spaniards to his presence illustration corts in the temple of huitzilopochtli on reaching the hall of audience the mexican officers took off their sandals and covered their gay attire with mantles of nequen a coarse stuff made from the fibres of the aloe and worn only by the poorest classes for it was thus humbly that all excepting the members of his own family approached the sovereign then with downcast eyes and formal obeisance they ushered the spaniards into the royal presence they found montezuma surrounded by a few of his favourite chiefs and were kindly received by him and corts soon began upon the subject uppermost in his thoughts setting forth as clearly as he could the mysteries of his faith and assuring montezuma his idols would sink him in perdition but the emperor only listened calmly and showed no sign of being convinced he had no doubt he said that the god of the spaniards was good but his own gods were good also what corts told him of the creation of the world was like what he had been taught to believe it was not worth while to discuss the matter farther he added that his ancestors were not the original possessors of his land but had been led there by the great being who after giving them laws and ruling over them for a time had withdrawn to the region where the sun rises declaring on his departure that he or his descendants would some day come again and reign the wonderful deeds of the spaniards their fair faces and the quarter whence they came all showed that they were his descendants if montezuma had resisted their visit to his capital it was because he had heard that they were cruel that they sent the lightning to consume his people or crushed them to pieces under the hard feet of the ferocious animals on which they rode he was now convinced that these were idle tales that the spaniards were kind and generous mortals indeed but of a different race from the aztecs wiser and more valiant you too he added with a smile have perhaps been told that i am a god and dwell in palaces of gold and silver but you see it is false my houses though large are of wood and stone and as to my body he said baring his tawny arm you see it is flesh and bone like yours it is true that i have a great empire inherited from my ancestors lands and gold and silver but your sovereign beyond the waters is i know the rightful lord of all i rule in his name you malinche are his ambassador you and your brethren shall share these things with me rest now from your labours you are here in your own dwellings and everything shall be provided for your subsistence i will see that your wishes shall be obeyed in the same way as my own corts while he encouraged the idea that his own sovereign was the great being as montezuma believed assured him that his master had no desire to interfere with his authority otherwise than out of concern for his welfare to effect his conversion and that of his people to christianity before the emperor dismissed his visitors rich stuffs and ornaments of gold were distributed among them so that the poorest soldier received at least two heavy collars of gold and on their homeward way they could talk of nothing but the generosity and courtesy of the indian monarch but the general was harassed by many anxious thoughts he had not been prepared to find so much luxury civilisation and power he was in the heart of a great capital which seemed like an extensive fortification with its dykes and drawbridges where every house might be converted into a castle at a nod from the sovereign all communication with the rest of the country might be cut off and the whole warlike population be at once hurled upon himself and his handful of followers and against such odds of what avail would be his superior science as to the conquest of the empire now he had seen the capital it must have seemed to him a more doubtful enterprise than ever but at any rate his best policy was to foster the superstitious reverence in which he was held by both prince and people and to find out all he could about the city and its inhabitants to this end he asked the emperors permission to visit the principal public buildings which was readily granted montezuma even arranging to meet him at the great temple corts put himself at the head of his cavalry and followed by nearly all the spanish foot set out under the guidance of several caciques sent by montezuma they led him to the great teocalli near their own quarters it stood in the midst of a vast space which was surrounded by a wall of stone and lime about eight feet high ornamented on the outer side by raised figures of serpents which gave it the name of the coatepantli or wall of serpents this wall was pierced by huge battlemented gateways opening upon the four principal streets of the city and over each gate was a kind of arsenal filled with arms and warlike gear the teocalli itself was of the usual pyramidal shape and five stories high coated on the outside with hewn stones the ascent was by flights of steps on the outside and corts found two priests and several caciques waiting to carry him up them as they had just carried the emperor but the general declined this compliment preferring to march up at the head of his men on reaching the great paved space at the summit the first thing they saw was the stone on which the unhappy victims were stretched for sacrifice at the other end of the platform stood twotowers each three stories high the lower story being of stone the two upper of carved wood in these stood the images of the gods and before each stood an altar upon which blazed the undying fires the putting out of which was supposed to portend so much woe to the nation here also was the huge drum made of serpents skins struck only on extraordinary occasions when it sent forth a melancholy sound that could be heard for miles a sound of woe to the spaniards in after times montezuma attended by a high priest came forward to receive corts after conferring with the priests the emperor conducted the spaniards into the building which was adorned with sculptured figures at one end was a recess with a roof of timber richly carved and gilt and here stood a colossal image of huitzilopochtli the wargod his countenance was hideous in his right hand he held a bow and in his left a bunch of golden arrows which a mystic legend connected with the victories of his people a huge serpent of pearls and precious stones was coiled about his waist and costly jewels were profusely sprinkled over his person on his left foot were the delicate feathers of the hummingbird from which singularly enough he took his name while round his neck hung a chain of gold and silver hearts as an emblem of the sacrifice in which he most delighted indeed even at that moment three bleeding human hearts lay upon the altar before him the next sanctuary was dedicated to tezcatlipoca who they believed had created the earth and watched over it he was represented as a young man and his image of polished black stone was garnished with gold plates and ornaments among which was a shield burnished like a mirror in which he was supposed to see reflected all the doings of the world and before this shrine also lay five hearts in a golden platter from the horrors of this place the spaniards gladly escaped into the open air and corts said turning to montezuma i do not understand how a great and wise prince like you can put faith in such evil spirits as these idols if you will but permit us to erect here the true cross and place the images of the blessed virgin and her son in your sanctuaries you will soon see how your false gods will shrink before them montezuma was greatly shocked at this speech these said he are the gods who have led the aztecs on to victory since they were a nation and who send us the seed time and harvest had i thought you would have offered them this outrage i would not have admitted you into their presence corts then took his leave expressing concern for having wounded the feelings of the emperor who remained to expiate if possible the crime of having exposed the shrines of his gods to such profanation by the strangers on descending into the court the spaniards took a leisurely survey of the other buildings in the enclosure there were several other teocallis but much smaller ones in which the spaniards saw implements of sacrifice and many other horrors and there was also a great mound with a timber framework upon its summit upon which were strung hundreds of thousands of skulls those of the victims who had been sacrificed schools granaries gardens and fountains filled up the remainder of the enclosed space which seemed a complete city in itself containing a mixture of barbarism and civilisation altogether characteristic of the aztec nation the next day the spaniards asked permission to convert one of the halls in their palace into a chapel where they might hold the services of their church the request was granted and while the work was in progress some of them discovered what seemed to be a door recently plastered over as there was a rumour that montezuma kept the treasures of his father in this palace they did not scruple to gratify their curiosity by removing the plaster and forcing open the door which it concealed when they beheld a great hall filled with rich and beautiful stuffs articles of curious workmanship of various kinds gold and silver in bars or just as it had been dug from the earth and many jewels of great value i was a young man says one of the spaniards who was allowed a sight of the treasure and it seemed to me that all the riches of the world were in that room by corts order the wall was built up again and strict injunctions were given that the discovery should be kept a profound secret the spaniards had now been a week in mexico and the generals anxieties increased daily corts resolved upon a bold stroke calling a council of his officers he laid his difficulties before them and ignoring the opinion of some who advised an immediate retreat he proposed to march to the royal palace and by persuasion or force to induce montezuma to take up his abode in the spanish quarters once having obtained possession of his person it would be easy to rule in his name by allowing him a show of sovereignty until they had taken measures to secure their own safety and the success of their enterprise a pretext for the seizure of the emperor was afforded by a circumstance which had come to the ears of corts while he was still in cholula don juan de escalante who had been left in charge of the spanish settlement at vera cruz had received a message from an aztec chief called quanhpopoca declaring his desire to come in person and tender his allegiance to the spaniards and requesting that four soldiers might be sent to protect him through the country of an unfriendly tribe this was not an uncommon request and the soldiers were sent but on their arrival two of them were treacherously murdered by the aztec the others escaped and made their way back to the garrison the commander at once marched with fifty of his men and some thousands of indians to take vengeance upon the cacique and though his allies fled before the mexicans the few spaniards stood firm and by the aid of their firearms made good the field against the enemy unfortunately seven or eight of them were killed including escalante himself and the indians who were taken prisoners declared that the whole proceeding had been by montezumas orders one of the spaniards fell into the hands of the enemy but soon died from his wounds he happened to be a very big man of ferocious appearance and when his head was sent to montezuma the aztec emperor gazed upon it with a shudder and commanded that it should be taken out of the city and not offered at the shrine of any of his gods he seemed to see in those terrible features a prophecy of his sure destruction the bolder spirits among the cavaliers approved of the generals plan and the next day having asked an audience of montezuma corts made the necessary arrangements for his enterprise the principal part of his force was drawn up in the courtyard one detachment was stationed in the avenue leading to the palace to prevent any attempt at rescue by the citizens twentyfive or thirty soldiers were ordered to drop in at the palace by twos and threes as if accidentally and he took with him five cavaliers on whose coolness and courage he could rely that they should all be in full armour excited no suspicion it was too common an occurrence the spaniards were graciously received by the emperor who by the aid of interpreters held a gay conversation with them and as usual presented them with gold and jewels he paid corts the compliment of offering him one of his daughters in marriage an honour which was respectfully declined on the ground that he already had one wife but as soon as the general saw that his soldiers had all come upon the scene he abruptly changed his tone and accused the emperor of being the author of the treacherous proceedings on the coast montezuma listened in surprise and declared that such an act could only have been imputed to him by his enemies corts pretended to believe him but said that quanhpopoca and his accomplices must be sent for that they might be dealt with after their deserts montezuma agreed and taking his royal signet from his wrist gave it to one of his nobles with orders to show it to the aztec governor and require his immediate presence in the capital and in case of his resistance to call in the aid of the neighbouring towns when the messenger had gone corts assured the emperor that he was now convinced of his innocence in the matter but that it was necessary that his own sovereign should be equally convinced of it nothing would promote this so much as for montezuma to transfer his residence to the palace occupied by the spaniards as this would show a condescension and personal regard for them which would absolve him from all suspicion the emperor listened to this proposal with profound amazement exclaiming with resentment and offended dignity when was it ever heard that a great prince like myself willingly left his own palace to become a prisoner in the hands of strangers corts declared that he would not go as a prisoner but would be simply changing his residence if i should consent to such degradation he cried my subjects never would when further pressed he offered one of his sons and two of his daughters as hostages so that he might be spared this disgrace two hours passed in this fruitless discussion till velasquez de leon impatient of the long delay and seeing that to fail in the attempt must ruin them cried out why do we waste words on this barbarian let us seize him and if he resists plunge our swords into his body the fierce tone and menacing gesture alarmed the emperor who asked marina what the angry spaniard said she explained as gently as she could beseeching him to accompany the white men who would treat him with all respect and kindness while if he refused he would but expose himself to violence perhaps to death this last appeal shook the resolution of montezuma looking round for support and sympathy he saw only the stern faces and mailclad forms of the spaniards and felt that his hour had indeed come in a scarcely audible voice he consented to accompany them and orders were given for the royal litter to be brought the nobles who bore and attended it could hardly credit their senses but now montezuma had consented to go pride made him wish to appear to go willingly as the royal retinue marched dejectedly down the avenue escorted by the spaniards the people ran together in crowds declaring that the emperor had been carried off by force and a tumult would have arisen had not he himself called out to them to disperse since he was of his own accord visiting his friends and on reaching the spanish quarters he sent out his nobles to the mob with similar assurances bidding them all return to their homes he was received with ostentatious respect by the spaniards and chose the apartments which pleased him best which were speedily furnished with tapestry featherwork and all other indian luxuries he was attended by his own household and his meals were served with the usual pomp and ceremony while not even the general himself approached him without due obeisance or sat down in his presence uninvited nevertheless it was but too clear to his people that he was a prisoner for day and night the palace was guarded by sixty sentinels in front and sixty in the rear while another body was stationed in the royal antechamber this was the state of affairs when quanhpopoca arrived from the coast montezuma received him coldly and referred the matter to corts who speedily made an end of it by condemning the unhappy chief and his followers to be burnt to death the funeral piles were erected in the courtyard before the palace and were made of arrows javelins and other weapons drawn by the emperors permission from those stored round the great teocalli to crown these extraordinary proceedings corts just before the executions took place entered the emperors apartments followed by a soldier bearing fetters in his hands sternly he again accused montezuma of having been the original contriver of the treacherous deed and said that a crime which merited death in a subject must in some way be atoned for even by a king whereupon he ordered the soldier to fasten the fetters upon montezumas ankles and after coolly waiting until it was done turned his back and quitted the room the emperor was speechless under this last insult like one struck down by a heavy blow but though he offered no resistance low moans broke from him which showed the anguish of his spirit his faithful attendants did their utmost to console him holding his feet in their arms and trying to keep the irons from touching him by inserting their own robes but it was not the bodily discomfort that so afflicted him but the feeling that he was no more a king and so utterly broken in spirit was he that when corts came after the execution had taken place and with his own hands unclasped the irons montezuma actually thanked him as if for some great and unmerited favour not long after the spanish general expressed his willingness that the emperor should if he wished return to his own palace but montezuma declined the offer doubtless fearing to trust himself again to the haughty and ferocious chieftains who could not but despise the cowardly proceedings of their master so unlike the usual conduct of an aztec monarch montezuma often amused himself with seeing the spanish troops go through their exercises or with playing at some of the national games with corts and his officers a favourite one was called totoloque played with golden balls which were thrown at a golden target and the emperor always staked precious stones or ingots of gold and won or lost with equal goodhumour and indeed it did not much matter to him since if he did win he gave away his gains to his attendants but while montezuma thus resigned himself without a struggle to a life of captivity some of his kinsmen were feeling very differently about the matter and especially his nephew cacama lord of the tezcuco and second in power to montezuma himself illustration this prince saw with alarm and indignation his uncles abject submission to the spaniards and endeavoured to form a league with the other chiefs to rescue him out of their hands but they from jealousy declined to join him declaring themselves unwilling to do anything without the emperors sanction these plots came to the ears of corts who wished at once to march upon tezcuco and stamp out this spark of rebellion but montezuma dissuaded him he therefore sent a friendly message of expostulation which met with a haughty response and to a second message asserting the supremacy of the king of spain cacama replied that he acknowledged no such authority he knew nothing of the spanish sovereign or his people nor did he wish to know anything of them when montezuma sent to him to come to mexico that this difference might be adjusted he answered that he understood the position of his uncle and that when he did visit the capital it would be to rescue it as well as the emperor himself and their common gods from bondage to drive out the detested strangers who had brought such dishonour on their country this reply made corts very angry but montezuma anxious to prevent bloodshed begged him still to refrain from declaring war against cacama saying that it would be better to obtain possession of him personally which he could easily do by means of several tezcucan nobles who were in his own pay so cacama was enticed by these faithless chiefs into a villa overhanging the lake where he was easily overpowered and forced into a boat which speedily brought him to mexico corts promptly fettered and imprisoned him while montezuma declared that he had by his rebellion forfeited his kingdom and appointed his brother a mere boy to reign in his stead now corts felt himself powerful enough to demand that montezuma and all his nobles should formally swear allegiance to the spanish sovereigns and accordingly the emperor assembled his principal caciques and briefly stated to them the object for which he had summoned them you all know said he our ancient tradition how the great being who once ruled over the land declared that he would one day return and reign again that time has now arrived the white men have come from the land beyond the ocean where the sun rises sent by their master to reclaim the obedience of his ancient subjects i am ready for my part to acknowledge his authority you have been faithful vassals of mine all the years that i have sat upon the throne of my fathers i now expect that you will show me a last act of obedience by acknowledging the great king beyond the waters to be your lord also and that you will pay him tribute as you have hitherto done to me as he spoke the tears fell fast down his cheeks and his nobles were deeply affected by the sight of his distress many of them coming from a distance and not having realised what was taking place in the capital were filled with astonishment on beholding the voluntary abasement of their master whom they had reverenced as the allpowerful lord of the whole country his will they told him was their law now as ever and if he thought the sovereign of the strangers was the ancient lord of their country they were willing to swear allegiance to him as such accordingly the oaths were administered with all due solemnity and a full record of the proceedings was drawn up by the royal notary to be sent to spain corts now seemed to have accomplished most of the great objects of his expedition but towards the conversion of the natives he had made no progress and still the horrible sacrifices took place day by day the general could bear it no longer but told the emperor that the christians could not consent to hold the services of their religion shut in within the narrow walls of the garrison they wished to spread its light abroad and share its blessings with the people to this end they requested that the great teocalli should be given up to them as a fit place where their worship might be conducted in the presence of the whole city montezuma listened in consternation malinche said he why will you push matters to an extremity that must surely bring down the vengeance of our gods and stir up an insurrection among my people who will never endure this profanation of their temple corts seeing that he was much agitated pretended that the demand had come from his followers and that he would endeavour to persuade them to be contented with one of the sanctuaries of the teocalli if that were not granted they should be obliged to take it by force and to throw down the idols in the face of the city montezuma still greatly disturbed promised to confer with the priests and in the end the spaniards were allowed to take possession of one of the sanctuaries in which when it had been purified an altar was raised surmounted by a crucifix and the imago of the virgin its walls were decorated with garlands of fresh flowers and an old soldier was stationed to watch over it then the whole army moved in solemn procession up the winding ascent of the pyramid and mass was celebrated by father olmedo and another priest while the aztecs looked on with mingled curiosity and repugnance for a nation will endure any outrage sooner than that which attacks its religion and this profanation touched a feeling in the natives which the priests were not slow to take advantage of soon the spaniards noticed a change in montezuma he was grave instead of cheerful and avoided their society many conferences went on between him and the priests and nobles at which even orteguilla his favourite page was not allowed to be present presently corts received a summons to appear before the emperor who told him that his predictions had come to pass his gods were offended and threatened to forsake the city if the sacrilegious strangers were not driven from it or sacrificed on their altars as an expiation if you have any regard for your safety he continued you will leave the country without delay i have only to raise my finger and every aztec in the land will rise against you corts knew well enough that this was true but concealing his dismay he replied that he should much regret to leave the capital so precipitately especially when he had no ships to take him back to his own country he should also regret that if he quitted it under these circumstances he should be driven to taking the emperor with him montezuma was evidently troubled by this last suggestion and finally offered to send workmen to the coast to build ships under the direction of the spaniards while he restrained the impatience of his people with the assurance that the white men would leave their land as soon as they were ready this was accordingly done and the work went forward at vera cruz with great apparent alacrity but those who directed it took care to interpose as many delays as possible while corts hoped in the meantime to receive such reinforcements from spain as should enable him to hold his ground nevertheless the whole aspect of affairs in the spanish quarters was utterly changed apprehension had taken the place of security and as many precautions were observed as if the garrison was actually in a state of siege such was the unpleasant state of affairs when in may six months after his arrival in the capital corts received tidings from the coast which caused him greater alarm than even the threatened insurrection of the aztecs the jealous governor of cuba was sending an expedition to attack corts it was the news of the arrival of this fleet at the place where he had himself landed at first that had caused corts so much consternation for he at once suspected that it was sent by his bitter enemy the governor the commander of this second expedition who was called narvaez having landed soon met with a spaniard from one of the exploring parties sent out by corts this man related all that had occurred since the spanish envoys left vera cruz the march into the interior the furious battles with the tlascalans the occupation of mexico the rich treasures found in it and the seizure of montezuma whereby said the soldier corts rules over the land like its own sovereign so that a spaniard may travel unarmed from one end of the country to the other without insult or injury narvaez and his followers listened in speechless amazement to this marvellous report and the leader waxed more and more indignant at the thought of all that had been snatched from velasquez whose adherent he was he now openly proclaimed his intention of marching against corts and punishing him so that even the natives who had flocked to this new camp comprehended that these white men were enemies of those who had come before narvaez proposed to establish a colony in the barren sandy spot which corts had abandoned and when informed of the existence of villa rica he sent to demand the submission of the garrison sandoval had kept a sharp eye upon the movements of narvaez from the time that his ships had first appeared upon the horizon and when he heard of his having landed he prepared to defend his post to the last extremity but the only invaders of villa rica were a priest named guevara and four other spaniards who formally addressed sandoval pompously enumerating the services and claims of velasquez taxing corts with rebellion and finally demanding that sandoval should tender his submission to narvaez that officer greatly exasperated promptly seized the unlucky priest and his companions and remarking that they might read the obnoxious proclamation to the general himself in mexico ordered them to be bound like bales of goods upon the backs of sturdy porters and placed under a guard of twenty spaniards and in this way travelling day and night only stopping to obtain relays of carriers they came within sight of the capital at the end of the fourth day its inhabitants were already aware of the fresh arrival of white men upon the coast indeed montezuma had sent for corts and told him there was no longer any obstacle to his leaving the country as a fleet was ready for him and in answer to his astonished inquiries had shown him a picture map sent him from the coast whereon the spaniards with their ships and equipments were minutely depicted corts pretended to be vastly pleased by this intelligence and the tidings were received in the camp with firing of cannon and other demonstrations of joy for the soldiers took the newcomers for a reinforcement from spain not so corts who guessed from the first that they came from the governor of cuba he told his suspicions to his officers who in turn informed the men but though alarm succeeded their joy they resolved to stand by their leader come what might when sandovals letter acquainting him with all particulars was brought to corts he instantly sent and released the bewildered prisoners from their ignominious position and furnished them with horses to make their entry into the capital where by treating them with the utmost courtesy and loading them with gifts he speedily converted them from enemies into friends and obtained from them much important information respecting the designs of narvaez and the feelings of his army he gathered that gold was the great object of the soldiers who were evidently willing to cooperate with corts if by so doing they could obtain it indeed they had no particular regard for their own leader who was arrogant and by no means liberal profiting by these important hints the general sent a conciliatory letter to narvaez beseeching him not to unsettle the natives by a show of animosity when it was only by union they could hope for success and declaring that for his part he was ready to greet narvaez as a brother in arms to share with him the fruits of conquest and if he could produce a royal commission to submit to his authority of course corts knew well enough that he had no such commission to show soon after the departure of guevara he resolved to send a special envoy of his own and chose father olmedo for the task with instructions to converse privately with as many of the officers and soldiers as he could with a view to securing their goodwill and to this end he was also provided with a liberal supply of gold during this time narvaez had abandoned his idea of planting a colony on the seacoast and had marched inland and taken up his quarters at cempoalla he received the letter of corts with scorn which changed to stern displeasure when guevara enlarged upon the power of his rival and urged him to accept his friendly offers but the troops on the other hand listened with greedy ears to the accounts of corts his frank and liberal manners and the wealth of his camp where the meanest soldier could stake his ingot and his chain of gold at play and where all revelled in plenty and when father olmedo arrived his eloquence and his gifts soon created a party in the interest of corts this could not go on so secretly as not to excite the suspicions of narvaez and the worthy priest was sent back to his master but the seed which he had sown was left to grow narvaez continued to speak of corts as a traitor whom he intended to punish and he also declared he would release montezuma from captivity and restore him to his throne it was rumoured that the aztec monarch had sent him a rich gift and entered into correspondence with him all this was observed by the watchful eye of sandoval whose spies frequented his enemys camp and he presently sent to corts saying that something must speedily be done to prevent villa rica from falling into the hands of the enemy and pointing out that many of the indians from sheer perplexity were no longer to be relied upon the general felt that it was indeed time to act but the situation was one of great difficulty however he marched against narvaez defeated and captured him embodied his forces and set out on his return to mexico where he had left alvarado in command on his march he received a letter from alvarado which conveyed the startling news that the mexicans were up in arms and had assaulted the spanish quarters that they had overwhelmed the garrison with a torrent of missiles which had killed some and wounded many and had burned some brigantines which corts had built to secure a means of retreat and it ended by imploring him to hasten to the relief of his men if he would save them or keep his hold on the capital this was a heavy blow to corts but there was no time for hesitation he laid the matter fully before his soldiers and all declared their readiness to follow him on june the army reached the same causeway by which they had before entered the capital but now no crowds lined the roads and no pirogues swarmed upon the lake a deathlike stillness brooded over the scene as they marched across corts ordered the trumpets to sound and their shrill notes were answered by a joyful peal of artillery from the beleaguered fortress the soldiers quickened their pace and all were soon in the city once more but here the appearance of things was far from reassuring in many places they saw the smaller bridges had been taken away the town seemed deserted and the tramp of the horses awakened melancholy echoes in the deserted streets when they reached the palace the great gates were speedily thrown open and corts and his party were eagerly welcomed by the garrison who had much to tell and to hear of course the generals first inquiry was as to the origin of the tumult and this was the story he heard the aztec festival called the incensing of huitzilopochtli was about to be celebrated in which as it was an important one nearly all the nobles took part the caciques asked the permission of alvarado to perform their rites in the teocalli which contained the chapel of the spaniards and to be allowed the presence of montezuma this latter request was refused but he consented to their using the teocalli provided they came unarmed and held no human sacrifice accordingly on the day appointed the aztecs assembled to the number of at least six hundred they wore their magnificent gala costumes with mantles of featherwork sprinkled with precious stones and collars bracelets and ornaments of gold alvarado and his men fully armed attended as spectators and when the hapless natives were engaged in one of their ceremonial dances they fell upon them suddenly sword in hand then followed a great and dreadful slaughter unarmed and taken unawares the aztecs were hewn down without resistance those who attempted to escape by climbing the wall of serpents were speared ruthlessly till presently not one of that gay company remained alive then the spaniards added the crowning horror to their dreadful deed by plundering the bodies of their murdered victims the tidings of the massacre flew like wildfire through the capital and every longsmothered feeling of hostility burst forth in the cry that arose for vengeance the city rose in arms to a man and almost before the spaniards could secure themselves in their defences they were assaulted with desperate fury some of the assailants attempted to scale the walls others succeeded in partially undermining and setting fire to the works it is impossible to say how the attack would have ended but the spaniards entreated montezuma to interfere and he mounting the battlements conjured the furious people to desist from storming the fortress out of regard for his safety they so far respected him that they changed their operations into a regular blockade throwing up works round the palace to prevent the egress of the spaniards and suspending the market so that they might not obtain any supplies and then they sat down to wait sullenly till famine should throw their enemies into their hands the condition of the besieged was gloomy enough true their provisions still held out but they suffered greatly from want of water that within the enclosure being quite brackish until a fresh spring was suddenly discovered in the courtyard even then the fact that scarcely a man had escaped unwounded and that they had no prospect before them but a lingering death by famine or one more dreadful still upon the altar of sacrifice made their situation a very trying one the coming of their comrades was therefore doubly welcome as an explanation of his atrocious act alvarado declared that he had but struck the blow to intimidate the natives and crush an intended rising of the people of which he had received information through his spies corts listened calmly till the story was finished then exclaimed with undisguised displeasure you have done badly you have been false to your trust your conduct has been that of a madman and so saying he turned and left him abruptly no doubt bitterly regretting that he had entrusted so important a command to one whose frank and captivating exterior was but the mask for a rash and cruel nature vexed with his faithless lieutenant and embarrassed by the disastrous consequences of his actions corts for the first time lost his selfcontrol and allowed his disgust and irritation to be plainly seen he treated montezuma with haughty coldness even speaking of him as this dog of a king in the presence of his chiefs and bidding them fiercely go tell their master and his people to open the markets or he would do it for them to their cost the chiefs retired in deep resentment at the insult which they comprehended well enough from his look and gesture and the message lost nothing of its effect in transmission by the suggestion of montezuma corts now released his brother cuitlahua thinking he might allay the tumult and bring about a better state of things but this failed utterly for the prince who was bold and ambitious was bitterly incensed by the injuries he had received from the spaniards moreover he was the heir presumptive to the crown and was welcomed by the people as a substitute for the captive montezuma so being an experienced warrior he set himself to arrange a more efficient plan of operations against the spaniards and the effect was soon visible corts meanwhile had so little doubt of his ability to quench the insurrection that he said as much in the letter that he wrote to the garrison of villa rica informing them of his safe arrival in the capital but his messenger had not been gone halfanhour before he returned breathless with terror and covered with wounds saying that the city was in arms the drawbridges were raised and the enemy would soon be upon them surely enough before long a hoarse sullen roar arose becoming louder and louder till from the parapet surrounding the enclosure the great avenues that led to it could be seen dark with masses of warriors rolling on in a confused tide towards the fortress while at the same time the flat roofs of the neighbouring houses were suddenly covered as if by magic with swarms of menacing figures brandishing their weapons a sight to appal the stoutest heart fighting in mexico when notice was given of the approach of the aztecs each man was soon at his post and prepared to give them a warm reception on they came rushing forward in dense columns each with its gay banner and as they neared the enclosure they set up the hideous yell or shrill whistle used in fight which rose high above the sound of their rude musical instruments they followed this by a tempest of stones darts and arrows which fell thick as rain on the besieged and at the same time those upon the roofs also discharged a blinding volley the spaniards waited until the foremost column was within fire and then with a general discharge of artillery swept the ranks of their assailants mowing them down by hundreds the mexicans for a moment stood aghast but soon rallying swept boldly forward over the prostrate bodies of their comrades a second and third volley checked them and threw their ranks into disorder but still they pressed on letting off clouds of arrows while those on the housetops took deliberate aim at the soldiers in the courtyard soon some of the aztecs succeeded in getting close enough to the wall to be sheltered by it from the fire of the spaniards and they made gallant efforts to scale the parapet but only to be shot down one after another as soon as their heads appeared above the rampart defeated here they tried to effect a breach by battering the wall with heavy pieces of timber but it proved too strong for them and then they shot burning arrows among the temporary buildings in the courtyard several of these took fire and soon a fierce conflagration was raging which was only to be checked by throwing down part of the wall itself and thus laying open a formidable breach this was protected by a battery of heavy guns and a file of arquebusiers who kept up an incessant volley through the opening all day the fight raged with fury and even when night came and the aztecs suspended operations according to their usual custom the spaniards found but little repose being in hourly expectation of an assault early the next morning the combatants returned to the charge corts did not yet realise the ferocity and determination of the mexicans and thought by a vigorous sortie he would reduce them to order and indeed when the gates were thrown open and he sallied out followed by his cavalry supported by a large body of infantry and tlascalans they were taken by surprise and retreated in some confusion behind a barricade which they had thrown up across the street but by the time corts had ordered up his heavy guns and demolished the barrier they had rallied again and though when the fight had raged all day corts was on the whole victorious still he had been so harassed on all sides by the battalions of natives who swarmed in from every side street and lane by those in canoes upon the canal and by the showers of huge stones from those upon the housetops that his losses had been severe earlier in the day he had caused a number of houses to be burned to rid himself of some of his tormentors but the aztecs could probably better afford to lose a hundred men than the spaniards one and the mexican ranks showed no signs of thinning at length exhausted by toil and hunger the spanish commander drew off his men and retreated into his quarters pursued to the last by showers of darts and arrows and when the spaniards reentered their fortress the indians once more encamped round it and though through the night they were inactive still they frequently broke the stillness with menacing cries and insults the gods have delivered you into our hands at last they said huitzilopochtli has long cried for his victims the stone of sacrifice is ready the knives are sharpened the wild beasts in the palace are roaring for their feast these taunts which sounded dismally in the ears of the besieged were mingled with piteous lamentations for montezuma whom they entreated the spaniards to deliver up to them corts was suffering much from a severe wound and from his many anxieties and he determined to induce montezuma to exert his authority to allay the tumult in order to give greater effect to his appearance he put on his imperial robes his mantle of blue and white was held by a rich clasp of the precious chalchivitl which with emeralds of uncommon size set in gold also ornamented other portions of his dress his feet were shod with golden sandals and upon his head he wore the mexican diadem surrounded by a guard of spaniards and preceded by a golden wand the symbol of sovereignty the indian monarch ascended the central turret of the palace his presence was instantly recognised by the people and a magical change came over the scene the clang of the instruments and the fierce cries of the assailants ceased and many in the hushed throng knelt or prostrated themselves while all eyes were turned with eager expectation upon the monarch whom they had been taught to regard with slavish awe montezuma saw his advantage and in the presence of his awestruck people felt once more a king with his former calm authority and confidence he addressed them why do i see my people here in arms against the palace of my fathers is it that you think your sovereign a prisoner and wish to release him if so you have done well but you are mistaken i am no prisoner the strangers are my guests i remain with them only for choice and can leave them when i will have you come to drive them from the city that is unnecessary they will depart of their own accord if you will open a way for them return to your homes then lay down your arms show your obedience to me whose right it is the white men shall go back to their land and all shall be well again within the walls of mexico as montezuma declared himself the friend of the detested strangers a murmur of contempt ran through the multitude their rage and desire for vengeance made them forget their ancient reverence and turned them against their unfortunate monarch base aztec they cried woman coward the white men have made you a woman fit only to weave and spin a chief of high rank brandished a javelin at montezuma as these taunts were uttered and in an instant the place where he stood was assailed with a cloud of stones and arrows the spaniards who had been thrown off their guard by the respect shown by the people on their lords appearance now hastily interposed their shields but it was too late montezuma was wounded by three of the missiles one of which a stone struck him on the head with such violence that he fell senseless to the ground the mexicans shocked at their own sacrilegious act set up a dismal cry and dispersed panicstricken until not one of all the host remained in the great square before the palace meanwhile the unhappy king was borne to his own apartments and as soon as he recovered from his insensibility the full misery of his situation broke upon him he had tasted the last bitterness of degradation he had been reviled and rejected by his people even the meanest of the rabble had raised their hands against him and he had nothing left to live for in vain did corts and his officers endeavour to soothe the anguish of his spirit and encourage him to hope for better things montezuma answered not a word his wounds though dangerous need not have proved fatal had he not refused all remedies tearing off the bandages as often as they were applied and maintaining all the while a determined silence he sat motionless with downcast eyes brooding over his humiliation but from this painful scene the spanish general was soon called away by the new dangers which threatened the garrison illustration montezuma assailed by missiles opposite to the spanish quarters stood the great teocalli of huitzilopochtli rising to a height of nearly a hundred and fifty feet and thus completely commanding the palace occupied by the spaniards a body of five or six hundred mexicans many of them nobles and warriors of the highest rank now took possession of the teocalli whence they discharged such a tempest of arrows upon the garrison that it was impossible for any soldier to show himself for an instant outside his defences without great danger while the mexicans themselves were completely sheltered it was absolutely necessary that they should be dislodged and corts entrusted the task to his chamberlain escobar giving him a hundred men for the purpose but after making three desperate attempts in which he was repulsed with considerable loss this officer returned unsuccessful and corts determined to lead the storming party himself though he was suffering much from a wound which disabled his left hand he made the arm serviceable however by strapping his shield to it and thus prepared sallied forth at the head of three hundred chosen cavaliers and several thousand of the indian allies in the courtyard of the temple a body of mexicans was drawn up to oppose him and he charged them briskly but the horses could not keep their footing on the slippery pavement and many of them fell hastily dismounting the spaniards sent the animals back to their quarters and then renewing the assault had little difficulty in dispersing the indians and securing a passage to the teocalli and now began a great and terrible struggle you will remember that the huge pyramidshaped teocalli was built in five divisions growing smaller and smaller till at the top you came out upon a square platform crowned only by the two sanctuaries in which stood the images of the aztec gods you will also remember that the only ascent was by flights of stone steps on the outside one above another and that it was necessary between each flight to pass by a kind of terrace right round the building so that a distance of nearly a mile had to be traversed before reaching the top corts sprang up the lower stairway followed by alvarado sandoval ordaz and the other gallant cavaliers leaving a strong detachment to hold the enemy in check at the foot of the temple on every terrace as well as on the topmost platform the aztec warriors were drawn up to dispute his passage from their elevated position they showered down heavy stones beams and burning rafters which thundering along the stairway overturned the ascending spaniards and carried desolation through their ranks the more fortunate eluding or springing over these obstacles succeeded in gaining the first terrace where they fell upon their enemies and compelled them to give way and then aided by a brisk fire from the musketeers below they pressed on forcing their opponents to retreat higher and higher until at last they were glad to take shelter on the broad summit of the teocalli corts and his companions were close behind them and the two parties soon found themselves face to face upon this strange battlefield engaged in mortal combat in the presence of the whole city while even the troops in the courtyard ceased hostilities as if by mutual consent and watched with breathless interest the issue of the struggle the spaniards and mexicans closed with the desperate fury of men who have no hope but in victory quarter was neither asked nor given and to fly was impossible the edge of the platform was unprotected by parapet or battlement and many of the combatants as they struggled together were seen to roll over the edge of the precipice locked in a deathgrip corts himself but narrowly escaped this frightful fate two powerful warriors had seized upon him and were dragging him violently towards the side of the pyramid when by sheer strength he tore himself from their grasp and hurled one of them over the brink with his own arm illustration the battle raged unceasingly for three hours the number of the mexicans was double that of the spaniards but the armour of the latter and their skill as swordsmen outweighed the odds against them resistance grew fainter and fainter on the side of the aztecs the priests who had run to and fro among them with streaming hair and wild gestures encouraging and urging them on were all slain or captured one by one the warriors fell dead upon the blooddrenched pavement or were hurled from the dizzy height until at last the wild struggle ceased and the spaniards stood alone upon the field of battle their victory had cost them dear for fortyfive of their comrades lay dead and nearly all the remainder were more or less seriously wounded but there was no time for regrets the victorious cavaliers rushed to the sanctuaries to find that the cross and the image of the virgin had disappeared from the one they had appropriated and that in the other before the grim figure of huitzilopochtli lay the usual offering of human hearts possibly those of their own countrymen with shouts of triumph the spaniards tore the hideous idol from its niche and in the sight of the horrorstricken aztecs hurled it down the steps of the teocalli and after having set fire to the sanctuaries descended joyfully into the courtyard passing through the ranks of the mexicans who were too much dismayed by all they had witnessed to offer any resistance they reached their own quarters in safety and that very night they followed up the blow they had struck by sallying forth into the sleeping town and burning three hundred houses corts now hoped that the natives were sufficiently subdued to be willing to come to terms with him he therefore invited them to a parley and addressed the principal chiefs who had assembled in the great square from the turret before occupied by montezuma as usual marina interpreted for him and the indians gazed curiously at their countrywoman whose influence with the spanish general was well known corts told them that they must now know how little they had to hope from their opposition to the spaniards they had seen their gods trampled in the dust their altars destroyed their dwellings burned and their warriors falling on all sides all this he continued you have brought upon yourselves by your rebellion yet for the sake of the affection felt for you by the sovereign you have treated so unworthily i would willingly stay my hand if you will lay down your arms and return once more to your obedience but if you do not he concluded i will make your city a heap of ruins and leave not a soul alive to mourn over it but the spanish commander did not yet understand the character of the aztecs if he thought to intimidate them by menaces it was true they replied that he had destroyed their temples broken in pieces their gods and massacred their countrymen many more doubtless were yet to fall under their terrible swords but they were content so long as for every thousand mexicans they could shed the blood of a single white man look out they said upon our streets and terraces see them still thronged with warriors as far as your eyes can reach our numbers are scarcely diminished by our losses yours on the contrary are lessening hour by hour your provisions and water are failing you are perishing from hunger and sickness you must soon fall into our hands the bridges are broken down and you cannot escape there will be too few of you left to glut the vengeance of our gods with this they discharged a volley of arrows which compelled the spaniards to beat a speedy retreat from the turret the fierce answer of the aztecs filled the besieged with dismay the general himself pressed by enemies without and factions within was as usual only roused to more energetic action by a situation which would have paralysed any ordinary mind he calmly surveyed his position before deciding what course he would pursue to retreat was hazardous and it mortified him cruelly to abandon the city in which he had so long been master and the rich treasure which he had secured with which he had hoped to propitiate the king of spain to fly now was to acknowledge himself further than ever from the conquest and to give great opportunity to his enemy the governor of cuba to triumph over him on the other hand with his men daily diminishing in strength and numbers with the stock of provisions so nearly exhausted that one small daily ration of bread was all the soldiers had with the breaches in his fortifications widening every day and his ammunition nearly gone it was manifestly impossible to hold the place much longer against the enemy having reached this conclusion the next difficulty was to decide how and when it would be well to evacuate the city he tried to fight his way out but he failed and when night fell the mexicans dispersed as usual and the spaniards tired famished and weak from their wounds slowly reentered the citadel only to receive tidings of a fresh misfortune montezuma was dead the tidings of his death says the old spanish chronicler were received with real grief by every cavalier and soldier in the army who had had access to his person for we all loved him as a father and no wonder seeing how good he was montezumas death was a real misfortune for the spaniards while he lived there was still a possibility of his influence with the natives being of use to them now that hope was gone the spanish commander showed all respect for his memory his body arrayed in its royal robes was laid upon a bier and borne on the shoulders of those nobles who had remained with him to the last to his subjects in the city whose wailings over it were distinctly heard by the spaniards but where he was buried and with what honours they never knew the spanish general now called a council to decide as speedily as possible the allimportant question of the retreat it was his intention to fall back upon tlascala and once there to arrange according to circumstances his future operations there was some difference of opinion as to the hour of departure but owing to the predictions of a soldier named botello who pretended to be able to read the stars and who announced that to leave the city at night would be for the good of his comrades though he himself would meet his death through it it was decided that the fortress should be abandoned that very night after events proved that botellos prophecy was unfortunately only true as far as he himself was concerned the generals first care was to provide for the safe conveyance of the treasure the soldiers had most of them converted their share into gold chains or collars which could be easily carried about their persons but the royal fifth with that of corts himself and his principal officers was in bars and wedges of solid gold that belonging to the crown was now given in charge to the royal officers with the strongest horse to carry it and a special guard for its protection but much treasure belonging to the crown and to private individuals was necessarily abandoned and the precious metal lay in shining heaps upon the floors of the palace take what you will of it said corts to the soldiers better you should have it than those mexican hounds but be careful not to overload yourselves he travels safest who travels lightest his own wary soldiers took heed to his counsel taking few treasures and those of the smallest size but the troops of narvaez thought that the very mines of mexico lay open before them and the riches for which they had risked so much were within their reach at last rushing upon the spoil they loaded themselves with all they could possibly carry or stow away corts next arranged the order of march the van consisted of two hundred spanish foot commanded by sandoval with twenty other cavaliers the rest of the infantry formed the rearguard under alvarado and de leon while the general himself took charge of the centre some of the heavy guns the baggage the treasure and the prisoners among whom were a son and two daughters of montezuma cacama and several nobles the tlascalans were pretty equally divided among the three divisions the general had previously superintended the construction of a portable bridge to be laid across the open canals this was entrusted to the care of an officer named magarino and forty men all pledged to defend the passage to the last extremity well would it have been if three such bridges had been made but the labour would have been great and the time was short at midnight all was ready and after a solemn mass had been celebrated by father olmedo the spaniards for the last time sallied forth from the ancient fortress the scene of so much suffering and of such great courage the night or horror the night was dark and a fine rain fell steadily the vast square before the palace was deserted as indeed it had been since the death of montezuma and the spaniards made their way across it as noiselessly as possible and entered the great street of tlacopan though to their anxious eyes every dark lane and alley seemed to swarm with the shadowy forms of their enemies it was not really so and all went well until the van drew near the spot where the street opened upon the causeway before the bridge could be adjusted across the uncovered breach the mexican sentinels stationed there fled raising the alarm as they went the priests from the summits of the teocallis heard them and sounded their shells while the huge drum upon the desolate temple of the wargod sent forth its solemn sound which heard only in seasons of calamity vibrated through every corner of the capital the spaniards saw that there was no time to be lost the bridge was fitted with all speed and sandoval rode across first to try its strength followed by the first division then came corts with the baggage and artillery but before he was well over a sound was heard as of a stormy wind rising in a forest nearer and nearer it came and from the dark waters of the lake rose the plashing noise of many oars then a few stones and arrows fell at random among the hurrying troops to be followed by more and more ever thicker and faster till they became a terrible blinding storm while the air was rent with the yells and warcries of the enemy who seemed to be swarming in myriads over land and lake the spaniards pushed on steadily though the mexicans dashing their canoes against the sides of the causeway clambered up and broke in upon their ranks the soldiers anxious only to make their escape simply shook them off or rode over them or with their guns and swords drove them headlong down the sides of the dyke again but the advance of such a body of men necessarily took time and the leading files had already reached the second gap in the causeway before those in the rear had cleared the first they were forced to halt though severely harassed by the fire from the canoes which clustered thickly round this opening and many were the urgent messages which were sent to the rear to hurry up the bridge but when it was at length clear and magarino and his sturdy followers endeavoured to raise it they found to their horror that the weight of the artillery and the horses passing over it had jammed it firmly into the sides of the dyke and it was absolutely immovable not till many of his men were slain and all wounded did magarino abandon the attempt and then the dreadful tidings spread rapidly from man to man and a cry of despair arose all means of retreat were cut off they were held as in a trap order and discipline were at an end for no one could hope to escape except by his own desperate exertions those behind pressed forward trampling the weak and wounded under foot heeding not friend or foe those in front were forced over the edge of the gulf across which some of the cavaliers succeeded in swimming their horses but many failed or rolled back into the lake in attempting to ascend the opposite bank the infantry followed pellmell heaped one upon the other frequently pierced by the aztec arrows or struck down by their clubs and dragged into the canoes to be reserved for a more dreadful death all along the causeway the battle raged fiercely illustration the mexicans clambered continually up the sides of the dyke and grappled with the spaniards till they rolled together down into the canoes but while the aztec fell among friends his unhappy antagonist was secured and borne away in triumph to the sacrifice the struggle was long and deadly but by degrees the opening in the causeway was filled up by the wreck of the waggons guns rich bales of stuffs chests of solid ingots and bodies of men and horses which had fallen into it and over this dismal ruin those in the rear were able to reach the other side corts had found a place that was fordable and halting halfway across had vainly endeavoured to check the confusion and lead his followers safely to the opposite bank but his voice was lost in the wild uproar and at length attended by a few trusty cavaliers he pushed forward to the front here he found sandoval and his companions halting before the last breach trying to cheer on the soldiers to attempt the crossing but though not so beset with enemies as the last it was wide and deep and the mens resolution failed them again the cavaliers set the example by plunging into the lake horse and foot followed swimming or clinging to the manes and tails of the horses those fared best as the general had predicted who travelled lightest and many were the unfortunate wretches who weighed down by the fatal treasure were buried with it at the bottom of the lake corts with a few others still kept in advance leading the miserable remnant off the causeway the din of battle was growing faint in the distance when the rumour reached them that without speedy succour the rearguard must be utterly overwhelmed it seemed a desperate venture but the cavaliers without thinking of the danger turned their horses and galloped back to the relief of their comrades swimming the canal again they threw themselves into the thick of the fray the first gleam of morning light showed the hideous confusion of the scene the masses of combatants upon the dyke were struggling till the very causeway seemed to rock while as far as the eye could see the lake was covered with a dense crowd of canoes full of warriors the cavaliers found alvarado unhorsed and with a mere handful of followers defending himself against an overwhelming tide of the enemy who by this time possessed the whole rear of the causeway and received constant reinforcements from the city the spanish artillery which had done good service at first had been overthrown and utterly confounded by the rush from the back in the general ruin corts strove by a resolute charge to give his countrymen time to rally but it was only for a moment they were speedily borne down by the returning rush the general and his companions were forced to plunge into the lake once more though with their numbers reduced this time and alvarado stood for an instant upon the brink uncertain what to do there was no time to be lost he was a tall and powerful man setting his long lance firmly on the wreck which strewed the lake he gave a mighty leap which landed him in safety upon the opposite bank aztecs and tlascalans looked on in amazement at this almost incredible feat and a general shout arose this is truly the tonatiuh the child of the sun to this day the place is called alvarados leap corts now rode to the front where the troops were straggling miserably off the fatal causeway most fortunately the attention of the aztecs was diverted by the rich spoil that strewed the ground and their pursuit ceased so that the spaniards passed unmolested through the village of popotla there the spanish commander dismounted from his weary steed and sitting down on the steps of an indian temple looked mournfully on while the broken files dragged slowly past it was a piteous spectacle the cavalry many of them dismounted were mingled with the infantry their shattered mail dripping with the salt ooze and showing through its rents many a ghastly wound their firearms banners baggage artillery everything was gone corts as he looked sadly on their thin disordered ranks sought in vain many a familiar face and missed more than one trusty comrade who had stood by his side through all the perils of the conquest and accustomed as he was to conceal his emotions he could bear it no longer but covered his face with his hands while he wept tears of anguish it was however some consolation to him that marina had been carried safely through the awful night by her faithful guards aguilar was also alive and martin lopez who had built two boats for him in mexico as well as alvarado avila sandoval olid and ordaz illustration but this was no time to give way to vain regrets corts hastily mounted again and led his men as speedily as possible through tlacopan and as soon as he reached the open country endeavoured to bring his disorganised battalions into something like order the broken army halfstarved moved slowly towards the coast on the seventh morning the army reached the mountain range which overlooks the plains of otumba all the day before parties of the enemy had hovered round crying vindictively hasten on you will soon find yourselves where you cannot escape now as they climbed the steep hillside corts realised what this meant for his scouts came back reporting that a powerful body of aztecs was encamped upon the other side waiting for them and truly enough when they looked down into the valley they saw it filled with a mighty host of warriors who had been gathered together by cuitlahua and stationed at this point to dispute the passage of the spaniards every chief of importance had taken the field with his whole array as far as the eye could reach extended a moving mass of glittering shields and spears mingled with the banners and bright feathermail of the caciques and the white cotton robes of their followers it was a sight to dismay the stoutest heart among the spaniards and even corts felt that his last hour was come but since to escape was impossible he disposed his little army to the best advantage and prepared to cut his way through the enemy or perish in the attempt he gave his force as broad a front as possible protecting it on each flank with his cavalry now reduced to twenty horsemen who were instructed to direct their long lances at the faces of the enemy and on no account to lose their hold of them the infantry were to thrust not strike with their swords and above all to make for the leaders of the enemy and then after a few brave words of encouragement he and his little band began to descend the hill rushing as it seemed to certain destruction the enemy met them with the usual storm of stones and arrows but when the spaniards closed with them their superiority became apparent and the natives were thrown into confusion by their own numbers as they fell back from the charge the infantry followed up their advantage and a wide lane was opened in the ranks of the enemy who receded on all sides as if to allow them a free passage but it was only to return with fresh fury and soon the little army was entirely surrounded standing firmly protected on all sides by its bristling swords and lances like an island in the midst of a raging sea in spite of many gallant deeds and desperate struggles the spaniards found themselves at the end of several hours only more deeply wedged in by the dense masses of the enemy corts had received another wound in the head his horse had fallen under him and he had been obliged to mount one taken from the baggage train the fiery rays of the sun poured down upon the nearly exhausted soldiers who were beginning to despair and give way while the enemy constantly reinforced from the rear pressed on with redoubled fury at this critical moment the eagle eye of corts ever on the watch for any chance of arresting the coming ruin descried in the distance a chief who from his dress and surroundings he knew must be the commander of the aztec forces he wore a rich surcoat of featherwork and a gorgeous plume of jewelled feathers floated from his helmet while above this and attached to his back between the shoulders showed a golden net fastened to a short staff the customary symbol of authority for an aztec commander turning quickly round to sandoval olid alvarado and avila who surrounded him he cried pointing to the chief there is our mark follow and support me and shouting his warcry he plunged into the thickest of the press taken by surprise the enemy fell back those who could not escape were trampled under his horses feet or pierced by his long lance the cavaliers followed him closely in a few minutes they were close to the aztec chief and corts hurled him to the ground with one stroke from his lance a young cavalier named juan de salamanca hastily dismounted and slew him where he lay and tearing away his banner presented it to the spanish general the caciques guard overpowered by this sudden onset fled precipitately and their panic spread to the other indians who on hearing of the death of their chief fought no more but thought only of escape in their blind terror they impeded and trampled down their own comrades and the spaniards availing themselves fully of the marvellous turn affairs had taken pursued them off the field and then returned to secure the rich booty they had left behind them illustration corts reached tlascala in safety and at once began to prepare his revenge on the mexicans aided by reinforcements of a few spaniards from vera cruz gunpowder had also to be manufactured and a cavalier named francio montao undertook the perilous task of obtaining sulphur for the purpose from the terrible volcano of popocatepetl he set out with four comrades and after some days journeying they reached the dense forest which covered the base of the mountain and forcing their way upward came by degrees to a more open region as they neared the top the track ended and they had to climb as best they could over the black glazed surface of the lava which having issued from the crater in a boiling flood had risen into a thousand odd forms wherever it met with any obstacle and continually impeded their progress after this they arrived at the region of perpetual snow which increased their difficulties the treacherous ice giving way at every step so that many times they narrowly escaped falling into the frozen chasms that yawned all round them at last however they reached the mouth of the crater and crawling cautiously to the very edge peered down into its gloomy depths at the bottom of the abyss which seemed to them to go down into the very heart of the earth a lurid flame burned sullenly sending up a sulphureous steam which cooling as it rose fell again in showers upon the sides of the cavity into this one of the brave explorers had to descend and when they had cast lots the choice fell upon montao himself his preparations were soon made and his companions lowered him in a basket into the horrible chasm to a depth of four hundred feet and there as he hung he scraped the sulphur from the sides of the crater descending again and again until he had procured enough for the wants of the army with which they returned triumphantly to tlascala meanwhile the construction of the ships went forward prosperously and by christmas in the year there was no longer any reason to delay the march to mexico illustration while all these preparations were being made some changes had taken place among the aztecs cuitlahua had suddenly died after reigning four months and guatemozin his nephew had been chosen in his stead this young prince had married one of montezumas daughters he was handsome and valiant and so terrible that his followers trembled in his presence he had a sort of religious hatred of the spaniards and prepared manfully to meet the perils which he saw threatening his country for by means of spies he had kept a watch upon the movements of the spaniards and had discovered their intention of besieging the capital corts upon reviewing his army found that his whole force fell little short of six hundred men of whom forty were cavalry and eighty arquebusiers and crossbowmen the rest were armed with sword target and the long copperheaded pikes which had been made specially by the generals directions there were also nine cannons of moderate size but the supply of powder was but indifferent corts published a code of strict regulations for the guidance of his men before they set out and addressed them as usual with stirring words touching all the springs of devotion honour and ambition in their hearts and rousing their enthusiasm as only he could have done his plan of action was to establish his headquarters at some place upon the tezcucan lake whence he could cut off the supplies from the surrounding country and place mexico in a state of blockade until the completion of his ships should enable him to begin a direct assault the most difficult of the three ways into the valley was the one corts chose it led right across the mountain chain and he judged wisely that he would be less likely to be annoyed by the enemy in that direction before long the army halted within three leagues of tezcuco which you will remember was upon the opposite shore of the lake to mexico and somewhat further north up to this time they only had had a few slight skirmishes with the aztecs though beacon fires had blazed upon every hilltop showing that the country was roused corts thought it very unlikely that he would be allowed to enter tezcuco which was now reigned over by coanaco the friend and ally of guatemozin but the next morning before the troops were well under arms came an embassy bearing a golden flag and a gift for corts and imploring him to spare coanacos territories and to take up his quarters in his capital corts first sternly demanded an account of the spaniards who while convoying treasure to the coast had been slain by coanaco just when corts himself was retreating to tlascala the envoys declared at once that the mexican emperor alone was to blame he had ordered it to be done and had received the gold and the prisoners they then urged that to give them time to prepare suitable accommodation for him corts should not enter tezcuco until the next day but disregarding this he marched in at once only to find the place deserted and coanaco well on his way across the lake to mexico the general however turned this to his own advantage by assembling the few persons left in the city and then and there electing a brother of the late sovereign to be ruler in his place and when a few months later he died he was succeeded by ixtlilxochitl son of negahualpilli who always a friend of the spaniards now became their most valuable ally and by the support of his personal authority and all his military resources did more than any other aztec chieftain to rivet the chains of the strangers round the necks of his own countrymen the siege and surrender of mexico the city of tezcuco which lay about half a league from the shore of the lake was probably the best position corts could have chosen for the headquarters of the army his first care was to strengthen the defences of the palace in which they were lodged and next to employ eight thousand indian labourers in widening a stream which ran towards the lake so that when the ships arrived they might be put together in tezcuco and floated safely down to be launched upon it meanwhile many of the places in the neighbourhood sent in their submission to corts and several noble aztecs fell into his hands these men he employed to bear a message to guatemozin in which he deprecated the necessity of the present hostilities and declared himself willing to forget the past inviting the mexicans by a timely submission to save their capital from the horrors of a siege but every man in mexico was determined to defend it to the uttermost and this appeal produced no effect the general now turned his attention to securing all the strong places upon the lake iztapalapan was the first the attacking party after a sharp struggle succeeded in entering the town many of the inhabitants fled in their canoes but those who remained were massacred by the tlascalans in spite of all corts could do to restrain them darkness set in while the soldiers were eagerly loading themselves with plunder some of the houses had been set on fire and the flames lighted up the scene of ruin and desolation suddenly a sound was heard as of the rush of the incoming tide and corts with great alarm realised that the indians had broken down the dykes and that before long the lowlying ground upon which the town stood would be under water he hastily called off his men and retreated the soldiers heavily laden wading with difficulty through the flood which gained fast upon them as they left the burning city behind them they could no longer find their way and sometimes plunged into deep water where many of the allies unable to swim were carried away and drowned when morning dawned they were harassed by the enemy who hovered round and discharged volleys of arrows and stones so that it was with no small satisfaction that they presently found themselves once more within the walls of tezcuco corts was greatly disappointed at this disastrous end of an expedition which had begun so well but after all the fate of iztapalapan produced a good effect and many more towns sent to tender their allegiance amongst others otumba and chalco which was a place of great importance corts also managed to induce the tribes who though friendly to him were hostile to one another to forget their feuds and combine against mexico and to this wise policy he owed much of his future success news now came from tlascala that the ships were ready and sandoval was despatched with a considerable guard to bring them to tezcuco on his way he was to stop at zoltepec where the massacre of the spaniards had taken place to find out and punish all who had had a hand in the matter but when they got there the inhabitants had fled in the deserted temples they had the horror of finding many traces of the fate of their comrades for beside their arms and clothing and the hides of their horses the heads of several soldiers were found suspended as trophies of victory while traced in charcoal upon the wall in one building were the words in the spanish language in this place the unfortunate juan juste with many others of his company was imprisoned it was fortunate that the inhabitants had fled for they would have met with but scant mercy from the spaniards who were full of indignation at the thought of the horrible doom which had overtaken their companions sandoval now resumed his march to tlascala but before he could reach it the convoy appeared transporting the ships through the mountain passes retaining twenty thousand of the warriors as a guard the spanish captain dismissed the rest and after four laborious days corts and his garrison had the joy of welcoming them safe within the walls of tezcuco it was not long before the general once more sallied forth to reconnoitre the capital and by the way to chastise certain places which had sent him hostile messages after an exciting struggle xaltocan and three other towns were taken and a considerable quantity of gold and food fell into the hands of the victors marching on the general found himself before tlacopan through whose streets he had hurried in consternation at the end of the night of horror it was his intention to occupy the town which he did after a sharp fight just before nightfall and the next morning seeing the enemy in battle array on the open ground before the city he marched out against them and routed them utterly the aztecs fled into the town but were driven through its streets at the point of the lance and compelled once more to abandon it after which the tlascalans pillaged and set fire to the houses much against the will of corts but they were a fierce race and sometimes dangerous to friends as well as foes after six days the general went back to tezcuco and for some time things went on as before with many skirmishes and expeditions against the towns garrisoned by the mexicans sandoval took several strongholds which threatened the security of chalco and all the while the work upon the canal was going rapidly forward and the ships were nearing completion in spite of three attempts made by the enemy to burn them just at this time came the welcome news that three vessels had arrived at villa rica with two hundred men on board well provided with arms and ammunition and with seventy or eighty horses and the new comers soon made their way to tezcuco for the roads to the port were now safe and open in april corts started once more to scour the country with a large force passing quite round the great lakes and exploring the mountain regions to the south of them here he came upon aztec forces intrenched in strong towns often built like eagles nests upon some rocky height so that to take them was a work of great difficulty and danger once he found himself before a city which it was absolutely necessary to subdue but he was separated from it by a cleft in the solid rock of no great width but going sheer down thousands of feet the bridges which generally crossed it had been broken down at the approach of the spaniards and as they stood there unable to advance the enemys archers as usual kept up a steady fire to which they were unavoidably exposed the general sent a party to seek a passage lower down but they met with no success until they came to a spot where two large trees growing one on either side of the ravine interlaced their branches overhead and by this unsteady and perilous bridge one of the tlascalans ventured to cross his example was soon followed and one by one about thirty spaniards and some more of the natives crawled across swinging dizzily above the abyss three lost their hold and fell but the rest alighted in safety on the other side and attacked the aztecs who were as much amazed at their sudden appearance as if they had dropped from the clouds presently a temporary bridge was contrived by which the remainder of the force managed to cross also and before long the town was taken and the trembling caciques appeared before corts throwing the blame of their resistance upon the mexicans and promising submission for the future the general then continued his march across the eastern shoulder of the mountain descending finally upon xochimilco which was built partly upon the lake like mexico itself and was approached by causeways which however were of no great length it was in the first attack upon this town that corts was as nearly as possible taken prisoner by the aztecs he had thrown himself into the thick of the fight with his usual bravery and was trying to resist an unexpected rush of the enemy when his horse stumbled and fell he himself received a severe blow upon the head before he could rise and was seized and dragged off in triumph by several indians at this moment a tlascalan saw his danger and sprang furiously upon his captors trying to tear him from their grasp two spaniards also rushed to the rescue and between them the aztecs were forced to quit their hold of the general who lost no time in regaining his saddle and laying about him with his good sword as vigorously as before after a terrible struggle the enemy was driven out and corts took possession of the city as it was not yet dusk he ascended the principal teocalli to reconnoitre the surrounding country and there beheld a sight which could but cause him grave anxiety the lake was covered with rapidly approaching canoes full of warriors while inland indian squadrons were marching up in dense columns xochimilco was but four leagues from the capital and at the first tidings of the arrival of the spaniards guatemozin had mustered a strong force and marched to its relief corts made all possible preparations for the defence of his quarters but not until the next day did the mexicans attack him and then the battle raged long and with varying success but in the end spanish discipline prevailed and the natives were routed with such dreadful slaughter that they made no further attempt to renew the conflict the city yielded a rich hoard of plunder being well stored with gold and featherwork and many other articles of use or luxury so that when the general mustered his men upon the neighbouring plain before resuming his march many of them came staggering under the weight of their spoil this caused him much uneasiness since their way would be through a hostile country but seeing that the soldiers were determined to keep what they had so hardly won he contented himself with ordering the baggage to be placed in the centre guarded by part of the cavalry and having disposed the rest to the best advantage they once more set forth at the last moment setting fire to the wooden buildings of xochimilco which blazed furiously the glare upon the water telling far and wide the fate that had befallen it resting here and there and engaging in many skirmishes with the aztecs who followed them up furious at the sight of the plunder which was being carried away by the invaders the army presently completed the circuit of the lakes and reached tezcuco to be greeted with the news that the ships were fully rigged and the canal completed so that there was no longer any reason to delay their operations against mexico it was a triumphant moment when the vessels were launched and reached the lake in good order corts saw to their being properly armed and manned and then reviewed the rest of his forces and summoned his native allies to furnish their promised levies at once the generals plan of action against mexico was to send sandoval with one division to take possession of iztapalapan at the southern end of the lake while alvarado and olid were to secure tlacopan and chapoltepec upon its western shore and at the latter place destroy the aqueduct and so cut off the supply of fresh water from mexico this they did successfully and in several days of fierce fighting breach after breach was carried and the spaniards penetrated the city as far as the great teocalli driving the natives before them while the tlascalans in the rear filled up the gaps in the dyke as well as they could and brought up the heavy guns corts and his men now pushed their way into the inclosure of the temple and some of them rushed to the top so lately the scene of their terrible battle and there found a fresh image of the wargod tearing away the gold and jewels with which it was bedecked they hurled it and its attendant priests over the side of the pyramid and hastened down to the assistance of their comrades who were by this time in a most perilous position the aztecs having rallied and attacked them furiously indeed it seemed likely to go hard with them for they were driven helplessly back down the great street in utter confusion and panic but the timely arrival of a small body of cavalry created a diversion in their favour and corts managed to turn them once more and drive the enemy back into the enclosure with much loss as it was by this time evening he retreated in good order to xoloc though this affair caused some consternation among the mexicans they speedily opened the canals and built up the ramparts again so that when corts renewed the attack the whole scene had to be gone through as before when they had once gained the street however they found it much easier to advance the tlascalans having on the last occasion pulled down many of the houses on either side this time corts had determined to destroy some of the cherished buildings of the mexicans and began by setting fire to his old quarters the palace of axayacatl and then the palace of montezuma on the other side of the great square the sight so maddened the natives that the spaniards had some ado to make good their retreat and few reached their camp that night unwounded the aztec emperor for his part made frequent sallies against the spaniards both by land and upon the lake sometimes with considerable success at first he managed to obtain supplies of food in canoes under cover of the darkness but by degrees the large towns on the mainland seeing the mexicans unable to defend themselves gave in their allegiance to the spaniards and then starvation began to be felt in the unhappy city in spite of everything however all offers of terms from corts were steadily refused at this juncture the general was persuaded by some of his officers that it would be well for two of the divisions to unite and occupy the great marketplace in the heart of the town and so at a given time they marched along their respective causeways and entered the city strict orders were given by corts that as they advanced every opening in the causeways should be filled up and made secure the attack began and the enemy taken apparently by surprise gave way and fell back on rushed the spaniards by every street eager to reach the appointed meeting place only the general suspected that the enemy might be purposely luring them on to turn upon them when they were hopelessly involved taking a few men with him he hastily proceeded to see for himself if the way was clear should a retreat become necessary and found as he had feared that all had been too eager to be in the front to attend to this most important duty in the first street he traversed was a huge gap twelve feet wide and at least as many deep full of water for it connected two canals a feeble attempt had been made to fill this up with beams and rubbish but it had been left before any good had been done worse than all corts saw that this breach was freshly made and that his officers had probably rushed headlong into a snare laid by the enemy before his men could do anything towards filling up the trench the distant sounds of the battle changed into an everincreasing tumult the mingled yells and war cries and the trampling of many feet grew nearer and at last to his horror corts beheld his men driven to the edge of the fatal gulf confused helpless surrounded by their foes the foremost files were soon hurried over the edge some trying to swim across some beaten down by the struggles of their comrades or pierced by the darts of the indians in vain with outstretched hands did corts try to rescue his soldiers from death or worse still from capture he was soon recognised and six of the enemy tried to seize and drag him into a canoe it was only after a severe struggle in which he was wounded in the leg that he was rescued by his brave followers two were killed in the attempt while another was taken alive as he held the generals horse for him to mount in all sixty spaniards were captured on this fatal day and it was only when the rest reached their guns in the open space before the causeway that they were able to rally and beat back the aztecs the other division had fared equally ill and were moreover in great anxiety as to the fate of corts who was reported to have been killed when they once more reached their quarters sandoval though badly wounded rode into the camp of corts to learn the truth and had a long and earnest consultation with him over the disaster and what was next to be done as he returned to his camp he was startled by the sound of the great drum on the temple of the wargod heard only once before during the night of horror and looking up he saw a long file of priests and warriors winding round the terraces of the teocalli as they came out upon the platform at the top he perceived with rage and despair that his own countrymen were about to be sacrificed with the usual ghastly ceremonies the camp was near enough to the city for the white skins of the victims and their unavailing struggles to be distinctly seen by their comrades who were nevertheless powerless to help them and their distress and fury may be imagined for five days the horrible scenes went on the mexicans feasting singing and dancing while their priests predicted that in eight days the wargod appeased by these sacrifices would overwhelm their enemies and deliver them into their hands these prophecies had a great effect upon the native allies of corts who withdrew from him in immense numbers but the general treated their superstition with cheerful contempt and only bargained with the deserters to remain close by and see what would happen when the ninth day came and the city was still seen to be beset on every side they ceased to believe in the oracle and returned with their anger against the mexicans rekindled and their confidence in the spaniards greatly strengthened at this time another vessel loaded with stores and ammunition touched at vera cruz and her cargo was seized and sent on to corts by the governor with his strength thus renewed the spanish general resumed active operations this time not a step was taken in advance without securing the entire safety of the army once and for all by solidly building up the dykes filling every canal and pulling down every house so that slowly and by degrees a bare open space was made which took in more and more of the town till at last the unhappy aztecs after many desperate sallies were shut into the portion of the city which lay between the northern and western causeways here famine and pestilence did their awful work unchecked the ordinary articles of food were long exhausted and the wretched people ate moss insects grass weeds or the bark of trees they had no fresh water the dead were unburied the wounded lay in misery yet all the endeavours of corts to induce guatemozin and his chiefs to submit were useless though the two divisions of the army had proceeded with their work of destruction until they could join their forces and seveneighths of the city lay in ruins though the banner of castile floated undisturbed from the smouldering remains of the sanctuary on the teocalli of the wargod still the aztecs defied the conquerors and fiercely rejected their overtures of peace hundreds of famishing wretches died every day and lay where they fell for there was no one to bury them familiarity with the spectacle made men indifferent to it they looked on in dumb despair waiting for their own turn to come there was no complaint or lamentation but deep unutterable woe in the midst of this appalling misery guatemozin remained calm and courageous and as firmly resolved not to capitulate as at the beginning of the siege it is even said that when corts persuaded a noble aztec prisoner to bear his proposals for a treaty to the emperor guatemozin instantly ordered him to be sacrificed the general who had suspended hostilities for several days hoping for a favourable answer to his message now resolved to drive him to submission by a general assault and for that purpose led his men across the dreary waste of ruins to the narrow quarter of the city into which the wretched mexicans had retreated but he was met by several chiefs who holding out their emaciated arms exclaimed why do you delay so long to put an end to our miseries rather kill us at once that we may go to our god huitzilopochtli who waits to give us rest from our sufferings corts moved by the piteous sight replied that he desired not their death but their submission why does your master refuse to treat with me he said when in a single hour i can crush him and all his people then once more he sent to demand an interview with guatemozin this time the emperor hesitated and agreed that next day he would meet the spanish general corts well satisfied withdrew his force and next morning presented himself at the appointed place in the great square where a stone platform had been spread with mats and carpets and a banquet made ready but after all guatemozin instead of coming himself sent his nobles corts though greatly disappointed received them courteously persuading them to partake of the feast he had prepared and dismissing them with a supply of provisions for their master and a renewed entreaty that he would next day come in person but though he waited for three hours beyond the time appointed neither the emperor nor his chiefs appeared and the general heard that the mexicans were preparing to resist an assault he delayed no longer but ordering sandoval to support him by bringing up the ships and directing his big guns against the houses near the water he marched at once into the enemys quarters the mexicans set up a fierce warcry and with their usual spirit sent off clouds of arrows and darts but the struggle soon became a handtohand one and weakened by starvation and hemmed in as they were the unhappy aztecs had no chance against their foes after a scene of indescribable horror which appalled even the soldiers of corts used as they were to war and violence the spanish commander sounded a retreat and withdrew to his quarters leaving behind him forty thousand corpses and a smouldering ruin through the long night that followed all was silent in the mexican quarter there was neither light nor movement this last blow seemed to have utterly stunned them they had nothing left to hope for in the spanish camp however all was rejoicing at the prospect of a speedy termination to the wearisome campaign the great object of corts was now to secure the person of guatemozin and the next day which was august he led his forces for the last time across the black and blasted ruin which was all that remained of the once beautiful city in order to give the distressed garrison one more chance he obtained an interview with the principal chiefs and reasoned with them about the conduct of their emperor surely he said guatemozin will not see you all perish when he can so easily save you but when he had with difficulty prevailed upon them to urge the king to confer with him the only answer they could bring was that guatemozin was ready to die where he was but would hold no communication with the spanish commander go then replied the stern conqueror and prepare your countrymen for death their last moment is come still however he postponed the attack for several hours but the troops were impatient at the delay and a rumour spread that guatemozin was preparing to escape by the lake it was useless to hesitate the word was given and the terrible scene that ensued repeated the horrors of the day before while this was going forward on shore numbers of canoes pushed off across the lake most of them only to be intercepted and sunk by the spanish ships which beat down upon them firing to right and left some few however under cover of the smoke succeeded in getting into open water sandoval had given particular orders that his captains should watch any boat that might contain guatemozin and now two or three large canoes together attracted the attention of one named garci holguin who instantly gave chase and with a favourable wind soon overtook the fugitives though they rowed with the energy of despair as his men levelled their guns at the occupants of the boat one rose saying i am guatemozin lead me to malinche i am his prisoner but let no harm come to my wife and followers illustration holguin took them on board and then requested that the emperor would order the people in the other canoes to surrender there is no need he answered sadly they will fight no longer when they see their prince is taken and so it was for when the news of his capture reached the shore the mexicans at once ceased to defend themselves it seemed as if they had only gone on so long to give their sovereign a better chance of escape corts who had taken up his station on the flat roof of one of the houses now sent to command that guatemozin should be brought before him and he came escorted by sandoval and holguin who each claimed the honour of having captured him the conqueror who was as usual accompanied by the lady marina came forward with dignified courtesy to receive his noble prisoner the aztec monarch broke the silence saying i have done all i could to defend myself and my people i am now reduced to this state deal with me malinche as you will then laying his hand on a dagger which hung from the belt of corts he added better despatch me at once with this and rid me of life fear not answered the conqueror you shall be treated with honour you have defended your capital like a brave warrior and a spaniard knows how to respect valour even in an enemy he then sent for the queen who had remained on board the spanish ship and after ordering that the royal captives should be well cared for and supplied with all they needed he proceeded to dispose of his troops olid and alvarado drew off their divisions to their quarters leaving only a small guard in the wasted suburbs of the pestilence stricken city whilst the general himself with sandoval and the prisoners retired to a town at the end of the southern causeway that night a tremendous tempest arose such as the spaniards had never before witnessed shaking to its foundations all that remained of the city of mexico the next day at the request of guatemozin the mexicans were allowed to leave the capital and for three days a mournful train of men women and children straggled feebly across the causeways sick and wounded wasted with famine and misery turning often to take one more look at the spot which was once their pleasant home when they were gone the conquerors took possession of the place and purified it as speedily as possible burying the dead and lighting huge bonfires in the deserted streets the treasure of gold and jewels found in it fell far short of the expectation of the spaniards the aztecs having probably buried their hoards or sunk them in the lake on purpose to disappoint the avarice of their enemies corts therefore to his eternal disgrace caused guatemozin to be tortured but fire and cord could not wring the secret of the treasure from this illustrious prince in later days corts hanged guatemozin on pretence of a conspiracy corts having no further need for his native allies now dismissed them with presents and flattering speeches and they departed well pleased loaded with the plunder of the mexican houses which was despised by the spanish soldiers great was the satisfaction of the conquerors at having thus brought the long campaign successfully to an end corts celebrated the event by a banquet as sumptuous as circumstances would permit and the next day at the request of father olmedo the whole army took part in a solemn service and procession in token of their thankfulness for victory thus after a siege of nearly three months in which the beleaguered mexicans showed a constancy and courage under their sufferings which is unmatched in history fell the renowned capital of the aztecs and with its fall the story of the nation comes to an end the aztec empire fell by its own sin the constant capture of men from neighbouring states as victims for sacrifice had caused the aztecs to be hated thus corts obtained the aid of the tlascalans but for which even his courage and energy would have been of no avail he deserted marina when she ceased to be useful and gave her as a wife to one of his followers footnote in bishop eric left iceland for vinland part of america discovered by leif the lucky bishop eric was heard of no more can he have reached the aztecs and been regarded as a god adventures of bartholomew portugues a pirate a certain pirate born in portugal and from the name of his country called bartholomew portugues was cruising from jamaica in his boat in which he had only thirty men and four small guns near the cape de corrientes in the island of cuba in this place he met with a great ship bound for the havana well provided with twenty great guns and threescore and ten men passengers and mariners this ship he assaulted but found strongly defended by them that were on board the pirate escaping the first encounter resolved to attack her more vigorously than before seeing he had sustained no great damage hitherto this resolution he boldly performed renewing his assaults so often that after a long and dangerous fight he became master of the great vessel having lost only ten men and had four wounded having possessed themselves of such a ship and the wind being contrary for returning into jamaica the pirates resolved to steer towards the cape of st anthony on the western side of the isle of cuba there to repair themselves and take in fresh water of which they had great necessity at the time being now very near the cape above mentioned they unexpectedly met with three great ships that were coming from new spain and bound for the havana by these not being able to escape were easily retaken both ship and pirates thus they were all made prisoners through the sudden change of fortune and found themselves poor oppressed and stripped of all the riches they had won two days after this misfortune there happened to arise a huge and dangerous tempest which separated the ships one from another the great vessel in which the pirates were arrived at campeche where many considerable merchants came to salute and welcome the captain these knew the portuguese pirate as one who had committed innumerable crimes upon these coasts not only murders and robberies but also lamentable burnings which those of campeche still preserved very fresh in their memory the next day after their arrival the magistrates of the city sent several of their officers to demand and take into custody the prisoners from on board the ship with intent to punish them according to their deserts yet fearing lest the captain of the pirates should escape out of their hands on shore as he had formerly done being once their prisoner in the city before they judged it more convenient to leave him safely guarded on board the ship for the present in the meanwhile they caused a gibbet to be erected whereon to hang him the very next day without any other form of trial than to lead him from the ship to the place of punishment the rumour of this tragedy was presently brought to the ears of bartholomew portugues and he sought all the means he could to escape that night with this design he took two earthen jars in which the spaniards usually carry wine from spain to the west indies and he stopped them very well intending to use them for swimming as those who are unskilled in that art do a sort of pumpkins in spain and in other places they use empty bladders having made this necessary preparation he waited for the night when all should be asleep even the sentry that guarded him but seeing he could not escape his vigilance he secretly purchased a knife and with the same gave him a stab that suddenly deprived him of life and the possibility of making any noise at that instant bartholomew portugues committed himself to the sea with those two earthen jars before mentioned and by their help and support though never having learned to swim he reached the shore having landed without any delay he took refuge in the woods where he hid himself for three days without daring to appear not eating any food but wild herbs illustration those of the city failed not the next day to make diligent search for him in the woods where they concluded him to be this strict search bartholomew portugues watched from the hollow of a tree wherein he lay concealed seeing them return without finding what they sought for he adventured to sally forth towards the coast of golfotriste forty leagues distant from the city of campeche here he arrived within a fortnight after his escape from the ship in which time as also afterwards he endured extreme hunger thirst and fear of falling again into the hands of the spaniards for during all this journey he had no provision but a small calabash with a little water neither did he eat anything but a few shellfish which he found among the rocks nigh the seashore besides this he was compelled to pass some rivers not knowing well how to swim being in this distress he found an old board which the waves had thrown upon the shore in which there stuck a few great nails these he took and with no small labour whetted against a stone until he made them sharp like knives with these and no other instruments he cut down some branches of trees which he joined together with twigs and osiers and as well as he could made a boat or rather a raft with which he crossed over the rivers thus he reached the cape of golfotriste as was said before where he happened to find a certain vessel of pirates who wore great comrades of his own and were lately come from jamaica to these pirates he instantly related all his misfortunes and asked of them a boat and twenty men to return to campeche and assault the ship that was in the river from which he had escaped fourteen days before they readily granted his request and equipped him a boat with the said number of men with this small company he set forth for the execution of his design which he bravely performed eight days after he separated from his comrades for being arrived at the river of campeche with undaunted courage he assaulted the ship before mentioned those that were on board were persuaded that bartholomews was a boat from the land that came to bring goods and therefore were not on their defence so the pirates assaulted them without any fear of ill success and in a short space of time compelled the spaniards to surrender being now masters of the ship they immediately weighed anchor and set sail determining to fly from the port lest they should be pursued by other vessels this they did with extreme joy seeing themselves possessors of such a brave ship especially bartholomew portugues their captain who now by a second turn of fortunes wheel was become rich and powerful again who had been so lately in that same vessel a poor miserable prisoner and condemned to the gallows with this plunder he designed to do great things for he had found in the vessel a great quantity of rich merchandise thus he continued his voyage towards jamaica for four days but coming nigh to the isle of pino on the south side of the island of cuba fortune suddenly turned her back once more never to show him her countenance again for a horrible storm arising at sea caused the ship to split against the rocks and it was totally lost and bartholomew with his companions escaped in a canoe in this manner he arrived in jamaica where he remained but a short time till he was ready to seek his fortune anew but from that day of disaster it was always illluck with him the return of the french freebooters in january the daring band of french pirates who sometimes alone sometimes in company with english captains had been cruising in the south seas resolved to return to st domingo with all the treasure they had won from the spaniards but it was manifest that this return would be a matter of great difficulty they had not one seaworthy vessel left in which to set out for a long voyage and with forces exhausted by the frightful hardships they had gone through in the past years they had to pass through a country peopled by spaniards cowardly indeed but innumerable and only longing for revenge on the reckless crew that had plundered so many of their rich ships and towns moreover provisions were scarce among the spaniards themselves and it seemed likely that the freebooters in their passage would find scant entertainment but they were determined to risk everything and having prayed and sunk their canoes that the spaniards might make no use of them they set out on their journey what followed is thus recounted by one of their party raveneau de lussan the spaniards having been warned of our approach employed every means they could think of for our destruction burning all the provisions before us setting fire to the prairies we entered so that we and our horses were almost stifled and continually blocking our way with great barricades of trees about three hundred of them formed themselves into a kind of escort and morning and evening diverted us with the sound of trumpets but never dared to show their faces a detachment of our men were always set to fire into woods and thickets to find out if a spanish ambush were concealed there on january we reached an opening in the forest where we could see a good way before us and therefore did not fire but we had been looking in front for what was really on both sides of us for in the bushes right and left the spaniards were crouching and presently they let fly on us so suddenly that only half the guard had time to fire back and two of our men were killed on the spot illustration on the th we found another ambush where we surprised our enemies who took to flight abandoning their horses which became our property on the th as we drew near segovia we found yet another ambuscade which we forced to retire and passed into the town ready to fight our best for we thought that here the spaniards might make a great effort to expel us but they only discharged their muskets at us now and then from the shelter of the pinewood above the town into which they had fled but we found nothing to eat for they had burned all the provisions on the th having left segovia we climbed a hill which looked like a good place to camp and we saw opposite us on a mountain slope from which only a narrow valley divided us twelve to fifteen hundred horses which for some time we took for cattle pasturing there rejoicing in the prospect of good cheer we sent forty men to make sure and when they came back they told us that what we had taken for cattle were horses ready saddled and that in the same place they had found three intrenchments a pistol shot from each other which rising by degrees to about the middle of the mountain slope entirely barred the way which we meant to travel the next day these intrenchments commanded the river which ran the length of the valley into which it was absolutely necessary for us to descend there being no other way they saw a man who having discovered them threatened them with a bare cutlass this grievous news was a bitter disappointment to us especially the loss of our supposed cows for we were perishing with hunger but we had to take courage and find out how to leave this place and without delay for the spaniards who were assembling from all the country round would fall upon our little troop which must be overwhelmed if we waited for them the means were not easy to find and perhaps escape would have seemed impossible except to our reckless band who had hitherto succeeded in nearly all our exploits but ten thousand men could not have crossed that guarded valley without being cut off entirely both by reason of the number of the spaniards and the position they occupied men alone could have gone round without crossing the valley but we could find no way round for the horses and baggage for the country on each side was nothing but a thick forest without the trace of a path all precipices and ravines and choked with a multitude of fallen trees and even had we found a way of escape through so many obstacles it was indispensable to fight the spaniards sooner or later if they were ever to let us alone there was only one thing to be done to cross these woods rocks and mountains however inaccessible they seemed and surprise our enemies taking advantage of the place by coming upon them from above where they certainly would not expect us as to our prisoners horses and baggage since through all our march a troop of three hundred spaniards had been dogging our steps without daring to approach we would leave eighty men to guard them enough to beat four times as many spaniards at nightfall we set out leaving our eighty men with orders to the sentinels to fire and beat the retreat and the diane at the usual times to make the three hundred spaniards who lurked near us think that we had not left the camp if we were successful we would send back messengers with the good news but if an hour after the firing ended none of us returned they were to escape how they could all being arranged we prayed in a low voice not to be heard by the spaniards and set out by the moonlight two hundred men of us through this country of rocks woods and frightful precipices where we went leaping and climbing our feet seeming to be much less use to us than our hands and knees on the th at the break of day when we had already gained a great height and were climbing on in profound silence with the spanish intrenchments to our left we saw a sentry party which thanks to the fog always thick in this country till ten oclock in the morning did not discover us when it had passed we went straight to the place where we had seen it and we found that there was really a road there this when we had halted half an hour to take breath we followed guided by the voices of the spaniards who were at matins but we had only gone a few steps when we found two sentinels very far advanced on whom we were forced to fire which warned the spaniards who dreamed of nothing less than our coming upon them from above since they only expected us from below so those who guarded the intrenchment about five hundred men being taken at a disadvantage when they thought they had all the advantage on their side were so terribly frightened that when we fell upon them all at once they vanished from the place in an instant and escaped into the thick fog this unexpected assault so utterly upset their plans that the men in the second intrenchment all passed into the lowest one where they prepared to defend themselves we fought them a whole hour under cover of the first intrenchment which we had taken and which commanded them being higher up the mountain side but as they would not yield we fancied our shots must have missed since the fog hindered us from seeing our foes distinctly so resolved to waste no more powder we went down and fell right on the spot whence they had been firing then we assailed them furiously and at sight of our weapons close upon them which hitherto the fog had concealed they left everything and fled into the road below the intrenchments here they fell into their own trap for thinking it was the only road we could possibly come by they had cut down trees and blocked it up and their way being stopped we could fire upon them from their intrenchment without once missing aim at last seeing the river in the ravine running down with blood and tired of pursuing the fugitives we spared the few remaining spaniards after we had chanted the te deum sixty of us went to tell those left in the camp of the victory which heaven had vouchsafed to us we found them on the point of giving battle to the three hundred spaniards who had already on finding out their weakness sent a message to them by an officer to tell them that it was hopeless for them to expect to cross the valley and to offer terms of peace to which our men replied that were there as many spaniards as the blades of grass in the prairie they would not be afraid but would pass through in spite of them and go where they liked the officer being just dismissed with this message when we arrived shrugged his shoulders with astonishment when he saw us safe back again and mounted on the horses of his comrades of the intrenchments he rode off with the news to his troop whom we presently fired upon to rid them altogether from their desire to follow in our wake unfortunately for them they had not time to mount their horses so after a brief conflict in which a great number of them fell we let the rest go though we kept their horses then with our baggage we joined those of our men who had stayed to guard the intrenchments in both these combats we had only two men slain and four wounded continuing our journey we passed one more spanish intrenchment where since the news of our victory had gone before us we found no resistance at last on the sixteenth day of our march we reached the river which we had been seeking eagerly by whose means we meant to gain the sea into which it flowed at once we entered the woods which are on its banks and everyone set to work in good earnest to cut down trees in order to construct piperies with which to descend the river the reader may perhaps imagine that these piperies were some kind of comfortable boat to carry us pleasantly along the stream but they were anything but this we joined together four or five trunks of a kind of tree with light floating wood merely stripping off their bark and binding them instead of cord with a climbing plant growing in those forests and embracing the trees like ivy and when these structures each large enough to hold two men and in appearance something like huge wicker baskets were completed vessels and crew were ready illustration the safest plan was to stand upright in them armed with long poles to push them off from the rocks against which the fierce current every moment threatened to dash them as it was they sank two or three feet deep in the water so that we were nearly always immersed up to our waists this river rises in the mountains of segovia and falls into the sea at cape gracia dios after having flowed for a long distance with frightful rapidity among an infinite number of huge rocks and between the most terrible precipices imaginable we had to pass more than a hundred cataracts great and small and there were three which the most daring of us could not look at without turning giddy with fear when we saw and heard the water plunging from such a height into those horrible gulfs everything was so fearful that only those who have experienced it can imagine it as for me though i shall all my life have my memory full of pictures of the perils of that voyage it would be impossible for me to give any idea of it which would not be far below the reality we let ourselves go with the current so rapid that often in spite of our resistance it bore us into foaming whirlpools where we were engulfed with our pieces of wood but happily before the greatest cataracts and also just beyond them there was a basin of calm water which made it possible for us to gain the bank drawing our piperies after us then taking out of them whatever valuables we had there we descended with these leaping from rock to rock till we had reached the foot of the cataract then one of us would return and throw the piperies which we had left behind down into the flood and we below caught them as they descended sometimes indeed we failed to catch them and had to make new ones when we first set out we voyaged all together that in case of accident we might come to each others aid but in three days being out of all danger of the spaniards we began to travel separately since a piperie dashed against the rocks had often been prevented from freeing itself by other piperies which the current hurled against it it was arranged for those who descended first when they came to an especially dangerous rapid to hoist a little flag at the end of a stick not to warn those behind of the cataract since they could hear it nearly a league away but to mark the side on which they ought to land this plan saved a number of lives nevertheless many others were lost the bananas which we found on the river bank were almost our only nourishment and saved us from dying of hunger for though there was plenty of game our powder and weapons were all wet and spoiled so that we could not hunt some days after we had begun to descend the river as we were travelling separate several freebooters who had lost all their spoils in gambling were guilty of most cruel treachery having gone in advance these villains concealed themselves behind some rocks commanding the river in front of which we all had to pass and as everyone was looking after himself and we descended unsuspiciously at some distance from each other for the reasons already given they had time to fix upon and to massacre five englishmen who possessed greater shares of booty than the rest of us they were completely plundered by these assassins and my companion and i found their dead bodies on the shore at night when we were encamped on the river bank i reported what we had seen and the story was confirmed both by the absence of the dead englishmen and of their murderers who dared not come back to us and whom we never saw again on the th of february we found the river much wider and there were no more cataracts when we had descended some leagues further it was very fine and the current was gentle and seeing that the worst of our perils were over we dispersed into bands of forty each to make canoes in which we might safely complete our voyage down the river on the st of march by dint of great diligence having finished four canoes a hundred and twenty of us embarked leaving the others whose canoes were still incomplete to follow on the th we reached the mouth of the river in safety and lived there among the mulattos and negroes who inhabit the coast till an english boat touching there took on board fifty of us of whom i was one on the th of april without any other accident we arrived at our destination st domingo printed by spottiswoode and co newstreet square london
