margin of which malone has noted the readings of the first edition to the rightworshipful sir thomas walsingham knight sir we think not ourselves discharged of the duty we owe to our friend when we have brought the breathless body to the earth for albeit the eye there taketh his everfarewell of that beloved object yet the impression of the man that hath been dear unto us living an afterlife in our memory there putteth us in mind of farther obsequies due unto the deceased and namely of the performance of whatsoever we may judge shall make to his living credit and to the effecting of his determinations prevented by the stroke of death by these meditations as by an intellectual will i suppose myself executor to the unhappily deceased author of this poem upon whom knowing that in his lifetime you bestowed many kind favours entertaining parts of reckoning and worth which you found in him with good countenance and liberal affection i cannot but see so far into the will of him dead that whatsoever issue of his brain should chance to come abroad that the first breath it should take might be the gentle air of your liking for since his self had been accustomed thereunto it would prove more agreeable and thriving to his right children than any other foster countenance whatsoever at this time seeing that this unfinished tragedy happens under my hands to be imprinted of a double duty the one to yourself the other to the deceased i present the same to your most favourable allowance offering my utmost self now and ever to be ready at your worships disposing edward blunt hero and leander the first sestiad the argument of the first sestiad heros description and her loves the fane of venus where he moves his worthy lovesuit and attains whose bliss the wrath of fates restrains for cupids grace to mercury which tale the author doth imply on hellespont guilty of true loves blood in view and opposite two cities stood seaborderers disjoind by neptunes might the one abydos the other sestos hight at sestos hero dwelt hero the fair whom young apollo courted for her hair and offerd as a dower his burning throne where she should sit for men to gaze upon the outside of her garments were of lawn the lining purple silk with gilt stars drawn her wide sleeves green and borderd with a grove where venus in her naked glory strove to please the careless and disdainful eyes of proud adonis that before her lies her kirtle blue whereon was many a stain made with the blood of wretched lovers slain upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath from whence her veil reachd to the ground beneath her veil was artificial flowers and leaves whose workmanship both man and beast deceives many would praise the sweet smell as she past when twas the odour which her breath forth cast and there for honey bees have sought in vain and beat from thence have lighted there again about her neck hung chains of pebblestone which lightend by her neck like diamonds shone she ware no gloves for neither sun nor wind would burn or parch her hands but to her mind or warm or cool them for they took delight to play upon those hands they were so white buskins of shells all silverd usd she and branchd with blushing coral to the knee where sparrows perchd of hollow pearl and gold such as the world would wonder to behold those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills which as she went would cherup through the bills some say for her the fairest cupid pind and looking in her face was strooken blind but this is true so like was one the other as he imagind hero was his mother and oftentimes into her bosom flew about her naked neck his bare arms threw and laid his childish head upon her breast and with still panting rock there took his rest so lovelyfair was hero venus nun as nature wept thinking she was undone because she took more from her than she left and of such wondrous beauty her bereft therefore in sign her treasure sufferd wrack since heros time hath half the world been black amorous leander beautiful and young whose tragedy divine musus sung dwelt at abydos since him dwelt there none for whom succeeding times make greater moan his dangling tresses that were never shorn had they been cut and unto colchos borne would have allurd the venturous youth of greece to hazard more than for the golden fleece fair cynthia wished his arms might be her sphere grief makes her pale because she moves not there his body was as straight as circes wand jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand even as delicious meat is to the tast so was his neck in touching and surpast the white of pelops shoulder i could tell ye how smooth his breast was and how white his belly and whose immortal fingers did imprint that heavenly path with many a curious dint that runs along his back but my rude pen can hardly blazon forth the loves of men much less of powerful gods let it suffice that my slack muse sings of leanders eyes those orient cheeks and lips exceeding his that leapt into the water for a kiss of his own shadow and despising many died ere he could enjoy the love of any had wild hippolytus leander seen enamourd of his beauty had he been his presence made the rudest peasant melt that in the vast uplandish country dwelt the barbarous thracian soldier movd with nought was movd with him and for his favour sought some swore he was a maid in mans attire for in his looks were all that men desire a pleasantsmiling cheek a speaking eye a brow for love to banquet royally and such as knew he was a man would say leander thou art made for amorous play why art thou not in love and loved of all though thou be fair yet be not thine own thrall the men of wealthy sestos every year for his sake whom their goddess held so dear rosecheekd adonis kept a solemn feast thither resorted many a wandering guest to meet their loves such as had none at all came lovers home from this great festival for every street like to a firmament glisterd with breathing stars who where they went frighted the melancholy earth which deemd eternal heaven to burn for so it seemd as if another phaton had got the guidance of the suns rich chariot but far above the loveliest hero shind and stole away th enchanted gazers mind for like seanymphs inveigling harmony so was her beauty to the standers by nor that nightwandering pale and watery star when yawning dragons draw her thirling car from latmus mount up to the gloomy sky where crownd with blazing light and majesty she proudly sits more overrules the flood than she the hearts of those that near her stood even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase wretched ixions shaggyfooted race incensd with savage heat gallop amain from steep pinebearing mountains to the plain so ran the people forth to gaze upon her and all that viewd her were enamourd on her and as in fury of a dreadful fight their fellows being slain or put to flight poor soldiers stand with fear of death deadstrooken so at her presence all surprisd and tooken await the sentence of her scornful eyes he whom she favours lives the other dies there might you see one sigh another rage and some their violent passions to assuage compile sharp satires but alas too late for faithful love will never turn to hate and many seeing great princes were denied pind as they went and thinking on her died on this feastday o cursd day and hour went hero thorough sestos from her tower to venus temple where unhappily as after chancd they did each other spy so fair a church as this had venus none the walls were of discolourd jasperstone wherein was proteus carved and overhead a lively vine of green seaagate spread where by one hand lightheaded bacchus hung and with the other wine from grapes outwrung of crystal shining fair the pavement was the town of sestos calld it venus glass there might you see the gods in sundry shapes committing heady riots incests rapes for know that underneath this radiant flour was danes statue in a brazen tower jove slily stealing from his sisters bed to dally with idalian ganymed and for his love europa bellowing loud and tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud bloodquaffing mars heaving the iron net which limping vulcan and his cyclops set love kindling fire to burn such towns as troy silvanus weeping for the lovely boy that now is turned into a cypresstree under whose shade the woodgods love to be and in the midst a silver altar stood there hero sacrificing turtles blood vailed to the ground veiling her eyelids close and modestly they opened as she rose thence flew loves arrow with the golden head and thus leander was enamourd stonestill he stood and evermore he gazd till with the fire that from his countenance blazd relenting heros gentle heart was strook such force and virtue hath an amorous look it lies not in our power to love or hate for will in us is overruld by fate when two are stript long ere the course begin we wish that one should lose the other win and one especially do we affect of two gold ingots like in each respect the reason no man knows let it suffice what we behold is censurd by our eyes where both deliberate the love is slight who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight he kneeld but unto her devoutly prayed chaste hero to herself thus softly said were i the saint he worships i would hear him and as she spake those words came somewhat near him he started up she blushed as one ashamd wherewith leander much more was inflamd he touchd her hand in touching it she trembled love deeply grounded hardly is dissembled these lovers parled by the touch of hands true love is mute and oft amazd stands thus while dumb signs their yielding hearts entangled the air with sparks of living fire was spangled and night deepdrenched in misty acheron heavd up her head and half the world upon breathd darkness forth dark night is cupids day and now begins leander to display loves holy fire with words with sighs and tears which like sweet music enterd heros ears and yet at every word she turnd aside and always cut him off as he replied at last like to a bold sharp sophister with cheerful hope thus he accosted her fair creature let me speak without offence i would my rude words had the influence to lead thy thoughts as thy fair looks do mine then shouldst thou be his prisoner who is thine be not unkind and fair misshapen stuff are of behaviour boisterous and rough o shun me not but hear me ere you go god knows i cannot force love as you do my words shall be as spotless as my youth full of simplicity and naked truth this sacrifice whose sweet perfume descending from venus altar to your footsteps bending doth testify that you exceed her far to whom you offer and whose nun you are why should you worship her her you surpass as much as sparkling diamonds flaring glass a diamond set in lead his worth retains a heavenly nymph belovd of human swains receives no blemish but ofttimes more grace which makes me hope although i am but base base in respect of thee divine and pure dutiful service may thy love procure and i in duty will excel all other as thou in beauty dost exceed loves mother nor heaven nor thou were made to gaze upon as heaven preserves all things so save thou one a statelybuilded ship well riggd and tall the ocean maketh more majestical why vowst thou then to live in sestos here who on loves seas more glorious wouldst appear like untund golden strings all women are which long time lie untouchd will harshly jar vessels of brass oft handled brightly shine what diffrence betwixt the richest mine and basest mould but use for both not usd are of like worth then treasure is abusd when misers keep it being put to loan in time it will return us two for one rich robes themselves and others do adorn neither themselves nor others if not worn who builds a palace and rams up the gate shall see it ruinous and desolate ah simple hero learn thyself to cherish lone women like to empty houses perish less sins the poor rich man that starves himself in heaping up a mass of drossy pelf than such as you his golden earth remains which after his decease some other gains but this fair gem sweet in the loss alone when you fleet hence can be bequeathd to none or if it could down from th enamelld sky all heaven would come to claim this legacy and with intestine broils the world destroy and quite confound natures sweet harmony well therefore by the gods decreed it is we human creatures should enjoy that bliss one is no number maids are nothing then without the sweet society of men wilt thou live single still one shalt thou be though neversingling hymen couple thee wild savages that drink of running springs think water far excels all earthly things but they that daily taste neat wine despise it virginity albeit some highly prize it compard with marriage had you tried them both differs as much as wine and water doth base bullion for the stamps sake we allow even so for mens impression do we you by which alone our reverend fathers say women receive perfection every way this idol which you term virginity is neither essence subject to the eye no nor to any one exterior sense nor hath it any place of residence nor ist of earth or mould celestial or capable of any form at all of that which hath no being do not boast things that are not at all are never lost men foolishly do call it virtuous what virtue is it that is born with us much less can honour be ascribd thereto honour is purchasd by the deeds we do believe me hero honour is not won until some honourable deed be done seek you for chastity immortal fame and know that some have wrongd dianas name whose name is it if she be false or not so she be fair but some vile tongues will blot but you are fair ay me so wondrous fair so young so gentle and so debonair as greece will think if thus you live alone some one or other keeps you as his own then hero hate me not nor from me fly to follow swiftlyblasting infamy perhaps thy sacred priesthood makes thee loath tell me to whom madst thou that heedless oath to venus answerd she and as she spake forth from those two tralucent cisterns brake a stream of liquid pearl which down her face made milkwhite paths whereon the gods might trace to joves high court he thus replied the rites in which loves beauteous empress most delights are banquets doric music midnight revel plays masks and all that stern age counteth evil thee as a holy idiot doth she scorn for thou in vowing chastity hast sworn to rob her name and honour and thereby committst a sin far worse than perjury even sacrilege against her deity through regular and formal purity to expiate which sin kiss and shake hands such sacrifice as this venus demands thereat she smild and did deny him so as put thereby yet might he hope for mo which makes him quickly reinforce his speech and her in humble manner thus beseech though neither gods nor men may thee deserve yet for her sake whom you have vowd to serve abandon fruitless cold virginity the gentle queen of loves sole enemy then shall you most resemble venus nun when venus sweet rites are performed and done flintbreasted pallas joys in single life but pallas and your mistress are at strife love hero then and be not tyrannous but heal the heart that thou hast wounded thus nor stain thy youthful years with avarice fair fools delight to be accounted nice the richest corn dies if it be not reapt beauty alone is lost too warily kept these arguments he usd and many more wherewith she yielded that was won before heros looks yielded but her words made war women are won when they begin to jar thus having swallowd cupids golden hook the more she strivd the deeper was she strook yet evilly feigning anger strove she still and would be thought to grant against her will so having pausd a while at last she said who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid ay me such words as these should i abhor and yet i like them for the orator with that leander stooped to have embracd her but from his spreading arms away she cast her and thus bespake him gentle youth forbear to touch the sacred garments which i wear upon a rock and underneath a hill far from the town where all is whist and still save that the sea playing on yellow sand sends forth a rattling murmur to the land whose sound allures the golden morpheus in silence of the night to visit us my turret stands and there god knows i play with venus swans and sparrows all the day a dwarfish beldam bears me company that hops about the chamber where i lie and spends the night that might be better spent in vain discourse and apish merriment come thither as she spake this her tongue trippd for unawares come thither from her slippd and suddenly her former colour changd and here and there her eyes through anger rangd and like a planet moving several ways at one self instant she poor soul assays loving not to love at all and every part strove to resist the motions of her heart and hands so pure so innocent nay such as might have made heaven stoop to have a touch did she uphold to venus and again vowd spotless chastity but all in vain cupid beats down her prayers with his wings her vows above the empty air he flings all deep enragd his sinewy bow he bent and shot a shaft that burning from him went wherewith she strooken lookd so dolefully as made love sigh to see his tyranny and as she wept her tears to pearl he turnd and wound them on his arm and for her mournd then towards the palace of the destinies laden with languishment and grief he flies and to those stern nymphs humbly made request both might enjoy each other and be blest but with a ghastly dreadful countenance threatening a thousand deaths at every glance they answerd love nor would vouchsafe so much as one poor word their hate to him was such hearken awhile and i will tell you why heavens wingd herald joveborn mercury the selfsame day that he asleep had laid enchanted argus spied a country maid whose careless hair instead of pearl tadorn it glisterd with dew as one that seemed to scorn it her breath as fragrant as the morning rose her mind pure and her tongue untaught to glose yet proud she was for lofty pride that dwells in towerd courts is oft in shepherds cells and tootoo well the fair vermillion knew and silver tincture of her cheeks that drew the love of every swain on her this god enamourd was and with his snaky rod did charm her nimble feet and made her stay the while upon a hillock down he lay and sweetly on his pipe began to play and with smooth speech her fancy to assay till in his twining arms he lockd her fast and then he wood with kisses and at last as shepherds do her on the ground he laid and tumbling in the grass he often strayd beyond the bounds of shame in being bold to eye those parts which no eye should behold and like an insolent commanding lover boasting his parentage would needs discover the way to new elysium but she whose only dower was her chastity having striven in vain was now about to cry and crave the help of shepherds that were nigh herewith he stayd his fury and began to give her leave to rise away she ran after went mercury who used such cunning as she to hear his tale let off her running maids are not won by brutish force and might but speeches full of pleasures and delight and knowing hermes courted her was glad that she such loveliness and beauty had as could provoke his liking yet was mute and neither would deny nor grant his suit still vowd he love she wanting no excuse to feed him with delays as women use or thirsting after immortality all women are ambitious naturally imposd upon her lover such a task as he ought not perform nor yet she ask a draught of flowing nectar she requested wherewith the king of gods and men is feasted he ready to accomplish what she willd stole some from hebe hebe joves cup filld and gave it to his simple rustic love which being known as what is hid from jove he inly stormd and waxd more furious than for the fire filchd by prometheus and thrusts him down from heaven he wandering here in mournful terms with sad and heavy cheer complaind to cupid cupid for his sake to be revengd on jove did undertake and those on whom heaven earth and hell relies i mean the adamantine destinies he wounds with love and forcd them equally to dote upon deceitful mercury they offerd him the deadly fatal knife that shears the slender threads of human life at his fairfeatherd feet the engines laid which th earth from ugly chaos den upweighd these he regarded not but did entreat that jove usurper of his fathers seat might presently be banishd into hell and agd saturn in olympus dwell they granted what he cravd and once again saturn and ops began their golden reign murder rape war and lust and treachery were with jove closd in stygian empery but long this blessd time continud not as soon as he his wishd purpose got he reckless of his promise did despise the love of th everlasting destinies they seeing it both love and him abhorrd and jupiter unto his place restord and but that learning in despite of fate will mount aloft and enter heavengate and to the seat of jove itself advance hermes had slept in hell with ignorance yet as a punishment they added this that he and poverty should always kiss and to this day is every scholar poor gross gold from them runs headlong to the boor likewise the angry sisters thus deluded to venge themselves on hermes have concluded that midas brood shall sit in honours chair to which the muses sons are only heir and fruitful wits that inaspiring are shall discontent run into regions far and few great lords in virtuous deeds shall joy but be surprisd with every garish toy and still enrich the lofty servile clown who with encroaching guile keeps learning

and his desire by this sad hero with love unacquainted viewing leanders face fell down and fainted he kissd her and breathd life into her lips wherewith as one displeasd away she trips yet as she went full often lookd behind and many poor excuses did she find to linger by the way and once she stayd and would have turnd again but was afraid in offering parley to be counted light so on she goes and in her idle flight her painted fan of curled plumes let fall thinking to train leander therewithal he being a novice knew not what she meant but stayd and after her a letter sent which joyful hero answerd in such sort as he had hope to scale the beauteous fort wherein the liberal graces locked their wealth and therefore to her tower he got by stealth wide open stood the door he need not climb and she herself before the pointed time had spread the board with roses strewd the room and oft looked out and mused he did not come at last he came o who can tell the greeting these greedy lovers had at their first meeting he asked she gave and nothing was denied both to each other quickly were affied look how their hands so were their hearts united and what he did she willingly requited sweet are the kisses the embracements sweet when like desires and like affections meet for from the earth to heaven is cupid raised where fancy is in equal balance paised yet she this rashness suddenly repented and turnd aside and to herself lamented as if her name and honour had been wronged by being possessed of him for whom she longed i and she wished albeit not from her heart that he would leave her turret and depart the mirthful god of amorous pleasure smiled to see how he this captive nymph beguiled for hitherto he did but fan the fire and kept it down that it might mount the higher now waxd she jealous lest his love abated fearing her own thoughts made her to be hated therefore unto him hastily she goes and like light salmacis her body throws upon his bosom where with yielding eyes she offers up herself a sacrifice to slake her anger if he were displeased o what god would not therewith be appeased like sops cock this jewel he enjoyed and as a brother with his sister toyed supposing nothing else was to be done now he her favour and goodwill had won but know you not that creatures wanting sense by nature have a mutual appetence and wanting organs to advance a step movd by loves force unto each other lep much more in subjects having intellect some hidden influence breeds like effect albeit leander rude in love and raw long dallying with hero nothing saw that might delight him more yet he suspected some amorous rites or other were neglected therefore unto his body hers he clung she fearing on the rushes to be flung strived with redoubled strength the more she strived the more a gentle pleasing heat revived which taught him all that elder lovers know and now the same gan so to scorch and glow as in plain terms yet cunningly hed crave it love always makes those eloquent that have it she with a kind of granting put him by it and ever as he thought himself most nigh it like to the tree of tantalus she fled and seeming lavish saved her maidenhead neer king more sought to keep his diadem than hero this inestimable gem above our life we love a steadfast friend yet when a token of great worth we send we often kiss it often look thereon and stay the messenger that would be gone no marvel then though hero would not yield so soon to part from that she dearly held jewels being lost are found again this never tis lost but once and once lost lost for ever now had the morn espied her lovers steeds whereat she starts puts on her purple weeds and red for anger that he stayed so long all headlong throws herself the clouds among and now leander fearing to be missed embraced her suddenly took leave and kissed long was he taking leave and loath to go and kissed again as lovers use to do sad hero wrung him by the hand and wept saying let your vows and promises be kept then standing at the door she turned about as loath to see leander going out and now the sun that through th horizon peeps as pitying these lovers downward creeps so that in silence of the cloudy night though it was morning did he take his flight but what the secret trusty night concealed leanders amorous habit soon revealed with cupids myrtle was his bonnet crowned about his arms the purple riband wound wherewith she wreathd her largelyspreading hair nor could the youth abstain but he must wear the sacred ring wherewith she was endowed when first religious chastity she vowed which made his love through sestos to be known and thence unto abydos sooner blown than he could sail for incorporeal fame whose weight consists in nothing but her name is swifter than the wind whose tardy plumes are reeking water and dull earthly fumes home when he came he seemed not to be there but like exild air thrust from his sphere set in a foreign place and straight from thence alcideslike by mighty violence he would have chasd away the swelling main that him from her unjustly did detain like as the sun in a diameter fires and inflames objects removd far and heateth kindly shining laterally so beauty sweetly quickens when tis nigh but being separated and removed burns where it cherished murders where it loved therefore even as an index to a book so to his mind was young leanders look o none but gods have power their love to hide affection by the countenance is descried the light of hidden fire itself discovers and love that is concealed betrays poor lovers his secret flame apparently was seen leanders father knew where he had been and for the same mildly rebukd his son thinking to quench the sparkles newbegun but love resisted once grows passionate and nothing more than counsel lovers hate for as a hot proud horse highly disdains to have his head controlled but breaks the reins spits forth the ringled bit and with his hoves checks the submissive ground so he that loves the more he is restraind the worse he fares what is it now but mad leander dares o hero hero thus he cried full oft and then he got him to a rock aloft where having spied her tower long stard he ont and prayd the narrow toiling hellespont to part in twain that he might come and go but still the rising billows answerd no with that he strippd him to the ivory skin and crying love i come leapd lively in whereat the sapphirevisaged god grew proud and made his capering triton sound aloud imagining that ganymede displeasd had left the heavens therefore on him he seizd leander strived the waves about him wound and pulld him to the bottom where the ground was strewed with pearl and in low coral groves sweetsinging mermaids sported with their loves on heaps of heavy gold and took great pleasure to spurn in careless sort the shipwreck treasure for here the stately azure palace stood where kingly neptune and his train abode the lusty god embracd him called him love and swore he never should return to jove but when he knew it was not ganymed for under water he was almost dead he heavd him up and looking on his face beat down the bold waves with his triple mace which mounted up intending to have kissd him and fell in drops like tears because they missd him leander being up began to swim and looking back saw neptune follow him whereat aghast the poor soul gan to cry o let me visit hero ere i die the god put helles bracelet on his arm and swore the sea should never do him harm he clapped his plump cheeks with his tresses played and smiling wantonly his love bewrayed he watched his arms and as they opend wide at every stroke betwixt them would he slide and steal a kiss and then run out and dance and as he turnd cast many a lustful glance and throw him gaudy toys to please his eye and dive into the water and there pry upon his breast his thighs and every limb and up again and close beside him swim and talk of love leander made reply you are deceivd i am no woman i thereat smild neptune and then told a tale how that a shepherd sitting in a vale playd with a boy so lovelyfair and kind as for his love both earth and heaven pind that of the cooling river durst not drink lest waternymphs should pull him from the brink and when he sported in the fragrant lawns goatfooted satyrs and upstaring fauns would steal him thence ere half this tale was done ay me leander cried th enamoured sun that now should shine on thetis glassy bower descends upon my radiant heros tower o that these tardy arms of mine were wings and as he spake upon the waves he springs neptune was angry that he gave no ear and in his heart revenging malice bare he flung at him his mace but as it went he calld it in for love made him repent the mace returning back his own hand hit as meaning to be venged for darting it when this freshbleeding wound leander viewed his colour went and came as if he rued the grief which neptune felt in gentle breasts relenting thoughts remorse and pity rests and who have hard hearts and obdurate minds but vicious harebrained and illiterate hinds the god seeing him with pity to be moved thereon concluded that he was beloved love is too full of faith too credulous with folly and false hope deluding us wherefore leanders fancy to surprise to the rich ocean for gifts he flies tis wisdom to give much a gift prevails when deep persuading oratory fails by this leander being near the land cast down his weary feet and felt the sand breathless albeit he were he rested not till to the solitary tower he got and knocked and called at which celestial noise the longing heart of hero much more joys than nymphs and shepherds when the timbrel rings or crookd dolphin when the sailor sings she stayed not for her robes but straight arose and drunk with gladness to the door she goes where seeing a naked man she screeched for fear such sights as this to tender maids are rare and ran into the dark herself to hide rich jewels in the dark are soonest spied unto her was he led or rather drawn by those white limbs which sparkled through the lawn the nearer that he came the more she fled and seeking refuge slipt into her bed whereon leander sitting thus began through numbing cold all feeble faint and wan if not for love yet love for pitysake me in thy bed and maiden bosom take at least vouchsafe these arms some little room who hoping to embrace thee cheerly swoom this head was beat with many a churlish billow and therefore let it rest upon thy pillow herewith affrighted hero shrunk away and in her lukewarm place leander lay whose lively heat like fire from heaven fet would animate gross clay and higher set the drooping thoughts of basedeclining souls than drearymarscarousing nectar bowls his hands he cast upon her like a snare she overcome with shame and sallow fear like chaste diana when acton spied her being suddenly betrayd divd down to hide her and as her silver body downward went with both her hands she made the

hesperides whose fruit none rightly can describe but he that pulls or shakes it from the golden tree wherein leander on her quivering breast breathless spoke something and sighd out the rest which so prevaild as he with small ado enclosd her in his arms and kissd her too and every kiss to her was as a charm and to leander as a fresh alarm so that the truce was broke and she alas poor silly maiden at his mercy was love is not full of pity as men say but deaf and cruel where he means to prey and now she wishd this night were never done and sighd to think upon th approaching sun for much it grievd her that the bright daylight should know the pleasure of this blessd night and them like mars and erycine display both in each others arms chaind as they lay again she knew not how to frame her look or speak to him who in a moment took that which so long so charily she kept and fain by stealth away she would have crept and to some corner secretly have gone leaving leander in the bed alone

enjoyer supplying it with power of a destroyer so fard fair hero in th expugnd fort of her chaste bosom and of every sort strange thoughts possessd her ransacking her breast for that that was not there her wonted rest she was a mother straight and bore with pain thoughts that spake straight and wishd their mother slain she hates their lives and they their own and hers such strife still grows where sin the race prefers love is a golden bubble full of dreams that waking breaks and fills us with extremes she musd how she could look upon her sire and not shew that without that was intire for as a glass is an inanimate eye and outward forms embraceth inwardly so is the eye an animate glass that shows informs without us and as phoebus throws his beams abroad though he in clouds be closd still glancing by them till he find opposd a loose and rorid vapour that is fit t event his searching beams and useth it to form a tender twentycolourd eye cast in a circle round about the sky so when our fiery soul our bodys star that ever is in motion circular conceives a form in seeking to display it through all our cloudy parts it doth convey it forth at the eye as the most pregnant place and that reflects it round about the face and this event uncourtly hero thought her inward guilt would in her looks have wrought for yet the worlds stale cunning she resisted to bear foul thoughts yet forge what looks she listed and held it for a very silly sleight to make a perfect metal counterfeit glad to disclaim herself proud of an art that makes the face a pandar to the heart those be the painted moons whose lights profane beautys true heaven at full still in their wane those be the lapwingfaces that still cry here tis when that they vow is nothing nigh base fools when every moorish fool can teach that which men think the height of human reach but custom that the apoplexy is of bedrid nature and lives led amiss and takes away all feeling of offence yet brazd not heros brow with impudence and this she thought most hard to bring to pass to seem in countenance other than she was as if she had two souls one for the face one for the heart and that they shifted place as either list to utter or conceal what they conceivd or as one soul did deal with both affairs at once keeps and ejects both at an instant contrary effects retention and ejection in her powers being acts alike

discoursive wits perhaps might find some little hole to pass through all these worldly cinctures yet alas there was a heavenly flame encompassd her her goddess in whose fane she did prefer her virgin vows from whose impulsive sight she knew the black shield of the darkest night could not defend her nor wits subtlest art this was the point piercd hero to the heart who heavy to the death with a deep sigh and hand that languished took a robe was nigh exceeding large and of black cypres made in which she sate hid from the day in shade even over head and face down to her feet her left hand made it at her bosom meet her right hand leand on her heartbowing knee wrappd in unshapeful folds twas death to see her knee stayd that and that her falling face each limb helpd other to put on disgrace no form was seen where form held all her sight but like an embryon that saw never light or like a scorchd statue made a coal with threewingd lightning or a wretched soul muffled with endless darkness she did sit the night had never such a heavy spirit yet might a penetrating eye well see how fast her clear tears melted on her knee through her black veil and turnd as black as it mourning to be her tears then wrought her wit with her broke vow her goddess wrath her fame all tools that enginous despair could frame which made her strew the floor with her torn hair and spread her mantle piecemeal in the air like joves sons club strong passion struck her down and with a piteous shriek enforcd her swoun her shriek made with another shriek ascend the frighted matron that on her did tend and as with her own cry her sense was slain so with the other it was called again she rose and to her bed made forcd way and laid her down even where leander lay and all this while the red sea of her blood ebbd with leander but now turnd the flood and all her fleet of spirits came swelling in with child of sail and did hot fight begin with those severe conceits she too much marked and here leanders beauties were embarked he came in swimming painted all with joys such as might sweeten hell his thought destroys all her destroying thoughts she thought she felt his heart in hers with her contentions melt and chide her soul that it could so much err to check the true joys he deserved in her her freshheat blood cast figures in her eyes and she supposd she saw in neptunes skies how her star wanderd

when we live loosely ever but bound as we are we live loosely never two constant lovers being joind in one yielding to one another yield to none we know not how to vow till love unblind us and vows made ignorantly never bind us too true it is that when tis gone men hate the joy as vain they took in loves estate but thats since they have lost the heavenly light should show them way to judge of all things right when life is gone death must implant his terror as death is foe to life so love to error before we love how range we through this sphere searching the sundry fancies hunted here now with desire of wealth transported quite beyond our free humanitys delight now with ambition climbing falling towers whose hope to scale our fear to fall devours now rapt with pastimes pomp all joys impure in things without us no delight is sure but love with all joys crowned within doth sit o goddess pity love and pardon it thus spake she weeping but her goddess ear burnd with too stern a heat and would not hear ay me hath heavens strait fingers no more graces for such as hero than for homeliest faces yet she hoped well and in her sweet conceit weighing her arguments she thought them weight and that the logic of leanders beauty and them together would bring proofs of duty and if her soul that was a skilful glance of heavens great essence found such imperance in her loves beauties she had confidence jove loved him too and pardoned her offence beauty in heaven and earth this grace doth win it supples rigour and it lessens sin thus her sharp wit her love her secrecy trooping together

her fair goddess and her powerful son as relics of her latefelt passion and in that holy sort she vowd to end them in hope her violent fancies that did rend them would as quite fade in her loves holy

chaste desire a golden star shined in her naked breast in honour of the queenlight of the east in her right hand she held a silver wand on whose bright top peristera did stand who was a nymph but now transformed a dove and in her life was dear in venus love and for her sake she ever since that time choosed doves to draw her coach through heavens blue clime her plenteous hair in curld billows swims on her bright shoulder her harmonious limbs sustained no more but a most subtile veil that hung on them as it durst not assail their different concord for the weakest air could raise it swelling from her beauties fair nor did it cover but adumbrate only her most heartpiercing parts that a blest eye might see as it did shadow fearfully all that alllovedeserving paradise it was as blue as the most freezing skies near the seas hue for thence her goddess came on it a scarf she wore of wondrous frame in midst whereof she wrought a virgins face from whose each cheek a fiery blush did chase two crimson flames that did two ways extend spreading the ample scarf to either end which figurd the division of her mind whiles yet she rested bashfully inclind and stood not resolute to wed leander this servd her white neck for a purple sphere and cast itself at full breadth down her back there since the first breath that begun the wrack of her free quiet from leanders lips she wrought a sea in one flame full of ships but that one ship where all her wealth did pass like simple merchants goods leander was for in that sea she naked figured him her diving needle taught him how to swim and to each thread did such resemblance give for joy to be so like him it did live things senseless live by art and rational die by rude contempt of art and industry scarce could she work but in her strength of thought she feard she prickd leander as she wrought and oft would shriek so that her guardian frighted would startling haste as with some mischief cited they double life that dead things griefs sustain they kill that feel not their friends living pain sometimes she feard he sought her infamy and then as she was working of his eye she thought to prick it out to quench her ill but as she prickd it grew more perfect still trifling attempts no serious acts advance the fire of love is blown by dalliance in working his fair neck she did so grace it she still was working her own arms t embrace it that and his shoulders and his hands were seen above the stream and with a pure seagreen she did so quaintly shadow every limb all might be seen beneath the waves to swim in this conceited scarf she wrought beside a moon in change and shooting stars did glide in number after her with bloody beams which figurd her affects in their extremes pursuing nature in her cynthian body and did her thoughts running on change imply for maids take more delight when they prepare and think of wives states than when wives they are beneath all these she wrought a fisherman drawing his nets from forth the ocean who drew so hard ye might discover well the toughend sinews in his neck did swell his inward strains drave out his bloodshot eyes and springs of sweat did in his forehead rise yet was of naught but of a serpent sped that in his bosom flew and stung him dead and this by fate into her mind was sent not wrought by mere instinct of her intent at the scarfs other end her hand did frame near the forkd point of the divided flame a country virgin keeping of a vine who did of hollow bulrushes combine snares for the stubbleloving grasshopper and by her lay her scrip that nourishd her within a myrtle shade she sate and sung and tufts of waving reeds above her sprung where lurked two foxes that while she applied her trifling snares their thieveries did divide one to the vine another to her scrip that she did negligently overslip by which her fruitful vine and wholesome fare she suffered spoiled to make a childish snare these ominous fancies did her soul express and every finger made a prophetess to show what death was hid in loves disguise and make her judgment conquer destinies o what sweet forms fair ladies souls do shroud were they made seen and forcd through their blood if through their beauties like rich work through lawn they would set forth their minds with virtues drawn in letting graces from their fingers fly to still their eyas thoughts with industry that their plied wits in numbered silks might sing passions huge conquest and their needles leading affection prisoner through their ownbuilt cities pinioned with stones and arachnean ditties proceed we now with heros sacrifice she odours burned and from their smoke did rise unsavoury fumes that air with plagues inspired and then the consecrated sticks she fired on whose pale flames an angry spirit flew and beat it down still as it upward grew the virgin tapers that on th altar stood when she inflamd them burned as red as blood all sad ostents of that too near success that made such moving beauties motionless then hero wept but her affrighted eyes she quickly wrested from the sacrifice shut them and inwards for leander looked searchd her soft bosom and from thence she plucked his lovely picture which when she had viewed her beauties were with all loves joys renewed the odours sweetend and the fires burned clear leanders form left no ill object there such was his beauty that the force of light whose knowledge teacheth wonders infinite the strength of number and proportion nature had placed in it to make it known art was her daughter and what human wits for study lost entombed in drossy spirits after this accident which for her glory hero could not but make a history th inhabitants of sestos and abydos did every year with feasts propitious to fair leanders picture sacrifice

send her with this confirmd she vowd to banish quite all thought of any check to her delight and in contempt of silly bashfulness she would the faith of her desires profess where her religion should be policy to follow love with zeal her piety her chamber her cathedralchurch should be and her leander her chief deity for in her love these did the gods forego and though her knowledge did not teach her so yet did it teach her this that what her heart did greatest hold in her selfgreatest part that she did make her god and twas less naught to leave gods in profession and in thought than in her love and life for therein lies most of her duties and their dignities and rail the brainbald world at what it will thats the grand atheism that reigns in it still yet singularity she would use no more for she was singular too much before but she would please the world with fair pretext love would not leave her conscience perplext great men that will have less do for them still must bear them out though th acts be neer so ill meanness must pander be to excellence pleasure atones falsehood and conscience dissembling was the worst thought hero then and that was best now she must live with men o virtuous love that taught her to do best when she did worst and when she thought it least thus would she still proceed in works divine and in her sacred state of priesthood shine handling the holy rites with hands as bold as if therein she did joves thunder hold and need not fear those menaces of error which she at others threw with greatest terror o lovely hero nothing is thy sin weighd with those foul faults other priests are in that having neither faiths nor works nor beauties t engender any scuse for slubbered duties with as much countenance fill their holy chairs and sweat denouncements gainst profane affairs as if their lives were cut out by their places and they the only fathers of the graces now as with settled mind she did repair her thoughts to sacrifice her

all eyes were on her hero did command an altar decked with sacred state should stand at the feasts upper end close by the bride on which the pretty nymph might sit espied then all were silent every one so hears as all their senses climbd into their ears and first this amorous tale that fitted well fair hero and the nuptials she did tell the tale of teras hymen that now is god of nuptial rites and crowns with honour love and his delights of athens was a youth so sweet of face that many thought him of the female race such quickening brightness did his clear eyes dart warm went their beams to his beholders heart in such pure leagues his beauties were combind that there your nuptial contracts first were signed for as proportion white and crimson meet in beautys mixture all right clear and sweet the eye responsible the golden hair and none is held without the other fair all spring together all together fade such intermixd affections should invade two perfect lovers which being yet unseen their virtues and their comforts copied been in beautys concord subject to the eye and that in hymen pleased so matchlessly that lovers were esteemed in their full grace like form and colour mixed in hymens face and such sweet concord was thought worthy then of torches music feasts and greatest men so hymen lookd that even the chastest mind he movd to join in joys of sacred kind for only now his chins first down consorted his heads rich fleece in golden curls contorted and as he was so loved he loved so too so should best beauties bound by nuptials do bright eucharis who was by all men said the noblest fairest and the richest maid of all th athenian damsels hymen lovd with such transmission that his heart removd from his white breast to hers but her estate in passing his was so interminate for wealth and honour that his love durst feed on naught but sight and hearing nor could breed hope of requital the grand prize of love nor could he hear or see but he must prove how his rare beautys music would agree with maids in consort therefore robbd he his chin of those same few first fruits it bore and clad in such attire as virgins wore he kept them company and might right well for he did all but eucharis excel in all the fair of beauty yet he wanted virtue to make his own desires implanted in his dear eucharis for women never love beauty in their sex but envy ever his judgment yet that durst not suit address nor past due means presume of due success reason gat fortune in the end to speed to his best prayers but strange it seemed indeed that fortune should a chaste affection bless preferment seldom graceth bashfulness nor gracd it hymen yet but many a dart and many an amorous thought enthralled his heart ere he obtained her and he sick became forced to abstain her sight and then the flame raged in his bosom o what grief did fill him sight made him sick and want of sight did kill him the virgins wonderd where ditia stayd for so did hymen term himself a maid at length with sickly looks he greeted them tis strange to see gainst what an extreme stream a lover strives poor hymen lookd so ill that as in merit he increasd still by suffering much so he in grace decreasd women are most won when men merit least if merit look not well love bids stand by loves special lesson is to please the eye and hymen soon recovering all he lost deceiving still these maids but himself most his love and he with many virgin dames noble by birth noble by beautys flames leaving the town with songs and hallowd lights to do great ceres eleusina rites of zealous sacrifice were made a prey to barbarous rovers that in ambush lay and with rude hands enforcd their shining spoil far from the darkened city tired with toil and when the yellow issue of the sky came trooping forth jealous of cruelty to their bright fellows of this underheaven into a double night they saw them driven a horrid cave the thieves black mansion where weary of the journey they had gone their last nights watch and drunk with their sweet gains dull morpheus enterd laden with silken chains stronger than iron and bound the swelling veins and tird senses of these lawless swains but when the virgin lights thus dimly burnd o what a hell was heaven in how they mournd and wrung their hands and wound their gentle forms into the shapes of sorrow golden storms fell from their eyes as when the sun appears and yet it rains so showd their eyes their tears and as when funeral dames watch a dead corse weeping about it telling with remorse what pains he felt how long in pain he lay how little food he ate what he would say and then mix mournful tales of others deaths smothering themselves in clouds of their own breaths at length one cheering other call for wine the golden bowl drinks tears out of their eyne as they drink wine from it and round it goes each helping other to relieve their woes so cast these virgins beauties mutual rays one lights another face the face displays lips by reflection kissed and hands hands shook even by the whiteness each of other took but hymen now used friendly morpheus aid slew every thief and rescued every maid and now did his enamourd passion take heart from his hearty deed whose worth did make his hope of bounteous eucharis more strong and now came love with proteus who had long juggled the little god with prayers and gifts ran through all shapes and varied all his shifts to win loves stay with him and make him love him and when he saw no strength of sleight could move him to make him love or stay he nimbly turned into loves self he so extremely burned and thus came love with proteus and his power t encounter eucharis first like the flower that junos milk did spring the silver lily he fell on hymens hand who straight did spy the bounteous godhead and with wondrous joy offerd it eucharis she wonderous coy drew back her hand the subtle flower did woo it and drawing it near mixed so you could not know it as two clear tapers mix in one their light so did the lily and the hand their white she viewed it and her view the form bestows amongst her spirits for as colour flows from superficies of each thing we see even so with colours forms emitted be and where loves form is love is love is form he entered at the eye his sacred storm rose from the hand loves sweetest instrument it stirred her bloods sea so that high it went and beat in bashful waves gainst the white shore of her divided cheeks it raged the more because the tide went gainst the haughty wind of her estate and birth and as we find in fainting ebbs the flowery zephyr hurls the greenhaired hellespont broke in silver curls gainst heros tower but in his blasts retreat the waves obeying him they after beat leaving the chalky shore a great way pale then moist it freshly with another gale so ebbed and flowed the blood in eucharis face coyness and love strived which had greatest grace virginity did fight on coyness side fear of her parents frowns and female pride loathing the lower place more than it loves the high contents desert and virtue moves with love fought hymens beauty and his valure which scarce could so much favour yet allure to come to strike but fameless idle stood action is fiery valours sovereign good but love once entered wished no greater aid than he could find within thought thought betrayd the bribed but incorrupted garrison sung io hymen there those songs begun and love was grown so rich with such a gain and wanton with the ease of his free reign that he would turn into her roughest frowns to turn them out and thus he hymen crowns king of his thoughts mans greatest empery this was his first brave step to deity home to the mourning city they repair with news as wholesome as the morning air to the sad parents of each savd maid but hymen and his eucharis had laid this plat to make the flame of their delight round as the moon at full and full as bright because the parents of chaste eucharis exceeding hymens so might cross their bliss and as the world rewards deserts that law cannot assist with force so when they saw their daughter safe take vantage of their own praise hymens valour much nothing bestown hymen must leave the virgins in a grove far off from athens and go first to prove if to restore them all with fame and life he should enjoy his dearest as his wife this told to all the maids the most agree the riper sort knowing what tis to be the first mouth of a news so far derived and that to hear and bear news brave folks lived as being a carriage special hard to bear occurrents these occurrents being so dear they did with grace protest they were content t accost their friends with all their compliment for hymens good but to incur their harm there he must pardon them this wit went warm to adolesches brain a nymph born high made all of voice and fire that upwards fly her heart and all her forces nether train climbd to her tongue and thither fell her brain since it could go no higher and it must go all powers she had even her tongue did so in spirit and quickness she much joy did take and loved her tongue only for quickness sake and she would haste and tell the rest all stay hymen goes one the nymph another way and what became of her ill tell at last yet take her visage now moistlipped longfaced thin like an iron wedge so sharp and tart as twere of purpose made to cleave loves heart well were this lovely beauty rid of her and hymen did at athens now prefer his welcome suit which he with joy aspired a hundred princely youths with him retired to fetch the nymphs chariots and music went and home they came heaven with applauses rent the nuptials straight proceed whiles all the town fresh in their joys might do them most renown first goldlocked hymen did to church repair like a quick offering burned in flames of hair and after with a virgin firmament the godheadproving bride attended went before them all she looked in her command as if formgiving cyprias silver hand gripped all their beauties and crushed out one flame she blushed to see how beauty overcame the thoughts of all men next before her went five lovely children decked with ornament of her sweet colours bearing torches by for light was held a happy augury of generation whose efficient right is nothing else but to produce to light the odd disparent number they did choose to show the union married loves should use since in two equal parts it will not sever but the midst holds one to rejoin it ever as common to both parts men therefore deem that equal number gods do not esteem being authors of sweet peace and unity but pleasing to th infernal empery under whose ensigns wars and discords fight since an even number you may disunite in two parts equal naught in middle left to reunite each part from other reft and five they hold in most especial prize since tis the first odd number that doth rise from the two foremost numbers unity that odd and even are which are two and three for one no number is but thence doth flow the powerful race of number next did go a noble matron that did spinning bear a huswifes rock and spindle and did wear a wethers skin with all the snowy fleece to intimate that even the daintiest piece and noblestborn dame should industrious be that which does good disgraceth no degree and now to junos temple they are come where her grave priest stood in the marriageroom on his right arm did hang a scarlet veil and from his shoulders to the ground did trail on either side ribands of white and blue with the red veil he hid the bashful hue of the chaste bride to show the modest shame in coupling with a man should grace a dame then took he the disparent silks and tied the lovers by the waists and side to side in token that thereafter they must bind in one selfsacred knot each others mind before them on an altar he presented both fire and water which was first invented since to ingenerate every human creature and every other birth producd by nature moisture and heat must mix so man and wife for human race must join in nuptial life then one of junos birds the painted jay he sacrificd and took the gall away all which he did behind the altar throw in sign no bitterness of hate should grow twixt married loves nor any least disdain nothing they spake for twas esteemd too plain for the most silken mildness of a maid to let a public audience hear it said she boldly took the man and so respected was bashfulness in athens it erected to chaste agneia which is shamefacedness a sacred temple holding her a goddess and now to feasts masks and triumphant shows the shining troops returned even till earththroes brought forth with joy the thickest part of night when the sweet nuptial song that used to cite all to their rest was by phemone sung first delphian prophetess whose graces sprung out of the muses well she sung before the bride into her chamber at which door a matron and a torchbearer did stand a painted box of confits in her hand the matron held and so did other some that compassed round the honourd nuptial room the custom was that every maid did wear during her maidenhead a silken sphere about her waist above her inmost weed knit with minervas knot and that was freed by the fair bridegroom on the marriagenight with many ceremonies of delight and yet eternized hymens tender bride to suffer it dissolved so sweetly cried the maids that heard so loved and did adore her they wished with all their hearts to suffer for her so had the matrons that with confits stood about the chamber such affectionate blood and so true feeling of her harmless pains that every one a shower of confits rains for which the brideyouths scrambling on the ground in noise of that sweet hail her cries were drownd and thus blest hymen joyed his gracious bride and for his joy was after deified the saffron mirror by which phoebus love green tellus decks her now he held above the cloudy mountains and the noble maid sharpvisaged adolesche that was strayd out of her way in hasting with her news not till this hour th athenian turrets views and now brought home by guides she heard by all that her long kept occurrents would be stale and how fair hymens honours did excel for those rare news which she came short to tell to hear her dear tongue robbed of such a joy made the wellspoken nymph take such a toy that down she sunk when lightning from above shrunk her lean body and for mere free love turnd her into the piedplumd psittacus that now the parrot is surnamd by us who still with counterfeit confusion prates naught but news common to

breathings most brought up in our metropolis and hath his cup brought after him to feasts and much palm bears for his rare judgment in th attire he wears hath seen the hot lowcountries not their heat observes their rampires and their buildings yet and for your sweet discourse with mouths is heard giving instructions with his very beard hath gone with an ambassador and been a great mans mate in

might almost go to heros tower had that kind minute lasted but now the cruel fates with at hasted to all the winds and made them battle fight upon the hellespont for eithers right pretended to the windy monarchy and forth they brake the seas mixed with the sky and tossed distressed leander being in hell as high as heaven bliss not in height doth dwell the destinies sate dancing on the waves to see the glorious winds with mutual braves consume each other o true glass to see how ruinous ambitious statists be to their own glories poor leander cried for help to seaborn venus she denied to boreas that for his atthas sake he would some pity on his hero take and for his own loves sake on his desires but glory never blows cold pitys fires then calld he neptune who through all the noise knew with affright his wreckd leanders voice and up he rose for haste his forehead hit gainst heavens hard crystal his proud waves he smit with his forked sceptre that could not obey much greater powers than neptunes gave them sway they loved leander so in groans they brake when they came near him and such space did take twixt one another loath to issue on that in their shallow furrows earth

raleighs patronage but oldys gives no authority for his statement another of the same nature made since come live with me and be my dear and we will revel all the year in plains and groves on hills and dales where fragrant air breathes sweetest gales there shall you have the beauteous pine the cedar and the spreading vine and all the woods to be a screen lest phoebus kiss my summers queen the seat for your disport shall be over some river in a tree where silver sands and pebbles sing eternal ditties to the spring there shall you see the nymphs at play and how the satyrs spend the day the fishes gliding on the sands offering their bellies to your hands the birds with heavenly tund throats possess woods echoes with sweet notes which to your senses will impart a music to enflame the heart upon the bare and leafless oak the ringdoves wooings will provoke a colder blood than you possess to play with me and do no less in bowers of laurel trimly dight we will outwear the silent night while flora busy is to spread her richest treasure on our bed ten thousand glowworms shall attend and all these sparkling lights shall spend all to adorn and beautify your lodging with most majesty then in mine arms will i enclose lilies fair mixture with the rose whose nice perfection in loves play shall tune me to the highest key thus as we pass the welcome night in sportful pleasures and delight the nimble fairies on the grounds shall dance and sing melodious sounds if these may serve for to entice your presence to loves paradise then come with me and be my dear and we will then begin the year the following verses in imitation of marlowe are by donne the bait come live with me and be my love and we will some new pleasure prove of golden sands and christal brooks with silken lines and silver hooks there will the river whispering run warmd by thine eyes more than the sun and there th enamoured fish will stay begging themselves they may betray when thou wilt swim in that live bath each fish which every channel hath will amorously to thee swim gladder to catch thee than thou him if thou to be so seen beest loath by sun or moon thou darkenest both and if my self have leave to see i heed not their light having thee let others freeze with angling reeds and cut their legs with shells and weeds or treacherously poor fish beset with strangling snare or winding net let coarse

prepare for thee what sweets the country can afford shall bless thy bed and bless thy board the soft sweet moss shall be thy bed with crawling woodbine overspread by which the silvershedding streams shall gently melt thee into dreams thy clothing next shall be a gown made of the fleeces purest down the tongues of kids shall be thy meat their milk thy drink and thou shall eat the paste of filberts for thy bread with cream of cowslips buttered thy feastingtables shall be hills with daisies spread and daffodils where thou shalt sit and redbreast by for meat shall give thee melody ill give thee chains and carcanets of primroses and violets a bag and bottle thou shalt have that richly wrought and this as brave so that as either shall express the wearers no mean shepherdess at shearingtimes

ale but spiced wine to make thy maids and self free mirth all sitting near the glittering hearth thou shalt have ribbands roses rings gloves garters stockings shoes and strings of winning colours that

christofer maryle concernynge his damnable opinions and judgment of relygion and scorne of gods worde from ms harl fol that the indians and many authors of antiquitei have assuredly written of aboue thowsande yeers agone wher adam is proved to have leyved within thowsande yeers he affirmeth that moyses was but a juggler and that one heriots can do more then hee that moyses made the jewes to travell fortie yeers in the wildernes which iorny might have ben don in lesse then one yeer er they came to the promised lande to the intente that those whoe wer privei to most of his subtileteis might perish and so an everlastinge supersticion remayne in the hartes of the people that the firste beginnynge of religion was only to keep men in awe that it was an easye matter for moyses beinge brought up in all the artes of the egiptians to abvse the jewes being a rvde and grosse people that he christ was the sonne of a carpenter and that yf the jewes amonge whome he was born did crvcifye him thei best knew him and whence he came that christ deserved better to dye than barrabas and that the jewes made a good choyce though barrabas were both a theife and a murtherer that yf ther be any god or good religion then it is in the papistes becavse the service of god is performed with more ceremonyes as elevacion of the masse organs singinge men shaven crownes c that all protestantes ar

had as good right to coyne as the queen of englande and that he was acquainted with one poole a prisoner in newgate whoe hath great skill in mixture of mettalls and havinge learned such thinges of him he ment thorough help of a cvnnynge stampemaker to coyne french crownes pistolettes and englishe shillinges that yf christ had instituted the sacramentes with more cerymonyall reverence it would have ben had in more admiracion that it wolde have ben much better beinge administred in a tobacco pype that one richard cholmelei hath confessed that he was perswaded by marloes reason to become an athieste theis thinges with many other shall by good and honest men be proved to be his opinions and common speeches and that this marloe doth not only holde them himself but almost in every company he commeth perswadeth men to athiesme willinge them not to be afrayed of bugbeares and hobgoblins and vtterly scornynge both god and his ministers as i richard bome sic will justify bothe by my othe and the testimony of many honest men and almost all men with whome he hath conversed any tyme will testefy the same and as i thincke all men in christianitei ought to endevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped he sayeth moreover that he hath coated a number of contrarieties out of the scriptures which he hath geeven to some great men who in convenient tyme shalbe named when

interest only to geologists and all may criticise with impunity the career of moses provided that they do not employ the shafts of ridicule too freely marlowes strictures on the new testament grossly exaggerated by the creature who penned the charges were made from the literary point of view we should blame nobody today for saying that the language of revelations is poor and thin when compared with the language of isaiah again as to the statement that romanism alone is logical and that protestantism has no locus standi has not the doctrine been proclaimed again and again in our own day by writers whom we all respect the charge that marlowe had announced his intention of coining french crowns is so utterly absurd as to throw discredit upon all the other statements it must be remembered that the testimony was not upon oath and that the deponent was a ruffian footnotes this is the original title which has been partly scored through to make way for the following title a note delivered
