pop by jim thompson copyright well sir i should have been sitting pretty just about as pretty as a man could sit here i was the high sheriff of potts county and iwas drawing almost two thousand dollars a year not to mention what i could pick up on the side on top of that i had free living quarters on the second floor of the courthouse just as nice a place as a man could ask for and it even had a bathroom so that i didnt have to bathe in a washtub or tramp outside to a privy like most folks in town did i guess you could say that kingdom come was really here as far as i was concerned i had it made and it looked like i could go on having it made being high sheriff of potts county as long as i minded my own business and didnt arrest no one unless i just couldnt get out of it and they didnt amount to nothin and yet i was worried i had so many troubles that i was worried plumb sick id sit down to a meal of maybe half a dozen pork chops and a few fried eggs and a pan of hot biscuits with grits and gravyand icouldnt eat it not all of it id start worrying about those problems of mine and the next thing you knew i was getting up from the table with food still left on my plate it was the same way with sleeping you might say i didnt really get no sleep at all id climb in bed thinking this was one night i was bound to sleep but i wouldnt itd be maybe twenty or thirty minutes before could doze off and then no more than eight or nine hours later id wake up wide awake and i couldnt go back to sleep frazzled and wore out as i was well sir i was layin awake like that one night tossing and turning and going plumb out of my mind until finally i couldnt stand it no longer so i says to myself nick says nick corey these problems of yours are driving you plumb out of your mind so you better think of something fast you better come to a decision nick corey or youre gonna wish you had so i thought and i thought and then i thought some more and finally i came to a decision i decided i didnt know what the heck to do i got out of bed that morning and i shaved and took a bath even if it was only monday and id washed real good the saturday before then i put on my sundaygotomeetin clothes my new sixtydollar stetson and my seventydollarjustin boots and my fourdollar levis i stood in front of the mirror checking myself over real good making sure that i didnt look like some old country boy because i was making a little trip to see a friend of mine i was going to see ken lacey and get his advice about my problems and i always try to look my best when i see ken lacey i had to pass myras bedroom on the way downstairs and she had her door open to catch the breeze and without realizing that i was doing it i stopped and looked in then i went in and looked at her some more and then leased toward the bed on tippytoe and stood looking down at her kind of licking my lips and feeling itchy ill tell you something about me ill tell you for true thats one thing i never had no shortage of i was hardly out of my shift just a barefooted kid with my first pair of boughten britches when the gals started flinging it at me and the older i got the more of em there were id say to myself sometimes nick id say nick corey youd better do something about these gals you better start carrying you a switch and whip em off of you or theyll do you to death but i never did do nothing like that because i just never could bear to hurt a gal a gal cries at me a little and right away im giving in to her well though to get back to the subject i never had no shortage of women and they were all real generous with me which maybe dont seem to add up the way was staring at my wife myra licking my lips and feeling itchy all over because myra was quite a bit older than i was and she looked every bit as mean as she was and believe me she was one danged mean woman but the way it is with me im kind of singleminded i get to thinking about something and i cant think of anything else and maybe i wasnt suffering any shortage but you know how that is i mean its kind of like eating popcorn the more you have the more you want she didnt have a nightdress on it being summer and shed kicked the sheet off and she was kind of lying on her stomach so that i couldnt see her face which made her look a lot better so i stood there staring and steaming and itching and finally i couldnt stand it no longer and i started unbuttoning my shirt after all nick i says to myself after all nick corey this here woman is your wife and you got certain rights well i guess you know what happened or i guess you dont know either because you dont know myra which makes you about as lucky as a person can get anyways she turned over on her back all of a sudden and opened her eyes and just what she said do you think youre doing i told her i was getting ready to take a trip over to the county where ken lacey was sheriff id probably be gone until late that night said and wed probably get real lonesome for each other so maybe we ought to get together first huh she said almost spitting the word at me do you think id want you even if i was of a mind to have relations with a man well i said i kind of thought maybe you might i mean i kind of hoped so i mean after all why not because i can hardly stand the sight of you thats why because youre stupid well i said i aint sure i can agree with you myra i mean i aint saying youre wrong but i aint saying youre right either anyways even if i am stupid you cant hardly fault me for it theys lots of stupid people in the world youre not only stupid but youre spineless she said youre about the poorest excuse for nothing i ever laid eyes on well looky i said if you feel that way why for did you marry me listen to him listen to the beast she said as if he didnt know why as if he didnt know that i had to marry him after he raped me well that made me kind of sore you know she was always saying id raped her and it always made me kind of sore i couldnt really argue about her saying was stupid and spineless because probably aint real smart who wants a smart sheriff and i figure its a lot nicer to turn your back on trouble than it is to look at it i mean what the heck we all got trouble enough of our own without butting in on other peoples but when she said i was a rapist that was something else i mean there just wasnt a word of truth in it because it just didnt make sense why for would a fella like me rape a woman when he had so many generous gals chasing him well ill tell you about this rape business i said getting kind of red in the face as i rebuttoned my shirt i aint saying youre a liar because that wouldnt be polite but ill tell you this maam if loved liars id hug you to death well that really started her off she started blubbering and bawling like a calf in a hail storm and of course that woke up her halfwitted brother lennie so he came rushing in blubbering and rolling his eyes and slobbering all over his chin what you done to myra he says spraying spit for about twenty feet what you gone an done to her nick i didnt say anything being busy dodging the spit he went stumbling over to myra and she took him into her arms glaring at me you beast now look what youve done i said what the heck i hadnt done nothing far as i could see lennie was pretty near always bawling and slobbering about the only time he aint i said is when hes sneaking around town peeking into some womans window you you bully she said faulting poor lennie for something he cant help you know hes as innocent as a lamb i said yeah well maybe because there wasnt much else to say and it was getting close to train time i started toward the hall door and she didnt like that me walking out without so much as a begpardon so she blazed away at me again you better watch your step mr nick corey you know what will happen if you dont i stopped and turned around what will happen i said ill tell the people in this county the truth about you well see how long youll be sheriff then after i tell them you raped me ill tell you right now what will happen i said id be run out of my job before i could say scat you certainly would youd better remember it too ill remember i said an heres something for you to remember if i aint sheriff then i got nothing to lose have i it dont make a good goshdamn about anything and if i aint sheriff you aint the sheriffs wife so where the heck will that leave you you and your half witted brother her eyes popped and she sucked in her breath with a gasp it was the first time id spoken up to her for a long time and it kind of took the starch out of her i gave her a meaningful nod and went out the door when i was about halfway down the stairs she called to me shed moved real fast throwing on a robe and working up a smile nick she said kind of cocking her head to one side why dont you come back for a few minutes hmmm i guess not i said im kind of out of the mood weel maybe i could get you back in the mood hmmmm i said i guessed not anyways i had to catch a train and id have to grab a bite to eat first nick she said sort of nervouslike you you wouldnt do anything foolish would youjust because youre angry with me no i wouldnt i told her no moren you would myra well have a nice day dear the same to you maam i said and then i went on downstairs into the courthouse proper and out the front door i almost took a header as i came out into the dusky haze of early morning because the danged place was being painted and the painters had left their ladders and cans scattered all over everywhere out on the sidewalk i looked back to see what kind of progress theyd been making the way it looked to me they hadnt made hardly any at all in the last two three days they were still working on the upper front floor but that wasnt none of my buttin i could have painted the whole building myself in three days but i wasnt a county commissioner and i didnt have a painting contractor for a brotherinlaw some colored folks had a cookshack down near the railway station and i stopped there and ate a plate of corn bread and fried catfish i was too upset to eat a real meal too worried about my worries so i just ate the one plateful and then bought another order with a cup of chicory to take on the train with me the train came and i got on i got a seat next to the window and began to eat trying to tell myself that id really got myra told off this morning and that shed be a lot easier to get along with from now on but i knew i was kidding myself wed had showdowns like the one this morning a lot of times shed threaten what she was going to do to me and id point out that she had plenty to lose herself and then things would be a little better for a while but not really better nothing that really mattered was any better it wasnt you see because it wasnt a fair standoff between me and her she had the edge and when things came to a showdown she knew id back away sure she couldnt lose me my job without being a loser herself shed have to leave town her and her lowdown halfwit of a brother and itd probably be a danged long time before she had it as nice as she had it with me probably shed never have it as nice but she could get by shed have something but me all id ever done was sheriffin it was all i could do which was just another way of saying that all i could do was nothing and if i wasnt sheriff i wouldnt have nothing or be nothing it was a kind of hard fact to face that i was just a nothing doing nothing and that brought up something else for me to worry about the worry that maybe i could lose my job without myra saying or doing anything because id begun to suspect lately that people werent quite satisfied with me that they expected me to do a little something instead of just grinning and joking and looking the other way and me i just didnt quite know what to do about it the train took a curve and began to follow the river a ways by craning my neck could see the unpainted sheds of the town whorehouse and the two men pimps sprawled on the little wharf in front of the place those pimps had caused me a sight of trouble a powerful sight of trouble only last week theyd accidentallyonpurpose bumped me into the river and a few days before theyd accidentallyonpurpose tripped me up in the mud and the worst thing of all was the way they talked to me calling me names and poking mean fun at me and not showing me no respect at all like youd naturally expect pimps to show a sheriff even if he was shaking em down for a little money something was going to have to be done about the pimps i reckoned something plumb drastic i finished eating and went up to the mens lounge i washed my hands and face at the sink nodding to the fella that was sittin on the long leather bench he wore a classy blackandwhite checked suit highbutton shoes with spats and a white derby hat he gave me a long slow look letting his eyes linger for a moment on my pistol belt and gun he didnt smile or say anything i nodded at the paper he was reading what do you think about them bullshevicks i said you reckon theyll ever overthrow the czar he grunted still not saying anything i sat down on the bench a few feet away from him the fact was i wanted to relieve myself but i wasnt sure that i ought to go on into the toilet the door was unlocked swinging back and forth with the motion of the train and it looked like it must be empty still though here this fella was and maybe thats what he was waiting for so even if the place was empty it wouldnt be polite to go in ahead of him i waited a little while i waited squirming and fidgeting until finally i couldnt wait any longer excuse me i said were you waiting to go to the toilet he looked startled then he gave me a mean look and spoke for the first time thats some of your business of course not i said i just wanted to go to the toilet and i thought maybe you did too i mean i thought maybe someone was already in there and thats why you were waiting he glanced at the swinging door of the toilet swinging wide now so that you could see the stool he looked back at me kind of bewildered and disgusted for gods sake he said yes sir i said i dont reckon theres anyone in there do you i didnt think he was going to answer me for a minute but then he said yeah someone was in the toilet she just went in a little while ago a naked woman on a spotted pony oh i said but how come a womans using the mens toilet on account of the pony he said he had to take a leak too i cant see no one from here i said its funny i couldnt see em in a little place like that you calling me a liar he said you saying a naked woman on a spotted pony aint in there i said no of course not i wouldnt say nothing like that but im in kind of a hurry i said maybe i better go up to one of the other cars oh no you dont he said no ones calling me a liar and getting away with it im not i said i didnt mean it that way at all i just ill show you ill show you im telling the truth youre gonna sit right there until that woman and her pony comes out but i gotta pee i said i mean i really got to sir well you aint leaving here he said not until you see im telling the truth well sir i just didnt know what to do i just didnt know maybe you would have but i didnt all my life ive been just as friendly and polite as a fella could be ive always figured that if a fella was nice to everyone why theyd be nice to him but it dont always work out that way more often than not it seems like i wind up in a spot like was in now and i just dont know what to do finally when i was about to let go in my britches the conductor came through taking up tickets and i had a chance to get away i tore out of there in such a hurry that it was maybe a minute before i could get the door open to the next car and i heard a burst of laughter from the rest room behind me they were laughing at me i guess the conductor and the man in the checked suit but im kind of used to being laughed at and anyway i didnt have time to think about it right then i dashed on up into the next car and relieved myself and believe me it was a relief i was coming back down the aisle looking for a seat in that car sos i wouldnt run into the checkedsuit fella again when i saw amy mason i was pretty sure that shed seen me too but she let on that she didnt i hesitated by the seat next to her for a minute then braced myself and sat down no one knows it in pottsville because we were careful to keep it a secret but me and amy was mighty thick at onetime fact is wedve got married if her daddy hadnt had such strong objections to me so we waited just waiting for the old gentleman to die and then just a week or so before he did myra hooked me i hadnt seen amy since except to pass on the street i wanted to tell her i was sorry and try to explain things to her but she never gave me the chance whenever she saw me shed toss her head and look away or if i tried to stop her shed cross to the other side of the street howdy amy i said nice morning her mouth tightened a little but she didnt speak its sure nice running into you like this i said how far you ridin if you dont mind my asking she spoke that time just barely to clarkton ill be getting ready to leave any moment now i sure wish you was riding further i said i been wanting to talk to you amy i wanted to explain about things did you she slanted a glance at me the explanation seems obvious to me aw flaw flaw i said you know i couldnt like no one bettern you amy i never wanted to marry anyone in my life but you and thats the gods truth i swear it is id swear it on a stack of bibles honey her eyes were blinking rapidly like she was blinking back the tears i got hold of her hand and squeezed it and i saw her lips tremble ththen why nick why did yyou thats what i been wanting to tell you its a pretty long story and looky honey why dont i get off at clarkton with you and we can get us a hotel room for a couple hours and it was the wrong thing to say right at that time it was the wrong thing amy turned white she looked at me with ice in her eyes so thats what you think of me she said thats all you want all you ever wanted not to marry me oh no im not good enough to marry just to get me in bed and now please honey i said i dont you dare honey me nick corey but i wasnt thinking about that what you think i was thinking about i said it was just that itd take quite a while to explain about me and myra and i figured wed need some place to never mind just never mind she said im no longer interested in your explanations please amy just let me but ill tell you one thing mr nicholas corey and youd better pass the word along to the proper quarters if i catch your wifes brother peeking in my windows theres going to be trouble real trouble i wont put up with it like the other women in pottsville do so you tell her that and a word to the wise is sufficient i told her i hoped she didnt ever do anything about lennie for her own sake that is i got no more use for lennie than you have but myra humph she tossed her head and stood up as the train slowed down for clarkton you think im afraid of that that her well i said it might be better if you was you know how myra is when she takes out after someone by the time she gets through gossiping and telling lies why let me out please she pushed past me and went on up the aisle her head high the ostrich plume on her hat dipping and swaying as the train pulled out i tried to wave to her where she stood on the platform but she turned her head quickly with another swoop of the ostrich plume and started off up the street so that was that and i told myself that maybe it was just as well because how could we ever mean anything to each other the way things stood there was myra of course and there was going to be myra it looked like until her or me died of old age but myra wasnt the only drawback somehow id gotten real friendly with a married woman name of rose hauck one of those involvements which ive always kind of drifted into before i knew what was happening rose didnt mean a thing to me except that she was awful pretty and generous but i meant plenty to her i meant plentyplenty and shed let me know it just to show how smart rose was myra considered her her very best friend yes sir rose could put on that good an act when we were alone me and rose that is shed cuss myra until it actually made me blush but when they were together oh brother rose would suck around her honeyin and deanein her until heck wouldnt have it and myra would get so pleased and flustered that shed almost weep for joy the surest way of gettin a rise out of myra was to hint that rose was something less than perfect even lennie couldnt do it he started to onetime just kind of hinted that anyone as pretty as rose couldnt be as nice as she acted and myra slapped him clean across the room maybe i didnt tell you but this ken lacey i was going to visit was the sheriff a couple of counties down the river me and him met at a peace officers convention one year and we kind of cottoned to each other right away he wasnt only real friendly but he was plenty smart i knew it the minute i started talking to him so the first chance i got id asked him advice about this problem i had umhmmm hed said after id explained the situation and hed thought it over for a while now this privy sits on public property right its out in back of the courthouse thats right i said thats exactly right ken but it dont bother no one but you right again i said you see the courtroom is on the downstairs rear and it dont have no windows in back the windows are upon the second floor where i live ken asked me if i couldnt get the county commissioners to tear the privy down and i said no i couldnt hardly do that after all a lot of people used it and it might make em mad and you cant get em to clean it out he asked maybe sweeten it up a little with a few barrels of lime why should they i said it dont bother no one but me id probably call down trouble on myself if i ever cbmplained about it uh hah ken nodded itd seem right selfish of you but i got to do something about it ken i said it aint just the hotweather smell which is plenty bad by itself but thats only part of it ysee theres these danged big holes in the roof that show everthing thats going on inside say ive got some visitors in and they think oh my you must have a wonderful view out that way so they look out and the only view they get is of some fella doing his business ken said uhhah again kind of coughing and stroking his mouth then he went on to say that i really had a problem a real problem i can see how it might even upset a high sheriff like you nick with all the preoccupations of your great office you got to help me ken i said im getting plumb frazzled out of my wits and im going to help you ken nodded i aint never let a brother officer down yet and i aint about to begin now so he told me what to do and i did it i sneaked out to the privy late that night and i loosened a nail here and there and i shifted the floor boards around a bit the next morning i was up early all set to spring into action when the proper time came well sir the fella that used the privy most was mr js dinwiddie the bank president hed use it on the way home to lunch and on the way back from lunch and on the way home at night and on the way in in the morning well sometimes hed pass it up but never in the morning by the time hed got that far from his house his grits and gravy were working on him and he just couldnt get to the privy fast enough he went rushing in that morning the morning after id done my tampering a big fat fella in a high white collar and a spanking new broadcloth suit the floor boards went out from under him and down into the pit and he went down with them smack down into thirty years accumulation of night soil naturally i had him fished out almost as fast as he went in so he wasnt really hurt none just awful messed up but i never saw one man so mad in all my borned days he hopped up and down and sideways waving his fists and flinging his arms around and yelling blue murder i tried to toss some water over him to get the worst of the filth off but the way he was hopping around and jumping every which way i couldnt do much good id throw the water at him in one place and hed be in another and cuss you never heard anything like it and him a deacon in the church the county commissioners came running outalong with the other office holders all of em pretty jittery to see the towns most important citizen like that mr dinwiddie recognized them somehow although its hard to see how he could with all that gunk in his eyes and if he could have found a club i swear hedve clubbed em he cussed em up one side and down the other he swore hed file felony charges against them for criminal negligence he yelled that he was going to file personal damage suits against them for wilfully perpetuating a public hazard about the only person he had a kind word for was me he said that a man like me could run the county by himself and that he was going to see that all the other officials were recalled because they were just a needless expense and a menace to life and limbas well as things turned out mr dinwiddie never did get around to doing anything of the things he threatened to but that sure settled the privy problem it was gone and the pit was filled in within an hour and if you ever feel like getting a punch in the nose just tell the commissioners that there ought to be another courthouse privy well thats a sample of ken laceys advice just one sample of how good it is of course some people might say it was no good at all that it might have got mr dinwiddie killed and me in a pack of trouble they might say that the other advice ken had given me was pure meanness and meant to be hurtful rather than helpful but me well ill always think good of people as long as i possibly can or at least i wont think bad about em until i absolutely have to so i hadnt quite reached a decision about ken as yet i figured id see how he acted today what kind of advice he gave me before i made up my mind if he stacked up even halfway good id give him the benefit of the doubt but if he didnt appear even that good well id know what to do about him i always know i bought a bite of lunch from the train news butch just a few sandwiches and some pie and potato chips and peanuts and cookies and sodypop about two oclock that afternoon we got into ken laceys town the county seat where he was high sheriff it was a real big place probably four five thousand people the main street was paved along with the square around the courthouse and everywhere you looked there were wirewheeled buggies and fancy fringetopped carriages and i even seen two three autymobiles with eyegoggled dudes driving em and women in veils and linen dusters holding on for dear life i mean it was just like being in new york or one of them other big cities ive heard about all that stuff to see and the people so busy and used to excitement that they didnt pay no mind at all just for example i passed this one vacant lot where there was the goddangest dogfight going on that i ever did see kind of a battle royal between two hounds and a bulldog and a kind of spottyassed mongrel why even if there hadnt been a fight that mongrel would have been enough to make a fella stop and stare because im telling you he was really something he had this high ass in the back all spotted and speckled like a cow had farted bran on him but his front legs were so short that his nose almost rubbed on the ground and one of his eyes was blue and the othern was yaller a real bright yaller like a womans hair i stood there gawking wishing that i had someone from pottsville with me as a witness because naturally no oned ever believe id really seen a dog like that then i happened to look around and hard as it was to tear myself away i turned my back on that spectacle and went on toward the courthouse i just about had to you know unless i wanted people to think i was an old country boy because i was the only one that had stopped to look there was so much going on in that city that no one would ever give a second glance to something like that ken and a deputy named buck a fella id never met before were sitting in the sheriffs office slumped way down on their spines with their boots crossed out in front of em and their stetsons tilted over their eyes i coughed and scuffled my feet and ken looked up from under his hatbrim then he said why ill be goddanged if it aint the high sheriff of potts county and he rolled his chair over to me and held out his hand set down set down nick he said and sat down in one of the swivel chairs buck wake up and meet a friend of mine buck was already awake as it turned out so he rolled over and shook hands like ken had then ken kind of jerked his head at him and buck rolled over to the desk and got out a quart of white corn and a handful of stogies this here buck is the smartest deputy i got ken said as we all had a drink and lit up got a lot of initiative buck has dont have to tell him every goddanged thing hes supposed to do like you would some fellas buck said all hed ever done was tojust try to do his duty and ken said no sir he was smart like old nick here thats why hes sheriff of the fortyseventh largest county in this state yeah buck said i didnt know they was but fortyseven counties in the state prezackly ken said sort of frowning at him how is things in pottsville these days nick still booming well no i said i wouldnt hardly say that was booming pottsville aint exactly no real metropolis like you got here is that a fack ken said guess my recollection aint as good as it used to bejust how big is pottsville anyways well sir i said theres a road sign just outside of town that says pop so i guess thats about it twelve hundred and eighty souls twelve hundred and eighty souls huh is them souls supposed to have people to go with em well yeah i said thats what i meant it was just another way of saying twelve hundred and eighty people we all had a couple more drinks and buck tossed his stogie in a gaboon and cut himself a chaw and ken said i wasnt prezackly correct in saying that twelve hundred and eighty souls was the same as twelve hundred and eighty people aint that right buck ken said giving him a nod keerect buck said youre a thousand per cent right ken natcherly so just tell old nick why i am shorely buck said turning toward me ysee its this way nick that twelve hundred and eighty would be countin niggers them yankee lawmakers force us to count em and niggers aint got no souls right ken keerect ken said well now i dont know about that i said i wouldnt come out flat and say you fellas was wrong but i sure dont reckon i can agree with you neither i mean well just how come you say that colored folks dont have souls because they dont thats why but why dont they i said tell him buck make old nick here see the light ken said why shorely buck said ysee its this way nick niggers aint got no souls because they aint really people they aint i said why o course not most everybody knows that but if they aint people what are they niggers just niggers thats all thats why folks refer to em as niggers instead of people buck and ken nodded at me as if to say there wasnt anything more to be said on this subject i took another pull at the bottle and passed it around well looky here now i said how about this my mama died almost as soon as i was born so i was put to suck with a colored mammy wouldnt be alive today except for her sucklin me now if that dont prove no it dont ken broke in that dont prove a thing after all you could have sucked titty from a cow but you cant say that cows is people well maybe not i said but that aint the only point of similarity ive had certain relations with colored gals that i sure wouldnt have with a cow and but you could ken said you could we got a fella over in the jail right now for pleasurin a pig well ill be dogged i said because id heard of things like that but i never had known of no actual cases what kind of charges you makin against him buck said maybe they could charge him with rape ken gave him a kind of blank look and said no they might not be able to make that kind of charge stick after all he might claim he had the pigs consent and then where would we be aw said buck aw now ken ken said what you mean aw now you tryin to tell me that animals cant understand what youre sayin to em why goddang it i got me this little ol beagleterrier and i can say boy you want to go catch some rats and hell leap all over me barkin and whinin and licking my face meaning natcherly that he does want to go after rats or i can say boy you want me to take a stick to you an hell slink off in a corner with his tail between his legs meanin he dont want me to take a stick to him an well sure buck said but goddang it ken said shut up when im talking what the hells wrong with you anyways here i go an tell nick what a smart fella you are and goddang if you dont make a liar out of me right in front of him buck got kind of red in the face and said he was sure sorry he sure hadnt meant to contradict ken i can see just how it happened now that you explained it to me this fella he probably says to the pig how about a little youknowwhat piggie and the pig started squealing and twitchin her tail meanin she was ready whenever he was o course thats the way it happened ken scowled so whatd you mean by disputin me why for was you telling me he couldnt have had the pigs consent and making a goddanged idjit out of yourself in front of a visitin sheriff i tell you somethin buck ken went on i was entertainin some pretty high hopes for you almost had me convinced you was a white man with good sense instead of one of these bigmouth smartalecks but now i dont know i purely dont know bout all i can say is you shore better watch your step from now on i shore will im shore sorry ken buck said i mean it i mean every goddanged word of it ken frowned at him you ever go disputin or contradictin me again an youll be out in the street scratching horse turds with the sparrows or maybe you think you wont be huh maybe youre gonna start arguin again tellin me you wont be out fighting them birds for turds answer me you goddanged liverlipped idjit buck sort of choked for a moment and then he said of course ken was right you say the word ken an thats prezackly what id be doin doin what speak up goddang it sscratchin buck choked again scratchin horse turds with the sparrers the hot steamy kind right right right buck mumbled youre a thousand per cent right ken ii reckon there aint nothin less appetizin than a cold horse turd well all right then ken said easing up on him and turning to me nick i reckon you didnt come all the way up here to hear me an old stupid buck jibberjabberin at each other pears to me like you got plenty of troubles of your own well sir youre sure right about that ken said you purely are an thats a fact and youre wantin my advice right you aint like some smartalecks that think they already know everthing yes sir i said i sure do want your advice ken uhhah he nodded uhhah go right ahead nick well its like this i said i got this here problem thats been driving me plumb out of my mind couldnt hardly sleep nor eat its been pesterin me so much so i fretted and studied an i thought and i thought and finally i came to a decision uhhuh i decided i didnt know what to do i said uhhuh ken said well now dont you go rushin into it me an old buck here has got plenty on our minds but we always got time to consult with a friend right buck keereck youre a thousand per cent right ken like always so you just take your time an tell us about it nick ken said im always willin to lay aside the cares of my great office when a friends in trouble i hesitated wanting to tell him about myra and her halfwit brother but all of a sudden it seemed too personal i mean how can you discuss your wife with another fella even a good friend like ken was and what the heck could he do about her even if i did tell him so i reckoned id better leave her out of it and take up this other big problem i had i figured it was one problem he could handle just fine in fact now that id kind of had a chance to get reacquainted with him and id seen how he handled buck i knew he was just the man to take care of it well sir ken i said you know that whorehouse there in pottsville place over on the river bank just a whoop an a holler from town ken looked upat the ceiling and scratched his head he allowed that he couldnt say that he did know about it but he figured naturally that pottsville had a whorehouse cant very well run a town without one right buck right why if they wasnt any whores the decent ladies wouldnt be safe on the streets keereck ken nodded fellas would get all full of piss an high spirits and take right off after em well thats the way look at it i said but now i got this trouble ysee theres these six whores all nice friendly girls and just as accommodatin as you could ask for i really cant make no complaint about these girls but along with them is these two pimps one pimp for three girls i guess and those pimps are giving me trouble ken they been sassin me somethin awful now you dont mean that ken said you dont mean ttell me that these pimps has actually been sassin the high sheriff of potts county yes sir i said thats exacly what theyve been doin an the bad part about it is they sometimes done it in front of other people and a thing like that ken it just dont do a sheriff no good the word gets around that youve been told off by pimps and it dont do you no good atall do tell ken said you spoke the gods truth there nick but i reckon you dont just let em get away with it you taken some action against em well i said ive been sassin em back i cant say that its stopped em but i sure been sassin em back ken sassin em back why for did you do that well it seemed about right i said a fella sasses you why you just pay him off by sassin back ken sort of drew his mouth in and shook his head he asked buck if hed ever heard such a thing in his life and buck said he purely hadnt not in all his borned days ill tell you what you got to do nick ken said no sir ill show you what to do you just stand up and turn your back to me an ill give you an illusstrated lesson i did what he told me to he got up out of his chair and hauled off and kicked me he kicked me so hard that i went plumb out the door and halfways across the hall now you come back in here he said crocking a finger at me you just sit down there like you was sos i can ask you some questions i said i guessed id better stand up for a minute and he said all right have my own way about it you know why i kicked you nick well i said i guess you probably had a good reason you were trying to teach me something right so heres what i want to ask you say a fella kicks you in the ass like just didwhy what do you do about it i dont rightly know i said no one ever kicked me in the ass before saving my daddy god rest his soul and there wasnt much i could do about it with him but suppose someone did lets just say we got a hypocritical case where someone kicks you in the ass what would you do about it well i said i guess id kick him in the ass i guess thatd be about right turn around ken said you turn right back around again you aint learned your lesson yet well looky i said maybe if you could just explain a little more you turnin ongrateful ken frowned you tryin to give orders to a fella when hes trying to help you no no i aint trying to do that i said but well should hope not now you just turn around like i told you to i turned my back to him again there just wasnt anything else i could do it looked like he and buck both got up and they both kicked me at the same time they kicked me so hard that i went practically straight up instead of forward i came down kind of crooked on my left arm and it hurt so bad that i almost forgot who i was for a moment i picked myself up trying to rub my ass and my arm at the same time which just cant be done in case youre thinking about doing it i sat down sore as was because i was just too dizzy to stand hurt your arm ken said whereabouts im not positive i said it could be either the radius or the ulna buck gave me a sudden sharp look out from under his hatbrim sort of like id just walked into the room and he was seeing me for the first time but of course ken didnt notice anything ken had so much on his mind i reckon helping poor stupid fellas like me that he maybe didnt notice a lot of things now i guess you learned your lesson right nick he said you see the futility of not givin back no more hurt than what you get well i sure learned some kind of lesson i said so if thats the one you was teaching me i guess that was it ysee maybe the other fella can kick hardern you can or maybe hes got a tougher ass an it dont hurt him as much as it does you or say you got a situation like me an buck just demonstrated two fellas start kicking you in the ass sos you get two kicks for every one you give you get a situation like that which is just about what you got figuratively speakin why you could get the ass kicked clean off of you afore you had time to tip your hat but these pimps aint kicked me i said they just been sassin me and shovin me around a little same principle same principle prezackly right buck right ysee nick when a fella starts doin somethin bad to you the proper way to pay him back is tdo somethin twice as bad to him otherwise the best you got is maybe a standoff and you dont never get nothing settled keereck ken said so ill tell you what to do about them pimps the next time they even look like theyre goin to sass you you just kick em in the balls as hard as you can huh i said but but dont it hurt awful bad pshaw course it dont hurt not if youre wearin a good pair o boots without no holes in em thats right buck said you just be sure you aint got any toes stickin out and it wont hurt you atall i mean wouldnt it hurt the pimps i said me dont think i could stand even an easy kick in the balls why shorely shorely it would hurt em ken nodded how else you goin to make em behave if you dont hurt em bad youre actually lettin em off pretty easy nick buck said i know id sure hate to be in the same room if any pimp sassed old ken here ken wouldnt stop with just kickin em why afore they knew what was happening hed just yank out his pissoliver and shoot em right in their sassy mouths prezackly ken said id send them sassy skunks to hell without no fooling around about it so youre really being too easy on em nick a goddanged sight easier than a proud intelligent upstandin officer like ol ken ken would shoot em deadern doornails if he was in your place and you heard him say so yourself right said ken i sure wouldnt miss doing prezackly that well it looked like id got what i came for and it was getting kind of late by then so i thanked ken for his advice and stood up i was still just a little wobbly though kind of rocking on my heels and ken asked me if was sure could make it to the station all right well i guess so i said i sure hope so anyways it sure wouldnt seem right for me to ask you to walk me there after everything youve already done for me why you dont need to ask ken said you think id let you go all the way to the train alone a fella that looks as peaked as you do well i wouldnt want to trouble you none i said trouble ken said why its a positive pleasure buck you just heist yourself up out of that chair and walk nick to the depot buck nodded and heisted himself up i said i sure hoped i wasnt putting him to any bother and he said it wouldnt be no bother atall just sos you can bear with me he said know i cant be no ways as good a compny for you as a fella like ken well now im sure youll be just fine i said bet youll prove out a real interestin fella ill try buck promised yes sir ill purely try and thats a fack i had supper down near the depot buying a whopping big meal for buck along with my own then my train came and buck walked me down to the car i was riding in not that i couldnt have made it all right by myself i was feeling pretty good about then but we were getting along real fine just like i thought we might and we had a lot of things to say to each other i fell asleep almost as soon as id given my ticket to the conductor but i didnt sleep good dogtired as i was i drifted into a scary dream the nightmare that was always ahaunting me i dreamed that i was a kid again only it didnt seem like a dream i was a kid living in the old rundown plantation house with my daddy trying to keep out of his way and never being able to getting beat half to death every time he could grab me i dreamed i was ducking into a doorway thinking id got away from him and suddenly being grabbed from behind i dreamed i was putting his breakfast on the table and trying to get my arms up when he flung it in my face i dreamed i lived showing him the reading prize id won in school because i was sure that would please him and i just had to show it to someone and i dreamed lived picking myself up off the floor with my nose bloodied from the little silver cup and he was yelling at me shouting that i was through with school because id just proved i was a cheat along with everything else the fact was i guess that he just couldnt stand for me to be any good if iwas any good then icouldnt be the lowdown monster that had killed my own mother in getting born and i had to be that he had to have someone to blame i dont fault him much for it any more because ive seen a lot of people pretty much like he was people looking for easy answers to big problems people that blame the jews or the colored folks for all the bad things that happen to em people that cant realize that a heck of a lot of things are bound to go wrong in a world as big as this one and if there is any answer to why its that way and there aint always why its probably not just one answer by itself but thousands of answers but thats the way my daddy was like those people they buy some book by a fella that dont know a goddang thing more than they do and thats supposed to set em straight about everything or they buy themselves a bottle of pills or they say the whole trouble is with other folks and the only thing to do is to get rid of em or they claim we got to war with another country or or god knows what all anyway thats how my daddy was thats the way i grew up its no wonder i reckon that me and the girls always got along so well i reckon i really worked at getting along with em sort of made a trade out of it without really knowing was doing it because a fella has to have someone that likes him he just naturally has to and girls are just naturally inclined to like a man i guess when you come right down to it i was making the same mistake that those people i was talking about make because there aint no bigger problem than love nothing is truly hard to come by and i was looking for an easy answer to it well sir danged if i hadnt got back to pottsville on just about the darkest night of the year it was so dark that i could have had a firefly sitting on my nose and wouldnt have been able to see it of course the dark didnt really bother me the way i knew every nook and cranny of pottsville i could get to wherever i wanted to go if i was walking in my sleep so the dark was really an advantage to me rather than otherwise if anyone was up and around and of course there wouldnt be at that time of night they wouldnt see where i was going and wonder why i was going there i walked right down the dark middle of main street i turned south at the end of it and headed toward the river there was just a speck of light down that way sort of a little blob bulging up out of the darkness i figured it came from the whorehouse or rather from the little pier behind it those two pimps would be sitting out there i knew taking the night air and drinking themselves stiff theyd be feeling their oats for sure by the time i got there all sassy and nasty and primed for meanness toward a fella thatd always been nice to them i struck a match took a quick look at my watch i began to walk faster the steamer ruby clark was about due and i had to be on hand when it rounded the bend thered been a pretty hard rain the week before low river country theres always a lot of rain the wet was all dried up by now because we get a lot of hot sunshine too but the road had gotten rutted here and there and hurrying like was i brought my foot down where i shouldnt have i stumbled almost taking a header before i could right myself paused sort of getting my breath back and then i whirled around straining my eyes and ears scared stiff for a minute because id heard something the same kind of clodkicking sound id made only not so loud i held my breath telling myself that there couldnt be anyone following me knowing that even if there was someone back there i was still protected by the darkness i stood stock still for two three minutes then i heard the sound again and i recognized it for what it was and i almost laughed out loud with relief it was just some of those goddanged big nightbeetles we have down here they go swooping around looking for each other and then they come together in midair and go plunking down on the ground they can make a heck of a racket on a stilly night if youre maybe just a little uneasy like was they can give you a bad start it was two or three minutes later when i got to the whorehouse i tippytoed along the walk which ran down the side of the place and went around to the rear the two pimps were there right where i thought theyd be they were sitting down with their backs to the mooring posts a dimmed lantern and a jug of whiskey between them they looked at me owleyed as i came in out of the darkness and then the one named curly a kind of dudeish fella with kinky scalptight hair shook a finger at me now nick you know youre not supposed to come over here but once a week just once a week and only long enough to pick up your graft and get thats right said the one named moose fact is were bein mighty generous to let you come here at all we got a reputation to protect here and it sure doesnt help none to have a fella like you dropping around well now i said thats not a very nice thing to say oh well theres nothing personal in it curly said its just one of those unpleasant facts of life youre a crook and it doesnt look good to have crooks around i asked him how come he thought i was a crook and he said what else could i call myself you take graft dont you youre getting a dollar out of every five that comes in here but i have to i said i mean its kind of a civic duty if i didnt keep you people stripped down a little youd get too powerful first thing i know youd be running the county instead of me moose sneered and wobbled to his feet you twobit clown he said will you just get the hell out of here will you or am i gonna have to make you well nowisaid well now idont know about that figure thats a pretty mean way to talk to a fella thats always been nice to you are you gonna get or not he took a step toward me youd better nick curly nodded pushing himself up you kind of make us sick to our stomachs you know it may not be your fault but the air turns bad every time you show up around the bend i could see the lights of the ruby clark and i could hear the whip of the paddles as it fought for the turn it was that time it would be that time any second now and i unholstered my gun and took aim wha moose stopped dead in his tracks his mouth gaping open curly said oh now nick forcing a smile to his face but it was the sickest smile ill ever see thats one thing people always know i guess they know when theyre going to die and moose and curly knew that they were going to good night ye merry gentlemen i said hail and farewell the ruby clark whistled by the time the echo died moose and curly were in the river each with a bullet spang between his eyes i waited on the little pier for a minute until the ruby had gone by i always say theres nothing prettier than a steamboat at night then i went around on the catwalk and headed for home the courthouse was dark naturally when i got there i took off my boots and crept up the stairs and got in bed without waking anyone i fell asleep right away a couple of hours later waked up with myra shaking me nick nick will you please get up for pitys sake huh what i said whats going on myra but i heard it then the pounding on the downstairs door a fella wouldve had to be deaf not to hear it well ill be dogged i said now who in tarnation can that be well go and see darn it get down there before they wake poor lennie up i studied about it for a moment staying right where i was while myra went on nagging at me then i said wasnt sure whether i should go downstairs or not because why for would any honest person be pounding on doors at this time of night it might be robbers myra pointed out wouldnt be a bit surprised if thats who it was i hear they do their robbin late at night when decent folks is in bed you fool you stupid spineless cowardly slob are you the sheriff of this county or not myra yelled well i said i guess you could say that and isnt it the sheriffs job to take care of criminals isnt it answer me you you well i guess you could say that too i said i aint thought much about it but it sounds reasonable you you get down there myra spluttered doggone you you get right down there this minute or ill ill but i aint got no clothes on i said nothin but my longhandled drawers wouldnt hardly seem right goin to the door without no clothes on myras voice dropped so low that i could hardly hear it but her eyes flashed fire nick she said this is the last time im going to tell you you go to the door right this minute or youll wish you had youll really wish you had the pounding was getting a lot louder by now and someone was shouting my name someone that sounded an awful lot like ken lacey so what with myra carrying on like she was i figured maybe id better go to the door i swung my legs over the side of the bed and pulled on my boots i studied em a minute wetting my finger with spit and rubbing down a little scuffed place i yawned and stretched and scratched under my armpits myra let out a groan she snatched up my britches and flung em at me so that the legs wrapped around my neck like a scarf you aint mad about somethin are you honey i said getting the britches untangled and starting to draw em on i sure hope i aint annoyed you no way she didnt say anything just started to swell up like she was about to explode i got a tradelast for you i said a fella was saying to me the other day he said nick you got the prettiest mother in town so i asked him who he meant naturally because my mamas been dead for years and he said why that lady you call myra you mean to tell me she aint your mother thats just what he said honey so now you got to tell me something nice that someone said about me she still didnt say anything she just leaped at me sort of meowing like a cat her hands clawed to scratch my eyes out she didnt do it because id been kind of expecting something like that all the time was talking to her i was easing back toward the door so instead of landing on me she came up against the wall clawing the heck out of it afore she could come to her senses meantime i went on downstairs and opened the door ken lacey busted in he was wildeyed heaving for breath he grabbed me by the shoulders and started shaking me have you done it yet he said goddang it have you already gone an done it whwhat i tried to shake free of him have i gone an done what you know what goddang it what i told you to do now you answer me you consarned idjit or ill beat it out of you well sir it looked to me like he was pretty excited about something might get himself in such a tizzy that hed keel over with the frantics so i just pushed him into my office and made him set down at my desk and i struck a lamp and made him take a big drink of whiskey and then when he seemed to be calmed down a little i asked him just what it was all about what am i supposed to have done ken the way youre actin youd think id killed someone then you didnt he said his eyes hard on my face you didnt kill anyone kill anyone i said why what a riddicerlous question why for would i kill anyone and you didnt you didnt kill them two pimps that was sassing you ken i said how many times have i got to tell you why for would i kill anyone he heaved a big sigh and relaxed for the first time then after another long drink he slammed down the jug and began to cuss his deputy buck goddang just wait until i get hold of him just you wait ill kick his mangy ass shard hell have to take off his boots to comb his hair why whatd he do i said whats old buck gone an done he frazzled me thats what got me sogoddanged excited an worried that i was plumb out of my mind ken said cussing buck up one side and down the other well its my own goddanged fault i reckon had the proof right before me that he was a lowdown maniac but broadminded like i am i went and closed my eyes to it how come i said what you mean you had the proof ken i mean i caught him reading a book thats what yes sir i caught him redhanded oh he claimed he was only lookin at the pitchers but i knew he was lyin well ill be dogged i said i will be doubledogged but whats buck got to do with you being down here so ken told me how it had happened it seemed like after he left me buck went back to the office and began to fret out loud wonderin whether id really be crazy enough to kill those pimps which would leave ken in a peck of trouble the way buck saw it in his outloud worryin ken had told me should kill emand if went ahead and did it hed be just as guilty as i was he kept on fretting about it buck did saying i just might kill the pimps because id always taken kens advice in the past no matter how nutty it was and then when he saw how upset ken was getting he said that the law probably wouldnt be too hard on him probaly wouldnt be hard on him atall like they would me but maybe let him off with thirty forty years the upshot of it was that ken finally tore out of his office and caught the red ball freight to pottsville he hadnt had too nice a trip because the caboose where he was sittin had had an awful flat wheel he said he was probably a lot sorer in the behind that i was from getting kicked and all he wanted to do now was go to bed i just had moren one poor body can stand in a day he yawned i reckon you can put me up all right cant you i said that iwas right shamed but no icouldnt we just didnt have no place where an extra fella could be bedded down goddang it he scowled all right ill go to the hotel then i allowed that that might be kind of hard to do seeing that pottsville didnt have a hotel if it was daytime you could bed at the widder shoups place thats what the travellin salesmen do but she sure wouldnt let you in at this time of night well where the goddanged hell am i gonna sleep then he said i sure as heck aint sittin up all night well lets see now i said danged if i can only think of but one place ken a place that could bed you down but im afraid you wouldnt get much sleep there you just lead me to it ill do the sleepin not at the whorehouse you wouldnt i said ysee the girls aint had much business lately and theyd all be mighty raunchy probly be makin demands on you all night long uhhah ken said well now i reckon a fella can put up with anything if he has to nice young gals are they no they aint i said most of em are fairly young maybe seventeen eighteen but they got this one old gal thats every bit of twentyone and she just wont leave a fella alone she purely wont ken and it wouldnt be fair not to warn you a streak of spit was trickling down his chin he brushed it away and stood up a kind of glassy look in his eyes i better be goin he said i better be goin right this minute ill put you on the right road i said but theres something you got to know first about them two pimps dont you worry none ill take care of em you wont have to i said because they wont be there theyll be off somewheres drunk by now and they wont wake up until noon what the hell then ken took a fidgety step toward the door if the girls think they aint there but they dont think that the pimps have got em kidded that theyre watching the place day and night which naturally makes it hard for the girls to relax and have fun like they want to so uhhuh yeah yeah ken said go on goddang it so heres what you do as soon as you go in you tell the girls that youve taken care of the pimps real good and that they wont be nosing around atall you tell em that and everything will be just fine an dandy he said hed tell em what i said to then he went out the door and across the yard moving so fast that i could hardly keep up with him we crossed through the edge of town and i lined him upon the river road he went on by himself then without so much as a nod and then i reckon he remembered his manners because he turned around and came back nick he said im obliged to you maybe i aint been too nice to you in the past but i aint forgettin what youve done here tonight aw pshaw i said comes to that ken i aint forgetting all the things youve done neither well anyways im obliged to you he said why it was a positive pleasure doin it i said a positive pleasure and thats a fact ken showed up at breakfast time the next morning looking mighty peaked and pale and wrungout but all shookup as he was he managed to toss a lot of flattery at myra and to say a few kind words to lennie so she treated him pretty nice not real nice because she knew hed spent the night in the whorehouse which was the only place he could have spent it but as nice as a lady could treat a gentleman under the circumstances she kept urging him to have something to eat and ken kept turning it down with thanks and saying that he hardly ever et anything in the morning but just a little coffee which was all he wanted now i got to watch my weight maam he said i aint got a naturally handsome figure like you and your finelooking brother lennie giggled and spit at him feelin pleased you know myra blushed and said he was just a great big flatterer me me flatter a woman ken said why i never heard the like oh you you know i dont have a really good figure well maybe not but thats because you aint fully developed yet ken said youre still a young girl teehee myra giggled you awful thing you you just wait until you fill out a little ken said wait until youre as old as your brother well sir lies like that can take a lot out of a man even when hes feeling good which ken sure wasnt he was just carrying on out of habit and from the looks of him he was just about to the end of his rope fortunately it seemed to occur to myra about then that she was being a little too friendly with ken and that she was letting him get pretty gay with her so she froze up all of a sudden and started clearing away the dishes and ken said his thankyous and goodbyes and i got him downstairs to my office i handed him a quart bottle of white whiskey he took a long long drink gagged gulped and leaned back in his chair sweat popped out on his forehead he shuddered all over and his face turned a few shades whiter for a minute thought he was going to be one sick man all that lying and flattering to myra had been just too much for him then all at once the color flooded back into his face and he stopped sweating and shaking and he drew a long deep sigh goddang he said softly i shore needed that fella cant ride a horse with one stirrup i said have another one ken well goddang it he said goddang it nick i dont care if i do he had a couple of more drinks which brought the bottle down to about the halfway level then he said he guessed hed better slow down a little bit and i told him to just take his time he couldnt get a train back home for a couple of hours yet we sat there for a minute or two not saying much of anything he looked at me and looked away again and a kind of shysly look came over his face mighty handsome young fella your brotherinlaw he said yes sir mighty handsome and hes an idjit i said anyways he sure aint quite right in the head ken nodded and said yeah hed noticed that but maybe that might not make too much difference to a certain kind of woman you know nick say a woman that was a lot older than he was a woman that was pretty ugly and pretty apt to stay that way well i just dont know about that i said i wouldnt say you were wrong but i sure wouldnt say you was right either well maybe thats because you aint real bright ken said why ill bet you theres a woman right in this town that would really preefer lennie to a fella like you i aint saying that you aint a plenty goodbookin fella yourself but probably you aint got as long a dingledangle as he has they tell me them idjits are hung like a studhoss and anyways well now i dont know about that i said i aint never had any complaints in that department yet shut up when im talkin ken said shut up and maybe youll learn somethin i was about to say that everything else being equal which i doubt like hell in your case because all of them idjits have got dongs you could skip rope with but but irregardless of that a woman still might rather have a dummy pour it on her than a normal fella because she dont have to put on for him know what i mean she can boss him around she can be just as haggy as all hell and twice as mean and she can still get what she needs i scratched my head and said well maybe so but i still thought he was wrong about lennie i know for a fact that there aint no woman in this town thats got any use for him they pretend that they do to keep on the good side of myra but i know they all hate his guts all of em all of em except myra of course his sister ken snorted and ran his hand over his mouth then he kind of got a grip on himself and his talk slowed down a little but he still couldnt get off the subject aint much family resemblance between lennie and your wife hardly know they was brother an sister unless someone told you thats right i guess i said cant say that i ever thought much about it but i had thought about it yessir id thought plenty about it was you acquainted with lennie before you married know that you was goin to have a idjit for a brotherinlaw well no i didnt i said i didnt even know that myra had a brother until afterwards came as quite a surprise for me uhhah ken snorted well dont be surprised if you get another surprise some time nick no sir dont you be surprised at all what i said how do you mean ken he shook his head not answering me and broke out laughing i laughed right along with him because it was a pretty good joke you see i was a joke and maybe i couldnt do anything about it right now but i figured i would some day ken took a couple more long drinks i stood up and said maybe wed better be going got quite a little walk to the station and i want you to meet a few fellas be a big treat for em to meet a bigcity sheriff like you why now i bet it would be that ken said staggering to his feet probly aint every day they get to meet a real man in a pisspot of a town like this tell em how you took care of them two pimps i said theyll be right impressed hearin how you took on two pimps all by yourself and gave em whatfor he blinked at me owlishly he said what pimps what the goddanged hell was talking about anyway i said the pimps id warned him about last night the two that were bound to try to give him some trouble huh he said what did you tell me somethin like that you mean you let em get away with it i said ken lacey took dirt from a couple of lowdown pimps hah what he rubbed his hand over his eyes who says i took dirt from pimps i knew you didnt i said giving him a slap on the back not ken lacey the bravest smartest peace officer in the state well said ken uh you shorely spoke a mouthful there nick you shorely did and thats a fact any other man i wouldnt have let him go over there last night but i knew you could stand up to those pimps if they come at you with guns and knives i knew youd make em wish theyd never been born ken put a stern look on his face like that fella william s hart does in the movies he squared his shoulders and straightened up or as much as he could straighten with the whiskey wobbling his legs whatd you do to em ken i said how did you settle their hash anyways i uh i took care of em thats what he gave me a lopsided wink you know i hic took care of em good you took care of em for good ken goddanged right i did thems two pimps that wont never bother a white man no more he started looking around for the whiskey bottle i pointed out that he was holding onto it so he had himself a couple more drinks and then he held the bottle up to the light why goddang danged if i aint drunk almost a whole quart of whiskey what the heck i said it dont hardly show on you none and the funny part of it was that it suddenly didnt show much id seen him drink before and i knew how whiskey acted on him a fairly small amount of booze say a pint or so and hed get drunk as a skunk hed show it i mean but when he went over that certain amount and up to a point of course hed seem to sober up hed stop staggering stop slurring his words stop playing the fool in general inside hed still be dead drunk but youd never know it by looking at him he finished the rest of the whiskey and we headed for the railroad station i introduced him to everyone we met which was a big part of the population and he stuck out his chest and told everyone how hed taken care of the two pimps or rather he just said that he had taken care of em never mind how hed say never you mind how and then hed wink and nod and everybody would be pretty impressed we stopped to talk to so many people that it was only a couple of minutes before train time when we got to the station i shook hands with him and then before realized i was doing it i laughed out loud he gave me a suspicious look asked me what i was laughing about nothing much i said i was just thinkin how funny it was you rushing down here last night thinkin i might kill those pimps yeah he grinned sourly that is funny imagine a fella like you killing anyone you cant imagine me doing it can you ken you just cant can you he said he sure couldnt and that was a fact if id stopped to think instead of letting that goddanged buck get me all riled up but it would be easy to imagine you doing that killing wouldnt it ken killing wouldnt bother you a bit what he said what do you mean i in fact folks wouldnt have to do any imagining would they youve as good as admitted it to dozens of people he blinked at me then the wild sweat broke out on his face again and a streak of spit oozed from the corner of his mouth and there was fear in his eyes it had soaked in on him at last the spot he was in soaked clear through a quart of booze until it hit him where he lived and rubbed the place raw why why goddang you he said i was just makin talk you know danged well i was i never even seen those pimps last night no sir i bet you didnt igrinned at him id bet a million dollars you didnt yyou he gulped you rnmean you did kkill i mean i know youre a truthful man i said if you said you didnt see those pimps i know you didnt see em but other folks might think somethin else mightnt they ken if those pimps bodies was to crop up some place everybodyd think that you killed them couldnt hardly think nothin else under the circumstances he cussed and made a grab at me i stayed where i was grinning at him and he slowly let his hands drop to his side thats right ken i nodded thats right there aint a thing you can do but hope just hope that if someone did kill those pimps that no one ever finds their bodies the train was coming in i waited until it came to a stop and then since ken seemed too dazed to do it by himself i helped him on one other thing ken i said and he turned on the step to look at me id be real nice to buck if i was you i got kind of a funny idea that he dont like you very much as it is so i sure wouldnt do no more talkin about makin him peck horse turds with the sparrers he turned back around again and went on up the steps i started back through town id been thinking it was about time to do some political campaignin since i had a pretty tough opponent coming up for a change but i figured thered been enough going on for one morning what with kens big talk and anyways i just didnt have a campaign plan this time always before id let the word get around that i was against this and that things like cockfighting and gambling and whiskey and soon so my opposition would figure theyd better come out against em too only twice as strong as i did and i went right ahead and let em me almost anyone can make a better speech than i can and anyone can come out stronger against or for something because me ive got no very strong convictions about anything not any more i havent well anyway by the time it got ready to vote it looked like a fella wouldnt be able to have no fun at all any more if my opponents were elected about all a fella would be able to do without getting arrested was to drink sodypop and maybe kiss his wife and no one liked the idea very much the wives included so all and all i began to look pretty good to folks it was a case of nothing looking better than something because all anyone had to do was listen to me and look at me a while to know that i wasnt against anything very much except having my pay stopped and that i wouldnt have enough gumption to do anything even jf i did want to id just let things go along like they always had because there wasnt much point in trying to change em and when the votes were counted i was still sheriff im not saying that there werent a lot of folks who really liked me there was a lot of em folks that id been kids with and who knew me as a nice friendly fella who was always ready to do a favor if it didnt put him out of pocket too much or offend someone else but it seemed to me that i didnt have as many friends as id used to even the very folks id favored them most of all it seemed like werent as friendly as they had been they seemed to kind of hold it against me because i hadnt cracked down on em and i didnt know quite what to do about it since id never really got the habit of doing anything and i didnt know how i was going to get myself elected again but i knew i was going to have to do something i was going to have to do something or think of something entirely different from the stuff id come up with in the past or id be out of a job when fall came i rounded the corner from the depot and turned into main street then i started to duck back off of it because there was a heck of a racket a couple of blocks down the street a lot of fellas jamming the sidewalk it looked like a fight of some kind was going on which meant that id better get out of sight before had to arrest someone besides maybe getting hurt myself i started to dart back around the corner then somehow i caught myself and i went on down the street to where the ruckus was it wasnt really a fight like id been afraid of just tom hauck beating a colored fella named unclejohn it seemed like tom had been coming out of the hardware store with a box of shotgun shells when uncle john had bumped into him or vice versa anyway hed dropped the shells and some of em had spilled off into the street mud which was why hed grabbed hold of the colored fella and started beating him i pushed myself between them and told tom to stop i felt kind of funny about it because tom was the husband of rose hauck the gal who was so generous with me i guess a fella always feels kind of funny in a situation like thatguilty i meanlike he ought to give the fella any break that he can aside from that tom was a lot bigger than i was mean fellas are always bigger than i am and he was about halfloaded with booze about all tom ever did was boozeup and go hunting his wife rose did most of the farm work when she wasnt laid up from tom beating her tom would set her chores for her before he went off on a hunting trip they were usually more than a strong man and a boy could do but if rose didnt have em done by the time he got back she was in for a beating now he pushed his big red face into mine and asked me what the hell i meant by interferin with him you tellin me a white man cant whip a nigger if he feels like it you sayin theres some law against it well i said i dont know about that i aint saying there is and i aint saying there aint but theres a law against disturbin the peace and thats what youre doin and what about him disturbin my peace how about that huh a goddanged stinkin nigger almost knocking me off the sidewalk and making me spill my shotgun shells well now theres some division of opinion about that i said it looks like maybe you might have bumped into him instead of him bumpin you tom yelled that what was the god danged difference anyways it was a niggers place to look out for a white man and keep out of his way just ask anyone he said looking around at the crowd aint that right fellas someone said thats right tom and there was a little murmur of agreement a kind of halfhearted murmur because no one liked tom very much even if they did have to side with him against a colored fella it looked to me like theyd really rather be on my side all i had to do was change the issue a little make it between me and him instead of between a white man and a black where did you get that board you been beating him with i said it looks to me like it came out of the sidewalk so what if it did tom said you expect me to use my fists on a nigger now never you mind about that i said the point is you got no right to beat him with city property suppose you broke that board then what why these good taxpayers here has got to pay for a new one suppose someone comes along and steps in that empty place in the sidewalk these taxpayers has got to pay the damages tom scowled and cussed and glared around at the crowd there wasnt hardly a friendly face among em so he cussed some more and said all right then to hell with the board hed just get the harness straps from his horse and beat uncle john with them uhhuh i said i dont reckon you will not right now anyways whos gonna stop me what the hell you mean i wont do it right now i mean uncle john aint here right now i said kind of pears like he got tired of waitin for you toms mouth gaped open and he looked around wildly everybody began to laugh because naturally uncle john had skipped out and the expression on toms face was a sight to see he cussed me he cussed the crowd then he jumped on his mare and rode away heeling her so hard in the flanks that she screamed with pain i stomped the sidewalk board back in place robert leejefferson the owner of the hardware store caught my eye and motioned me to come inside i went in and followed him back to his little office robert lee jefferson was the county attorney as well as the store owner there not being enough work in the job to interfere with his business i sat down and he told me id handled the situation with tom hauck real well and that tom would surely have a lot of respect for law and order from now on in fact i imagine the whole town will dont you nick all those noble taxpayers who observed the manner in which you maintained the peace i guess you mean just the opposite of what youre sayin i said just what do you think i should have done robert lee why you should have arrested hauck of course thrown him in jail id have been delighted to prosecute him but what could i arrest him for i sure couldnt do it for whippin a colored fella why not aw now isaid aw now robert lee you dont really mean that do you he looked down at his desk hesitating a moment well maybe not but there are other charges you could have got him on being drunk in a public place for example or hunting out of season or wifebeating or uh but robert lee i said everyone does those things a lot of people anyways do they i havent noticed any of them being brought into court for prosecution but i cant arrest everyone pretty near everyone were talking specifically about one man one mean nogood drunken shiftless lawbreaking wifebeater why didnt you make an example out of him for other men of his type i said i just didnt rightly know since he put it that way ijust didnt know but id do some studyin about it and if i came up with an answer id tell him i already know the answer he said curtly everyone with a lick of sense knows it youre a coward now i dont know as id say that i said i aint sayin that i aint a coward but if youre afraid to do your job by yourself why dont you hire a deputy the county provides funds for one why i already got a deputy i said my wife i deputized myra sos she could do my office for me robert lee jefferson stared at me grimly nick he said do you honestly think you can go on doing as youve been doing absolutely nothing in other words do you really think you can go on taking graft and robbing the county and doing nothing to earn your money why i dont see how i can do much else if i want to stay in office i said i got all kinds of expenses that fellas like you and the county judge and so on aint bothered with me im out in the open all the time brushin up with hundreds of people whereas you folks only see one once in a while anyone thats put in trouble why im the fella that puts em there they dont see you until afterward anyone that needs to borry a dollar they come to me all the church ladies come to me for donations and nick i throw a big barbecue every night the last month before election come one come all i got to buy presents when folks has a new baby and i got to nick nick listen to me robert lee held up his hand you dont have to do all those things people have no right to expect them of you maybe they dont have a right i said ill go along with that but what they got a right to expect and what they do expect aint exactly the same thing just do your job nick do it well show people that youre honest and courageous and hardworking and you wont have to do anything else i shook my head and said i couldnt i just plain cant robert lee and thats a fact no he leaned back in his chair and just why cant you pray tell for a couple of reasons i said for one thing i aint real brave and hardworkin and honest for another the voters dont want me to be and just how do you figure that they elected me didnt they they keep electing me thats pretty specious thinking robert lee said perhaps they trusted and liked you theyve been giving you every chance to make good and youd better do it very quickly nick he leaned forward and tapped me on the knee im telling you that as a friend if you dont straighten up and do your job youll be out of it come fall you really think sam gaddis is that strong robert lee hes that strong nick every bit that strong sam is just about everything youre not if youll excuse my saying so and the voters like him youd better get busy or hell beat the pants off of you uh hah i said umm humm would you mind if i used your phone robert lee he said go ahead and i called myra i told her i was going out to rose haucks place to help her do her chores so that tom wouldnt beat her up when he got home myra said that was just fine her and rose being such good friends or so she thought and she told me to stay as long as i liked i hung up the phone robert lee jefferson was staring at me like i was plumb out of my mind nick he said waving his hands havent you heard a word i said is that your idea of doing your job to go out and chore around the hauck farm but rose needs help i said you surely aint sayin its wrong to help her of course im not its nice of you to want to help her thats one of your good qualities the way youre always willing to help people but but he sighed and shook his head wearily aaah nick dont you understand it isnt your job doing things like that it isnt what youre paid for and youve got to start doing what youre paid for or sam gaddis will beat you beat me i said oh you mean the election of course i mean the election what the hell else have we been talking about well ive been thinking about that i said ive been doing a lot of thinking about it robert lee and think ive thought of an angle that will beat ol sam an angle you mean some kind of trick well you might call it that i said bbut but he looked like he was about to explode again but why nick why not simply do your job well i thought a lot about that too i said yes sir i really did a lot of thinking almost had myself convinced for a while that i actually should get out and start arrestin people and start actin like a sheriff in general but then i did some more thinkin and i knew i hadnt ought to do nothing of the kind but nick because people dont want me to do that i said maybe they think they do but they dont all they want is for me to give em some excuse to vote for me again youre wrong nick robert lee wagged his head youre dead wrong youve got away with tricks in the past but they wont work this time not against a truly fine man like sam gaddis i said well wed just have to wait and see and he gave me a sharp look have you got some idea that sam gaddis isnt a good man is that it nick can tell you right now that if you have some idea of digging up some dirt on him i got no such idea i said i couldnt dig up no dirt on sam if wanted to because there just aint none to dig good im glad you realize that no sir i said i know sams as good a man as they come thats why i cant understand how all these stories about him got started well thats fine i what he stared at me startled what stories you mean you aint heard i said of course i havent now just what are these stories i made as if i was about to tell him and then i stopped and shook my head i aint gonna repeat em i said if you aint heard em you sure aint gonna hear em from me no siree he took a quick look around and leaned forward voice lowered tell me nick i swear i wont repeat a word you say i cant ijust cant robert lee it wouldnt be fair and theres just no reason to what difference does it make if people are going around spreading a lot of dirty stories about sam as long as we know theyre not true now nick i tell you what i am gonna do i said when sam gets up to make his first campaign speech come sundayweek im gonna be right up on the platform with him he gets my moral support a thousand per cent and im gonna say so because i know there aint a word of truth in all them dirty filthy stories that are going around about him robert lee jefferson followed me to the front door trying to get me to say what the stories were i kept refusing naturally the main reason being that id never heard no one say a bad word about sam gaddis in my life no sir said as i went out the door i just aint gonna repeat em you want to hear any dirt about sam youll have to get it from someone else who he said eagerly who should i ask nick anyone just about anyone i said theres always folks that are willin to dirty a good man even when they aint got a thing to go on i got my horse and buggy out of the livery stable and drove out of town but i was quite a little while in getting out to see rose hauck i had a little business with tom to take care of first business that was kind of a pleasure if you know what i mean and it was about an hours drive to his favourite hunting place he was there maybe a hundred feet back from the road and he was doing his usual kind of hunting sitting with his back against one tree and his gun against another and slugging down whiskey from a jug as fast as he could swallow he looked around as i came up on him and asked me what the hell i was doing there then his eyes widened and he tried to get to his feet and he asked me what the hell i thought i was doing with his gun first things first i said one thing im doin out this way is to pay a visit to your wife im gonna be gettin in bed with her pretty soon now and shes gonna be givin me what you were too goddanged lowdown mean to ever get from her reason i know shes gonna give it to me is because shes been doin it for a long time just about every time you were out here hogdrunk too stupid to appreciate what a good thing you had he was cussing before i had the last words out pushing himself up against the treetrunk and at last wobbling to his feet he took a staggering step toward me and i brought the gun up against my shoulder the second thing im gonna do i said is somethin i should have done long ago im gonna give you both barrels of this shotgun right in your stupid stinking guts and i did it it didnt quite kill him although he was dying fast wanted him to stay alive for a few seconds so that he could appreciate the three or four good swift kicks i gave him you might think it wasnt real nice to kick a dying man and maybe it wasnt but id been wanting to kick him for a long time and it just never had seemed safe until now i left him after a while getting weaker and weaker squirming around in a pool of his own blood and guts and then ceasing to squirm then i drove on out to the hauck farm the house was pretty much like most farm houses you see in this part of the country except it was a little bigger a pitchedroofed shack with one long room across the front and a threeroom leanto on the back it was made of pine naturally and it wasnt painted because with the hot sun and high humidity you cant hardly keep paint on a house down here at least thats what folks say and even if it aint so its a danged good excuse for being shiftless the farm land a whole quarter section of it was as good as youd find it was that rich black silt you see in the river lowlands so fine and sweet you could almost eat it and so deep that you couldnt wear it out like so much of the shallow soil in the south is worn out you might say that land was a lot like rose naturally good deep down good but tom had done his best to ruin it like he had her he hadnt done it because theyd had too much good stuff to begin with but both the land and her were a long sight from being what theyd been before he got ahold of em she was hoeing sweet potatoes when i arrived and she came running up from the field panting for breath and pushing the sweatsoaked hair from her eyes one heck of a pretty woman she was tom hadnt been able to change that and she had one heck of a figure tom hadnt been able to ruin her body either although hed sure tried hard what he had changed was the way she thought mean and tough and the way she talked when she didnt have to be on guard she talked practically as bad as he did goddam honey she said giving me a quick little hug and stepping back again dammit sweetheart i wont be able to stop today that sonofabitch of a tom gave me too much work to do i said aw come on you can spare a few minutes ill help you afterwards she said goddamit it wouldnt do any good if she had six men to help her she still couldnt get through you know i want you honey she said im crazy about you baby and you know i am if it wasnt for all this goddam work well i dont know i said deciding to tease her along a while i guess i aint real sure that you do want me seems like as if you did you could give me a minute or two but it wouldnt be a minute or two darling you know it wouldnt why not i said it dont take no longer than that to kiss you a little and give you a few squeezes and pats an ddont she moaned shakily dont say those things i why id probably even have time to hold you on my lap i said with your dress sort of pulled up sos i could feel how warm and soft you are where you sit down and i could maybe sort of pull your dress down from the top kind of slide it down from your shoulders so that could see those nice things underneath and stop it nick i you know how i get aand i cant i just cant honey why i wouldnt even expect you to take your dress all the way off i said i mean it aint really necessary when you get right down to cases with a tightpacked little gal like you a fella dont have to do hardly nothing at all except she cut me off groaning like a spurred horse she said goddam i dont give a damn if the sonofabitch beats my tail off then she grabbed me by the hand and began to run dragging me toward the house we got inside and she slammed the door and locked it she stood leaning into me for a moment twisting and writhing against me then she flung herself down on the bed rolled over on her back and hitched her dress up what the hell you waiting for honey she said come on darling goddam it what you layin down for i said i thought i was just goin to hold you on my lap pplease nick she moaned again weve ggot no time to waste so please honey well all right i said but i got some news for you sort of a little secret i think maybe i ought to tell it to you before crap on the secret she made a wild grab for me i dont want any goddam secrets what i want is but its about poor old tom somethin done went and happened to him who gives a damn its just too goddam bad that the sonofabitch isnt dead now i told her that that was the secret tom was dead looks like he got his guts blowed clear through his backbone i said looks like he stumbled over his gun when he was drunk and blowed himself to glory she looked at me her eyes widening mouth working as she tried to speak finally the words came out in a shaky whisper youre sure nick you really killed him lets just say he had himself an accident i said lets just say that fate dealt him a crool blow but he is dead youre sure about that i told her i was sure all right plenty sure if he aint hes the first live man ive ever seen who could hold still while he was getting kicked in the balls roses eyes lit up like id given her a christmas purty then she threw herself back on the pillows rocking with laughter holy jesus so the stinking sonofabitch is really dead im through with the dirty bastard at last well sir it sure looks that way i said goddam him i just wish id have been there to kick him myself the bastardly son ofabitchin whoremonger she said adding on a few more choice names you know what id have liked to do to that dirty bastard nick id have liked to take me a red hot poker and jabbed it right up the filthy sonofabitchs uh whats the matter honey nothin i said i mean maybe we ought to show a little more respect for ol tom him bein dead and all it just dont seem quite fittin to lowrate the dead with a lot of dirty names you mean i shouldnt call the sonofabitch a sonofabitch well now it dont sound real good does it i said it dont sound nice atall rose said it sounded just fine to her but if it bothered me shed try to watch her tongue that sonofabitch caused enough trouble while he was alive without fouling us up afterward anyway id do anything to please you sweetheart anything you want darling then why aint you doin it i said how come you still got your dress on goddam she said looking down at herself rip the goddam thing off will you honey i started ripping and she started helping me with my clothes and things were getting right to the most interesting point when the phone rang rose cussed and said to let the goddam thing go but said it might be myra which it was so she stalked out in the kitchen and answered it she talked quite a while or rather she listened to myra talking about all rose got to say was a lot of wellideclares and youdontsaysos and so on finally she said why of course ill tell him myra dear just as soon as he comes in from the field and you and lennie take care of your sweet selves until see you again rose slammed up the phone and came back to where i was i asked her what myra wanted and she said it could wait goddam it there were more important things to do right now like what i said like this she said this so we didnt do no talking for quite a while not until afterwards when we lay side by side holding hands and breathing in long deep breaths then finally she turned around facing me her head propped up on her elbow and told me about myras call looks like a day for good news honey first that sonofabitch tom gets killed and now it looks like youre a cinch to get reelected yeah i said hows that baby sam gaddis the whole towns talking about him why do you know what he did nick i aint got the slightest idea i said i always thought sam was a mighty good man he raped a little twoyearold nigger baby thats what mmmm male or female i said female i guess i ha ha nick you awful thing you she laughed and gave me a squeezebut isnt it terrible honey to think of a grown man screwing a poor innocent little baby and thats only one thing he did do tell i said like which rose said that sam had also cheated a poor widow woman out of her lifes savings and then hed beat his own father to death with a stick of cordwood to keep him from talking about it and thats only the beginning nick everyones saying that sam broke into his grandmas grave and stole the gold teeth out of her mouth did you ever hear of such a thing and he killed his wife and fed her corpse to the hogs and now wait a minute i said sam gaddis has never been married you mean you just never saw his wife he was married before he came here and he fed her to the hogs before anyone could find out about her aw come on now i said just when is sam supposed to have done all these things rose hesitated and said well she didnt know when exactly but by god she knew hed done em people wouldnt just make up stories like that they couldnt couldnt they why of course not honey anyway most of the stories came right from mrs robert lee jefferson according to myra her own husband told them to her and you know robert lee jefferson wouldnt lie yeah i said it dont seem like he would now does it and i had to bite my lip to keep from laughing or maybe doing the opposite because it was really pretty goddanged sad now wasnt it it was a goddanged sorry state of affairs of course it was all to the good for me id thrown the bait to robert leejefferson and hed bit on it hed done just what i expected him to do gone around asking people what the stories about sam were which had started them to asking other people and before long there were plenty of answers the kind of stinking dirty dirt that people can always create for themselves when there aint none for real and it made me kind of sad you know really downright sad i couldnt help wishing that robert lee hadnt taken the bait and started askingquestions which in turn had started piling up the dirt around a fine man like sam gaddis yes sir i really sort of wished things hadnt worked out this way even if it did ruin sam and get me reelected which it was just about certain to do unless something went wrong it rained during the night and i slept pretty good like almost always do when it rains along about ten the next morning when i was having a little second breakfast because i hadnt eaten much the first time but a few eggs and some pancakes and sausage rose hauck called shed been trying to reach me for quite a while but hadnt been able to because of myras gossiping about sam gaddis myra talked to her for a couple of minutes and then passed the phone to me im afraid somethings happened to tom nick rose told me just as if she didnt know what had happened to him his horse came home without him this morning is that a fact i said you think maybe should go out and start looking for him well i just dont know nick she hesitated if tom is all right he might be pretty mad if i sent the sheriff after him i said that was for sure all right tom didnt like anyone butting in on his affairs maybe he holed up somewhere on account of the rain i said maybe hes waitin for it to dry up a little before he starts home ill bet thats it she said making her voice relieved he probably didnt have cover for the mare so he sent her home by herself thats probably the way it was all right i said after all he didnt tell you he was coming home last night did he no no he didnt he never tells me how long hes going to be gone well dont worry none about it i said not yet anyways if tom aint home by tomorrow why then ill start lookin for him myra was making wild faces and motions as if to say what is it all about i passed her the phone and there was some more jibberjabbering and she wound up asking rose to come have supper with us now you just must come dear because ive got all kinds of news to tell you you can get a ride in with the mailman about four and ill have nick drive you home afterward she hung up shaking her head and murmuring poor rose that poor dear sweet woman i said why rose aint poor honey thats a right good farm her and tom has oh shut up she said if youd have been half a man youd have done something about tom hauck long ago put him in jail where he belongs instead of leaving him free to beat up that poor little helpless wife of his why i couldnt do that i said i couldnt interfere between a man and his wife no you couldnt you couldnt do anything because youre not half a man well now i dont know about that i said i aint saying youre wrong but i sure aint saying oh shut up she said again lennies more of a man than you are arent you lennie darling she smiled at him youre myras brave strong man arent you not an old cowardly calf like nick lennie slobbered out a laugh pointing a finger at me cowardly calf cowardly calf sheriff nicks a cowardly calf i looked at him and he stopped laughing and pointing he turned real quiet and kind of pale i looked at myra and her smile stiffened and faded and she was almost as pale and silent as lennie nnick she broke the long silence with a trembly laugh wwhats the matter matter i said the way youre looking like you were about to kill lennie and me both i never saw you look that way before i forced a laugh making it sound easy and stupid me me kill someone aw now but but you i guess maybe i was thinking about the election thinking maybe it wasnt a very good idea to be pokin fun at me with the election comin up she nodded her head quickly and frowned at lennie of course wed never carry on like that in public but but probably it isnt a good idea even if we were just joking i thanked her for her understandin and started for the door she followed me for a step still kind of anxious shook up from the scare id accidently given her i dont think you have to worry about getting elected dear not with all the talk thats going on about sam gaddis well i never believe in takin chances i said i always figure a fella ought to lean over backwards and put his shoulder to the wheel and not count his chickens until theyre hatched mrs robert lee jefferson said her husband said that you said you didnt believe the stories about sam gaddis i dont i dont believe a goddanged word of em i said but she also said that he said that you said you were going to speak up for mr gaddis she said that he said that you said you were going to be on the speakers platform with him come sundayweek i told her shed spoken the truth and that was a fact you talk to her again you tell her that when she said that robert lee said that i said i was going to speak up for sam gaddis she was a thousand per cent right you fool she caught herself but gaddis is running against you dear why should you do anything for him now thats quite a question aint it i said yes sir that is quite a question reckon id tell you the answer if i didnt figure youd have so much fun cypherin it out but reckon id better be rushing back to my office i said no tellin whats been happening while i was away i went on down the stairs pretending like i didnt hear her when she called to me i went in my office and sat down with my boots upon the desk and i slanted my hat over my eyes and kind of dozed for a little while it was awfully peaceful the mud was keeping most folks indoors and the painters were taking the day off because of the wet so there wasnt a lot of slamming and banging and calling back and forth from them a fella could really rest for a change and catch up the sleep that he didnt get at night i rested and slept until noon when i went upstairs for dinner myra had got over her scare and was about back to normal she looked at me and said she could see id had a very busy morning and she hoped i wasnt wearing myself out well im trying not to i said a fella like me with the whole county depending on him for law and order has got to watch out for his health which sort of reminds me about me takin rose hauck home tonight youre going to do it myra snapped youre going to so just dont try to get out of it but suppose toms there suppose hes mad about me bringin his wife home an an i squirmed letting my eyes fall but i could still see myra glaring at me at last she spoke her voice shaky with hate and disgust you you thing you you miserable excuse for a man ill tell you this nick corey if tom is there and you let him hurt rose ill make you the sorriest man in the county now my goodness isaid my goodness gracious you dont need to talk that way i wouldnt stand by an watch rose get hurt well youd better not thats all ive got to say youd just better not i started eating with myra shooting me a suspicious look now and then after a while i looked up and said id just thought of something else about rose suppose tom came home after left and wouldnt be around to protect her hes bound to be pretty bad off i said stayin away so long hell probably be twice as drunk and mean as he usually is makes me plumb shiver to think what he might do to rose well myra hesitated studying over what id said and not finding anything to fault me for well i dont suppose it would look right for you to stay all night at the house but naw i couldnt do that i sure couldnt do that i said anyways we dont know for sure when toms comin home might be gone two three days all we know is hes gonna be plenty hard to get along with when he does get back myra fumed and frowned and said i should have done something about tom long ago and rose wouldnt be in this position now i said she was probably right and it was just too bad we couldnt think of some way to give rose some protection lets see i said i wonder maybe if we could get her a watchdog or you fool tom would kill it in a minute hes killed every dog they ever had mmmhmm i said goddang if i didnt forget about that well lets see now id know of just the thing if rose was a different kind of person more nervy you know instead of so meek and mild but thats the way she is so it just wouldnt do no good what wouldnt do no good what are you talking about now why a gun i said you know one of them things you shoot with but it sure wouldnt do no good with rose her bein scared of her own shadder so thats it myra cut in well get her a gun she ought to have one anyway a woman alone as much as she is but what good will it do i said rose wouldnt shoot no one to save her life im not so sure about that not if her life was at stake at any rate she could point it make that big brute of a husband keep away from her well now ijust dont know about that i said if you ask me im not asking you im taking rose out to get a gun this very day so just finish your dinner and shut up i finished eating and went back down to my office i rested and dozed some more but not as good as i had in the morning i was kind of puzzled with myself you know wondering why id wanted rose hauck to have a gun because of course i did want her to have one i tried to tell myself that it was just for her own protection just in case someone tried to bother her but i knew that wasnt my real reason my real reason i guessed was something i hadnt quite figured out yet it was part of something else some planwishes i had for myra and lennie and i hadnt quite figured out what they were either maybe it dont seem to make sense for a fella to be doing things for a reason that he dont know about but i reckon ive been doing it most of my life the reason i went to see ken lacey for example wasnt the one i let on that it was id done it because i had a plan for him and youve seen what that plan was but i didnt know it at the time id called on him id had kind of a goal and id figured that a fella like ken could be a lot of help in bringing it about but just how i was going to use him i wasnt even halfway sure and it was the same situation now with rose and the gun all i knew was that they probably fitted into a plan for myra and lennie but i didnt have no real idea of what the plan was i purely didnt except that it was probably pretty unpleasant rose got to the courthouse around four oclock that afternoon i was on the lookout for her and i got her in the office for a minute before she could goon upstairs she was looking prettier than id ever seen her which was really saying something she said shed slept like a goddam baby all night long and shed woke up laughing thinking about that sonofabitch of a tom being dead out in the mud somewheres did i do all right when i called up this morning honey she whispered it sounded like i was really concerned about the dirty bastard you did just fine i said and looky baby i told her about the gun how it would look like she was worried about tom beating her up when became back which you see would prove she didnt know he was dead and she kind of hesitated for a second giving me a quick frowny look but she didnt argue about it whatever you say nick honey if you think its a good idea well it was actually myras i said i just about had to go along with it or it would have looked like i knew tom wasnt coming back rose nodded and said what the hell dismissing the subject maybe i can take a shot at you some time if youre not real nice to me that time aint never gonna come i said and i gave her a quick hug and a squeeze and she went on up the stairs she and myra went out a little later to get the gun and stayed out until after five a few minutes before six myra called me and i closed the office and went upstairs to supper myra did most of the talking like she always did shutting me up whenever i said anything about all rose did was agree with her putting in a word now and then about how wonderful and smart myra was and that was the same as usual too we finished eating myra and rose started clearing up the dishes lennie looked at me to see if i was watching him which iwas only he didnt know it and then he made a sneak toward the door i cleared my throat to get myras attention and jerked my head at lennie how about that honey i said you know what we agreed on what she said what are you talking about now for pitys sake about him goin out at night i said you know what hell do an it just aint a good idea with the election coming up myra said oh pshaw the boys got to get a little air some time doesnt he you cant begrudge him that but we agreed that i did not you just got me so mixed up i wasnt thinking what i was saying anyway sam gaddis is bound to be beat and you know it well i just dont see no use in taking chances i said i oh shut up did you ever see such a man in your life rose is it any wonder that im half out of my mind from living with him myra scowled at me then turned to give lennie a smile you go right ahead honey have a good time but dont stay out too late he went out after a blubbery spiteful grin at me myra said id better go to my bedroom and stay if i couldnt make sense which she was sure i couldnt so thats what i did i stretched out on the bed with the spread turned back so that my boots wouldnt soil it the window was open and i could hear the crickets singing like they always do after a rain now and then a bullfrog would sound off with a loud kerrumph like a bass drummer keeping time way off across town someone was pumping water pplump whish pplump whish and you could hear some mother calling her kid henry clay oooh henry clay houston you come home now and the smell of freshwashed soil was in the air just about the nicest smell there is and and everything was fine it was so goddanged nice and peaceful that i dozed off again yes sir i went to sleep even though i hadnt had a real hard work day and id managed to catch up on my rest a little i guess i must have been asleep about an hour when i waked up to the sound of myra yelling and lennie bawling and someone talking to em amy mason speaking her mind in a way that almost put your teeth on edge soft but firm and cutting like only amy could speak when she had her dander up you knew youd better listen to what she was saying when amy spoke that way youd better listen and take it to heart or it would be too goddanged bad for you i knew it was having its effect on myra in spite of her yelling and trying to set defiant she began to kind of whimper and whine saying that lennie didnt mean anything by peeking in amys window he was just curious about people amy said she knew exactly what he meant and hed better not try any of his nasty tricks again if he knew what was good for him ive already warned your husband she said and now im warning you mrs corey if i catch your brother at my window again ill take a horsewhip to him yyou wouldnt dare myra whined and you just stop hurting him let go of the poor boys ear gladly amy said it makes my flesh crawl to touch him i cracked the door open an inch or so and looked out myra had her arm around lennie who looked redfaced and mad and scared as she patted him on the head rose was standing next to her trying to appear concerned and protective but i knew knowing her so well that she was laughing inside tickled pink to see myra catching it for a change as for amy i swallowed hard looking at her wondering what id ever seen in rose after id had someone like amy not that she was any prettier than rose or built any better you just couldnt fault rose on prettiness or build no matter who you stood her up against the difference i guess was something that came from the inside something that kind of grabbed hold of you right around the heart that left its mark on you like a brand so that the feel of her and the memory of her was always with you no matter where you strayed i came bursting out of the bedroom and looked around putting a real surprised look on my face whats going on here anyways i said not givin anyone a chance to answer why good evening miss mason is they some kind of trouble amy said no they was not no kind of trouble kind of mimicking me you know not now there isnt sheriff the troubles all settled your wife will tell you how to avoid any in the future my wife i gave myra and lennie a studyin look and turned back to amy did my wifes brother do somethin miss mason you just tell me about it of course lennie didnt do anything myra snapped he was just is your name miss mason i said is it wwhat what i asked miss mason a question i said in case you aint heard miss mason is one of the most prominent and respected young women in potts county and when i ask her somethin its because i know shell tell the truth so maybe youd better not go contradictin what she says myras mouth dropped open she turned from red to white and then back to red again i knew shed probably give me allheck when she got me alone but for the present she wasnt talkin back she knew she just hadnt better what with an election coming up and amy being so generally wellthoughtof she knew that someone like amy could cause an awful lot of trouble if they took a notion and an election year was no time for trouble so myra didnt give me any trouble much as she felt like it and amy was kind of pleased by the way id acted and said she was sorry if shed said anything hurtful im afraid i lost my temper for a moment she smiled a little stiffly if youll excuse me ill run along home ill walk you home myself i said its too late at night for a young lady to be out by herself now thats not at all necessary sheriff i i said it certainly was necessary me and my wife we wouldnt have it no other way thats right aint it myra you insist on me seem miss mason home dont you myra said yes her teeth practically clenched together i nodded and winked to rose and she winked back at me and amy and me left she lived right there in town so i didnt get out the horse and buggy like i might have if her home had been a far piece off anyway i wanted to talk to her and i didnt want her pulling away from me and its just about impossible for a woman to be standoffish when youre walking her home through the mud on a dark night she had to listen when i started telling her how myra had hooked me she said she just wasnt interested and it wasnt any of her business and that sort of thing but she listened anyway because she couldnt get out of it and after a couple of minutes she stopped interruptin and began to cling closer to me and i knew she believed what i was saying on the porch of the house she flung her arms around me and i put mine around her and we stood there in the darkness for a little while just holding onto each other then she sort of pushed me away and i couldnt see her expression but somehow i knew she was frowning nick she said nick this is terrible i said yeah i guess i have kind of messed things up all right i guess ive been nine kinds of fool lettin myra scare me into marryin her and thats not what im talking about that could be solved with money and i have money but but then whats botherin you i said whats so terrible honey i im not sure she shook her head i know what but i dont know why and im not positive it would make any difference if i did know i cant talk about it now i dont even want to think about it i oh nick nick she buried her face against my chest i held her tighter stroking her head and whispering that everything was all right that nothing could be so very terrible as long as we were together again now it just couldnt honey i said you just tell me what it is and ill show you it dont really amount to nothin at all she clung to me a little tighter still not saying anything i said well to heck with it maybe we could save it for another time when i didnt have to be in kind of a rush like i was tonight you remember how i used to go nightfishin i said well i was thinkin maybe might go tomorrow night and itd be kind of a natural mistake if i should wind up here instead of the river because you aint so awful far from it amy sniffled then laughed oh nick theres just no one like you well i should hope not i said the worldd be in a heck of a mess if there was i said id see her the next night just as soon as it was good and dark she shivered against me and said that would be fine but do you have to go now darling well i guess i kind of should i said myrall be wonderin what happened and i got to see miz hauck home yet tonight amy said oh i see id almost forgotten about rose yeah i got to take her home i said kind of grumbling about it myra has done promised her i would poor nick amy patted my cheek everyones always imposing on him aw i dont really mind i said after all someones got to take care of poor miz hauck how true and isnt it fortunate that she has someone so willing to take care of her you know nick poor ol mrs hauck seems to be bearing up remarkably well under her troubles she looked positively blooming like a woman in love one might say is that a fact i said i cant say that i rightly noticed come in for a while nick i want to talk to you i guess we better let it wait until tomorrow night i said its kind of late an now tonight nick but rose i mean miz hauck will be waiting i let her im afraid its not the only disappointment shes in for now come in she flung the door open and went in and i went in after her her hand gripped mine in the darkness and she led me back through the house to her bedroom and it was a funny thing her saying she wanted to talk to me because she didnt do no talking at all or hardly any afterwards she lay back and yawned and stretched kind of fidgeting because i never could see good in the dark and i was slow in getting my clothes on will you please hurry a little darling i feel all nice and relaxed and drowsy and i want to get to bed well you sure aint got far to get i said what was it you was wantin to talk to me about anyways about your grammar possibly youre no ignoramus nick why do you talk like one just habit i guess kind of a rut ive got into english and grammar i reckon theyre like a lot of things a fella dont use em he dont see no real demand for em and pretty soon he loses the knack wrong is right for him an vicey versa you might say amys head shifted on the pillows her eyes wide in her white face as she studied me i think i know what you mean nick she said in a way im a victim of the same process yeah i said pulling on my boots how you mean amy or im beginning to be a victim she said and you know darling i rather like it i stood up tucking in my shirttails just what was you wantin to say to me amy nothing that cant wait until tomorrow night in fact i no longer think ill have anything to say then but you said and isaid some other things too darling possibly you werent listening now you run along now and i do hope pore ol miz hauck aint too disappointed yeah i said i sure hope she aint either but i had an idea she was going to be the way id met myra was at the state fair a few years ago i was all dressed up like i always am when i go someplace and even a goddanged fool could see i was doing plenty all right anyway i reckon myra seen it and she didnt look so bad herself then shed gone to some pains to pretty herself up and i didnt fight too hard when she latched herself onto me it was at this place where you throw balls at a colored fellas head and if you hit him you won a prize i was just doin it because the fella that ran the place kept asking me to it had seemed unobliging not to but i sure didnt want to hit this colored man and i didnt but i heard someone clapping her hands and here was myra carrying on like i was the worlds greatest pitcher oooh i just dont see how you do it she said simpering up at me would you throw some balls for me please if i give you the money well id kind of rather not maam i said if you dont mind excusin me i was just quitting myself oh she said kind of letting her face sag which didnt require much of an effort if you know what i mean i understand your wife is with you naw that aint it i said i aint married maam i just dont want to throw at that colored fella because it dont seem right somehow it aint rightly decent you might say youre just saying that she pouted and simpered its your way of rebuking me for being forward i said naw that wasnt it at all i really felt like i said i did i guess its his job to get throwed at but it aint mine to do the throwin i said anyways a fellad be better off without a job than one like this if hes got to get hit to live he aint got nothing worth living for myra put on a solemn face and said she could see i was a really deep thinker i said well i didnt know about that but i was sure a thirsty one maybe could offer you a lemonade maam seem as how i cant favor you by throwing balls well she twisted and twitched and twittered you wont think im terribly forward if i say yes why you just said it maam i said leading her toward the pink lemonade stand you just said yes and i dont think nothing like that at all and sure enough i didnt what i was thinking was that she must have buggers in her bloomers or a chigger on her figger or however you say it it looked to me like something had better be done about it pretty quick or her pants would start blazing and maybe theyd set the fairgrounds on fire and thered be a panic with thousands of people getting stomped to death not to mention the property damage and i couldnt think of but one way to prevent it well though i didnt want to rush into things there just wasnt any need to rush as far as i was concerned because i was getting married to amy the next week and shed taken good care to provide for me until then so i stalled around trying to decide whether i really ought to do the only thing i could think of to do you might say it really wasnt my problem if myra did set the fairgrounds on fire with thousands of innocent women and children getting killed because was from out of town and im a great believer in local rights you know like state rights and myra lived here in the city could be i might get into all kinds of trouble by interfering in a local problem even if it was something that even a goddanged fool would be familiar with and the local folks werent doing nothing about it i took myra to a few side shows standing close to her while i tried to make up my mind i took her on the merrygoround and some other rides helping her on and off and looking at her when her dress slid up and so on and so forth and goddang if it wasnt long before i came to my decision myra looked shocked when i whispered to her almost as shocked as if id bought her a sack of popcorn why why i just wouldnt think of it she twisted and twitched the very idea going to a hotel with a strange man but i aint strange i said giving her a pinch im built just like the rest of em oh you awful thing you she giggled youre just terrible why i aint neither terrible i said anyways it aint fair to say i am without more knowledge on the subject she giggled and blushed and said she just couldnt go to a hotel i just couldnt i really couldnt well if you cant you cant i said getting a little tired of it all far be it from me to urge you but but we could go to my rooming house no one would think anything of it if you just came up to my room for a little visit we took a streetcar over to the place where she lived a big white house a few blocks from the river it was a very respectable place from all appearances and the people were too and no one lifted an eyebrow when myra said we were just going upstairs to clean up before we went out for supper well sir i hardly touched that woman or anyway if i did touch her i didnt do much more than that i was ready to and rarin to and well maybe i did do a little something but with all them clothes she had on it was goddanged little all of a sudden though she pushed me off to the floor starting to bawl and sob so loud you could hear her in the next block i picked myself up and tried to shush her i asked her what the heck was the matter and i tried to pat her and calm her down she shoved me away again setting up an even bigger racket i didnt know what the heck to do anyways i didnt have time to do anything before a bunch of the other roomers came busting in the women hovered around myra trying to soothe her and talk to her myra kept bawling and shaking her head not answering when they asked her what the matter was the men looked at me and kept asking me what id done to myra and it was just one of those situations where the truth wont do and a lies no help which fortunately there aint many of in this vale of tears the men grabbed ahold of me and began to bat me around one of the women said she was going to call the police but the men said no theyd take care of me themselves theyd give me what i deserved they said and there were plenty of men in the neighborhood to help em well i couldnt really blame em for thinking what they did idve probably thought the same thing in their place what with myra bawling and her clothes being messed up and me not being in very good shape neither they figured id raped her and when a fella rapes a gal in this part of the country he hardly ever gets to the jail or if he does he dont stay there very long i figure sometimes that maybe thats why we dont make as much progress as other parts of the nation people lose so much time from their jobs in lynching other people and they spend so much money on rope and kerosene and getting likkeredup in advance and other essentials that there aint an awful lot of money or manhours left for practical purposes howsoever it sure looked like i was about to be the guest of honor at a necktie party when myra decided to speak up im ssure mr corey didnt mean to do wrong she said looking around tearyeyed hes really a fine man im sure and he didnt mean to do wrong did you mr corey no maam i sure didnt i said running my finger around my collar i positively didnt mean nothing like that and thats a fact then why did you do it a man frowned at me this is hardly something that a person does accidentally well i dont know about that i said i wouldnt say youre wrong but i aint sure youre right either he started to take a swing at me i ducked but another fella caught me by the shoulder and flung me toward the door i went down on my knees and someone kicked me and some others jerked me to my feet again not being very gentle about it and then everyone was hustling me out of the room and trying to sock me at the same time myra said wait please wait its all a mistake they slowed down a little and someone said now dont upset yourself miss myra this skunk isnt worth it but he wants to marry me we were going to get married tonight everyone was pretty surprised including me and they were puzzled too which i wasnt it looked like id sold my pottage for a mess of afterbirth as the saying is id been chasing females all my life not paying no mind to the fact that whatevers got tail at one end has teeth at the other and now i was getting chomped on that right corey a fella nudged me you and miss myra getting married well i saidwell its like this or at least thats the way i see it i mean uh oh hes so bashful myra laughed and he gets excited so easily thats what happened when she looked down at herself blushing and brushing at her mussedup clothes he got so excited when i said yes id marry him that that the women put their arms around her and kissed her the men slapped me on the back and began shaking my hands they said they were sorry theyd misunderstood the situation and doggone it couldnt a woman get a man in a heck of a lot of trouble without even halfway trying why we might have had you strung up by the neck corey if miss myra hadnt set things straight now wouldnt that have been a fine state of affairs yeah i said that would have been a good joke on me but looky fellas about this marriage business a wonderful institution corey and youre getting a wonderful woman and im getting a wonderful man myra jumped up and threw her arms around me were getting married right tonight because mr corey just cant wait and youre all invited to the wedding it just happened that there was a preacher right up in the next block so thats where we went where everyone else went i should say and i got took myra dragged me along with her arm hooked through mine and those other folks brought up the rear laughing and joking and slapping me on the back and crowding on my heels so that i couldnt slow down i tried to sort of hang back and they thought that was funny as allheck they thought the expression on my face was funny and they practically went into hysterics when i said something like what was the goddanged hurry and maybe we ought to think this over for a while it reminded me of one of those ceremonies you read about in ancient histories you know theres this big procession with everyone laughing and carrying on and having themselves a heck of a time and up at the head of it is this fella thats going to get sacrificed to the gods he knows hell get his ass carved up with a meat axe as soon as they stop throwing roses at him so he sure aint in no hurry to get to the altar he cant get out of the deal but neither can he put his heart into it and the more he protests the more people laugh at him so so thats what it reminded me of a fella getting sacrificed for something that just aint worth it but i guess a lot of marriages strike me the same way everything for show and nothing for real everything for public and nothing for private and that night after me and myra were in bed i guess a lot of marriages turn out like that too bawling and accusations and mean talk the woman taking it out on the man because he was too stupid to get away from her or maybe im just kind of sour i got my horse and buggy out of the livery stable and drove back to the courthouse myra was jumping on me wanting to know what had took me so long almost as soon as i was inside the door and i said id had quite a time getting things straightened out with amy i dont see why myra said she seemed calm enough when she left here well theres quite a few things you dont see i said like why you should keep lennie in at night so we wouldnt have messes like this now dont you start in on lennie i tell you what id like to start i said id like to start home with rose so maybe we could all get to bed sometime tonight rose said yes she really should be going and she thanked myra for the dinner and hugged her and kissed her good night i went on downstairs ahead of her before i got into another argument and she came running down after a minute of two and got into the buggy ugh she said scrubbing at her mouth every time i kiss that old bitch i want to wash out my mouth you ought to watch that cussing rose i said its liable to slip out sometime when you dont mean it to yeah i guess i should goddam it she said its toms fault the dirty sonofabitch but im sure as hell going to do my best to stop it thats my girl i said i can see you aint going to have no trouble we were outside of town by now and rose moved over in the seat to snuggle up against me she kissed me on the back of my neck and she put a hand inside my pocket and sort of wiggled it around and then she kind of moved away a little and gave me a funny look whats the matter nick what i said hows that rose i said whats wrong with you why nothing i said course im kind of tired and wore out from all the excitement tonight but there aint nothing really wrong she stared at me not saying anything she turned around in the seat facing straight ahead and we rode in silence for a while at last she spoke in a voice so low i could hardly hear it asking me a question i went cold all over and then i said for goshs sake what a thing to say you know amy mason aint that kind of woman rose everyone knows she aint what the hell you mean shes not that kind rose snapped you mean shes too goddam good to go to bed with you but im not i mean i just aint hardly acquainted with the woman i said i barely know her to tip my hat to you were gone long enough tonight to get acquainted aw naw i wasnt honey i said it just seemed like a long time to you like it did to me you know because we were just waitin to get together tonight and it seemed like a heck of a long wait why honey i was just itchin and achin for you from the minute you showed up today well she moved over a little in the seat why for goshs sake i said what for would i want with amy mason when i got you why it just dont make sense now does it there just aint no comparison between the two of you rose came all the way over in the seat she leaned her head against my shoulder and said she was sorry but i had acted kind of strange and it did make her so goddam mad the way some men were that goddam tom for example the sonofabitch just wouldnt leave me alone until i gave in to him and then he goes out and screws everything that cant outrun him tsk tsk i said i just cant understand fellas like that rose squeezed me and kissed me on the ear she gave me a little nibble on the ear and whispered to me talking about whatall she was going to do to me when we got to her house myra wants you to stay a while and make sure im all right isnt that nice mm we can take our time just you and me together for hours and hours and honey we wont waste a minute of it oh boy i said itll be like it never was before darling she shivered against me oh honey im going to be something special for you tonight gollee i said goody goshdang she went on whispering and shivering against me saying that this was one night id never forget i said i bet i wouldnt neither and i meant every word of it because the way i was feeling as hollow as a treebark whistle and like my back was broken in six places there wasnt going to be no party when we got to roses house which meant that shed know shed been right about amy which also meant that shed probably take that gun shed got today and shoot me right through the offendin part and with a memento like that i sure wouldnt forget the night i tried to think of some way of stalling her i looked up at the sky which was clouding over again for a rain and i saw a streak or two of lightning and i thought well maybe a bolt would strike me coldcocking me for the night so that rose would excuse me then i thought well maybe the horse would run away and throw me into a bobwire fence and rose would have to let me off then too or maybe a water moccasin would climb up in the buggy and fang me or but nothing like that happened a fella never gets lucky that way when he really needs to we reached the farm i drove on into the barn wondering how much it would handicap a fella having a hole where was going to have one it seemed to me it would mess him up pretty bad in the things he needed to do most and i climbed down from the buggy feeling mighty glum i helped rose down giving her a smack on the bottom by way of habit then i bent down behind the splashboard to unhitch the singletree and the horse was fidgeting and switching his tail and i was saying sooo boy soo now and then i thought of an idea i gave the horse a goose and made him jump i drove my shoulder against the splashboard making a heck of a racket like the horse had kicked it then i jumped out in the clear again groaning and clutching myself rose came running up clinging to me by one arm as i staggered around doubled over oh honey darling did that goddam nag kick you right in the youknowwhat i groaned i never had nothin hurt so bad in my life goddam him to hell anyway ill get a pitchfork and gut the brindle bastard naw dont do nothin like that i said the horse didnt go to do it just help me get him hitched up again sos i can get home home youre not going anywhere in your condition she said im taking you in the house and dont you argue about it i said but looky now it wasnt necessary to go to all that trouble ill just go home and lay down with some cold towels on it and youll lie down here and well see about the towels after i see what the damage is it might be you need something else but looky looky here now honey i said its kind of private a thing like that it aint hardly something a woman should deal with since when rose said now come on and stop arguing with me just lean on me and well go real slow i did what she said therejust wasnt anything else icoulddo we got to the house she helped me back into the bedroom made me lay down on the bed and started taking off my clothes i told her she didnt need to take them all off because the pain was just in the part that my pants covered she said it wasnt any trouble at all and i could relax better if i was all undressed instead of partways and to stop butting into her business i said that it was my business that got hurt and she said well my business was her business and right now she was running the store she leaned down over the place where i was hurt or supposed to be hurt turning the lamp this way and that so that she could make a proper inspection hmmm she said i dont see any bruises honey no breaks in the skin i said well it sure hurt thats all i knew of course a fella dont have to get hit very hard in that area to make him hurt to beat heck she said lets see now you tell me here it hurts does it hurt there or here or here she was awful gentle so gentle that it wouldnt have hurt me in any of the places even if i had been hurt i told her that maybe shed better be a little more firm about it so i could make sure of where the pain was so she pushed and pressed a little harder asking if it hurt there or here and so on and i let out an ooh or an aah now and then but what i was feeling wasnt pain it didnt matter any more about amy me being with her that night i mean i was as ready and rarin as id ever been and of course rose wasnt long in noticing the fact hey now she said just whats going on here mister what does it look like i said it looks to me like a big business recovery well goddang geewhillikins i said and right after a severe blow to the economy you reckon we ought to celebrate the occasion what the hell you think she said just let me get these goddam clothes off i snoozed a little while afterwards no more than fifteen minutes probably because id rested quite a bit that day and wasnt really tired i came awake with roses hand biting into my arm her voice a scary whisper nick nick wake up someones outside what i mumbled starting to roll over on my side again well leave em out there sure dont want em in here nick theyre on the porch nick what who do you suppose it i dont hear nothin i said maybe its just the wind no it listen there it is again i heard it then faint careful footsteps like someone moving on tiptoe and along with them a dull draggy sound as if something heavy was being dragged upon the stoop nnick what do you think wed better do nick i swung my legs off the bed and said id get my gun and have a look she started to nod and then she put out her hand and stopped me no honey it wont look right your being here this time of night not with the lights all off and your horse put away but ill just take a little peek out i said i wont show myself to no one you might have to you just stay here and keep quiet and ill go she slid quietly out of bed and trotted into the other room making no more noise than a shadow i was pretty nervy naturally wondering who or what was upon the porch and what it might have to do with me and rose but the way she was taking things sort of keeping out in front and leaving me in the background was a big comfort i thought about myras idea of rose as someone meek and mild and ready to jump at her own shadow and i almost laughed out loud rose could whip her weight in bobcats if she took a notion shed maybe let tom get the best of her but that just wasnt no way a fair match i heard the click of the key in the outside door i sat up kind of poised on the edge of the bed ready to move if she called to me i waited holding my breath for quiet there was another click as rose unlatched the screen and then a rusty squeak as she pushed it open then it was a small house like ive said but from where i was to where she was was still quite a piece maybe thirty feet or more yet that far away i heard it the gasp the scaredcrazy sound of her breath sucking in and then she screamed screamed and cussed in a way i dont ever want to hear again nnick nick the sonofabitch is back that goddam toms back i grabbed for my pants but the legs were twisted and the way rose was carrying on i didnt have no time to fool with em pants werent what i needed anyway with that goddanged tom back so i snatched up my gun which i sure as heck did need and ran for the door i tripped over a chair in the kitchen almost taking a header against the wall i righted myself and dashed out to the porch then i saw how things were and they sure werent good all right but they were a lot better than id expected em to be it was toms body that was there not tom it had been left on the porch face up with the shotgun placed at the side the beard had grown out some because hair does go on growing for a while on dead people he was all covered over with mud and the middle of his body was just a big gutsy hole his eyes were wide open and staring the meanness was gone from them but the fear that had taken its place was worse whatever death looked like it sure didnt look good to him all in all you might say he wasnt a very pretty sight nothing that would take first prize in a bestlookinfella contest old man death had painted tom hauck in his true colors and it wasnt an even halfway flattering portrait i couldnt really blame rose for carrying on like she was almost any woman would have done the same if her husband had come home in the middle of the night looking like tom did rose had a right to raise a ruckus but it wasnt helping things particularly helping me to think which i was obviously in need of doing and fast so i got an arm around her and tried to calm her down easy now honey easy this dont look so good but goddam you why didnt you kill him she tore away from me you told me you killed the sonof abitch i did baby he sure dont look like no live man now does he he couldnt be no more dead if then who brought him back here what goddam dirty bastard did it if i get my hands on the sonofabitch she broke off and whirled around wildeyed seeming to listen for something i started to say i wanted to get my hands on the fella too because just why the heck had he done this anyway rose told me to shut my goddam mouth now honey i said that aint no way to talk we got to be calm and there she yelled pointing there he is thats the sonofabitch that did it she leaped off the porch and started running racing up the lane that led from the house to the road her naked white body faded into the darkness i hesitated wondering if i shouldnt at beast put my pants on and then i thought what the heck and i ran after her i couldnt see whatever rose had seen i couldnt hardly see nothing it being so dark but i did hear something the squeak of wagon wheels and the soft plodplod of horses hooves on the muddy lane i kept running finally the squeaking and the plodding stopped and i saw the white of roses body then she was cussing and screaming again ordering whoever it was to climb down off the wagon get down you black bastard get down goddam you what the hells the idea of bringing back that sonofabitch of a husband of mine miz rose please maam miz rose i it was the soft frightened voice of a man ill show you you sonofabitch ill teach you ill peel your black ass right down to the bones she was trying to tear loose a piece of harness strap when i ran up i jerked her around and she faced me wildeyed pointing shakily to the fella who stood at the side of the wagon it was uncle john the colored fella i mentioned earlier he was standing with his hands halfraised and in the darkness his frightened eyes seemed all whites he kept them turned away naturally because a colored fella could get himself killed for looking at a naked white woman hhe he did it rose began to bawl he brought the sonofabitch back nick well now im sure he didnt mean no harm by it i said howdy do uncle john nice evenin thank you mistah nick is feelin tolable thank you his voice shook with fear yes suh sho is a fine evenin you sonofabitch rose yelled whatd you bring him back for why do you think we got rid of the dirty bastard anyway rose i said rose and uncle johns eyes rolled in his head and he said please maam miz rose and it sounded like a prayer hed already seen a lot a heck of a lot more than it was healthy to see he sure didnt want to hear anything to go with it rose slipped away from me again opening her mouth for another yell and uncle john tried to stopper his ears with his fingers but he knew it was no good he heard and he knew that i knew it its not fair nick goddam it you go to all the trouble of killing the sonofabitch and this bastard brings him back i slapped her across the mouth she whirled and came at me hands clawed i grabbed her by the hair lifted her off the ground and gave her a crisscross slap backwards and forwards you get the idea i said letting her back down on her feet now you shut up and get back to the house or ill give you the worst beating you ever had in your life her hand went slowly to her face she looked down at herself seeming to realize for the first time that she was naked shivering she tried to cover up with her hands shooting a scared look at uncle john nnick what whatll we go on do what i told you to i gave her a push toward the house me an uncle john will handle this bbut but why did he do it i got an idea about that too i said you run along now and everything will be fine she hesitated then scampered back up the lane i waited until i was sure she was really gone and then i turned around to uncle john i smiled at him and he tried to smile back but his teeth were chattering so bad that he couldnt now dont be scared uncle john i told him you got nothin to fear from me aint i always treated you right now aint i aint i always done the very best i could by you yes yes suh mistah nick he said eagerly an i done right by you suh aint i mistah nick now aint that the truth suh aint i been a plumb good nigger for you well sir i said i reckon i could call you that all right yes suh mistah nick any of them bad niggers startin trouble i always comes an tells you suh any of em steal a chicken or shoot crap or get drunk or all em other things bad niggers do i always comes right an reports it to you now dont i suh well sir i said i reckon youre right about that too and iaint forgettin it unclejohn but just what are you getting at anyways he gulped and choked swallowing a sob mistah nick i wont say nothin about bout what happen tonight hones mistah nick i wont say nothin to no one you just let me go an an why sure i will i said aint keeping you from leaving now am i yyou really means it mistah nick you really aint mad at me none cn go home right now an just keep my big ol mouth shut forevah an evah i told him that of course he could leave but id feel a lot better if he first told me how he happened to be here with tom haucks body you dont do that i might be kind of suspicious of you i might figure youd done something bad and was trying to hide it no suh mistah nick doin something bad was jus what i didnt i try to do good an then i get all mixed up ol foolish me an an oh mistah nick he covered his face with his hands ddont be mad at me suh uncle john he dont know nothin at all he dont hhear nothin an he dont see nothin an an please dont kill me mistah nick please dont kill ol john i patted him on the back letting him cry for a minute then i said i knew he hadnt done nothing wrong so why would i want to do anything bad to him but id sure be obliged if he told me just what had happened yyou he uncovered his face to look at me you really aint gonna kill me mistah nick honest goddang it you callin me a liar i said now you just start talkin and dont you tell me nothing but the truth he told me what had happened whyhe had brought tom haucks body back to his farm house it stacked up just about the way i thought it would he had come across the body early that evening while he was out hunting possum and hed started to come into town to tell me about it then with so many varmints around he figured it might be best to bring the body in with him so hed loaded it on his old spring wagon along with the shotgun and headed for town again he was about halfway there when it struck him that it might be a pretty bad idea to show up in town with the remains in fact it was a goddanged bad idea to be caught even in the same neighborhood with them because a lot of people might figure he had a firstclass motive for killing tom after all tom had given him a hard beating and intended to beat him again if he got within grabbing range he just couldnt lead a very happy life as long as tom was around soit wouldnt be any surprise at all if he killed him anyways unclejohn being a colored fella he wouldnt get the benefit of any doubts tom hauck was completely no good and the community was well shet of him but theyd still lynch uncle john it would sort of be their civic duty the way theyd see it part of the process of keeping the colored folks in hand well so poor old uncle john had got himself in a pickle he couldnt take toms body into town or even be seen with it and tom being a white man he couldnt bring himself to just dump the body off in a ditch somewhere there was only one thing he could do as he saw it only one thing that would be acceptable to toms white ghost and the allknowing god that he had been taught to believe in hed just take the dead man back to his own home and leave him there now dont that seem fittin mistah nick you see how i figgered suh i reckon now it sho wasnt the right thing to do seem as how miz rose carry on so bad an well now dont you worry none about that at all i said miss rose was just upset seeing her husband dead and pretty uglydead at that its probably goin to take her quite a while to get over it so maybe wed better move the body somewheres else until then but bbut you say i could leave mistah nick you say ijus tell you the truth an yes sir thats what wed better do i said so just you hurry up and turn your wagon back around he stood there head bowed his mouth working like he was trying to say something there was a long roll of thunder and then a jagged flash of lightning lighting his face for a moment and somehow i had to look the other way you hear me unclejohn i said you hear what i tell you to do he hesitated then sighed and climbed up on the wagon yes sub i hear you mistah nick we drove back to the house it began to rain while we were loading toms body and i told uncle john to stand on the porch until i was dressed so that he wouldnt get no wetter than he had to youre probably kind of hungry i said you want i should bring you a cup of hot chicory maybe a little pone or somethin i reckon not thank you suh he shook his head miz rose probably got no fire this time o night well well just build one up i said no trouble at all thank you suh i guess not mistah nick i i aint real hongry i went on in the house and dried off with a towel rose gave me and it sure felt good getting back into my clothes she was pestering me with questions while i dressed what were we going to do and what was i going to do and so on i asked her what she thought did she reckon shed ever feel safe with someone knowing what uncle john knew well she wet her lips her eyes turned away from mine we can give him some money cant we both of us will that should uh well he wouldnt want to say anything then would he he takes a drink now and then isaid no tellin what a fella will do when he gets enough booze in him but he and hes a very religious fella wouldnt be at all surprised if he figured he ought to pray for us you can send him away somewhere rose said put him on a train and send him up north he cant talk up there he wouldnt feel more free to do it away from us thanhe would here i laughed and chucked her under the chin asking her what she was so squeamish about here i thought you was a real tough woman it didnt bother you at all about what happened to tom because i hated the sonofabitch its not the same with uncle john a poor nigger man who was just trying to do the best he could maybe tom was doing the best he could too i wonder if we did any better but but nick you why you know what the bastard was like i said yeah i knew but id never heard of anyone killing toms wife and tom sleeping before and after with the party that did it then i laughed cutting her off before she could butt in but this is different all right honey i said this you know about before it happens it aint something you learn about afterwards so you can say well what can i do about it and it aint really my doin nick she touched my arm sort of frightened im sorry i lost my head tonight honey i guess i cant blame you for trying to hurt me it aint really that i said i reckon im just kind of tired of doing things that everybody knows im doing things they really want and expect me to do and having to take all the blame for it she understood she said she did anyway she put her arms around me and held me for a little while and we talked a couple of minutes about what would have to be done then i left because i had a pretty full nights work ahead of me i had uncle john drive up in the back country about three miles behind the farm we unloaded toms body there in the edge of some trees and uncle john and i took such shelter as we could a few feet away he sat down at the base of a tree his legs being too wobbly to hold him up any longer i hunkered down a few feet away from him and broke open the barrel of the shotgun it looked fairly clean clean enough to be safe anyways i blew through it a couple of times to make sure and then i loaded it with the shells id taken from toms pockets unclejohn watched me all the begging and praying in the world in his eyes i relatched the barrel and sighted along it and he began to cry again i frowned at him feeling pretty fretted now what you want to carry on like that for i said you knew what i was goin to have to do right along no ssuh i believe you mistah nick you different fm other white folks i believe every word you say well now i think youre lyin unclejohn i said an im sorry to hear you because its right in the bible that lyins a sin its a sin to kill folks too mistah nick worse sin than lyin yyou you ill tell you somethin unclejohn i said ill tell you something and i hope itll be a comfort to you each man kills the thing he loves yyou dont love me mistah nick i told him he was goddanged right about that a thousand per cent right what i loved was myself and i was willing to do anything i goddang had to to go on lying and cheating and drinking whiskey and screwing women and going to church on sunday with all the other respectable people ill tell you something else isaid and it makes a shitpotful more sense than most of the goddam scripture ive read better the blind man uncle john better the blind man who pisses through a window than the prankster who leads him thereto you know who the prankster is uncle john why its goddam near everybody every sonofabitch who turns his head when the crap flies every bastard who sits on his dong with one thumb in his ass and the other in his mouth and hopes that nothing will happen to him every whoremonger who thinks that piss will turn into lemonade every motherlover supposedly made in gods image which makes me think id hate like hell to meet him on a dark night even you particularly you uncle john people who go around sniffing crap with their mouth open and acting surprised as hell when someone kicks a turd in it yeah you cant help bein what you are jus a pore ol black man thats what you say uncle john and do you know what i say i say screw you i say you cant help being what you are and i cant help being what i am and you goddam well know what i am and have to be you goddam well know youve got no friends among the whites you goddam well ought to know that youre not going to have any because you stink uncle john and you go around begging to get screwed and how the hell can anyone have a friend like that i gave him both barrels of the shotgun it danged near cut him in two what i wanted things to look like was that unclejohn had shot tom with his own gun and then tom had got the gun away from him and shot uncle john or vice versa anyways when i got to thinking about it afterward it seemed to me that people werent going to see it that way at all which meant that they were apt to start looking for the real killer and for a spell there i was pretty worried but i didnt need to be as plumb crazy as it was with uncle john getting killed almost two days after tom and with both of em obviously dying almost the instant they was shot it turned out no one thought anything of it they didnt wonder at all about how one dead man couldve killed another of course both bodies were wet and muddied up so you couldnt say offhand just when theyd died and we just aint equipped to do a lot of scientific examination and investigation here in potts county if things look a certain way folks usually figure thats the way they are and if theyd had a mind to kick up a fuss about anyone it wouldnt be tom hauck or uncle john the plain fact was that no one much gave a good goddang about either one of em it was a plain case of good riddance to bad rubbish as far as tom was concerned and who cared about one colored fella more or less unless it was some other colored folks and who cared if they did care but i guess im getting ahead of myself a little i dropped the shotgun between tom and uncle john then leaving johns horse and wagon where they were i plodded back across country to the hauck farm it was pretty late by that time or pretty early i should say an hour or so short of dawn i hitched up without going to the house and headed for town the livery stable door was open the hostler snoring like a buzz saw up in the hayloft a lantern stood burning in a tub of sand casting a flickering light along the row of stalls i put up the horse and buggy without hardly a sound and the hostler went on snoring and i went out into the dark again the dark and the rain there wasnt no one on the street of course even without the rain no one would have been out at that hour i got to the courthouse took off my boots and sneaked upstairs to bed the drywarm felt awful good after them wet clothes and i guess i was plumb wore out because i went to sleep right away instead of tossing around fifteen twenty minutes like i usually do then just about the time my head touched the pillow it seemed like myra started yelling and shaking me nick nick corey you get up from there my goodness do you want to sleep all night and all day too why not i mumbled hanging on to the pillows sounds like a danged good idea i said to get up its almost noon and rose is on the phone i let her get me up and i talked to rose for a minute or two i said i was sorry to hear that tom wasnt home yet and id probably get out and take a look around for him even if i wasnt sure that the sun would stay out and it wouldnt start raining again ill probly do it rose i said so dont you worry none i reckon ill probly start lookin for him today even if it does start raining again and i spoil my clothes like i did last night not to mention catchin an awful cold or if i dont get out today ill sure do it tomorrow i hung up the phone and turned around myra was frowning at me tightmouthed and disgustedlooking she pointed to the table and told me to sit down for pitys sake just eat your breakfast and get out of here start doing your job for a change me i said i do my job all the time you you stupid silly spineless fool you dont do anything well thats my job i said not doing nothing i mean thats why for people elect me she whirled around so fast her skirts spun and went out into the kitchen i sat down at the table i looked at the clock and saw that it was almost twelve oclock practically dinner time so i didnt eat much except some eggs and ham and grits and gravy and seven or eight biscuits and a bitty bowl of peaches and cream i was having a third cup of coffee when myra came back in she began to snatch upthedishes muttering to herself and i asked her if they was something the matter if they is i said you just tell me all about it because two heads is better than one you miserable arent you ever going to get out of here she yelled why are you still sitting at the table why im drinking this here coffee i said you look real close an you can see that i am well well take it with you drink it somewhere else you mean you want me to leave the table i said yes now go on and do it for pitys sake i said i plumb liked to be obliging but if she studied it over shed see it didnt make much sense for me to leave the table i mean its almost time for dinner i said youll be bringin it in any minute now so why for should i leave when i can set right here an be all ready to start eatin yyou her teeth gritted together you get out of here without no dinner i said you mean i got to work all afternoon on an empty stomach but you just got she choked up and sagged down into a chair i said that was fine she should set down and rest herself up a little and it didnt matter at all if dinner was maybe a minute or two late and she said i dont know what she said wejust went on talking back and forth for a while neither of us really listening to the other which didnt bother her any since she never paid any attention to me anyhow and to tell the truth i never actually paid a lot of attention to her anyhow anyways i couldnt have done it today even if id wanted to because i was too worried about what would happen when tom and uncle john were found dead thats why id been pestering myra i guess i didnt want to get out and face up to whatever was going to happen so id start gigging at her that was kind of a habit with me i reckon taking it out on her when i felt bad or bothered more of a habit than i maybe realized where at is lennie i said picking up the conversation again he dont hurry up hell be late for dinner hes had his dinner i mean i fixed him a lunch before he left you mean hes outside when maybe the sun will stop shining pretty soon and itll start raining to beat heck and hell probably spoil his clothes and get himself an awful cold i said now that aint takin very good care of your brother honey myras face began to swell kind of like she was blowing out her cheeks she stared at me her eyes popping and goddang if she didnt sort of tremble all over why for did lennie go out in the daytime anyways i said he cant peek in no windows when its light you myra said pushing herself up from the chair yyou she pointed toward the door her hand shaking like a leaf you get out of here you hear me get out of here you mean you want me to leave i said well you shouldve said so sooner maybe given me a little hint i put on my hat and told her to be sure and call me when dinner was ready she made a wild grab for the sugar bowl and i got on down the stairs pretty fast i sat down in my office i tilted my hat over my eyes and put my boots up on the desk it looked to me like it was a good time to take a little nap because people still werent getting around much on account of the mud but this was one day i just couldnt keep my eyes closed finally i stopped trying there just wasnt much point to it with me so scaredworried i figured the best thing i could do was to get things over with get some fellas together and start the hunt for tom then whatever happened id know what it was at least and i wouldnt have to fret myself anymore i got up and started for the door the phone rang and i went back to answer it and just as i did lennie came busting in he was waving his arms burbling and spitting alltheheck over everything with excitement i waved him to simmer down and spoke into the phone just a minute robert lee lennie just came in and it looks like he wants to tell me somethin never mind i know what he wants to tell you robert leejefferson said and he told me what it was now you better get right down here and take charge i said id do that and i did it was henry clay fanning a farmer who lived a couple miles south of the hauck place whod found the bodies hed been out cutting cordwood at the time and hed just pitched em up on top of his load and brought em on into town didnt waste a minute he said proudly spitting snuff into the mud you reckon the countyll sort of take care o me for my trouble well im not real sure they will henry clay i said noticing how uncle johns head was crushed between the wood and the wagon bed after all you was comin to town anyways but what about that nigger he said a white man ought to get some kind of reeward for handlin a nigger well maybe you will i said if not in this world the next one he went on arguing about it some of the people in the crowd picked up the argument debating it back and forth between themselves they were about evenly divided on the subject one group claiming that henry clay was entitled to a reward and the other saying that a white that was fool enough to bother with a nigger didnt deserve nothing but an asskicking i grabbed hold of a couple of colored fellas and told em to carry uncle johns body back to his folks and they kind of dragged their feet but of course they did it then me and robert lee and one of his clerks carried tom into taylors emporium furniture and undertaking i told robert lee id kind of like his opinion on things and he turned on me looking sickish cant you at least let me wash my hands he snapped are you in such an allfired hurry i cant even do that not me i said i aint in no more hurry than ol tom is and i sure dont see him bein in one do you robert lee kind of hard to tell which is the biggest ol tom or the hole in him we all washed up in the rear of the emporium robert lee looking awful pale and sickish then his clerk went on back to the hardware store me an robert lee following him maybe ten minutes later we couldnt make it any sooner than that because robert lee had to make himself another quick trip and a long visit to the washsink he held himself straight and tightlipped as we left still as pale as a ghost then just as we stepped out the door henry clay fanning latched hold of him that henry clay was a real case what we call a cottonpatch lawyer down here he knew all the privileges he was entitled to and maybe three or four million others besides but he didnt have much sense of his obligations none of his fourteen kids had ever been to school because making kids go to school was interferin with a mans constitutional rights four of his seven girls all of em that were old enough to be were pregnant and he wouldnt allow no one to ask em how theyd got that way because that was his legal responsibility it was a fathers job to care for his childrens morals and he didnt have to tolerate any interference of course everyone had a pretty good idea whod gotten those girls pregnant but under the circumstances there wasnt any way of proving it and with henry clay being kind of meantempered no one talked much about it so here he was now exercisin his rights again grabbing robert lee jefferson by the arm and whirling him around now you see here robert lee he said maybe that doggone nick corey dont know the law but you do and you know goddang well im entitled to a reeward i what robert lee started at him what did you say county pays a reeward for corpses pulled out of the river dont they so why dont i get a bounty for finding these i not only found em i haul em all the way into town an get nigger blood all over my wagon an answer me you incestuous skunk did you address me as robert lee henry clay said sure he called him that and what about it what you mean callin me a robert lee hit him in the mouth henry clay sailed off the sidewalk and landed in the mud on his back his eyes were open but he didnt stir just lay there breathing with a snuffling sound because of his bloody nose and mouth robert lee dusted his hands nodded to me and entered his store i followed him back to his office now i feel better he sighed sinking down in a chair ive been wanting to punch that dirty cur for years and he finally gave me an excuse i said i guessed henry clay didnt really know a lot about law after all if he did hed know that calling you by your first name would be laying a predicate for justifiable assault what he gave me a startled look im not sure understood you nothin i said you sure gave him a punch robert lee wasnt it a beaut i only wish id broken his filthy neck maybe youd better be kind of careful for a while i said henry clay might try to get back at you robert lee snorted he doesnt have the nerve but i wish he did thats one man id enjoy killing imagine him calling me by my first name yeah i said just imagine that now about this other matter tom and uncle john i dont see much point in impaneling a coroners jury in such a clearcut case the facts seem obvious enough dont you agree well it sure is a clearcut case i said i dont know as ive ever seen such a clearcut case of killing exactly and everyone ive talked to has the same opinion of course if rose should insist on an inquest or uncle johns kinfolks oh now robert lee laughed lets not be ridiculous nick i say something funny i said well uh said robert lee sort of clearing his throat perhaps i chose the wrong word i should have said impractical i looked blank and asked just what did he mean anyways he snapped back that i knew very well what he meant no doctor is going to do a post mortem on a negro why you cant get a doctor to touch a live negro let alone a dead one i reckon youre right i said just in case we had to though and im just asking for information do you suppose you could get out a court order tmake a doctor do his duty weel robert lee leaned back and pursed his lips i imagine thats something that one could do de jure but not de facto in other words youd have a paradox the legal right to do something that was factually impossible of accomplishment i said id be goddanged he was sure one heck of a smart man i reckon my heads plumb bustin from all these things you been tellin me robbie lee maybe i better run along before you give me some more information an it pops wide open now youre flattering me he beamed standing up as i did which reminds me that i should compliment you on your conduct in todays affair you handled it very well nick why thank you kindly robert lee i said how does the election look to you by now if you dont mind my asking i think youre a cinch to win in view of the unfortunate talk about sam gaddis just keep on doing your job like you did today oh i will i said ill keep on exactly like that i left the hardware store and sauntered back toward the courthouse stopping now and then to talk to people or rather to let them talk to me almost everyone had about the same idea about the killing as robert lee jefferson almost everyone agreed that it was an open and shut case with uncle john killing tom and then tom dead as he was killing uncle john or vice versa about the only people who didnt see it that way or said they didnt were some loafers they wanted a coroners jury impaneled and they were ready and willin to serve on it but if they were that hard up for a couple of dollars i figured they hadnt paid their poll tax so what they thought didnt matter rose had heard the news from probably two three hundred people by the time i got back to the courthouse and myra said i had get out to the hauck place right away and bring rose into town now please hurry for once in your life nick the poor thing is terribly upset why for is she upset i said you mean because tom is dead of course i mean that what else would i mean well i was just wonderin i said she was terribly upset last night when she thought he might becomin home and now shes terribly upset because she knows he aint dont seem to make much sense somehow now just you never mind myra snapped dont you dare start arguing with me nick corey you just do what i tell you to or you wont make much sense not that you ever did anyway i got the horse and buggy and drove out toward the hauck farm thinking to myself that a fella hardly got one problem settled before he had to take care of another one maybe i should have foreseen that rose would be coming in and staying with myra and me tonight but i hadnt id had too many other things on my mind so now i was supposed to see amy tonight id just better see her if i ever wanted to see her again and i was also supposed to stay at home rose would think it was goddanged peculiar if i didnt and ijust didnt know what the heck i was going to do they were a real problem rose and amy a lot bigger problem than i realized the farm house was all steamy and kind of smelly when rose let me in she apologized for it nodding toward the black dress that was hung up over the stove i had to give it a hurryup dye job honey but the goddam thing ought to be dry pretty soon you want to come into the bedroom and wait i followed her into the bedroom and she started taking off her shoes and stockings which was all she had on i said looky honey maybe we shouldnt do this right now huh she frowned at me why the hell not well you know i said youre just now officially a widow it just dont seem decent to hop in bed with a woman when she aint hardly been a widow an hour what the hells the difference you slept with me before i was a widow well sure i said but everybody does things like that you might say it was even kind of a compliment to a woman but this way when a woman aint been a widow long enough to get her weeds wet it just aint respectful i mean after all theys certain proprieties to observe and a decent fella dont hop right on a brandnew widow any more than a decent brandnew widow lets him she hesitated studying me but finally she nodded well maybe youre right nick christ knows ive always done my goddam best to be respectable in spite of that sonofabitch i was married to why sure you have i said dont i know that rose so well wait until tonight after myra goes to sleep i mean well i said well uh and now i am going to tell you a surprise she gave me a hug eyes dancing it wont be long now before we can forget about myra you can get a divorce from the old bag christ knows youve got plenty of grounds or we can just say to hell with her and leave here because were going to have plenty of money nick plenty whoa whoa now i said what the heck are you sayin honey and she laughed and told me how it was back in the beginning when tom was still sugarin up to her hed taken out a tenthousanddollar insurance policy ten thousand double indemnity after a year or so when being nice got tiresome hed said to hell with the policy and to hell with her but shed kept up the premiums herself paying for them out of her butter and egg money now since tom had been killed instead of dying a natural death shed collect under the doubleindemnity clause a whole twenty thousand dollars isnt it wonderful honey she hugged me again and thats only part of it this is damned good farm land even if that sonofabitch was such a nogood bastard that he never put any improvements on it even at a forced sale it ought to bring ten or twelve thousand dollars and with that much money why now wait a minute i said not so fast honey we cant but we can nick what the hells to stop us you just think about it i said think how it would look to other people your husband gets killed and right away youre a rich woman he gets killed and you profit by it plenty and you tie up with another man before his bodys hardly cold you dont think that folks would wonder about that a little you dont think they might get some alarmin ideas about her and this other man and her husbands death weel rose nodded i suppose youre right nick how long do you think well have to wait before it will be safe id say a year or two anyways i said probly two years would be best rose said she didnt think two years would be best not for her it wasnt one year was going to be a goddamned plenty to wait and she wasnt sure shed even wait that long but we got to my gosh honey i said we cant take no chances right when weve got everything the way we want it that wouldnt make no sense now would it everything isnt the way iwant it not by a hell of a long shot but looky looky honey i said you just agreed that we had to begoddanged careful and now you oh all right rose laughed kind of pouting ill try to be sensible nick but dont you forget ive got my brand on you dont you forget it for a minute why honey i said what a thing to say why for would i want another woman when ive got you i mean it nick i mean every word of it i said sure i knew she did so what was she carryin on about she untensed a little and patted me on the cheek im sorry honey well see each other tonight hmmm you know after myras gone to sleep i dont see no reason why not i said wishing to gosh i could see a reason mmm i can hardly wait she kissed me and jumped up i wonder if that goddam dress is dry yet it was dry probably a heck of a lot dryer than i was what with all the sweating i was doing i thought to myself nick corey how in the good goshdang do you get in these goddang messes you got to be with rose tonight you just dont dare not to be with her and you got to be with amy mason tonight anyway youre sure aching to be with amy even if you dont have to be so but i did have to be i just didnt know it yet myra was waiting for us at the head of the stairs when me and rose arrived and the two of em practically fell into each others arms myra said you poor poor dear and rose said oh what would i ever do without you myra and then they both busted out bawling myra made the most noise of course even though it was more roses place to do it and shed been practising all the way into town there just wasnt no one that could beat myra when it came to noisemaking she started to steer rose into her bedroom her eyes on rose instead of where she was going and she bumped spang into lennie she whirled and gave him a slap that almost made me hurt then she hit him again because he yelled now you shut up she warned him just shut up and behave yourself poor rose has enough trouble without putting up with your racket lennie clenched his teeth to keep from bawling i almost felt kind of sorry for him fact is i felt real sorry for him but right while i was doing it i felt something else because thats the way i am i guess i start feeling sorry for people like rose for example or even myra or uncle john or well lots of folks and the way it eventually works out is itd be a lot better if i hadnt felt sorry for them better for them i mean and i guess thats natural enough you know because when youre sorry for someone you want to help them and when it sinks in on you that you cant that theres too goddanged many of them that everywhere you look theres someone millions of someones and youre only one man an no one else cares an an we were having an oven supper that night which was a good thing since myra was so long in the bedroom with rose finally they came out and i patted rose on the shoulder and told her shed have to be brave she rested her head against my chest for a moment like she just couldnt help herself and i gave her another pat now thats right nick myra said you just take care of rose and ill get supper on ill sure do that i said me an lenniell both take care of her wont we lennie lennie scowled blaming rose naturally because myra had hit him myra gave him a frown and told him hed better watch his step then she went into the kitchen to take up supper it was goddanged good being a company meal rose remembered to bust into tears now and then and say that she just couldnt eat a bite but she couldnt have put away much more without letting out her dress myra filled up our coffee cups and brought in dessert two kinds of pie and a chocolate cake rose had some of each shedding a few tears at intervals to show that she was just forcin herself we finished eating rose got up to help but of course myra wouldnt hear of it no sir no siree you sit right down there on the settee and rest your poor dear self but its not fair to leave you with all the work myra darling rose said i could at least do nothing absolutely nothing myra shooed her away youre going to sit down thats what youre going to do nick you entertain rose while im busy why sure i said nothin id enjoy more than entertainin rose rose had to bite her lip to keep from laughin we went over to the settee and sat down and myra gathered up an armful of dishes and started for the kitchen lennie was lolling on a chair with his eyes closed but i knew they werent closed tight that was a trick of his pretending to be asleep and i guess he must have liked it real well because this was about the umpteenth time hed tried to pull it on me i whispered to rose how about a little kiss honey rose shot a quick look at lennie and the kitchen door and said lets have a big one and we had a big one and lennies eyes and mouth flew open at the same time and he let out a yell myra myra come quick myra there was a heck of a clatter as myra dropped something in the kitchen a stack of dishes it sounded like she ran in scared out of her wits looking like she expected the house to be on fire what what what she said whats going on whats the matter lennie they was huggin and kissin myra lennie pointed at rose and me i seen em huggin and kissin why lennie i said how can you say such a awful thing you was too i seen you now you know that aint so i said you know goddanged good an well what happened just what did happen myra said looking kind of uncertainly from rose to me im im sure there must be a uh mistake but rose started crying again burying her face in her hands she got up saying she was going home because she just couldnt stay another minute in a place where people said such awful things about her myra put out a hand to stop her and said nick will you kindly tell me what this is all about they was huggin and kissin thats what lennie yelled i seen em hush hush lennie nick theck with it i said sounding mad you can believe any goddanged thing you want to i tell you this though this is the last goddanged time i try to comfort anyone when theyre feelin bad but oh said myra you mean that i mean that rose got to feelin real bad again i said she started cryin and i told her to just lean against me until she felt better and i sort of patted her on the shoulder like any decent fella would why goddang it i said i did the same goddang thing a while ago when you were right here in the room and you said that was fine i should take care of her and goddang look how youre actin now please nick myra was all flustered and red i never for a moment thought that uh its all my fault rose said drawing herself up real dignified i guess i cant blame you for thinking such terrible things about me myra but you should have known that id never never do anything to hurt my very best friend but i do know it i never had any such thoughts rose darling myra was practically bawling herself id never doubt you for a moment dear theyre storytellin myra lennie yelled i seen em huggin and kissin myra slapped him she pointed to the door of his room chasing him toward it with a couple more hard slaps now you get in there get right in there and dont let me see you again tonight but i seen myra gave him a crack that practically knocked him off his feet he went stumbling into his bedroom blubbering and spitting and she slammed the door on him im terribly terribly sorry rose darling myra turned back around again i rose you take that hat right back off because youre not moving a step out of here i ththink id better go home rose wept but she didnt sound real determined id be too embarrassed to stay after this but you mustnt be dear theres absolutely no need to be why but she does i cut in an i dont blame her a goddang bit i feel the same way myself why goddang it the way i feel right now i get sort of selfconscious even bein in the same room with rose well why dont you get out of the same room then myra snapped my goodness get out and take a walk or something no sense in you acting the fool just because poor lennie did all right i will get out i said that goddanged lennie starts all the trouble and iget drove out of my own house so dont you be surprised if i dont hurry back ill be pleasantly surprised if you dont im sure neither rose nor i will miss you will we rose well rose bit her lip i hate to feel responsible for now dont you trouble yourself another minute darling you just come out in the kitchen with me and well have a nice cup of coffee rose went with her looking just a wee bit disappointed naturally at the kitchen door she glanced back at me quickly and i shrugged and spread my hands and looked sort of mournful as if to say you know that it was too doggoned bad but it was just one of those things and what could you do about it and she nodded letting me know that she understood i got a pole and fishing line from under my bed i came back out of the bedroom and called to myra asking her if she could pack me up a lunch because i was going fishing and i guess you know what she told me so i left there werent many people on the street that late at night almost nine oclock but practically everybody that was up asked me if i was going fishing i said why no i wasnt and where did they ever get an idea like that well how come youre carryin a fish pole and line then this one fella said how come youre doin that if you aint goin fishin oh i got that to scratch my butt with i said just in case im up a tree somewheres an i cant reach myself from the ground but looky here now he hesitated frowning that dont make no sense how come it dont i said why practically everyone i know does the same thing you mean to say you never took a fishing pole with you to scratch your butt with in case you was up a tree an couldnt reach yourself from the ground why goddang it aint you behind the times he said well sure he always did the same thing himself fact is he was the first fella to think of the idea all i meant was that you shouldnt have no hook an line on it i mean that part dont make sense why shore it does i said thats to pull up the backflap of your drawers after youre through scratchin goddang i said it looks to me like youre really behind the times fella you dont watch out the world will plumb pass you by before you know it he scuffed his feet looking ashamed of himself i went on down the street toward the river i told one fella that no i wasnt going fishing i was going to fasten on to a skyhook and swing myself t the other side of the river i told another fella that no i wasnt going fishing the county was putting a bounty on flying turds and i was going to try to hook onto some in case they cleaned out the crappers when the train went by i told another fella well never mind it dont make no more difference than it made sense i got to the river i waited a while and then i began moving up the bank until i was about on a line with amy masons house then i started cutting back toward town again dodging any house with lights in it and taking cover whenever i could and finally i got to where i was going amy let me in the back door it was dark and she took my hand and led me back to the bedroom she flung off her nightgown there grabbed me and held me for a minute her lips moving over my face she began to whisper wild crazy things sweet wild crazy things and her hands fumbled with my clothes and i thought to myself god danged there just never was no one like amy there just aint no one like her and and i was right she made me know i was then we were lying side by side holding hands breathing together our hearts beating together somehow there was perfume in the air although i knew amy never wore none and somehow you could hear violins playin so sweet and so soft playing a song that never was it was like there wasnt any yesterday like thered been no time before this and i wondered why it should ever be any other way amy i said and she rolled her head to look at me lets get away from this town honey lets us run away together she was silent for a moment seeming to think the idea over then she said i couldnt think very much of her or i wouldnt make such a suggestion youre a married man im afraid you might have a great deal of trouble in getting unmarried what does that make me the woman who runs away with you well looky honey i said this sure aint satisfactory the way were doin now we sure cant go on like this can we do we have a choice her shoulders moved in a shrug now if you had money you dont do you dear no i thought not you might be able to make a settlement with your wife and we could leave town but in the absence of money well uh about that now i cleared my throat i reckon theys a lot of fellas thatd be too proud to accept money from a woman but the way i look at it i dont have it nick popular opinion to the contrary notwithstanding i own a number of income properties and the rentals enable me to live quite well by pottsville standards but theyd bring very little at a sale certainly not enough to support two people for the rest of their lives let alone assuage the wounded feelings of a wife like yours i hardly knew what to say to that maybe well maybe my feelings was kind of hurt because i knew just about as much about the property she owned as she did and i knew she was a lot better off than she pretended she just didnt want to get things squared up and go off with me or just run away with me like any woman should if she was really in love with a fella but it was her money so what the heck could i do about it amy picked up my hand and put it on one of her breasts she squeezed it trying to press it into her flesh but i didnt help her none and finally she pushed it away all right nick she said ill tell you the real reason i wont go away with you i said to never mind i wouldnt want to trouble her none and she snapped for me not to dare to be rude to her dont you dare nicholas corey i love you at least it seems to be love to me and because i do im willing to accept something that i never thought i could accept but dont you be rude to me or i might change i might cease to love a man who i know is a murderer i didnt say anything for quite a spell just lay still where i was wondering where that violin music had gone to and why i couldnt smell the perfume no more finally i said just what are you talking about amy and i was just a little relieved when she told mejust a little because it could have been a lot worse im talking about those two men you killed those well pimps is the word i believe pimps i said what pimps stop it nick my reference is to a certain night when you and i returned to pottsville on the same train yes i know you didnt see me but i was on it i was curious as to why youd be going to the river at that time of night dressed in your very best clothes so i followed you now listen i said you couldntve followed me wherever i went it was doggoned dark that night that it was very dark for you nick for a man whos never been able to see well at night but i dont suffer from that handicap i followed you quite easily and i saw you quite clearly when you killed those two men well at least it was better than her knowing id killed the other two it didnt tie me up with rose in a way that i couldnt very well get out of which amy would have known was the case if she knew id killed tom hauck and which was still the case even if amy didnt know about it for a minute or two i almost wished i was running off with rose and thirty thousand dollars plus and theck with amy but my thinking that was just almost and ididnt even almost it very long rose just naturally took too much out of a fella she was too demandin and possessive and she didnt have much of anything to give him back she was one heck of a lot of woman but when youd said that youd said it all a lot of woman but a goddanged flighty one a woman who was apt to lose her head just when she needed it most like she had with uncle john i rolled over and took amy into my arms she swam up against me for a moment pressing every soft warm inch of herself again me and then she kind of moaned and pulled away why did you do it nick i told you id accepted it and i have but why darling make me understand why i never thought you could kill anyone i never thought i could neither i said and i cant rightly say why did it they were just one more goddang thing i didnt like that i particularly didnt like id been letting them go like i let so many things go and finally i thought well i didnt have to there were a lot of things most things that i couldnt do nothing about but i could do something about them an finally finally i did something amy stared at me a little frown working up on her face i gave her a pat on the bottom and kissed her again ttell the truth honey i went on i really felt like i was doing the right thing for them fellas they werent no good to themselves nor nobody else and they mustve known it like anyone would know a thing like that so i was doing em a pure kindness by fixing it so they wouldnt have to go on livin i see amy said i see and do you also feel youd be doing ken lacey a pure kindness if you kept him from going on living him especially i said a fella that mocks his friends that hurts people just because hes able to hurt em ken lacey i said what do you know about him only one thing nick all i know is that you somehow seem to have arranged things so that sheriff lacey will be blamed for the two murders that you committed i swallowed and said i just didnt know how she figured that it sure aint my fault if ken comes down here an gets drunk and pops off all over town about what a tough fella he is i figure that if a fella wants to get all the glory out of braggin he has to take the blame along with it i dont figure that way nick i wont allow you to do it but booky i said why not amy whats ken to you anyways hes a man who may be falsely convicted of murder but but i just dont understand i said if you dont mind about me killin them two pimps why you havent been listening nick i mind about them very much but i had no way of knowing that you were going to kill them in the case of sheriff lacey i do know your plans and if i allowed you to carry them out id be as guilty as you are but i hesitated what if i just cant help myself amy what if its him or me then id be very sorry nick it would have to be you but that circumstance isnt likely to arise is it theres no way you can be incriminated well no i said i cant think of none offhand for that matter theres a good chance them bodies will never be found well then well goddang it amy itd be a lot better to let things go like i planned i said a whole lot better why if you knew that goddanged ken lacey like i do some of the mean things hes done no nick absolutely no but doggone it no now you looky here amy i said it just dont look to me like youre in any position to be givin orders you got guilty knowledge like they say in the courts you know i killed those fellas an you didnt say nothin about it so if you try to do it later youre incriminatin yourself i know that amy nodded evenly but id still do it nick im sure you know i would but but i did know shed do it even if it got her hanged so there just wasnt anything more to say on the subject i looked at her with her hair spilled out on the pillows and the warmth of her body warming mine and i thought goddang if this aint a heck of a way to be in bed with a pretty woman the two of you arguing about murder and threatening each other when youre supposed to be in love and you could be doing something pretty nice and then i thought well maybe it aint so strange after all maybe its like this with most people everyone doing pretty much the same thing except in a different way and all the time theyre holding heaven in their hands im sorry honey i said o course ill do whatever you want i wouldnt never want to do nothing else and im sorry too darling she brushed my mouth with a kiss and ill do what you want as soon as things here are a little more settled ill go away with you fine thats just fine honey i said i want to very much dear and i will just as soon as we can be sure that there are no loose ends here i said again that that was just fine wondering what i was going to do about a great big loose end like rose hauck then i thought well id just have to face that problem when icame to it and i put everything out of my mind but amy and i reckon she put everything out of her mind but me and it was like it was before only more so it was like nothing that ever was only more so then again we were layin there side by side breathing together hearts beating together and suddenly amy tore her hand out of mine and sat up nick whats that what whats what i looked to the window where she was pointing at the drawn shade with its rim of flickering light then i jumped up and ran to the window and tilted the shade back and i guess i must have groaned out loud goddang i said goddang it to heck anyway nick what is it darling colored town its on fire i guess i should have known it might happen because tom hauck was a white man whatever else you said about him and it looked like a colored fella had killed him so some idjit would get the notion that the niggers got to be taught a lesson and hed spread the word to other idjits and pretty soon thered be trouble i got dressed with amy watchin me worriedly she asked me what i was going to do and i said i didnt know but i was sure going to have to do something because a thing like this a sheriff bein off fishing when trouble broke was just the kind of thing that could lose an election but nick that doesnt matter now does it as long as were going away together when i jerked on my boots you cant name no definite date can you well she bit her lip i see what you mean dear might be a year or two i said but even if it was only six months i better be in office makes it a lot easier to wrap up any of them loose ends you mentioned than it would if i was just an ordinary citizen i finished dressing and she let me out the back door i went back the way id come down to the river then up the river bank and of course i didnt keep my fishing pole with me i came up on the far side of the negro section dirtyin myself with some charcoal from the fire then i mingled in with the crowd beating at the flames with a wet toesack that someone had dropped actually there wasnt a whole lot of damage maybe a total of six or seven burned shacks what with the recent rain and no wind the fire was slow in starting and it didnt have a chance to spread far before it was discovered i started telling some colored folks what to do working right along with them then i stood back for a minute wiping the sweat from my eyes and someone tapped me on the shoulder it was robert lee jefferson and he looked about as stern as id ever seen him goddang aint this something robert lee i said no telling what might have happened if i hadnt been right here johnnyonthespot when the fire broke out come along he said why thanks robert lee i said but i dont rightly think i can this fire the fire is fully under control it was under control long before you got here now come along i climbed into his carriage with him we drove to his store and there were other carriages and buggies and horses tied up outside and there were maybe a half a dozen men waiting on the sidewalk important citizens like mr dinwiddie the bank president and zeke carlton who owned the cotton gin and stonewall jackson smith the school superintendent and samuel houston taylor who owned taylors emporium furniture and undertaking we all went inside we sat down in robert lees office or i should say everybody but me sat down because there just wasnt no place for me to sit zeke carlton started the meeting by slamming his fists down on the desk and asking just what the hell kind of county were we running do you know what can come of a thing like this tonight nick do you know what happens when a bunch of poor helpless niggers get burned out i got a pretty good idea i said all the colored folks get scared and maybe they aint around when it comes cottonpickin time youre tootin well right theyre not scarin them goddam poor niggers could cost us all a pisspot full of money your wife said youd gone fishing tonight robert lee jefferson said at just what point on the river were you when the fire broke out i didnt go fishing i said now corey stonewall jackson smith said firmly i saw you heading toward the river myself with a fishing pole and line id say that was pretty conclusive evidence that you did go fishing well now i just dont think i can agree with you i said i wouldnt say you was wrong but i sure wouldnt say you was right neither oh cut it out nick snapped samuel houston taylor we take tother night now i went on i seen a certain fella crawlin into an empty freight car with a certain high school teacher but i dont think thats conclusive evidence they was shipping themselves somewhere stonewall jackson turned fiery red the others looked at him kind of narroweyed like they was sizing him up for the first time and mr dinwiddie the bank president turned to me he was friendlier than the other fellas hed stayed pretty friendly toward me ever since the time id pulled him out of the privy just where were you and what were you doing there tonight sheriff he said im sure well all be glad to accept your explanation not me by god said zeke carlton i quiet zeke mr dinwiddie motioned to him go on sheriff well well start right at the beginning of tonight i said i figured someone might try to start somethin with the colored folks so i got out a pole an line and pretended togo fishing the river runs right in back of colored town you know an yeah hell we know where it runs samuel houston taylor scowled what we want to know is why you werent there to prevent the fire because i had to make a little detour i said i seen a fella sneakin away from someones house and i thought maybe hed pulled something crooked it looked like something i ought to investigate anyways just to make sure so i went up to this house and i was about to knock when decided it wasnt necessary and it might be kind of embarrassin because i could see this housewife inside and it was plain to see as happy as she looked that there hadnt been no trouble aside from which she didnt have hardly no clothes on it was just a shot in the dark of course sort of a double shot i figured that with this many pottsville citizens involved someone was just about bound to be twotimin his wife or someones wife was twotimin him or else he was goddang suspicious that she was anyways it sure looked like my shot hit home because it was the dangest funniest thing you ever seen the way they acted all of em or most of em i should say glaring at each other and trying to keep their heads ducked at the same time all of em accused and accusing mr dinwiddie started to ask just whose house i was referring to but the others gave him a look that shut him up fast robert lee cleared his throat and said for me to go on with my story we can assume that you eventually reached the river and you were there when the fire started then what happened what were you doing all the time that the rest of us were fighting the blaze i was trying to catch the fellas that started it i said they came crashing down through the underbrush afterward trying to get away and i hollered for em to halt they was under arrest but it didnt do no good they kept on running and i chased em yelling for them to stop or id shoot but i reckon they knew i wouldnt knew i wouldnt dare to because they all got away robert lee wet his lips hesitating did you see who they were nick well lets put it this way i said it dont make much difference whether i know who they were or not as long as i didnt catch em their names aint important and it would just cause hard feelins to say who they was but sheriff mr dinwiddie said i dont see uh he broke off seeing the look that zeke carlton gave him seeing the looks of the others his most important depositors because id fired another shot in the dark and it had hit even closer on target than the first one with a couple of exceptions there wasnt a man there that didnt have a grown or a semigrown son and there wasnt a one of them younguns that was worth the powder itd take to blow their nose they loafed around town puttin up a halfway pretense of working for their daddies whoring and drinking and thinking up meanness any troubles that broke out you could bet that either one of em or all of em was mixed up in it the meeting broke up hardly anyone nodding to me as they left i followed robert lee out to the walk and we stood talking together for a minute im afraid you havent made yourself any friends tonight nick he told me youll really have to buckle down and work from now on if you want to stay in office work i scratched my head what at at your job naturally what else he said and then his eyes shifted as i stared at him all right perhaps you did have to compromise tonight perhaps youll have to again but one or two exceptional cases dont justify your doing nothing at all to enforce the law well ill tell you about that robert lee i said practically every fella that breaks the law has a danged good reason to his own way of thinking which makes every case exceptional not just one or two take you for example a lot of fellas might think you was guilty of assault and battery when you punched henry clay fanning in ill ask you just one question robert lee cut in are you or arent you going to start enforcing the law sure i am i said i sure aint going to do nothing else but good im relieved to hear it yes sir i said im really going to start cracking down anyone that breaks a law from now on is goin to have to deal with me providing o course that hes either colored or some poor white trash that cant pay his poll tax thats a pretty cynical statement nick cynical i said aw now robert lee what for have i got to be cynical about the fire was on late friday night and it was almost dawn saturday before i got home i scrubbed myself up and put on some clean clothes then i went out into the kitchen and started to fix breakfast myra came out fuming and fussing asking me what in the world i was up to i told her about the fire and how people were criticizin me and she shut up fast because she didnt want to be an exsheriffs wife any more than i wanted to be an exsheriff and she knew i was going to have to do some humpin or we might be she finished cooking breakfast for me i ate and went downtown it being saturday all the stores were open extra early and any farmers that werent already in town were on their way in they stood around on the sidewalks their black cloth hats brushed and cleanlooking their sunday shirts fairly clean and their overalls ranging from middlingdirty to downright filthy their wives wore starchedstiff sunbonnets and mother hubbards made out of calico or gingham their kids clothes except the kids that were old enough for handmedowns were made out of meal sacks with the faded labels still showing on some of em men and women and practically every boy and girl over twelve were chewing and spitting snuff the men and boys poured the snuff down inside their lower lip the women and girls used snuffsticks frayed twigs that they dipped in their snuff cans and then put in the corners of their mouths i moved around among the men shakin hands and slapping backs and telling em tojust come and see me any time they had a problem i told all the women that myra had been askin about em and that they just had to come and see her sometime and i patted the kids on the head if their heads werent too high up and gave them pennies and nickels depending on how tall they were naturally i was busy with the townspeople too doing my dangdest to make friends or to get back any id lost but i couldnt be sure i did any better with them than i did with the farmers and i couldnt be sure i did any good with the farmers oh almost everyone was pleasant and no one was what youd call downright unfriendly but too many of em were cautious kind of cagey when i hinted around at the subject of voting and if theres one thing i know its this a fella thats going to vote for you dont lose much time in declaring himself i tried to run a tally in my mind and it looked to me like the best i could hope for was a neardraw with sam gaddis that was the best despite all the dirty talk that was going on about him and if he was that strong now in spite of the talk how could i be sure he wouldnt be even stronger in the runoff i ate some crackers and cheese for lunch passing them around amongst the fellas i was talking to about two oclock i had to go out to the cemetery for tom haucks buryin but a passel of other folks went too by way of amusin themselves so you couldnt really say it was a waste of time i worked through the supper hour eating some crackers and sardines and passing them around amongest the fellas i was talking to finally it got too late to work any longer but by then i was so keyed up from talking so restless and highstrung that my nerves seemed to be standing on end so instead of going home i sneaked over to amy masons house we went back into the bedroom she held me off for a minute kind of cold and peevishactinand then she seemed to change her mood suddenly and we went to bed it happened pretty fast considering how wore out i was but afterwards my eyes drifted shut and i seemed to sink down into a deep dark pit and wake up amy was shaking me wake up i said i said huh whassa matter honey and amy said again that i was to wake up is that how little i mean to you that you can fall asleep like a hog in a wallow with my arms around you or were you saving yourself for your precious rose hauck huh what i said for gosh sake amy rose is staying at your place is she not well sure i said but just on account of her husbands death and buryin she and why didnt you tell me she was staying there why did i have to find it out for myself but looky i said why the heck should i tell you whats it got to do with us anyways you already knew all about me an rose an it didnt seem to bother you none she stared at me her eyes sparkling with anger and suddenly turned her back to me then just as i was about to put my arm around her she turned and faced me again just what do i already know about you and rose tell me aw now honey i said i answer mejust what do i know about you want to know i said id just made a slip of the tongue and there wasnt anything to tell her about rose and me because of course she didnt want to know about us no woman that sleeps with a man wants to know that another woman is doin it too i was just referrin to the other night i said you know when you was teasin me about rose and i told you there wasnt nothing between us thats all i meant when i said you already knew all about us well she was anxious to believe me youre sure o course im sure i said why my gosh aint we the same as engaged to get married aint we goin togo away together just as soon as we figure out what to do about my wife an were sure there am t any kickbacks from them two pimps i killed thats right aint itso why would i be fooling around with another woman she smiled her lips kind of trembly she kissed me and snuggled up in my arms nick dont see her anymore after shes gone home i mean well i sure dont want to i said i sure dont aim to anyways i sure wont see her amy unless i just cant noways get out of it yes and just what is that supposed to mean i mean shes myras friend i said even before tom got himself killed myra was always after me to give rose some help an i felt sorry for her so i usually did so itll look awful funny if i stop all of a sudden without even waitin until she can hire a farm hand amy was silent for a moment thinking things over then her head moved in a little nod all right nick i suppose you will have to see her one more time well im not sure thatll be enough i said i mean it probly will but one more time nick just to tell her that shed better employ some help because you wont be seeing her again no she put her hand over my mouth as i started to speak thats it nickjust once more and never again if you want me that is if you want to keep me from being very very angry with you i said all right thats the way it would be there just wasnt much else i could say but what i was thinking was that rose was going to have something to say about this and i could get in just as much trouble by not heeding her as i could amy amy just wasnt giving me a chance goddang it i was just as anxious to be shet of rose as she was to have me but it would take time and if i didnt have the time if i could only see rose once more nick darling im still here i said yeah danged if you aint and i hugged her close and kissed and petted her putting a lot of enthusiasm into it but i tell you frankly i didnt feel much and it wasnt just because i was so tired i could hardly lift a finger id been almost on the point of hitting on a plan something that would not only take care of rose without me seeing her more than once but would take care of myra and lennie at the same time and then amy had spoke up and the pieces of a plan had scattered every which way and i knew i was going to have a heck of a time putting em together again if i ever was able to nick she was beginning to sound cross again youre not going to sleep again are you me i said me go to sleep around a pretty thing like you now what do you think she let me out the door so drowsy herself she could barely keep her eyes open i sneaked back across town and believe me sneakin is the word because i was plumb wrung dry an there wasnt enough juice left in me to wet a whistle i got to the courthouse and slipped off my boots at the foot of the stairs i sneaked up the stairs and got to my room and got out of my clothes then i slid into bed careful as i could to keep the springs from squeaking and i sighed and thought oh lord how long goddang it one cross is bad enough but i hadnt ought to carry a whole goddang lumberyard around with me rose grabbed me she swarmed all over me and it was like her body was on fire goddam what the hell took you so long nick i tried to keep from groaning i said look rose we cant do this honey its already sunday morning crap on sunday morning she said who gives a damn what day it is but but this aint nice i said it just aint nice to fornicate on sunday morning now you just think about it an youll see im right rose said she didnt want to think about it she just wanted to do it come on dammit she panted come on ill show you whether its nice or not well i just couldnt you know at least ithought i couldnt and i guess the only way i managed to was because the good lord gave me strength he seen i was in a heck of a spot like he naturally would because if hed noticed something like a sparrow fallin hed just about have to see the predicament i was in so he gave me strength i reckon which an i dont mean to sound ungrateful was about the least he could do rose went to church with myra and me lennie staying at home because he didnt always behave too well in crowds after the services rose and myra went on home to get dinner ready and i hung around to do a little handshakin and babypattin and backslappin sam gaddis was doing the same thing a grayhaired middleaged fella with a dignified look about him the minister had given him a kind of indirect boost in his sermon which was about casting stones and judge not lest ye be judged and now he seemed to be getting a better reception than i was people would turn their heads to look at him while they were shaking hands with me id slap em on the back and theyd sort of take it as a shove toward sam and there was one woman that yanked her baby away just as i was about to kiss it so that i danged near kissed my own belt buckle it looked to me like a case of if you cant lick em join em so i eased my way through the crowd and grabbed sam by the hand i want you to know im a thousand per cent behind you sam i said all these dirty stories going around about you i know they aint true sam even if it sounds like they are so you got my moral support a thousand per cent and im goin to be right up on the speakers platform with you tonight to prove it he said well uh and cleared his throat awkwardly he said well uh thats certainly very nice of you sheriff but uh uh what he wanted to say was that he didnt want me within a thousand miles of him let alone on the same speakers platform but the kind of fella he was he didnt know how to say it well uh now he tried again i surely appreciate your offer sheriff but wouldnt it be better if uh i slapped him on the back cutting him off i said by golly i was going to do it and he didnt need to worry about takin favors from me because i wasnt really doin him one i figure its just the right thing to do i said you might say its something i got to do so come tonight im goin to be up there on the platform with oof zeke carlton shoved past me digging his elbow into my ribs he dropped an arm around sams shoulders and jerked his head at me ill say it for you sam you dont want nick around you because hes a sneaky half assed triflin nogood excuse for a sheriff and youd be hurt just by bein seen with him even if he didnt stick a knife in your ribs sam cleared his throat again looking more uncomfortable than ever zeke glared at me like he wanted to spit in my face i said well now zeke that aint hardly no way to talk here it is sunday and were still here on the church grounds and goddang if you aint calling me names and using bad words like halfassed balls he sneered who the hell are you to be correctin me why im the sheriff i said an its my job to look out for wrongdoin particularly seem that the lord aint abused right in his own front yard so you just better not do it no more zeke or ill bygolly march you right down to the lockup zeke let out an angry snort laughed on a shaky note he looked around at the crowd trying to swing them to his side but were a real godfearin community like you probably gathered and everyone was frowning at him or givin him frosty looks that made him madder than ever why god da goshdarn it dont you see what hes trying to do hes trying to get at sam through me he knows im backing sam so he wants to make trouble for me now that just aint so i said you know it aint so zeke the hell the heck it aint i said no sir it sure wasnt and he knew it as well as i did i leave it to anyone here i said if they ever knew me to do a man dirty or even say so much as an unkind word about another fella as long as theyve lived just ask anyone ill leave it up to them zeke scowled and muttered something under his breath cuss words it sounded like i asked sam if he thought i was out to harm him and he scuffled his feet and looked embarrassed well uh im sure you wouldnt uh do so uh right i said i wouldnt in the first place it just aint my nature to hurt another fella an in the second place i know it wouldnt do no good because i figure you cant be hurt sam the way i see it youre as good as elected right now sams head snapped up he kind of waved his hands helplesslike like he didnt know whether to pee or go blind and if he was surprised he sure had plenty of company everyone was staring at me their eyes popped open even zeke carlton was struck dumb for a moment now see here nick he spoke up at last now lets get this straight are you saying that youre concedin the election to sam im saying that im going to i said raising my voice im concedin to sam just as soon as he answers one question zeke asked what kind of question i said a very simple question stalling a minute to get as big a crowd as i could a very simple question i repeated one thats already on everyones lips you might say and that sam would have to answer sooner or later well come on zeke scowled impatiently ask it sam dont mind answering questions do you sam sams life is an open book how about that sam i said id like to hear you speak for youself sam said well uh yes i mean ill be glad to answer your question uh anything i can that is well this is about them dirty stories people are tellin on you i said now wait a minute wait a minute zeke sam held up my hand know them stories aint true i know sam wouldnt rape a little colored baby or steal the gold teeth out of his grandmas mouth or beat his pappy to death with a stick of cordwood or rob a widder woman of her lifes savings or feed his wife to the hawgs i know a fine fella like sam wouldnt do nothing like that so all im asking is this this is my question i paused again gettin everyone on their toes i waited until you could have heard a weevil crapping on a cotton boll and then i asked my question all right i said here it is if them stories aint true how come them to get started how come almost everybody claims they are true sam blinked he opened his mouth and then he closed it again and he and zeke looked at each other well uh sam began i uh i now hold up there zeke butted in turning to me what do you mean everybodys saying theyre true who the hells everybody i stand corrected i said i reckon everybody aint saying it when you get right down to cases probly aint no more than two three hundred people that are sayin it but that still leaves the same question how come even two three hundred people are sayin it is true that sam raped a little colored baby an beat his pappy to death an fed his wife to the hawgs an never mind dammit zeke grabbed sam by the arm come on sam you dont have to answer no damnfool question like that well of course he dont have to i said but i should think hed want to dont rightly see how he can get elected sheriff if he dont answer zeke hesitated scowling he shot a glance at sam then gave him a nudge all right sam maybe youd better answer uh well of course sam nodded uh what was the question again sheriff i started to tell him but someone behind me interrupted you know the question sam howd them stories about you get started how come folks say theyre true if they aint there was a loud murmur of agreement with people nodding and nudging each other sam cleared his throat to speak and there was another interruption a catcall from the outskirts of the crowd how about that nigger baby sam the crowd looked at each other embarrassed snickering or outright guffawing all at once there were catcalls from half a dozen different directions wheres them gold teeth sam and did you just screw that widder for her money sam and whatd you do with them hawgs you fed your wife to and so on until everything was in an uproar of shouts and laughter and bootstampings i let it go on for two three minutes letting these here good christians work themselves up to the proper pitch then i held up my arms and called for quiet and finally i got it but it was restless you know the kind of quiet you get just before a storm now sam i said facing around to him again you reckon you fully understand the question or do you want me to repeat it uh well ill repeat it i said an you listen closely now sam if you didnt rape any little defenseless colored babies or beat your poor ol pappy to death or feed your sweet trusting wife that youd sworn to protect and cherish to the hawgs or if you didnt do none of them dirty lowdown things that make me sick to my stomach to think about how come so many folks say you did or puttin it briefly sam how come folks say that you done things that would outstink a skunk and that youre lower down than a pukeeating dawg if it aint true or puttin it still another way are you sayin that youre telling the truth an that everyone else is a dirty nogood liar zeke canton hollered now wait a minute thats not but he was hollered down before he could say anything more everyone was yelling for sam to answer to let him do his own talking i held up my hands again well sam whats the answer i said were all waitin to hear it well sam wet his lips well uh yeah i said just speak right up sam why are people sayin those stories are true if they aint well sam didnt have an answer you could almost smell him sweatin blood to think of one but he just couldnt which wasnt no surprise to me of course because how could anyone answer a question like that sam kept trying though he was on maybe about his sixteenth try when someone flung a prayer book hitting him spang in the mouth and that was kind of like a signal like the first crack of lightning in a storm because the air was suddenly full of prayer books and hymnals and everyone was shouting and cussing and trying to get their hands on sam and all at once he disappeared like hed been dropped through a trap door i sauntered on home i thought well it was just as well that iwouldnt be on the speakers platform tonight at sams meeting because sam wouldnt be there neither because there wouldnt be no meeting because sam wouldnt be a candidate no more i thought well that was at least one nail out of my cross and maybe if i kept on being upright and godfearin and never hurting no one unless it was for their good or mine which was pretty much the same thing why then maybe all my other problems would get straightened out as easy as this one had we ate sunday dinner rose and myra and lennie and me rose was supposed togo home that afternoon and i said id sure be proud to take her as soon as id rested myself a little but naturally i didnt take her i couldnt you know since i could only see her one more time just once to do something about her and that plan had come back to me again the plan for doing something about her and lennie and myra at the same time but it wasnt something that i could pull off on sunday afternoon or any afternoon it had to be at night and anyways i had to study some more about it myra called to me after about an hour then she came into my bedroom and called some more shaking me until the whole bed almost fell apart and of course it didnt do no good at all finally she gave up and went back out into the other room and i heard her apologizing to rose i simply cant wake him up dear hes just dead to the world not that its any wonder i suppose considering how much sleep hes lost rose said yes it wasnt any wonder was it her voice kind of flat well i really hadnt planned on staying over tonight but and you dont have to myra declared ill just take lennie and drive you home myself now thats not necessary rose said quickly i dont mind and i dont mind taking you i really dont darling so you just get yourself ready lennie go wash your face and well be on our way well said rose well all right myra dear they left a few minutes later i yawned and stretched and turned over on my side all set to go to sleep for real i started to doze just started to and i heard someone coming up the stairs it was a man judging by the footsteps i started to turn back on my side again thinking well theck with him its sunday afternoon an im entitled to a little rest but you just cant ignore no one when youre sheriff sunday or whatever day it is so flung my feet over the side of the bed and got up i went out into the living room and flung open the hall door just as he was about to knock on it he was a citydressed fella tall and thin with a nose like a fishhook and a mouth about as big as a beesass sheriff corey he flashed an identification card at me im barnes the talkington detective agency he smiled his beesass mouth stretching enough to show one tooth and it was like getting a glimpse of an egg coming out of a pullet pigeon i said i was plumb proud to meet him so youre with the talkington agency i said why goddang if i aint heard a lot about you people lets see now you broke up that big railroad strike didnt you thats right he showed me the tooth again the railroad strike was one of our jobs now by golly that really took nerve i said them railroad workers throwin chunks of coal at you an splashin you with water and you fellas without nothin to defend yourself with except shotguns an automatic rifles yes sir goddang it i really got to hand it to you now just a moment sheriff his mouth came together like a buttonhole we have never and them lowdown garment workers i said goddang you really took care of them didnt you people that threw away them big threedollaraweek wages on wild livin and then fussed because they had to eat garbage to stay alive i mean what the heck they was all foreigners wasnt they and if they didnt like the good ol american garbage why didnt they go back where they came from sheriff sheriff corey yeah i said you got something on your mind mr barnes certainly i have something on my mind why else would i have come here now you mean you just didnt drop in for a little chat i said just to maybe show me your medals for shootin people in the back an im here to inquire about a former resident of pottsville a man named cameron tramell never heard of him i said goodbye i started to close the door barnes held it open youve heard of him he said he was known locally as curly and he was a pimp i said oh i said oh yeah sure id heard of curly aint seen him for a spell come to think of it hows he getting along anyways now sheriff he grinned at me with his eyes lets not spar with each other spar what do you mean i said i mean cameron trammel alias curly is dead as you well know and you also know who killed him i had him come in and we sat in the living room while he explained about curly it seemed that both bodies had been washed up mooses as well as curlys but no one was interested in moose whereas they were plenty interested in curly and the people that was interested in him was his own family one of the best families in the south they knew he was no good naturally in fact theyd paid him to stay away from em but still he was family still part of em and they meant to see to it that his murderer was hanged so here i am sheriff barnes forced a smile perhaps we didnt see eye to eye on everything but well im not a man to hold a grudge and im sure neither of us wants to see a murderer running loose i know i sure dont i said if i see any murderer runnin around loose ill arrest em and throw em in jail exactly so if youll tell me the name of the man who killed curly me i said i dont know who killed him if i did id arrest him an put sheriff you do know who killed him youve admitted it not me i said you said that i knew not me his mouth pinched together again and his eyes along with it with that fishhook nose his face looked like three clods on a sandbank with a plough cutting through them approximately one week ago on the morning after curly was killed now how do you know it was the morning after i said aint no one can say that unless it was the fella that killed him i know this sheriff i know that your friend sheriff ken lacey openly boasted on the streets of this town that he had taken care of moose and curly meaning he had killed them and you were with him at the time of this boasting this claim that he had murdered those two men and you gave your hearty approval to it oh yeah i laughed now remember that was a little joke of kens an mine had ourselves a peck of fun with it now sheriff you think it wasnt i said you think that a fella whod killed two men would walk around the streets braggin about it and that i an officer of the law would just pat him on the back for it never mind what i think sheriff the events i have described did take place and on the night previous to them the only night sheriff lacey spent in pottsville he stayed at the river whorehouse and he there boasted to the inmates of the house that he had fixed moose and curly good and that he had taken care of them good and so on in other words there is incontrovertible evidence that approximately one week before moose and curly were found dead on the only night sheriff lacey spent in pottsville he did declare himself to be the murderer of the aforesaid moose and curly uhhah i said making myself sound real interested now this incontrowatchmacallit evidence you speak about would that be the unsupported word of these whorehouse gals its not unsupported dammit theres sheriff laceys bragging the following morning and but he was just jokin mr barnes i put him up to it barnes head snapped back them little old eyes of his glaring at me then he darted it forward again like he was going to hook me with his nose now you listen to me corey listen to me good i dont intend to to he broke off suddenly shook himself like a horse shaking off flies then his face twisted and screwed up and unscrewed and goddang if he didnt smile please excuse me sheriff corey ive had a rather trying day im afraid i lost track of the fact for a moment that were both equally sincere and intent in our desire for justice even though we may not act and think alike i nodded and said that i guessed he was right all right he beamed and went on now youve known sheriff lacey for years hes a good friend of yours you naturally feel that you have to protect him uhuh i said he aint a friend of mine and if there was any way i could pin them two murders on him id be plain proud to do it but sheriff he was a friend of mine i said he stopped bein one even before that night he came down here an rousted me out of bed and got me to point out the way to the whorehouse to him then he did go there barnes rubbed his hands together you can testify of your own knowledge that he did go to the whorehouse on the night in question why sure i can i said its the plain truth so why couldnt i testify to it but thats wonderful wonderful sheriff and did lacey tell you why he wanted to go to the no wait a minute did he say anything that would indicate that he was going to the whorehouse for the purpose of killing moose and curly you mean then that night i shook my head no he didnt say anything then but he did at some other time when that day i said when i was over to his county on a visit he said that pimps was one thing he just didnt have no use for and that he believed in killin em on general principles barnes jumped up and began pacing around the room he said that what id told him was wonderful wonderful and it was just what he needed then stopped in front of me an shook his finger sort of playful youre quite a tease sheriff almost made me lose my temper and im a man who prides himself on selfcontrol you had this vital information all along and yet you appeared to be defending lacey i said that well that was the way was a real card he glanced at his watch and asked me what time he could get a train into the city oh you got lots of time i said bettern a couple of hours best thing you can do is stay an have supper with us why why thats very kind of you sheriff very kind i got some whiskey out of the office and we had ourselves a few drinks he started talking about himself him and the detective agency me throwing in a word now and then by way of heading him on and his voice began to get kind of bitter it seemed like he hated what he was doing he knew exactly what talkington was and he couldnt make no excuses for it it was a downright hateful outfit and he was part of its hateful doings and he hated himself because he was you probably know what i mean sheriff even a man in your job has to chose his eyes to some very bad things youre right about that i said i have to close em if i want to stay on bein sheriff and do you want to youve never thought of taking up another line of work not for very hong i said what else would a fehha hike me do anyways exacthy his eyes lit up and they began to hook a hot bigger what else can you do what else can i do but nick excuse me for being familiar my names george sheriff ghad to know you george i nodded an you go right on calling me nick thank you nick he took another drink of whiskey now heres what i was going to ask nick and its something ive worried about a great deah does the fact that we cant do anything ehse does that excuse us well i said do you excuse a post for fittin a hole maybe theres a nest of rabbits down in that hole and the post will crush em but is that the posts fault for filhin a gap it was made to fit but thats not a fair analogy nick youre talking about inanimate objects yeah i said so aint we ahh rehatively inanimate george just how much free wilh does any of us exercise we got controhs ahh ahong the line our physical makeup our mentah makeup our backgrounds theyre ahl shapin usa certain way fixin us up for a certain role in life and george we better play that role or fihh that hole or any goddang way you want to put it or alh hell is going to tumble out of the heavens and fahh right down on top of us we better do what we were made to do or well find it being done to us you mean its a case of kill or be killed barnes shook his head i hate to think that nick maybe thats not what mean said maybe im not sure what i mean i guess mostly what i mean is that there cant be no personah hell because there aint no personal sins theyre all public george we all share in the other fellas and the other feihas all share in ours or maybe i mean this george that im the savior himself christ on the cross come right here to potts county because god knows i was needed here an im goin around doing kindly deeds so that people wihh know they got nothing to fear and if theyre worried about hehi they dont have todigfor it and by god that makes sense dont it george i mean obligation aint ahh on the side of the fehha that accepts it nor responsibility neither i mean well which is worse george the fehha that craps on a doorknob or the one that rings the doorbell george threw back his head and roared with laughter thats priceless nick priceless well it aint exactly original i said like the poem says you cant fault a jug for bein twisted because the hand of the potter shipped so you tell me which is worse the one that messes up the doorknob or the one that rings the belhand ill tell you which got twisted and who done the twisting but but suppose the same person does both it aint likely i said as a fella thats had to deah with plenty of high jinks and goddang if i dont feel im hiving in a jokers paradise sometimes i can say that these little chores is usually divided up but if that wasnt the case george then weve opened up another field of obligation and responsibility because this felha had to eat before he could crap didnt he and where did the food come from we went on tahking and drinking until myra came home she fixed dinner for george and me she an lennie having already eaten at roses place george was real courtly to myra goddang if she didnt hook almost pretty the way he shined up to her and goddang if he didnt look almost handsome because he done it then we finished eating and i walked george toward the railroad station and things werent so nice any more we were friendly but it was just one of those havetobe things there wasnt no real warmth or hiking in it i reckon thats the bad part of whiskey you know the bad part about a hot of things not the indulging of em but the not being able to indulge the afterwards when the oh familiar taste of piss is back in your mouth and you want to spit it out at everyone and you think goddang why for did i want to be nice to that fella and i bet he thought i was a goddanged fool george was hooking kind of ghum and letdown kind of frowny and thoughtful then amy mason crossed to our side of the street and i introduced her and george perked himself up again you have a fine sheriff here he said chapping me on the back a very fine officer miss mason hes helped me solve a very important case indeed said amy what kind of case mr barnes and george told her adding on that he just wouldnt have had a case against ken if it hadnt been for me im sure it wasnt an easy thing for him to do either he said its never easy for one officer to incriminate another even if they are not friends how true amy said and im sure it will become even hess easy as time goes on by the way sheriff wilh you stop by my house this evening i think ive seen a prowler around i said id be tickled to death to stop by and she mustnt feel like she had to set out no coffee or cake or nothing because i wouldnt want her troubled she said she wouldnt be troubled at all sort of tossing her head at me then she went on and george barnes and i went on toward the station way up river the train was whistling for the crossing george shook my hand and gave me a beesass smile and thanked me again for my help by the way nick its just a matter of form of course but youll be receiving a subpoena within the next day or so a subpoena i said why for will i be receiving one of those as a prosecution witness against ken lacey naturally the chief prosecution witness i should say wed certainly never get a conviction without you but what am i going to testify against him about i said whats old ken supposed to have went and done whats he supposed to have done george stared at me why what are you trying to puhh anyway you know what hes done well now i reckon i forgot i said maybe you wouldnt mind tellin me again now you see here he grabbed me by the shoulders teeth gritted dont you go dumb on me corey if you want money all right but im really plumb puzzled george i eased out of his grip why for would i want money for stating under oath what youve already told me privatehy that ken lacey murdered cameron tramehi alias curly huh i said now wait a minute george i didnt tell you nothin hike that oh yes you did you certainly did tell me that in so many words you told me well maybe you got that impression said but never mind about that never mind what i told you the important thing i reckon is what i didnt tell you and what was that this i said the morning after ken lacey left i saw moose an curly alive it was sunday morning earlyearly sunday morning way off somewhere in the country i could hear a rooster crowing but i figured he was probably just dumb or doing it for exercise because it was at least an hour before dawn yes sir it was plumb quiet and not a creature was stirring you might say except for me shifting my buttocks a little on the bed now and then sos i would stay comfortable and except for rose she was out in the kitchen it sounded like fixing herself a cup of coffee then there was a clatteryclash and i reckoned she must have thrown the cup against the wall and then i heard a mumbled string of words that had to be curses i yawned and stretched i sure was needing some sleep but i guess im always in need of sheep like im always in need of food because my labors were mighty ones oh hercules didnt know what hard work was and what is there to do but eat and sleep and when youre eatin and sleepin you dont have to fret about things that you cant do nothing about and what else is there to do but laugh an joke how else can you bear up under the unbearable it was a cinch that cryin didnt do no good id tried that before in my agony id cried out as loud as a fella could cry an it hadnt done no good at all i yawned and stretched again sunday in pottsville i thought sunday in pottsvilhe an my sweetheart is going to leave me and i hope it dont grieve me my eyes plumb deceive me an no onehh believe me and i thought goddang it nick if you didnt already have your work cut out for you you could be a poet the poet laureate of potts county by dang and you could make up poems about piss tinkling in pots and jaybirds with the bots and assholes tying knots and rose came in and stood beside my bed she looked down at me biting her lip her face twisted like a handful of clay that a baby has played with i just want to tell you one thing nick corey she said and dont think youre not getting off lucky because id be doing a hot more than talk to you if i could id see you swinging by your neck you dirty bastard id tell about you killing tom and goddam you id laugh my head off when they strung you up an an i thought you werejust going to tell me one thing i said seems to me like thats about a dozen screw you im not going to tell you what i was going to say because im a decent woman but if i wasnt you know what id say you know what id do to you you rotten sonofabitch id heist a leg and pee in your ear until it washed out that stinking pile of crap you call brains now you just watch out now rose i said you just better watch out or youll be saying something dirty she started bawling and stumbled back out of the room i heard her as she dropped down on the lounge bawling and sniffling and after a while she began to mumble to herself wondering out loud how anyone meaning me could do such a terrible thing and what could i have said except that it wasnt easy it sure wasnt easy and how could i explain what i didnt really understand myself well but this is what had happened after id taken george barnes to the station last sunday i stopped by amy masons house i knew id better explain that id just been kidding in front of barnes that i didnt have no intention of letting ken lacey get blamed for killing those pimps but the way she hopped on me the minute i showed up i hardly had a chance to say anything i warned you nick she blazed at me i warned you not to do it now youll have to bear the consequences now wait a minute honey i said what im going to send a telegram to the governor thats what right tonight im going to tell him who actually did kill those two uh men but amy i didnt im sorry nick youll never know how sorry i am but im going to do it i cant allow you to commit a murder and framing sheriff lacey would be murder that know about in advance i finally managed to make her listen to me to tell her that i wasnt even halfway planning to frame ken it was just a joke see i was just leadin barnes on for a good hard letdown yes she looked at me sharply youre sure about that sure im sure you should have seen his face when i told him id seen them pimps alive the day after ken was down there well she was still sort of suspicious still not quite convinced that i didnt have some scheme for framing ken without getting myself in trouble finally i got kind of impatient and i said i wasnt really flattered to have her doubtin my word when she didnt have no reason to im sorry she smiled and pecked me on the cheek i believe you dear and ill tell you something else if i hated sheriff lacey like you do id probably want to kill him too hate i said what makes you think hate him now darling it sticks out all over you what did he ever do to you to make you feel that way about him but i dont i said i mean i dont hate him i mean it aint what i feel about him that matters its what he is you know the things hes done to others i well its kind of hard to explain but but never mind dear she laughed and kissed me again youre not going to do anything to him and thats all that matters but it wasnt all you know not by a long shot idve sworn that i never held no malice toward no one never a speck of hatred or if lever had felt sort of a teensy twinge of dislike it hadnt been the motivatin factor in whatever id done thats the way i felt about myself anyways until amyd said what shed said and now i was kind of worried i could put ken lacey out of my mind since wasnt going to take any action against him but the others well they were all part of the same pattern werent they and if id been showing spite toward ken then maybe id been doing the same thing with them and maybe in the case of what i was about to do the people i was about to take care of but it had to be done i reckoned it had to be and i didnt have no choice in the matter i was willing to let things ride im long sufferin you might say but they wouldnt have it that way rose was callin myra every day hinting that she needed me to do this or that for her and myra kept naggin at me togo out and do what rose wanted done and amy was insistin that i couldnt see rose but one more time no more or else and lennie had taken one of his spells of tagging after me and spying on me and and finally it was saturday night last night and i couldnt hold out no longer they were all asking for it and like the good book says ask and ye shall receive it was about eight in the evening about an hour after sunset i came running down the cotton rows halfstooped which didnt conceal me much because it was a low stand of cotton in the dusk just about anyone nearby could see me and they didnt even have to be too nearby and that was the way i wanted it lennie didnt like to walk ordinarily hed never go outside the town limits it had really been a job to act sneaky and creepy enough to tote him way out here to roses place i came out of the cotton and made a dash toward the house out of the corner of my eye i could see lennie rising up in the field gawking openly as i reached the house and pounded on the door he really thought he had me now lennie did he had me and rose hed caught me sneaking into her house at night so pretty soon now he was going to do some peeking and then hed go back to town with a fine story to tell myra a real juicy story about her own husband and her best friend that was just the way i wanted it that was the way id planned it lennie was going to get a story for myra all right but it would be a lot nastier than he figured on nick rose opened the door what where have you been anyway why didnt you come out last later i squeezed inside and closed the door i kissed her keeping her mouth closed until i knew she was ready to listen i couldnt come any sooner honey because i been workin on a plan its a way to get rid of myra and lennie and ive already taken the first step an now im goin to need your help so here am askin for it you dont want togive it you just say so and well just forget all about gettin rid of em and go on like we been doin but by what she was willing but confused puzzled id talked fast acting excited and running my words together and i had her nodding even while she was frowning and wondering what the heck it was all about well forget it i said turning toward the door just forget i asked rose an im sorry i troubled you no wait wait honey she grabbed onto me i just wondered what why but ill do it honey you just tell me what it is i want you to wait a couple of minutes i said then i want you to go outside and grab lennie an lennie she let out a frightened gasp ddid he he followed me out here i egged him into doin it because thats part of the plan so you grab him and haul him inside and then you tell him what i tell you to i told her what to say the gist of it that is she turned pale hookin at me like id gone out of my mind nnick thats thats crazy i couldnt sure its crazy i said its got to be crazy dont you see but oh she said and her eyes narrowed a little yeah i can see how it might but nick honey what about the rest how does there aint time to tell you now i said you just go on an take care of lennie an ill explain everything afterwards i turned and went into the bedroom seeming to take it for granted you know that shed do what i told her to she stayed where she was for a moment fidgeting uncertainly frowning and maybe a little frightened she took a step toward the bedroom on the point it looked like of calling out to me then she suddenly faced back around crossed to the door and went outside dimly i heard running sounds the fast scuffle of footsteps on the hardpacked clay of the yard i heard a holler as she grabbed hold of lennie and i heard him burbling and giggling as she dragged him into the house tickled pink with himself but just a mite scared along with it they came into the kitchen i stood back out of sight watching and listening all right rose said her eyes pure poison as she hooked at him what were you doing sneaking around here lennie giggled and smirked putting his hands over his mouth latticehike then he said me an rose was really going to catch it you just wait im gonna tell myra on you i seen him i seen oh smarty nick he come sneaking out here sos you n him could do somethin nasty you mean screwing rose said whats nasty about screwing ooh lennie pointed a shaky finger at her his eyes popped as big as saucers now you done it youre really gonna catch it now i tell myra you whats the matter rose said you screw myra all the time and dont tell me you dont you stupidhooking jackass thats what makes you goofy banging her so much youve tossed it to her so often youve thrown your ass out of line with your eyeballs i almost busted out laughing that rose there just wasnt no one like her goddang it in less than a minute now shed got lennie so mixed up that he couldnt have found his butt if itd had a bell on it he pointed his finger at her again shaking all over rubbing his eyes with his other hand as he started to blubber i deed not i do not i never done nothin like that an the hell you didnt youre not her brother youre her boy friend thats what she keeps you around for to diddle her fiddle because youre howhung and shes highstrung it aaint nneither i deed not you yyoure just a rnmean ol storyteller an dont lie to me you liverlipped bastard rose shook her fist in his face ive seen you pouring it on her i climbed up one of those ladders the painters are using and peeked in the window and goddam you were pounding it hike a drum the way you were banging the bunghole you damned near fell in well goddang it was better than a circus and it just went to show what a fella could do when he really put his mind to it here you take a common everyday thing like fornication which like the felha says can be a pretty fleeting pleasure but if you can just take the idea of it you know and start tossing it around amongst the right people or the wrong ones dependin on your viewpoint why then you can get something pretty goddang unusual something like what was going on here a heck of a lot of laughs plus the means of getting some people to get rid of themselves when there aint no way for you to get rid of them im ggonna tell mmyra lennie blubbered ill tell jus what you said about her every dirty rnmean word an cows ass said rose like she was sayin hows that and suck which like she was sayin says which you and myra better stop playing tickle the pickle boy before you bat your brains out with your balls im gonna tell myra lennie bawled stumbling toward the door youre gonna get it tell her she may be a hole but youre no post rose said tell her youll tickle her ass if shell whistle old black joe she gave lennie a shove it knocked him clean out the door and off the porch and he landed sprawling in the yard he picked himself up blubbering and rubbing his eyes rose gave him a final cussing accusing him and myra of a whole blast of dirty things it kind of made me wince to listen to her it was that dirty what shed said before sounded downright complimentary by comparison she came back in slamming the door i gave her a hug and told her shed done just fine now are you beginnin to get the picture i said lennie never leaves town hes not only too danged lazy to do any real walkin but hes scared to get very far off by himself myra knows this she knows hed be just about as likely to flap his arms and fly as he would to come way out here to your place so what happens when he goes home and tells myra he has been out here rose said mmm nodding her head slowly she probably wont believe him right but what she wont believe him i said leastways shell have some awful strong doubts hes telling the truth then he tells her alh the dirty things you said about her about her and lennie sleepin together and so on and how can she believe that how can she believe that her very best friend a perfect lady would all of a sudden start talking dirty about her mmmhmm rose nodded again she cant believe that he came out here in the first place and she cant believe what he says happened here the way she sees it hell just have made it all up and hell probably get his ears boxed for hying but not just lying i said but goddanged dangerous lyin the kind that breaks up homes and gets people killed and myra wont want to chance the risk of it happening again shell figure hes taken a real bad turn for the worse and shell have to put him away somewhere hike shes sometimes threatened to huh rose gave me a startled look when did myra ever do anything hike that why she can hardly bear to let lennie out of her sight i said myra had threatened to put him away a couple times when she got extra mad at him and yeah she couldnt hardly bear to let lennie out of sight thats why shes never done anything about him because shed want to be with him wherever he was and she didnt want to heave pottsvihle now though shes got no choice he goes and she goes too rose said she just wasnt sure about it it sounded good but you couldnt depend on it working out that way i said that well of course wed have to help things along a little myras bound to tell us about it and naturally we get pretty blamed worried and the worrieder we get the worrieder she gets were real concerned about what lennie might do next you know like maybe taking a meat axe to people instead of just lying about em or setting houses on fire or chasm little girls or well dont you fret about it honey i gave her a squeeze and a pat on the bottom everythings goin to work out fine but absolutely fine i aint got a doubt in the world about it rose shrugged and said well maybe so i knew myra better than she did then she snuggled up to me and bit my ear and i kissed her and pulled myself away lennie aint a real fast walker i explained i aim to cut crosscountry and beat him back to town just in case you know just in case rose frowned in case of what in case we need a clincher something thatll sweep the last doubt out of myras mind if she should have a doubt it aint even remotely likely that she will have but when lennie gets to the courthouse just pantin to tell myra about me bein out here aint it a pretty good idea for me to be sittin in my office rose had to admit that it was much as she hated to have me heave i promised wed get together in a day or so then i beat it out the door before i had to talk any more naturally i didnt go back to town i already knew what was going to happen there what i wanted to see was what was going to happen here although i already had a pretty good idea and maybe to help it along a little if it needed helpin i circled around through the fields until i reached the lane that came up from the road then i hunkered down beside it in a clump of scrub muhberries and waited about an hour and a half passed i started to worry a little wonderin if icould have been wrong and then i heard the squeak of buggy wheels coming on fast i parted the bushes and peeked out lennie and myra swept by myra clutching the horses reins lennies head lolling back and forth on his neck he was carrying something on his lap a black boxlike thing and one of his hands clutched something that looked like a stick i scratched my head wonderin what the heck the stuff was the box and the stick and then the buggy had rolled past me up and out of the lane and into the farmyard myra whoaed the horse to a stop she and lennie climbed down from the buggy and she trailed the reins over the horses head to keep it from wandering away then she and lennie crossed the yard and went up on the porch she banged on the door it opened after a minute and the lamplight outlined her face white and purposefullooking she started to go in then she took lennie by the shoulder and shoved him in ahead of her and at last i saw what he was carryin it was a camera a camera and one of them sticks that you explode flashpowder in for taking pictures indoors i jumped up and started for the house about the first step i took my foot caught in a root and i fell sprawling with the wind knocked out of me for a minute or two i didnt even have enough breath to groan and when i finally did manage to pick myself up i couldnt move very fast so it was maybe all of five minutes before i got to the house and found a window where i could hear and see well sir it was a funny thing a funnyterrible thing a strange crazy thing because what caught my attention wasnt what youd have thought it would be at all not rose scared and dazed and wonderin what the heck had gone wrong not lennie and myra smilin and spiteful and enjoyin theirselves not something that was in the room itself not somethin but nothing the emptiness the absence of things id maybe been in that house a hundred times that one and a hundred others like it but this was the first time id seen what they really were not homes not places for people to live in not nothinjust pineboard walls locking in the emptiness no pictures no books nothing to hook at or think about just the emptiness that was soakin in on me here and then suddenly it wasnt here it was everywhere every place like this one and suddenly the emptiness was filled with sound and sight with all the sad terrible things that the emptiness had brought the people to there were the helpless little girls cryin when their own daddies crawled into bed with em there were the men beating their wives the women screamin for mercy there were the kids wettin in the beds from fear and nervousness and their mothers dosin em with red pepper for punishment there were the haggard faces drained white from hookworm and blotched with scurvy there was the nearstarvation the neverbeinfull the debts that always outrun the credits there was the howwegonnaeat howwegonnasheep howwegonnacoverourpoorbareasses thinkin the kind of thinkin that when you aint doing nothing else but that why youre better off dead because thats the emptiness thinkin and youre already dead inside and all youll do is spread the stink and the terror the weepin and wailin the torture the starvation the shame of your deadness your emptiness i shuddered thinking how wonderful was our creator to create such downright hideous things in the world so that something like murder didnt seem at all bad by comparison yea verily it was indeed merciful and wonderful of him and it was up to me to stop brooding and to pay attention to what was going on right here and now so i made an extra hard try rubbing my eyes and shaking myself and finally i managed to a goddam liar rose was yelling i didnt say any such of a goddam thing tsk tsk there was a possum grin on myras face such language im beginning to think youre not a very nice girl after all to hell with what you think who wouldnt cuss having you and that idiot show up at this time of night you mean you didnt expect us myra said did you think id let you talk that way about me and not do anything about it but i didnt talk about you lennies hyin lennie wasnt even out here tonight wasnt he then what was his handkerchief doing out there on the porch one of the extrabig doublethick kind i make for him because the poor dears always slobbering myra went on grinning watching the fear spread over roses face rose stammered that she was hying that she hadnt found lennies handkerchief on the porch but she had all right id put it there myself well myra said well rose rose was caught and she must have known it the rough talk shed been using was a dead giveaway in itself but like a scared person will she kept on trying wwell she bobbed her head jerkily all right lennie was here i caught him sneaking around the house and it scared me and i guess i talked pretty rough to him but but i certainly didnt say those dirty things that he says i did didnt you no i didnt how many times do i have to tell you myra laughed a mean scary laugh that even made me shiver she said that rose didnt have to tell her any times because a lie didnt gain anything by repetition lennies telling the truth dear he doesnt have the imagination to make up a story like that bbut but and you dont have the imagination either you couldnt have invented the story any more than he could which means well i dont know how you found out but you obviously did and thats the important thing isnt it that and making sure that you dont do any talking to anyone else rose stared at her slowly shaking her head her voice a harsh sickish whisper i i ddont believe you yyou and lennie i just dont believe you the fact was i was pretty shocked myself because id guessed the truth id been pretty sure of it but that wasnt nowhere near the same as knowin it i dont believe you rose repeated shakily why why would you oh stop pretending myra said you found out about us and you were foolish enough to tell lennie as for the why of things youre going to find that out too and very shortly that is of course if youre similarly attracted to him she motioned to lennie he fastened the camera around her neck with a strap and she fiddled with the settings for a minute getting it like she wanted then he poured powder into the flashstick from a can in his pocket and carefully handed it to her rose stood staring at them myra let out another one of her meanscary laughs dont worry about your picture dear im really quite professional with a camera in fact i made quite a bit of money that way before i was married quite a bit youd be surprised at the sums people paid me for certain pictures that i took of them rose shook her head seeming to shake off her fear for the moment she said that myra was going to get a surprise if she didnt drag her ass out of there now beat it you baggy old bitch take your buggy boy friend and clear out of here before i forget im a lady in a moment dear just as soon as i take your picture with lennie take my picture why goddam you mmmhmm take your picture with lennie itll be much safer than killing you and every bit as effective at keeping you quiet and tear her clothes off lennie lennies hand darted out before rose could move it caught in the front of her dress and ripped downward taking the underclothes along with the dress before you could blink an eye she was standing in a puddle of rags naked as a baby jay lennie burbled and choked on his own spit and about a pint more spilled over his chin myra gave him a lovin look she looks very good doesnt she darling why dont you see if she really is guh guh lennie hesitated doubtfully mmaybe she hurt me now of course she wont hurt you myra laughed youre big and shes little and anyway im here to protect you guh guh lennie still hesitated hed ripped roses clothes off but just doing that just the one quick grab didnt take much guts he wasnt quite ready to go the rest of the way even with myra to nerve him up and tell him it was okay wwhat how i do it myra just grab her and throw her down myra said and then sharply forcing him to obey before he could think grab her lennie rose had been standin sort of stunned since her clothes were ripped off glazedeyed too stupefied even to try to cover herself but then lennie grabbed hugging her to him slobbering over her and everything was changed she came to life like a turpentined bobcat screaming clawing kicking and pounding lennie got hit and clawed in about a dozen places at the same time not to mention a kneein in his crotch and a kicking on his shins he fell away from her blubbering and clutching himself rose darted into the bedroom and shammed the door and myra hauled off and kicked lennie in the tail you big boob go after her break the door down im ascairt lennie whined she hurt me ill hurt you a hot worse myra twisted his ear by way of demonstration ill beat you black and blue if you dont do what i tell you now break that door down lennie began to shoulder the door myra stood right behind him urging him on telling him what would happen if he didnt mind her the lock gave the door banged open lennie following it with his rush and myra following him and and so i reckon i never will know what was in myras mind or what wasnt in it whether shed forgot about that pistol shed helped rose buy or whether she thought that rose wouldnt dare use it or whether she was so danged mad and determined to put rose in a fix that she just wasnt thinking no sir ill never know what she thought or didnt think because just about a second after the bedroom door busted open she and lennie were dead they came stumbling backward into the living room when rose started shooting falling over each other going down to the floor together in a tangled heap they were already dead then i reckon but rose kept on firing like she was shooting fish in a barrel until the gun was empty i climbed in the buggy and started for town ponderin over the strange workings of providence what id really sort of figured on was that myra would kill rose and then myra and lennie would have to skip town because i would be absolutely impartial even if they were sort of kinfoiks and id do my dangdest to see that they were punished even if i had to shoot em while they were trying to escape which would probably be the best way of winding things up but this would be all right i reckoned it would work out just as well with rose killin myra and lennie i put the horse and buggy in the livery stable listening to the hostler snore away in the hayloft i went back across town to the courthouse and everyone was longgone in bed of course and it was like there wasnt no one on the earth but me i went upstairs to the living quarters and drew the shades down tight then i lit a lamp and got myself a cup of cold coffee from the stove and eased down on the lounge to drink it i finished it and carried the cup back into the kitchen i toed my boots off and stretched out on the lounge to rest and the downstairs door slammed open and rose came pounding up the steps and busted in on me shed run all the way into town on foot i reckon and she was wildeyed and crazyhookin she sagged against the door heaving for breath pointing a shaking accusin finger at me it was all she could do for a moment just point i said howdydo to her and then i said it was all right me and her bein friends but it really wasnt perlite to point at people i thought you ought to know that i said it not only aint polite but you might poke someone in the eye yyou she said fighting for breath you you or if they was real tall folks i said you might poke em in some other bodily orifice which could be plumb embarrassin for you not to mention the danger of getting your finger caught she took a long shuddery heave then she came over to the lounge and stood over me you you you sonofabitch she said you you you rotten stinking bastard you you goddamned whoremongerin doublecrossing lowdown worthless nogood mean hateful twotiming onery now goddang it rose i said danged if it dont almost sound as if you was mad at me mad she yelled ill show you how mad i am ill better not holler so loud i said folks might be roused into coming up here to find out whats going on rose said to let em come but she lowered her voice ill damned well tell them whats going on you dirty bastard ill tell them just what happened and what would that be i said dont you play dumb on me damn you you know what happened you were outside all the time because i heard you when you drove away you let it happen you stood by watching while had to kill two people uhhuh i said yeah what the hell do you mean uhhuh yeah are you saying that you didnt do it that it didnt happen that way that you didnt plan the whole thing an an i aint sayin nothin like that at all i said all im saying or rather askin is what youre goin to tell folks what kind of a believable explanation are you going to put together for them two dead bodies you got in your house and the blood all over the floor and the fact that even an idjit could prove they was shot with your gun because no ones goin to believe the truth rose they just aint goin to believe no such wild story you just think about it a minute and youll see that they wont she opened her mouth to speak to call me some more dirty names i guess then she seemed to have some second thoughts on the matter and she sat down quietly at the side of the lounge youve got to help me nick youve got to help me cover this up some way well now i dont rightly see how i could do that i said after all youre guilty of murder an fornicatin and hypocrisy an huh whaat she glared at me why you forktongued sonofabitch you call me names after what youve done and i dont suppose youre at all responsible are you not a speck said just because put temptation in front of people it dont mean they got to pick it up i asked you a question damn you who planned those murders who tells a lie every time he draws a breath who the hell is it thats been fornicating with me and god knows how many others oh well i said it dont count when i do those things it dont count what the hell do you mean i said i meant i was just doing my job followin the holy precepts laid down in the bible its what im supposed to do you know to punish the heck out of people for bein people to coax em into revealin theirselves an then kick the crap out of em and its agoddanged hard job rose honey and ifigure that if i can get a little pleasure in the process of trappin folks im mighty well entitled to it rose stared at me frowning what is this she said what kind of nutty talk is that well now i guess it does sound kind of nutty i said but that aint hardly no ways my fault by rights i should be rompin on the high an the mighty the folks that really run this country but i aint allowed to touch them so ive got to make up for it by being twice as hard on the white trash an negroes and people hike you that let their brains sink down to their butts because they couldnt find no place else to use them yes sir im haborin in the lords vineyard and if i cant reach up high i got to work all the harder on the lowhangin vines for the lord hoveth a willin worker rose he liketh to see a man bustin his ass during workin hours and i got them hours cut way way down with eatin and sleepin but i cant eat and sleep all the time id let my eyes drift shut while i was talking when i opened them rose was gone but i heard her moving around in myras room i went to the door and hooked in shed stripped out of her clothes and was trying on some of myras i asked her if she was figurin on going somewhere and she gave me a look that would have fried an egg am i going somewhere she said bitterly as if you didnt know what i was going to do what i have to do i said i reckoned shed be taking the dawn train out of town because no one would see her leave that way and shed have a full days start before i got excited and worried about myra and lennie and got around to discqvering that they was murdered of course that dawn train dont carry passengers they just got a waterstop here but i reckon them trainmen will be proud to let you ride when they see how friendly you are i bet they wont charge you a cent which makes things pretty nice since you dont have no money you can put your hands on rose bit her lips shook her head wonderingly youre actually enjoying this arent you youre getting a kick out of it not really i said its just part of my job you know to gloat over folks in trouble nick she said whats happened to you when did you get like this i said well sir if she meant when had the truth been revealed to me it had been happenin for a long time bit by bit id been given a glimpse of it and now and then id think i knew what it was and now an then i was just mystified and scared i didnt know from what for and id get the idea that i must be goin crazy or something and then tonight at her house as i stood outside of myself plannin things and then as id watched what id planned to take place it was sort of like someone had pulled a trigger in my mind and there was one great big flash of light and at last saw the whole truth at last i saw why things were as they were and why i was as i was i saw it all honey said i saw the truth and the glory and it aint going to be nearways so bad for you as you might think why a gal like you can make herself a mint in them river towns just doin what you like to do and i never knew no gal that done it any better and speakin of that and as long as we wont be seem each other no more ive got no objection to cleaving unto you for five or ten minutes even if you are sort of a fugitive from the law rose snatched up the alarm clock from the dresser and flang it at me it smashed against the wall and what i mean is it really smashed now goddang it rose i said how the goddang heck am i goin to wake up in time for church church church she moaned you going to church after after oh you sonofabitch oh you sneaky tricky lying mealymouthed bastard now there you go again i said there aint no sure use of pretendin no longer cause now i know youre mad at me she cut loose with another blast of cuss words then she whirled back around to the mirror and began fussin with the dress she was trying on its that amy mason isnt it she said youre getting rid of everyone so you can marry her well i said i got to admit ive been studyin about it ill bet you have i just bet you have you doublecrossing skunk yes sir i said ive been studyin about it but the fact is icant make up my mind it aint that shes a sinner because shes one of the quality an they got their own laws and rules and i dont have to bother with em but im afraid marryin her might interfere with my work ysee i got my job to do rose i got to go on bein high sheriff the highest legal authority in potts county this place thats the world to most people here because they never see nothin else ijust got to be high sheriff because ive been pecculyarly an singularly fitted for it and iaint allowed togive it up every now an then i think im goin to get out of it but always the thoughts are put in my head and the words in my mouth to hold me in my place i got to be it rose i got to be high sheriff of potts county forever an ever i got to go on an on doin the lords work and all he does is the pointin rose all he does is pick out the people an i got to exercise his wrath on em and ill tell you a secret rose theys plenty of times when i dont agree with him at all but i got nothing to say about it im the high sheriff of potts county an i aint supposed to do nothing that really needs doing nothin that might jeopardize my job all i can do is follow the pointin of the lords finger striking down the pore sinners that no one gives a good goddang about like say ive tried to get out of it ive figured on runninaway and stayinaway but i cant and i know ill never be able to i got to keep on like im doin now and im afraid amy would never understand that or put up with it so misdoubt ill be marryin her rose gazed at me in the mirror she studied me for a long time puzzled angry frightened and then she shrugged and rolled her eyes oh brother she said what a bull artist now goddang it rose i said you just think about it a little and itll make plenty of sense for you aint it logical that i should appear here in potts county which is just about as close to the asshole of creation as you can get without havin a finger snapped off and dont i have to bejust another fehla just a man like i was the first time and dont i have to act like one just the same as anyone else when in potts county do what the potts county folks do like the fella says an if you want to promote anyone to glory why do it privately because people want logical explanations for everything particularly for the miracle of promotin people to glory rose made a farting noise with her lips brother she said again are you ever full of crap now dont you say that rose i said please please dont ive been a long time figuring things out and now i finally done it i finally explained things to myself and had to explain em rose or go crazy an even now sometimes i find a doubt or so creepin in and i cant stand it i honest to god cant stand it so please honey please dont dont i turned and stumbled off to my bedroom i prayed mightily and pretty soon i got a grip on myself and my doubts went away i prayed mightily and the strength flowed back into me and i didnt hardly mind at all the names that rose was fussin and cussin at me and i could even have kissed her goodbye when she left and maybeve given her a pinch or two if she hadnt threatened to brain me if i so much as touched her i went to church like always and i was asked to sing in the choir like id been doin up until the time it had hooked hike sam gaddis was going to beat me out for sheriff so i sang out loud an clear shouting the praises of the lordand goddang if didnt practically raise the roof with amens when the minister started preachin i reckon i mustve prayed and shouted an sang louder than anyone in the church and after everything was over the minister wrung me by the hand and called me brother and said he saw the spirit was truly in me and where is good sister myra today not ill i hope well no i reckon not i said she and lennie drove out to see sister rose hauck last night and i didnt discover until this morning that the horse had run off and come back to town by hissehf i guess thats what happened anyway because the horse is in the stable an she and lennie aint come home yet yes he frowned a little but havent you phoned the hauck house oh i didnt see no point in that i said i couldnt have picked her up anyway before church and i sure didnt want to miss church i figured ill probably drive out in time to bring her in for evenin services yes he said still kind of frowning well hallelujah i said praise the lord brother i went on home and fixed myself a bite to eat then i washed up the dishes and put em away and after id done that i went into my room and dropped down on the bed just laid there doin nothing in particular and not workin very hard at it i found a long hair sticking out of my nose and jerked it out and looked at it and it didnt look particularly interesting i dropped it to the floor wonderin if falling hair from fellas noses was noted along with fallin sparrows i raised up on one cheek of my butt and eased out one of those long rattly farts like you never can get rid of when other folks are around i scratched my balls tryin to decide at what point a fella stopped scratchin and started playin which is an ageold question i guess and one that aint likely to be solved in the near future i listened tryin to hear myra out in the kitchen started puzzlin over where lennie might be and thinking maybe i ought to go out and look for him before he got into trouble i wondered if maybe i shouldnt take a run out to see rose and pleasure her up a little if tom wasnt to home it seemed like a good idea the more thought about it and i was clean out into the living room before suddenly remembered and i dropped down hard into a chair and buried my face in my hands trying to sort things out trying to fit them back together in the only way they made sense buck came in ken laceys deputy you know i was kind of befuddled for a minute so absorbed with fittin things together that i couldnt quite place him but there was the gun hangin from his hip and his deputy sheriffs badge and his long leathery face so of course i remembered pretty fast we shook hands and i told him to set down i bet you probly run into my wife downtown i said i bet she told you just to come right on up here and walk in without knockin because i wouldnt mind a bit didnt she nope said buck you mean it didnt happen that way yep said buck yeah yeah said buck what happened was i was huntin me a skunk and when im ahuntin skunk i dont stand none on ceremony i just bust right in wherever i smell him well i said well now how you standin all this weather tolable just tolable you reckon its goin to get any hotter yep said buck yes sir its goin to get a lot hotter wouldnt suprise me none if it got so hot for a certain fella that didnt keep his bounden bargain with me that he just naturally wont be able to stand it i got a bottle out of the sideboard and filled a couple of glasses he took the one handed him and threw it against the wall like to keep my hands free he explained kind of a habit with me when im around a fella that dont keep his bounden agreements buck i said i just couldnt do it i was willin to but it was just plumb impossible no it wasnt buck said moresomeover it aint but you dont understand goddang it i possolutely couldnt do it because aint interested in no becauses or whys or whichfors buck said you n me had a bargain and i done my part in gettin ken down here now you do your part an drop that rope over his neck or im goin to put it around yours i told him that would be a pretty trick to see but maybe hed better not attempt it might be youd get it around your own neck maybe buck said but then i reckon not i reckon i could go right on aplayin a part like got so much practice doin around ken lacey such as i said such as bein in such a state of fear and tremblin that i didnt dast do anything when you told me you was goin to kill them two pimps also along with being feared and trembly i was just plain stupid and i didnt reckon there was no way we could ever convict you until this fella george barnes came along and he dont like you none at all nohow an i figure he could somehow prove the truth with me tellin him what it was an also swearin to it buck i said listen to me buck uhhuh buck shook his head let a peck of dirt a day every day i worked for ken lacey et so much dirt that i could feel it seepin out of me and i couldnt hardly bear to hug my kids no more nor tsheep with my wife for fear it would rub off on them and they couldnt never get clean like i figured i couldnt never get clean well now i got a chance to stop eatin it and put ken lacey under six feet of it and dont you try to stop me nick you try to stop me and tme youre just ken lacey youre his twin brother spoonin the dirt into me every time i open my mouth and i just cant eat no more i just cant by god i cant eat no more dirt i ccant his jaw snapped shut he brushed his nose with his sleeve his eyes burnin into mine thats it nick id rather it was ken but its goin to be you or him i took a drink from my glass giving him time to get calmed down a little then i told him why he couldnt do it revealin who i was for the first time he didnt seem a speck surprised beyond raising his eyebrows for a second the fact was i guess that he probably thought i was jokin or crazy he didnt care much which an i suppose should have expected that because what would you have thought but i was still a mite disappointed i told him again just to make sure hed heard me right he shook his head sayin he reckoned i was wrong probly got yourself mixed up with that other fella he said the one with the same front initial thats right buck i said thats right im both dont you see the fella that gets betrayed and the one that does the betrayin all in one man he didnt seem even nowheres near convinced i jumped up and went over to the window thinkin that maybe i would see a sign but all i could see was a couple of dogs frolickin around and sniffing each other i stood watching them and i guess i laughed out loud without knowin it that gravedirt ticklin you buck drawled you already got one foot in it you know i was just watching a couple of dogs out here i said and it reminded me of a story i heard one time you ever hear it buck mean why dogs always go around sniffing each others asses buck said he hadnt heard it cant say that im real interested in hearin it neither just in case you was figurin on telling it i said that well sir accordin to this story all the dogs in the world held a convention back in the beginning of time their purpose being to set up a code of conduct hike maybe it shouldnt be fair to bite each other in the balls and so on and there was this one dog that had a copy of roberts rules of order that hed got somewhere probly at the same place cain got his wife so he automatically became chairman and the first thing he done was to declare the entire convention a committee of the hole fellas he says canines of the convention i dont want to tread on no honorable dogs paws so ill just put it this way when we go back in them smokefilled rooms to caucus im sure we dont want to smell nothing but smoke and the best thing to do it seems to me is to pile our assholes outside and if someone will make a motion to that effect ill certainly be glad to put a second on it well sir it seemed hike such a danged good idea that every dog in the convention jumped up to make the motion so the chairman declared it passed by acclamation and there was a brief recess while all the dogs went outside to stack up their asshohes then they went back inside tcarry out their business and goddanged if a heck of a storm didnt blow up out of nowhere and it scattered them asshohes every which way mixin em up so bad that not a one of them dogs was ever able to find his own so thats why they still go around sniffing butts and theyll probably keep on until the end of time because a dog thats lost his ass just cant be happy even if one of em is pretty much hike another and the one he has is in good working order what im saying is this buck i said hang on to your own ass and dont try to get kens for all you know he may beeatin alot worse than dirt and i may be too and youll be a lot happier like you are is that all you got to say buck said and i could hear him getting up from his chair youre sure thats all you got to say i hesitated thinkin i should be able to come up with somethin because it was all so clear to me christ knew it was clear love one another and dont screw no one unless theyre bending over and forgive us our trespasses because we may be a minority of one for gods sake for gods sake why else had i been put here in potts county and why else did i stay here why else who else what else but christ almighty would put up with it but i couldnt make him see that he was as blind as the rest of em well nick i aint waiting much longer and you dont have to buck i said you dont have to because i finally come to a decision ive been a long time comin to it its been the product of thinkin and thinkin and thinkin and then some more thinkin and dependin on how you hook at it its the goddangest whingdingest decision ever made or its the skittyassed worst because it explains everything that goes on in the world it answers everything and it answers nothing so here it is buck heres my decision i thought and i thought and then i thought some more and finally i came to a decision i decided i dont no more know what to do than if i was just another lousy
