waiting for someone to tell them what to do and where to go sally mrs smith needs someone to collect her shopping sally went to the desk and took the shopping list for mrs smith then with a smile on her pretty face said goodbye and walked out of the office john mrs jones wants you to take her dog for a walk and be careful not to step on the dog this time gary can you babysit for the smiths this afternoon jo mr brown needs help in his garden the telephone never stopped ringing but slowly as time passed the office became calm again most of the teenagers were out helping the people of the town the rest were by the coffee machine someone switched on the cassette player and william sat in his chair more comfortably and closed his eyes hello william opened his eyes a lovely girl stood in front of his desk smiling hello young lady who are you im kathy im new here and i dont know anybody so i thought perhaps i could help you you said the magic word help is always needed round here in fact as soon as joan gets back im taking the library van to the old peoples home and i need someone to help with the small trolley why dont you get some coffee and meet the rest of the group suddenly the door

much to do that day william and kathy walked out of the office and got into the van dont worry kathy im a safe driver and it wont take us very long to do this job kathy smiled at william and looked at the busy street outside im not worried about your driving but it will take us a long time as theres a lot of traffic in the streets today all right then lets hit the road chapter two the lady in room the old peoples home was outside the town when they arrived william parked at the main entrance he went to the back of the van and pushed a big trolley of books out of it kathy took the smaller trolley ill go to the main room downstairs and you take your trolley round the rooms to the old people who cant get out of bed the matron will give you the room numbers just then the matron arrived hello william theyre waiting for you but whos this hello im kathy im new at helping hand and william asked me to come here thank you for coming they always like to meet new people from the town this is the list of room numbers leave the lady in room last because she likes to talk and feels lonely now that she has to stay in bed all right william pushed his trolley into the large sunny room on the left of the hall kathy pushed her trolley down a narrow corridor with doors on each side the old people were happy to meet her and asked her lots of questions at last kathy arrived at room she knocked on the door and when a gentle voice called come in kathy opened the door and pushed the trolley into a pretty room which at that moment was full of sunshine an old lady with bright blue eyes behind round metalframed glasses was lying in bed her hair was soft and white shining in the sunlight she smiled at kathy kathy smiled back at her good afternoon my names kathy watson and im working at helping hand i brought you some books do you want one i am miss emily nice to meet you may i ask how old you are kathy im nineteen now come here and let me look at you yes you do remind me of a girl i knew long ago she was very pretty too but enough of that please come and sit down on this stool beside me as i have many things to tell you and there is very little time left kathy sat down beside the old lady she felt calm and peaceful but curious too the old lady began to speak softly i am very old now but when i was young i went to work in a big house i worked in the basement doing the washing and ironing lord hampton the young master lived alone but many rich friends came to visit him and his parties were famous in the town hampton house was beautiful then bright lights shone in all the rooms they made the wood on the furniture shine and the silver sparkle the carpets were so thick your feet disappeared inside the wool when you walked on them i was lucky the cook let me have some food after lord hamptons meals came back to the kitchen but his other servants were often cold and hungry how terrible lord hampton wasnt a bad man he just thought servants no he didnt think about servants at all rich people and his work that was all he thought about do people still work there cleaners gardeners and maybe the young people from helping hand sometimes no the house is old and needs lots of repairs nobody ever goes there now and lord hampton there was no answer from miss emily her eyes were shut and there was a smile on her lips the kind of smile children have when they are keeping a secret thought kathy do you want a book to read no thank you come and visit me again another day kathy kathy stood up and quietly pushed the trolley to the door she opened it went out of the room and back into the narrow corridor what took you so long miss emily she told me about the days when she was young whos miss emily the lady in room the one you told me to leave last but the lady in room is called karen black thats strange maybe i got the name wrong come on then we have to get back to work back at helping hand joan asked kathy to answer the telephone for a few hours william left to help mr fisher paint his house at oclock everyone returned to the office joan gave each of them a brown envelope with their name on the front joan gave kathy an envelope too inside there was a fivepound note oh whats this you didnt think you worked today for nothing yes i did joan started helping hand so the young people who dont have much money could find work and at the same time help people who cant do things by themselves you see we help the towns people and they help us then everyone is happy do you want to come to the dance here tonight oh i didnt see any notices about a dance

dress because she didnt know what to wear she finally put on her best dress and shoes then she brushed her shoulderlength fair hair until it shone a last look in the mirror showed a slim girl with happy brown eyes her oval face framed by soft curls william stood at the end of the road and waited when he saw kathy he hurried to meet her hello again ready to go yes lets go together they went into the building it was full of young people some girls were in miniskirts and tshirts others in long bright dresses most of the young men wore jeans tshirts and leather jackets everyone wanted to enjoy themselves william greeted his friends then invited kathy to dance the moment the music started they danced nicely together and when the music stopped a girl with soft brown hair and shining brown eyes came near them this is sue sue say hello to kathy hello kathy nice to meet you come and meet the rest of the crowd just then a tall young man came forward he held his glasses in one hand and a handkerchief in the other this is john he always cleans his glasses when hes thinking hes terribly clever so he cleans his glasses a lot my hair falls across one eye when im angry she looked into his kind green eyes and didnt believe he could ever actually get angry here comes pam you hear her before you see her because shes always laughing are you talking about me yes i hope it was something nice as she smiled her grey eyes shone a young man went near her hello my names adam glad to meet you im kathy would you like to dance id love to for the rest of the evening kathy danced and talked to her new friends and william enjoyed himself too last dance my dance william led kathy to the dance floor as they were dancing kathy took a look at her face in a mirror her cheeks were pink and her eyes were shining after the dance was over william and kathy went home walking through the streets of the town which were now quiet see you tomorrow then kathy see you tomorrow william byebye every saturday kathy and william worked at helping hand kathy enjoyed doing the odd jobs around town she even sang for a pop group because their singer was sick and then she had to serve drinks and food to the guests at a garden party but the name of the house was pine lodge not hampton house as she had hoped one saturday she and william helped mr jones build a fish pond in his garden as it was a very hot day they decided to jump into the pond to cool off a little after so much hard work mr jones looked at them and said that he would have to put the fish in the pond the next day on days when there was no work to do they played monopoly and scrabble and had a lot of fun together william also taught kathy to cycle one day joan asked kathy and william to take the van to the old peoples home kathy visited the rooms on the matrons list number was not on the list wheres the lady from room shes gone away by the way i found an envelope with your name on it left on the floor of room here it is kathy opened the envelope and took out the piece of paper inside visit hampton was all it said she put the paper in her pocket was she a friend of yours no but i liked her then as there was nothing else to do in the old peoples home kathy followed william out to the van chapter four the accident autumn turned to winter in the regular saturday morning meeting joan clapped her hands and asked everyone to be quiet everyone stopped talking and looked at her the council is going to pull this place down so we have one month to find a new meeting place has anyone got any ideas the room was silent well if we want to keep helping hand we must find a place for our office so get onto your bicycles or motorbikes and start looking this is your chance to ride your bicycle out in the countryside kathy had an old bicycle shed bought from a friend at helping hand at the moment the bicycle was at the bike shop williams friend george wanted to mend the brakes before kathy went out onto the busy roads well go on sunday we can join the others and have a picnic kathy got up early on sunday morning and walked to the shop to collect her bicycle hello youre up early arent you yes were going on a picnic today so i need my bicycle well the new tyres are on and the front brake works but today i wanted to mend the back brake its not working properly oh never mind ill ride slowly and ill try to be very careful with the front brake its very dangerous to use the front brake without the back one if you put it on too hard youll fall off she still didnt know how to ride her bicycle very well but she wanted to go on the picnic more than anything else show me what to do then i wont be in any danger george got onto the bicycle and rode round kathy then he put on the front brake the back wheel of the bicycle moved to the side and george nearly fell off now you see what can happen he pushed the bike over to where kathy stood yes now you try but this time use the front brake gently kathy rode slowly round george then gently put on the front brake the bike slowed then stopped thats it but remember you have no back brake your bicycle is dangerous thank you george and dont worry i really will be very careful that must be william and the others well have a good time and bring your bicycle back here tonight so then i can fix it properly goodbye and dont worry she got on her bicycle and went to meet the others they all started cycling together towards the countryside is everything all right no problem at the end of the road there was a hill they all cycled slowly up that hill and kathy pedalled harder to catch up with them at last they got to the top who wants to race me down the hill they started going down the hill they were going faster and faster and william was singing loudly this is like flying kathys bicycle zoomed down the hill suddenly kathy saw a crossroads at the bottom of the hill a lorry was coming slowly from a side road moving into the main road gently kathy put on the front brake of her bicycle but it just slowed a little it didnt stop put your brakes on kathy i cant william help oh my god kathy froze with fear she saw the look of horror on the lorry drivers face just before she crashed into the side of his lorry then for a moment everything went black chapter five life or death kathy heard people shouting and then the sound of her bicycle wheel spinning round she opened her eyes and saw williams face among other faces looking down at her finally she felt the pain all over her body it slowly spread from her head to the rest of her body it was so bad she could hardly breathe a siren sounded in the distance william who sat on the road next to her gently lifted her head you shouldnt move her the ambulance is coming now this is a bad one well take her now can i go with her in the ambulance she wont know youre there but get in if you like dont worry about your bike well bring it to the hospital thanks william climbed into the ambulance and sat down near kathy he felt terrible in fact he was shaking kathy looked so white and there was a deep cut on her head at the hospital william was walking beside the stretcher praying for kathys life while tears filled his eyes the nurse came up to him wait here please will she be all right im sure she will you should drink a cup of sweet coffee its good for shock you look terrible the nurse brought william some coffee he drank the hot coffee slowly the long wait had begun slowly the young people from helping hand started coming into the hospital at first they talked to william but he didnt want to talk he only wanted kathy to be well happy and laughing again as she was a while ago on the way to the picnic one hour passed then another the young crowd left but william sat quietly and waited the clock ticked on the wall and the hands moved round then round again william hated that clock then the door opened and the doctor walked up to him william couldnt speak or even breathe are you william yes how is she a nasty bump on the head some cuts and bruises but nothing broken shes awake now and wants to see you ah she also shouted the name hampton house is it her home no it isnt she must stay in town when she leaves the hospital no long journeys on trains or buses ill make sure she stays in town but can i see her now please yes yes shes waiting for you kathy smiled shyly at william he looked tired and his t shirt was covered in dirt and blood he sat down on the chair next to her bed how do you feel you gave me an awful fright much better now the doctor says i can go home tomorrow yes he said youre fine he also told me that you said something about a house called hantom hanton or something like that hampton house a lady i met in the old peoples home said she used to work there once a nurse came into the room its time you went young man come again tomorrow and take her home goodnight kathy see you tomorrow goodnight and thank you william kathy relaxed and closed her eyes she thought about the old ladys story who was the old woman why did she tell me about her past she seemed to know me but i had never seen her before rich masters with lots of servants have not been around for a long time and the old lady looked so old this lord hampton can he still be in that house why did she give me the invitation oh its the bump on my head that makes me feel confused the man must be over years old the house is probably empty with this last thought kathy felt very calm when the nurse opened the door a few moments later she was pleased to see that kathy was asleep chapter six hampton house for the next few days kathy stayed quietly at home in the evenings people came to visit her and told her about the search for a new meeting place everyone in the town was helpful offering their garages garden sheds or even their spare rooms but none of the places were any good as an office for helping hand thats it then helping hand will have to close what about hampton house an old lady at the old peoples home was telling me about it maybe its just what we need for an office as its been empty for years its worth a try you never know two days later william found some information about the house he told kathy that it was near the old peoples home he had checked on an old map of the town and found out where it was were going there this afternoon do you want to come kathy of course you cant leave me behind it was a warm afternoon kathy sat behind william on his motorbike and waved to the crowd from helping hand they wanted to come and look round the old house too after a long ride they finally saw its old wall with tall iron gates in the middle of it some energetic young people climbed up onto the high wall while others looked in through the gate kathy saw a wild garden with old trees covered in ivy the house was exactly as she had imagined it except the roof had fallen in the windows were covered in dirt and dust and they were cracked from the stones children had thrown at them for fun its falling down what do you think sue it does look dangerous where are you going adam im going to have a look round adam jumped off the top of the wall into the garden everyone watched in fear as he tried to walk across the wild garden to the house suddenly he came back to the wall and climbed quickly over it to the road snakes the garden is full of snakes thats it then we cant use the old house im not afraid of snakes before anyone could stop her kathy climbed up to the top of the wall and jumped down carefully she walked across the garden to the heavy wooden front door she bent down and cleared the stones and earth from the bottom then she slowly turned the big brass handle to open it the door opened just enough for kathy to get inside then it closed behind her kathy was in a large room the walls were cracked and peeling the ceiling hung down in places and the floor was covered in dust the few floor boards that showed looked wormeaten and dangerous kathy saw a great staircase covered with spiders webs and a small mouse sitting on the bottom step quickly it jumped away in a cloud of dust kathy became so frightened that she couldnt move she was ready to leave the house when she saw a large table and four chairs there was no dust on them a candlestick stood in the middle of the table with a lit candle in it kathy went closer and at that moment she heard the voice please sit down kathy strangely kathy felt relaxed and comfortable when she heard it she sat down on the nearest chair and waited a plate of delicious food appeared in front of her it was hot and smelt delicious kathy felt hungry so she picked up the heavy silver knife and fork and soon her plate was empty it disappeared and a bowl of strawberries and cream arrived in its place lovely thank you i never could say no to food our time together is not ended please come to the house another day kathy she accepted the invitation then carefully stood up from the table and walked round the room keeping close to the wall until she reached the front door it opened easily and she was outside again in the bright sunshine the crowd gathered round her what happened is the house any good for our meetings why did you stay in there so long kathy told them about the clean table and chairs about the lovely meal and about the voice she saw the way they looked at each other and she knew they didnt believe her come on kathy it seems the bump on your head is more serious than we thought if theres free food inside ill go next time everyone relaxed and laughed as they walked away from the old house chapter seven the investigation kathy woke up the next morning and saw that it was raining when she looked out of her bedroom window she ran downstairs and across the road to williams house are you going to the old house today yes im going with john and some of the others but you can come too if you like yes i do want to come with you the old house looked more frightening than before it was difficult for william and john to climb the wall because it was wet and slippery kathy waited at the gate and watched them walk across the garden they went to the front door and together they pushed hard but it wouldnt open then they walked to the side of the house looking for a window to climb through william looked for a rock to break the glass and john climbed into the house first it was cold and dark there was dust everywhere and mice ran across the room the hole in the roof let the rain in onto the ruined floor the wind made strange sounds too john walked further into the room just as william climbed in through the window can you see anything no theres no table here the rooms empty i wonder why kathy made up that story i think that this house makes her say funny things shes so much different when shes away from here they climbed out through the window and across the garden to meet kathy well whats it like in there did you see anything unusual the whole place is a mess the floor is rotten and the walls are falling apart the roof as you can see is ruined did you hear the voice or see the table and chairs there was no table or chairs either theres nothing in there kathy just made the whole thing up dont ask me why without waiting for kathy he started the motorbike and rode away down the road the others stared at her then walked away from her and got onto their bicycles kathy was now alone outside the old house slowly and carefully she climbed the wet wall and got into the garden she walked up to the front door turned the doorknob and stepped inside the room smelt damp the table and chairs were not in the room kathy was ready to leave when she suddenly saw two armchairs on either side of the fireplace there was a small table beside one of them kathy walked slowly across the room she reached the back of the chairs and looked to see if anyone was sitting in one of them she was really scared as she did so but fortunately both the chairs were empty suddenly a gentle wind came into the room and made the old tom curtains move she turned round and called to the empty room please let me see your face lord hampton there was no answer the room was silent and kathy even more scared now stood quietly beside the empty chairs after a long silence which made kathy more nervous the voice spoke again kathy looked towards the sound but she could see nothing please sit down kathy and make yourself comfortable she sat in front of the brightly burning fire and waited she forgot about william and the others at helping hand i have a gift for you theres a box on the table next to you do open it kathy carefully opened the box inside there was a small diamond heart on a chain put it on then i must explain why the heart belongs to you kathy put the chain over her head then she sat quietly and waited the voice echoed round the room as the story began chapter eight lord hamptons story when i was very young i lived in a village where the people were very poor i worked on a farm picking fruit and planting vegetables every day at lunchtime a young girl brought me fresh bread and some cheese to eat she was a very pretty girl and she wore a beautiful diamond heart round her neck this jewel was so pretty that i could not stop thinking about it late one night i went to her house sneaked in and stole the diamond heart which was beside her on a pillow the next morning i left the village i sold the diamond heart and i used the money to buy clothes then i went to work for a rich old man i worked hard for many years and became very close to him i often thought about the girl whose diamond heart i had stolen but i never went back to my village to see her one day the old man asked me to visit him in his house he said to me i have no family you are a good man and i want you to have my business and this house after i die everything i have is yours soon after he died i inherited his money and became a very rich man everyone called me lord hampton and were afraid of me as i had become a cruel master who treated people in a terrible way one day the girl whose diamond heart i had stolen years before came to my house she was cold and hungry and needed work now the time had come for me to help her just as the diamond heart i had stolen from her had helped me in the past after all i owed her so much but instead when i saw that she did not recognise me in my fine new clothes my cruel selfmade me send her down to the basement where she had to work long hard hours every day she had to carry water from the well boil it in huge pots and then wash my clothes in it then she had to hang them outside to dry and press them with the heavy iron she worked hard all day for a bowl of soup and a piece of dry bread then exhausted she slept on the wet floor for a few hours the only person that gave her some happiness was a kind young man who finally married her when this happened i felt sad for some time because i had memories from the time we were both young and poor and she cared for me so much but my sadness quickly went away what did i want from a poor miserable girl my house was beautiful i had many rich friends and there was always good food on my table so you can imagine my surprise when years later when i was an old man the girl came to me in a dream and said many of your servants have died of cold and hunger the ones who lived to be old were sent away when they could not work anymore and they too died of hunger now you must suffer before you can find peace you will know when the time has come because a young girl will come to your house if she eats at your table and you speak to her honestly of your past cruelty and selfishness then you will be free to leave this house and find peace in the morning i found the diamond heart on the pillow beside me and i knew it had not been a dream soon what she had told me became true all my servants were old and tired one by one they left but no new ones came to work for me my beautiful house started falling apart my rich friends no longer wanted to visit me for endless years i have wandered from room to room always waiting for a young girl to come and free my soul from its suffering now i can finally find peace there was a long sigh after the voice stopped speaking kathy felt cold and lonely as she stood in the middle of the empty room suddenly the fire went out dont leave me here alone kathy cried but there was no answer she walked slowly across the dark room to the front door there she turned and looked once more at the two chairs beside the fireplace then she left the house it was still raining and nobody was waiting outside the gates for her kathy felt lonely and sad as she walked home chapter nine a matter of choice william telephoned joan early on friday morning hello joan i must speak to you why dont you come to the office william its not open today so well have time to talk william hurried to the office and after joan unlocked the door for him he sat down opposite her in front of the big desk i need your help its about kathy and the strange happenings at hampton house kathys never been like this before but every time she goes near that house she seems to be a different person i dont believe in ghosts maybe the accident she had makes her see things kathy is special to me but im afraid shes not the kathy i knew anymore i thought you might want to talk to me about that kathy told me once that her mother died when she was very small and she had never seen her grandmother so i went to the old peoples home and asked some old people who remembered kathys grandmother they told me that when she was young she used to work for lord hampton so maybe kathys grandmother was the girl with the diamond heart joan i came to talk to you because i thought you were a logical person it seems that ive made a mistake i believe that something happened to kathy in that house and if shes really special to you then you must believe it too if you cant do that then let her go you have until the meeting tomorrow to decide the next day was saturday kathy walked slowly along the road to the offices of helping hand she knew that the young people there were angry with her especially william the room was full of young people talking or sitting quietly waiting for joan to tell them where to go william was in a corner of the room with his close friends around him he turned his back to kathy but joan hurried over to her hello kathy how are you today i feel much better thank you come over here to my desk i have something to say to these young people and i want you beside me confused kathy followed joan and sat down near her desk attention please as you all know we havent found a new office for helping hand yet but we will finally find one sadly i wont be here to help you im moving away from this town but there are many good people here to take my place today you must vote for a new leader ive chosen three people i think will do the job well william owen sally brown and john holt if you all agree then please write the name of the person you want as a leader on a piece of paper then put your paper in the box on my desk after everyone had voted they returned to their jobs kathys job that day was to answer the telephone when the office was quiet joan turned to kathy that old house we saw hampton house its being pulled down today no kathy jumped up from the chair she ran outside feeling that she had to visit the old house one more time chapter ten the final moments kathy could hear the noise before she got to the house she saw lorries blocking the road outside it and workmen walking in and out then she saw the bulldozers they were breaking the windows and the wooden balcony soon the rest of the roof fell in a cloud of dust poor lord hampton now hell be in that old house forever i came too late now i cant do anything to help him the bulldozers were ready to pull down the rest of the house a moment before they did so kathy saw a blinding light rising slowly above the house for a moment the house looked the way it did in the past full of glamour then it fell to pieces only dust bricks and stones were left where once the beautiful home of lord hampton had stood kathy looked at the light shining in the air it became dimmer as it travelled higher then she thought she heard the voice call goodbye kathy goodbye have a safe journey lord hampton goodbye move along miss its dangerous round here kathy smiled at the workman suddenly she felt very happy she did not go back to the helping hand office nobody telephoned her or came to her home but kathy didnt mind she waited quietly for a message or sign it came at last through an article on the front page of the local paper which began with the words kathy tore the newspaper into small pieces and threw them out of the window the wind lifted the pieces high into the air she didnt even look at them the past was over and now she was in a hurry to get to the new helping hand office she wanted to see her friends again but most of all she wanted to see william meanwhile william was reading the same article at home when he finished he tore his newspaper into pieces and threw them into the dustbin then he took his coat and left he walked down the road whistling as he went then he saw mrs smith coming out to collect her milk from the doorstep good morning mrs smith there goes a young man in love best of luck william it was the day helping hand was going to move to the new offices the old building was full of people who were anxious to help but it did not take more than a moment for william to realise that kathy was not there suddenly he felt miserable he sat in his chair and closed his eyes shes right of course who would want to be with a selfish person like me i almost called her a liar and i wasnt there when she needed me are you speaking to me kathy im so sorry about what happened i was selfish and cruel to you but i promise youll never be lonely or afraid again william took kathys hands into his and looked into her eyes she looked back at him hampton house was forget hampton house its part of the past yes but if we have any future together i mean if we have a future together oh kathy i want that more than anything but can you forgive me for the way i acted i will never doubt you again of course i will william oh kathy i love you so much i think thats everything sue with one of the removal men was looking round to see if everything had been cleared away she saw william and kathy holding hands looking into each others eyes well youd better put those two in the van its the only way well get them to the new offices they both turned to look at all the people watching them william threw his head back and laughed so did everyone else their joy full laughter filling the building for the last time the end
