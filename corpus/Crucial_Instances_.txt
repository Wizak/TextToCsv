 edith wharton table of contents i the duchess at prayer ii the angel at the grave iii the recovery iv copy a dialogue v the rembrandt vi the moving finger vii the confessional the duchess at prayer have you ever questioned the long shuttered front of an old italian house that motionless mask smooth mute equivocal as the face of a priest behind which buzz the secrets of the confessional other houses declare the activities they shelter they are the clear expressive cuticle of a life flowing close to the surface but the old palace in its narrow street the villa on its cypresshooded hill are as impenetrable as death the tall windows are like blind eyes the great door is a shut mouth inside there may be sunshine the scent of myrtles and a pulse of life through all the arteries of the huge frame or a mortal solitude where bats lodge in the disjointed stones and the keys rust in unused doors ii from the loggia with its vanishing frescoes i looked down an avenue barred by a ladder of cypressshadows to the ducal escutcheon and mutilated vases of the gate flat noon lay on the gardens on fountains porticoes and grottoes below the terrace where a chromecolored lichen had sheeted the balustrade as with fine laminae of gold vineyards stooped to the rich valley clasped in hills the lower slopes were strewn with white villages like stars spangling a summer dusk and beyond these fold on fold of blue mountain clear as gauze against the sky the august air was lifeless but it seemed light and vivifying after the atmosphere of the shrouded rooms through which i had been led their chill was on me and i hugged the sunshine the duchesss apartments are beyond said the old man he was the oldest man i had ever seen so sucked back into the past that he seemed more like a memory than a living being the one trait linking him with the actual was the fixity with which his small saurian eye held the pocket that as i entered had yielded a lira to the gatekeepers child he went on without removing his eye for two hundred years nothing has been changed in the apartments of the duchess and no one lives here now no one sir the duke goes to como for the summer season i had moved to the other end of the loggia below me through hanging groves white roofs and domes flashed like a smile and thats vicenza proprio the old man extended fingers as lean as the hands fading from the walls behind us you see the palace roof over there just to the left of the basilica the one with the row of statues like birds taking flight thats the dukes town palace built by palladio and does the duke come there never in winter he goes to rome and the palace and the villa are always closed as you see always how long has this been since i can remember i looked into his eyes they were like tarnished metal mirrors reflecting nothing that must be a long time i said involuntarily a long time he assented i looked down on the gardens an opulence of dahlias overran the boxborders between cypresses that cut the sunshine like basalt shafts bees hung above the lavender lizards sunned themselves on the benches and slipped through the cracks of the dry basins everywhere were vanishing traces of that fantastic horticulture of which our dull age has lost the art down the alleys maimed statues stretched their arms like rows of whining beggars fauneared terms grinned in the thickets and above the laurustinus walls rose the mock ruin of a temple falling into real ruin in the bright disintegrating air the glare was blinding let us go in i said the old man pushed open a heavy door behind which the cold lurked like a knife the duchesss apartments he said overhead and around us the same evanescent frescoes under foot the same scagliola volutes unrolled themselves interminably ebony cabinets with inlay of precious marbles in cunning perspective alternated down the room with the tarnished efflorescence of gilt consoles supporting chinese monsters and from the chimneypanel a gentleman in the spanish habit haughtily ignored us duke ercole ii the old man explained by the genoese priest it was a narrowbrowed face sallow as a wax effigy highnosed and cautiouslidded as though modelled by priestly hands the lips weak and vain rather than cruel a quibbling mouth that would have snapped at verbal errors like a lizard catching flies but had never learned the shape of a round yes or no one of the dukes hands rested on the head of a dwarf a simian creature with pearl earrings and fantastic dress the other turned the pages of a folio propped on a skull beyond is the duchesss bedroom the old man reminded me here the shutters admitted but two narrow shafts of light gold bars deepening the subaqueous gloom on a dais the bedstead grim nuptial official lifted its baldachin a yellow christ agonized between the curtains and across the room a lady smiled at us from the chimneybreast the old man unbarred a shutter and the light touched her face such a face it was with a flicker of laughter over it like the wind on a june meadow and a singular tender pliancy of mien as though one of tiepolos lenient goddesses had been busked into the stiff sheath of a seventeenth century dress no one has slept here said the old man since the duchess violante and she was the lady there first duchess of duke ercole ii he drew a key from his pocket and unlocked a door at the farther end of the room the chapel he said this is the duchesss balcony as i turned to follow him the duchess tossed me a sidelong smile i stepped into a grated tribune above a chapel festooned with stucco pictures of bituminous saints mouldered between the pilasters the artificial roses in the altarvases were gray with dust and age and under the cobwebby rosettes of the vaulting a birds nest clung before the altar stood a row of tattered armchairs and i drew back at sight of a figure kneeling near them the duchess the old man whispered by the cavaliere bernini it was the image of a woman in furred robes and spreading fraise her hand lifted her face addressed to the tabernacle there was a strangeness in the sight of that immovable presence locked in prayer before an abandoned shrine her face was hidden and i wondered whether it were grief or gratitude that raised her hands and drew her eyes to the altar where no living prayer joined her marble invocation i followed my guide down the tribune steps impatient to see what mystic version of such terrestrial graces the ingenious artist had found the cavaliere was master of such arts the duchesss attitude was one of transport as though heavenly airs fluttered her laces and the lovelocks escaping from her coif i saw how admirably the sculptor had caught the poise of her head the tender slope of the shoulder then i crossed over and looked into her face it was a frozen horror never have hate revolt and agony so possessed a human countenance the old man crossed himself and shuffled his feet on the marble the duchess violante he repeated the same as in the picture eh the same but the face what does it mean he shrugged his shoulders and turned deaf eyes on me then he shot a glance round the sepulchral place clutched my sleeve and said close to my ear it was not always so what was not the face so terrible the duchesss face the statues it changed after after it was put here the statues face changed he mistook my bewilderment for incredulity and his confidential finger dropped from my sleeve eh thats the story i tell what ive heard what do i know he resumed his senile shuffle across the marble this is a bad place to stay in no one comes here its too cold but the gentleman said i must see everything i let the lire sound so i must and hear everything this story now from whom did you have it his hand stole back one that saw it by god that saw it my grandmother then im a very old man your grandmother your grandmother was the duchesss serving girl with respect to you your grandmother two hundred years ago is it too long ago thats as god pleases i am a very old man and she was a very old woman when i was born when she died she was as black as a miraculous virgin and her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole she told me the story when i was a little boy she told it to me out there in the garden on a bench by the fishpond one summer night of the year she died it must be true for i can show you the very bench we sat on iii noon lay heavier on the gardens not our live humming warmth but the stale exhalation of dead summers the very statues seemed to drowse like watchers by a deathbed lizards shot out of the cracked soil like flames and the bench in the laurustinusniche was strewn with the blue varnished bodies of dead flies before us lay the fishpond a yellow marble slab above rotting secrets the villa looked across it composed as a dead face with the cypresses flanking it for candles iv impossible you say that my mothers mother should have been the duchesss maid what do i know it is so long since anything has happened here that the old things seem nearer perhaps than to those who live in cities but how else did she know about the statue then answer me that sir that she saw with her eyes i can swear to and never smiled again so she told me till they put her first child in her arms for she was taken to wife by the stewards son antonio the same who had carried the letters but where am i ah well she was a mere slip you understand my grandmother when the duchess died a niece of the upper maid nencia and suffered about the duchess because of her pranks and the funny songs she knew its possible you think she may have heard from others what she afterward fancied she had seen herself how that is its not for an unlettered man to say though indeed i myself seem to have seen many of the things she told me this is a strange place no one comes here nothing changes and the old memories stand up as distinct as the statues in the garden it began the summer after they came back from the brenta duke ercole had married the lady from venice you must know it was a gay city then im told with laughter and music on the water and the days slipped by like boats running with the tide well to humor her he took her back the first autumn to the brenta her father it appears had a grand palace there with such gardens bowlingalleys grottoes and casinos as never were gondolas bobbing at the watergates a stable full of gilt coaches a theatre full of players and kitchens and offices full of cooks and lackeys to serve up chocolate all day long to the fine ladies in masks and furbelows with their pet dogs and their blackamoors and their abates eh i know it all as if id been there for nencia you see my grandmothers aunt travelled with the duchess and came back with her eyes round as platters and not a word to say for the rest of the year to any of the lads whod courted her here in vicenza what happened there i dont know my grandmother could never get at the rights of it for nencia was mute as a fish where her lady was concerned but when they came back to vicenza the duke ordered the villa set in order and in the spring he brought the duchess here and left her she looked happy enough my grandmother said and seemed no object for pity perhaps after all it was better than being shut up in vicenza in the tall painted rooms where priests came and went as softly as cats prowling for birds and the duke was forever closeted in his library talking with learned men the duke was a scholar you noticed he was painted with a book well those that can read em make out that theyre full of wonderful things as a man thats been to a fair across the mountains will always tell his people at home it was beyond anything theyll ever see as for the duchess she was all for music playacting and young company the duke was a silent man stepping quietly with his eyes down as though hed just come from confession when the duchesss lapdog yapped at his heels he danced like a man in a swarm of hornets when the duchess laughed he winced as if youd drawn a diamond across a windowpane and the duchess was always laughing when she first came to the villa she was very busy laying out the gardens designing grottoes planting groves and planning all manner of agreeable surprises in the way of waterjets that drenched you unexpectedly and hermits in caves and wild men that jumped at you out of thickets she had a very pretty taste in such matters but after a while she tired of it and there being no one for her to talk to but her maids and the chaplain a clumsy man deep in his books why she would have strolling players out from vicenza mountebanks and fortunetellers from the marketplace travelling doctors and astrologers and all manner of trained animals still it could be seen that the poor lady pined for company and her waiting women who loved her were glad when the cavaliere ascanio the dukes cousin came to live at the vineyard across the valley you see the pinkish house over there in the mulberries with a red roof and a pigeoncote the cavaliere ascanio was a cadet of one of the great venetian houses pezzi grossi of the golden book he had been meant for the church i believe but what he set fighting above praying and cast in his lot with the captain of the duke of mantuas bravi himself a venetian of good standing but a little at odds with the law well the next i know the cavaliere was in venice again perhaps not in good odor on account of his connection with the gentleman i speak of some say he tried to carry off a nun from the convent of santa croce how that may be i cant say but my grandmother declared he had enemies there and the end of it was that on some pretext or other the ten banished him to vicenza there of course the duke being his kinsman had to show him a civil face and that was how he first came to the villa he was a fine young man beautiful as a saint sebastian a rare musician who sang his own songs to the lute in a way that used to make my grandmothers heart melt and run through her body like mulled wine he had a good word for everybody too and was always dressed in the french fashion and smelt as sweet as a beanfield and every soul about the place welcomed the sight of him well the duchess it seemed welcomed it too youth will have youth and laughter turns to laughter and the two matched each other like the candlesticks on an altar the duchess youve seen her portrait but to hear my grandmother sir it no more approached her than a weed comes up to a rose the cavaliere indeed as became a poet paragoned her in his song to all the pagan goddesses of antiquity and doubtless these were finer to look at than mere women but so it seemed was she for to believe my grandmother she made other women look no more than the big french fashiondoll that used to be shown on ascension days in the piazza she was one at any rate that needed no outlandish finery to beautify her whatever dress she wore became her as feathers fit the bird and her hair didnt get its color by bleaching on the housetop it glittered of itself like the threads in an easter chasuble and her skin was whiter than fine wheaten bread and her mouth as sweet as a ripe fig well sir you could no more keep them apart than the bees and the lavender they were always together singing bowling playing cup and ball walking in the gardens visiting the aviaries and petting her graces trickdogs and monkeys the duchess was as gay as a foal always playing pranks and laughing tricking out her animals like comedians disguising herself as a peasant or a nun you should have seen her one day pass herself off to the chaplain as a mendicant sister or teaching the lads and girls of the vineyards to dance and sing madrigals together the cavaliere had a singular ingenuity in planning such entertainments and the days were hardly long enough for their diversions but toward the end of the summer the duchess fell quiet and would hear only sad music and the two sat much together in the gazebo at the end of the garden it was there the duke found them one day when he drove out from vicenza in his gilt coach he came but once or twice a year to the villa and it was as my grandmother said just a part of her poor ladys illluck to be wearing that day the venetian habit which uncovered the shoulders in a way the duke always scowled at and her curls loose and powdered with gold well the three drank chocolate in the gazebo and what happened no one knew except that the duke on taking leave gave his cousin a seat in his carriage but the cavaliere never returned winter approaching and the poor lady thus finding herself once more alone it was surmised among her women that she must fall into a deeper depression of spirits but far from this being the case she displayed such cheerfulness and equanimity of humor that my grandmother for one was halfvexed with her for giving no more thought to the poor young man who all this time was eating his heart out in the house across the valley it is true she quitted her goldlaced gowns and wore a veil over her head but nencia would have it she looked the lovelier for the change and so gave the duke greater displeasure certain it is that the duke drove out oftener to the villa and though he found his lady always engaged in some innocent pursuit such as embroidery or music or playing games with her young women yet he always went away with a sour look and a whispered word to the chaplain now as to the chaplain my grandmother owned there had been a time when her grace had not handled him overwisely for according to nencia it seems that his reverence who seldom approached the duchess being buried in his library like a mouse in a cheese well one day he made bold to appeal to her for a sum of money a large sum nencia said to buy certain tall books a chest full of them that a foreign pedlar had brought him whereupon the duchess who could never abide a book breaks out at him with a laugh and a flash of her old spirit holy mother of god must i have more books about me i was nearly smothered with them in the first year of my marriage and the chaplain turning red at the affront she added you may buy them and welcome my good chaplain if you can find the money but as for me i am yet seeking a way to pay for my turquoise necklace and the statue of daphne at the end of the bowlinggreen and the indian parrot that my black boy brought me last michaelmas from the bohemians so you see ive no money to waste on trifles and as he backs out awkwardly she tosses at him over her shoulder you should pray to saint blandina to open the dukes pocket to which he returned very quietly your excellencys suggestion is an admirable one and i have already entreated that blessed martyr to open the dukes understanding thereat nencia said who was standing by the duchess flushed wonderfully red and waved him out of the room and then quick she cried to my grandmother who was too glad to run on such errands call me antonio the gardeners boy to the boxgarden ive a word to say to him about the new clovecarnations now i may not have told you sir that in the crypt under the chapel there has stood for more generations than a man can count a stone coffin containing a thighbone of the blessed saint blandina of lyons a relic offered ive been told by some great duke of france to one of our own dukes when they fought the turk together and the object ever since of particular veneration in this illustrious family now since the duchess had been left to herself it was observed she affected a fervent devotion to this relic praying often in the chapel and even causing the stone slab that covered the entrance to the crypt to be replaced by a wooden one that she might at will descend and kneel by the coffin this was matter of edification to all the household and should have been peculiarly pleasing to the chaplain but with respect to you he was the kind of man who brings a sour mouth to the eating of the sweetest apple however that may be the duchess when she dismissed him was seen running to the garden where she talked earnestly with the boy antonio about the new clovecarnations and the rest of the day she sat indoors and played sweetly on the virginal now nencia always had it in mind that her grace had made a mistake in refusing that request of the chaplains but she said nothing for to talk reason to the duchess was of no more use than praying for rain in a drought winter came early that year there was snow on the hills by all souls the wind stripped the gardens and the lemontrees were nipped in the lemonhouse the duchess kept her room in this black season sitting over the fire embroidering reading books of devotion which was a thing she had never done and praying frequently in the chapel as for the chaplain it was a place he never set foot in but to say mass in the morning with the duchess overhead in the tribune and the servants aching with rheumatism on the marble floor the chaplain himself hated the cold and galloped through the mass like a man with witches after him the rest of the day he spent in his library over a brazier with his eternal books youll wonder sir if im ever to get to the gist of the story and ive gone slowly i own for fear of whats coming well the winter was long and hard when it fell cold the duke ceased to come out from vicenza and not a soul had the duchess to speak to but her maidservants and the gardeners about the place yet it was wonderful my grandmother said how she kept her brave colors and her spirits only it was remarked that she prayed longer in the chapel where a brazier was kept burning for her all day when the young are denied their natural pleasures they turn often enough to religion and it was a mercy as my grandmother said that she who had scarce a live sinner to speak to should take such comfort in a dead saint my grandmother seldom saw her that winter for though she showed a brave front to all she kept more and more to herself choosing to have only nencia about her and dismissing even her when she went to pray for her devotion had that mark of true piety that she wished it not to be observed so that nencia had strict orders on the chaplains approach to warn her mistress if she happened to be in prayer well the winter passed and spring was well forward when my grandmother one evening had a bad fright that it was her own fault i wont deny for shed been down the limewalk with antonio when her aunt fancied her to be stitching in her chamber and seeing a sudden light in nencias window she took fright lest her disobedience be found out and ran up quickly through the laurelgrove to the house her way lay by the chapel and as she crept past it meaning to slip in through the scullery and groping her way for the dark had fallen and the moon was scarce up she heard a crash close behind her as though someone had dropped from a window of the chapel the young fools heart turned over but she looked round as she ran and there sure enough was a man scuttling across the terrace and as he doubled the corner of the house my grandmother swore she caught the whisk of the chaplains skirts now that was a strange thing certainly for why should the chaplain be getting out of the chapel window when he might have passed through the door for you may have noticed sir theres a door leads from the chapel into the saloon on the ground floor the only other way out being through the duchesss tribune well my grandmother turned the matter over and next time she met antonio in the limewalk which by reason of her fright was not for some days she laid before him what had happened but to her surprise he only laughed and said you little simpleton he wasnt getting out of the window he was trying to look in and not another word could she get from him so the season moved on to easter and news came the duke had gone to rome for that holy festivity his comings and goings made no change at the villa and yet there was no one there but felt easier to think his yellow face was on the far side of the apennines unless perhaps it was the chaplain well it was one day in may that the duchess who had walked long with nencia on the terrace rejoicing at the sweetness of the prospect and the pleasant scent of the gillyflowers in the stone vases the duchess toward midday withdrew to her rooms giving orders that her dinner should be served in her bedchamber my grandmother helped to carry in the dishes and observed she said the singular beauty of the duchess who in honor of the fine weather had put on a gown of shotsilver and hung her bare shoulders with pearls so that she looked fit to dance at court with an emperor she had ordered too a rare repast for a lady that heeded so little what she ate jellies gamepasties fruits in syrup spiced cakes and a flagon of greek wine and she nodded and clapped her hands as the women set it before her saying again and again i shall eat well today but presently another mood seized her she turned from the table called for her rosary and said to nencia the fine weather has made me neglect my devotions i must say a litany before i dine she ordered the women out and barred the door as her custom was and nencia and my grandmother went downstairs to work in the linenroom now the linenroom gives on the courtyard and suddenly my grandmother saw a strange sight approaching first up the avenue came the dukes carriage whom all thought to be in rome and after it drawn by a long string of mules and oxen a cart carrying what looked like a kneeling figure wrapped in deathclothes the strangeness of it struck the girl dumb and the dukes coach was at the door before she had the wit to cry out that it was coming nencia when she saw it went white and ran out of the room my grandmother followed scared by her face and the two fled along the corridor to the chapel on the way they met the chaplain deep in a book who asked in surprise where they were running and when they said to announce the dukes arrival he fell into such astonishment and asked them so many questions and uttered such ohs and ahs that by the time he let them by the duke was at their heels nencia reached the chapeldoor first and cried out that the duke was coming and before she had a reply he was at her side with the chaplain following a moment later the door opened and there stood the duchess she held her rosary in one hand and had drawn a scarf over her shoulders but they shone through it like the moon in a mist and her countenance sparkled with beauty the duke took her hand with a bow madam he said i could have had no greater happiness than thus to surprise you at your devotions my own happiness she replied would have been greater had your excellency prolonged it by giving me notice of your arrival had you expected me madam said he your appearance could scarcely have been more fitted to the occasion few ladies of your youth and beauty array themselves to venerate a saint as they would to welcome a lover sir she answered having never enjoyed the latter opportunity i am constrained to make the most of the former whats that she cried falling back and the rosary dropped from her hand there was a loud noise at the other end of the saloon as of a heavy object being dragged down the passage and presently a dozen men were seen haling across the threshold the shrouded thing from the oxcart the duke waved his hand toward it that said he madam is a tribute to your extraordinary piety i have heard with peculiar satisfaction of your devotion to the blessed relics in this chapel and to commemorate a zeal which neither the rigors of winter nor the sultriness of summer could abate i have ordered a sculptured image of you marvellously executed by the cavaliere bernini to be placed before the altar over the entrance to the crypt the duchess who had grown pale nevertheless smiled playfully at this as to commemorating my piety she said i recognize there one of your excellencys pleasantries a pleasantry the duke interrupted and he made a sign to the men who had now reached the threshold of the chapel in an instant the wrappings fell from the figure and there knelt the duchess to the life a cry of wonder rose from all but the duchess herself stood whiter than the marble you will see says the duke this is no pleasantry but a triumph of the incomparable berninis chisel the likeness was done from your miniature portrait by the divine elisabetta sirani which i sent to the master some six months ago with what results all must admire six months cried the duchess and seemed about to fall but his excellency caught her by the hand nothing he said could better please me than the excessive emotion you display for true piety is ever modest and your thanks could not take a form that better became you and now says he to the men let the image be put in place by this life seemed to have returned to the duchess and she answered him with a deep reverence that i should be overcome by so unexpected a grace your excellency admits to be natural but what honors you accord it is my privilege to accept and i entreat only that in mercy to my modesty the image be placed in the remotest part of the chapel at that the duke darkened what you would have this masterpiece of a renowned chisel which i disguise not cost me the price of a good vineyard in gold pieces you would have it thrust out of sight like the work of a village stonecutter it is my semblance not the sculptors work i desire to conceal it you are fit for my house madam you are fit for gods and entitled to the place of honor in both bring the statue forward you dawdlers he called out to the men the duchess fell back submissively you are right sir as always but i would at least have the image stand on the left of the altar that looking up it may behold your excellencys seat in the tribune a pretty thought madam for which i thank you but i design before long to put my companion image on the other side of the altar and the wifes place as you know is at her husbands right hand true my lord but again if my poor presentment is to have the unmerited honor of kneeling beside yours why not place both before the altar where it is our habit to pray in life and where madam should we kneel if they took our places besides says the duke still speaking very blandly i have a more particular purpose in placing your image over the entrance to the crypt for not only would i thereby mark your special devotion to the blessed saint who rests there but by sealing up the opening in the pavement would assure the perpetual preservation of that holy martyrs bones which hitherto have been too thoughtlessly exposed to sacrilegious attempts what attempts my lord cries the duchess no one enters this chapel without my leave so i have understood and can well believe from what i have learned of your piety yet at night a malefactor might break in through a window madam and your excellency not know it im a light sleeper said the duchess the duke looked at her gravely indeed said he a bad sign at your age i must see that you are provided with a sleepingdraught the duchesss eyes filled you would deprive me then of the consolation of visiting those venerable relics i would have you keep eternal guard over them knowing no one to whose care they may more fittingly be entrusted by this the image was brought close to the wooden slab that covered the entrance to the crypt when the duchess springing forward placed herself in the way sir let the statue be put in place tomorrow and suffer me tonight to say a last prayer beside those holy bones the duke stepped instantly to her side well thought madam i will go down with you now and we will pray together sir your long absences have alas given me the habit of solitary devotion and i confess that any presence is distracting madam i accept your rebuke hitherto it is true the duties of my station have constrained me to long absences but henceforward i remain with you while you live shall we go down into the crypt together no for i fear for your excellencys ague the air there is excessively damp the more reason you should no longer be exposed to it and to prevent the intemperance of your zeal i will at once make the place inaccessible the duchess at this fell on her knees on the slab weeping excessively and lifting her hands to heaven oh she cried you are cruel sir to deprive me of access to the sacred relics that have enabled me to support with resignation the solitude to which your excellencys duties have condemned me and if prayer and meditation give me any authority to pronounce on such matters suffer me to warn you sir that i fear the blessed saint blandina will punish us for thus abandoning her venerable remains the duke at this seemed to pause for he was a pious man and my grandmother thought she saw him exchange a glance with the chaplain who stepping timidly forward with his eyes on the ground said there is indeed much wisdom in her excellencys words but i would suggest sir that her pious wish might be met and the saint more conspicuously honored by transferring the relics from the crypt to a place beneath the altar true cried the duke and it shall be done at once but thereat the duchess rose to her feet with a terrible look no she cried by the body of god for it shall not be said that after your excellency has chosen to deny every request i addressed to him i owe his consent to the solicitation of another the chaplain turned red and the duke yellow and for a moment neither spoke then the duke said here are words enough madam do you wish the relics brought up from the crypt i wish nothing that i owe to anothers intervention put the image in place then says the duke furiously and handed her grace to a chair she sat there my grandmother said straight as an arrow her hands locked her head high her eyes on the duke while the statue was dragged to its place then she stood up and turned away as she passed by nencia call me antonio she whispered but before the words were out of her mouth the duke stepped between them madam says he all smiles now i have travelled straight from rome to bring you the sooner this proof of my esteem i lay last night at monselice and have been on the road since daybreak will you not invite me to supper surely my lord said the duchess it shall be laid in the diningparlor within the hour why not in your chamber and at once madam since i believe it is your custom to sup there in my chamber says the duchess in disorder have you anything against it he asked assuredly not sir if you will give me time to prepare myself i will wait in your cabinet said the duke at that said my grandmother the duchess gave one look as the souls in hell may have looked when the gates closed on our lord then she called nencia and passed to her chamber what happened there my grandmother could never learn but that the duchess in great haste dressed herself with extraordinary splendor powdering her hair with gold painting her face and bosom and covering herself with jewels till she shone like our lady of loreto and hardly were these preparations complete when the duke entered from the cabinet followed by the servants carrying supper thereupon the duchess dismissed nencia and what follows my grandmother learned from a pantrylad who brought up the dishes and waited in the cabinet for only the dukes bodyservant entered the bedchamber well according to this boy sir who was looking and listening with his whole body as it were because he had never before been suffered so near the duchess it appears that the noble couple sat down in great good humor the duchess playfully reproving her husband for his long absence while the duke swore that to look so beautiful was the best way of punishing him in this tone the talk continued with such gay sallies on the part of the duchess such tender advances on the dukes that the lad declared they were for all the world like a pair of lovers courting on a summers night in the vineyard and so it went till the servant brought in the mulled wine ah the duke was saying at that moment this agreeable evening repays me for the many dull ones i have spent away from you nor do i remember to have enjoyed such laughter since the afternoon last year when we drank chocolate in the gazebo with my cousin ascanio and that reminds me he said is my cousin in good health i have no reports of it says the duchess but your excellency should taste these figs stewed in malmsey i am in the mood to taste whatever you offer said he and as she helped him to the figs he added if my enjoyment were not complete as it is i could almost wish my cousin ascanio were with us the fellow is rare good company at supper what do you say madam i hear hes still in the country shall we send for him to join us ah said the duchess with a sigh and a languishing look i see your excellency wearies of me already i madam ascanio is a capital good fellow but to my mind his chief merit at this moment is his absence it inclines me so tenderly to him that by god i could empty a glass to his good health with that the duke caught up his goblet and signed to the servant to fill the duchesss heres to the cousin he cried standing who has the good taste to stay away when hes not wanted i drink to his very long life and you madam at this the duchess who had sat staring at him with a changed face rose also and lifted her glass to her lips and i to his happy death says she in a wild voice and as she spoke the empty goblet dropped from her hand and she fell face down on the floor the duke shouted to her women that she had swooned and they came and lifted her to the bed she suffered horribly all night nencia said twisting herself like a heretic at the stake but without a word escaping her the duke watched by her and toward daylight sent for the chaplain but by this she was unconscious and her teeth being locked our lords body could not be passed through them the duke announced to his relations that his lady had died after partaking too freely of spiced wine and an omelet of carps roe at a supper she had prepared in honor of his return and the next year he brought home a new duchess who gave him a son and five daughters v the sky had turned to a steel gray against which the villa stood out sallow and inscrutable a wind strayed through the gardens loosening here and there a yellow leaf from the sycamores and the hills across the valley were purple as thunderclouds and the statue i asked ah the statue well sir this is what my grandmother told me here on this very bench where were sitting the poor child who worshipped the duchess as a girl of her years will worship a beautiful kind mistress spent a night of horror you may fancy shut out from her ladys room hearing the cries that came from it and seeing as she crouched in her corner the women rush to and fro with wild looks the dukes lean face in the door and the chaplain skulking in the antechamber with his eyes on his breviary no one minded her that night or the next morning and toward dusk when it became known the duchess was no more the poor girl felt the pious wish to say a prayer for her dead mistress she crept to the chapel and stole in unobserved the place was empty and dim but as she advanced she heard a low moaning and coming in front of the statue she saw that its face the day before so sweet and smiling had the look on it that you know and the moaning seemed to come from its lips my grandmother turned cold but something she said afterward kept her from calling or shrieking out and she turned and ran from the place in the passage she fell in a swoon and when she came to her senses in her own chamber she heard that the duke had locked the chapel door and forbidden any to set foot there the place was never opened again till the duke died some ten years later and then it was that the other servants going in with the new heir saw for the first time the horror that my grandmother had kept in her bosom and the crypt i asked has it never been opened heaven forbid sir cried the old man crossing himself was it not the duchesss express wish that the relics should not be disturbed the angel at the grave the house stood a few yards back from the elmshaded village street in that semipublicity sometimes cited as a democratic protest against oldworld standards of domestic exclusiveness this candid exposure to the public eye is more probably a result of the gregariousness which in the new england bosom oddly coexists with a shrinking from direct social contact most of the inmates of such houses preferring that furtive intercourse which is the result of observations through shuttered windows and a categorical acquaintance with the neighboring clotheslines the house however faced its public with a difference for sixty years it had written itself with a capital letter had selfconsciously squared itself in the eye of an admiring nation the most searching inroads of village intimacy hardly counted in a household that opened on the universe and a lady whose doorbell was at any moment liable to be rung by visitors from london or vienna was not likely to flutter upstairs when she observed a neighbor stepping over the solitary inmate of the anson house owed this induration of the social texture to the most conspicuous accident in her annals the fact that she was the only granddaughter of the great orestes anson she had been born as it were into a museum and cradled in a glass case with a label the first foundations of her consciousness being built on the rock of her grandfathers celebrity to a little girl who acquires her earliest knowledge of literature through a reader embellished with fragments of her ancestors prose that personage necessarily fills an heroic space in the foreground of life to communicate with ones past through the impressive medium of print to have as it were a footing in every library in the country and an acknowledged kinship with that worlddiffused clan the descendants of the great was to be pledged to a standard of manners that amazingly simplified the lesser relations of life the village street on which paulina ansons youth looked out led to all the capitals of europe and over the roads of intercommunication unseen caravans bore back to the elmshaded house the tribute of an admiring world fate seemed to have taken a direct share in fitting paulina for her part as the custodian of this historic dwelling it had long been secretly regarded as a visitation by the great mans family that he had left no son and that his daughters were not intellectual the ladies themselves were the first to lament their deficiency to own that nature had denied them the gift of making the most of their opportunities a profound veneration for their parent and an unswerving faith in his doctrines had not amended their congenital incapacity to understand what he had written laura who had her moments of mute rebellion against destiny had sometimes thought how much easier it would have been if their progenitor had been a poet for she could recite with feeling portions of the culprit fay and of the poems of mrs hemans and phoebe who was more conspicuous for memory than imagination kept an album filled with selections but the great man was a philosopher and to both daughters respiration was difficult on the cloudy heights of metaphysic the situation would have been intolerable but for the fact that while phoebe and laura were still at school their fathers fame had passed from the open ground of conjecture to the chill privacy of certitude dr anson had in fact achieved one of those anticipated immortalities not uncommon at a time when people were apt to base their literary judgments on their emotions and when to affect plain food and despise england went a long way toward establishing a mans intellectual preeminence thus when the daughters were called on to strike a filial attitude about their parents pedestal there was little to do but to pose gracefully and point upward and there are spines to which the immobility of worship is not a strain a legend had by this time crystallized about the great orestes and it was of more immediate interest to the public to hear what brand of tea he drank and whether he took off his boots in the hall than to rouse the drowsy echo of his dialectic a great man never draws so near his public as when it has become unnecessary to read his books and is still interesting to know what he eats for breakfast as recorders of their parents domestic habits as pious scavengers of his wastepaper basket the misses anson were unexcelled they always had an interesting anecdote to impart to the literary pilgrim and the tact with which in later years they intervened between the public and the growing inaccessibility of its idol sent away many an enthusiast satisfied to have touched the veil before the sanctuary still it was felt especially by old mrs anson who survived her husband for some years that phoebe and laura were not worthy of their privileges there had been a third daughter so unworthy of hers that she had married a distant cousin who had taken her to live in a new western community where the works of orestes anson had not yet become a part of the civic consciousness but of this daughter little was said and she was tacitly understood to be excluded from the family heritage of fame in time however it appeared that the traditional penny with which she had been cut off had been invested to unexpected advantage and the interest on it when she died returned to the anson house in the shape of a granddaughter who was at once felt to be what mrs anson called a compensation it was mrs ansons firm belief that the remotest operations of nature were governed by the centripetal force of her husbands greatness and that paulinas exceptional intelligence could be explained only on the ground that she was designed to act as the guardian of the family temple the house by the time paulina came to live in it had already acquired the publicity of a place of worship not the perfumed chapel of a romantic idolatry but the cold clean empty meetinghouse of ethical enthusiasms the ladies lived on its outskirts as it were in cells that left the central fane undisturbed the very position of the furniture had come to have a ritual significance the sparse ornaments were the offerings of kindred intellects the steel engravings by raphael morghen marked the via sacra of a european tour and the blackwalnut desk with its bronze inkstand modelled on the pantheon was the altar of this bleak temple of thought to a child compact of enthusiasms and accustomed to pasture them on the scanty herbage of a new social soil the atmosphere of the old house was full of floating nourishment in the compressed perspective of paulinas outlook it stood for a monument of ruined civilizations and its white portico opened on legendary distances its very aspect was impressive to eyes that had first surveyed life from the jigsaw residence of a rawedged western town the highceilinged rooms with their panelled walls their polished mahogany their portraits of triplestocked ancestors and of ringleted females in crayon furnished the child with the historic scenery against which a young imagination constructs its vision of the past to other eyes the cold spotless thinlyfurnished interior might have suggested the shuttered mind of a maidenlady who associates fresh air and sunlight with dust and discoloration but it is the eye which supplies the coloringmatter and paulinas brimmed with the richest hues nevertheless the house did not immediately dominate her she had her confused outreachings toward other centres of sensation her vague intuition of a heliocentric system but the attraction of habit the steady pressure of example gradually fixed her roving allegiance and she bent her neck to the yoke vanity had a share in her subjugation for it had early been discovered that she was the only person in the family who could read her grandfathers works the fact that she had perused them with delight at an age when even presupposing a metaphysical bias it was impossible for her to understand them seemed to her aunts and grandmother sure evidence of predestination paulina was to be the interpreter of the oracle and the philosophic fumes so vertiginous to meaner minds would throw her into the needed condition of clairvoyance nothing could have been more genuine than the emotion on which this theory was based paulina in fact delighted in her grandfathers writings his sonorous periods his mystic vocabulary his bold flights into the rarefied air of the abstract were thrilling to a fancy unhampered by the need of definitions this purely verbal pleasure was supplemented later by the excitement of gathering up crumbs of meaning from the rhetorical board what could have been more stimulating than to construct the theory of a girlish world out of the fragments of this titanic cosmogony before paulinas opinions had reached the stage when ossification sets in their form was fatally predetermined the fact that dr anson had died and that his apotheosis had taken place before his young priestesss induction to the temple made her ministrations easier and more inspiring there were no little personal traits such as the great mans manner of helping himself to salt or the guttural cluck that started the wheels of speech to distract the eye of young veneration from the central fact of his divinity a man whom one knows only through a crayon portrait and a dozen yellowing tomes on freewill and intuition is at least secure from the belittling effects of intimacy paulina thus grew up in a world readjusted to the fact of her grandfathers greatness and as each organism draws from its surroundings the kind of nourishment most needful to its growth so from this somewhat colorless conception she absorbed warmth brightness and variety paulina was the type of woman who transmutes thought into sensation and nurses a theory in her bosom like a child in due course mrs anson passed away no one died in the anson vocabulary and paulina became more than ever the foremost figure of the commemorative group laura and phoebe content to leave their fathers glory in more competent hands placidly lapsed into needlework and fiction and their niece stepped into immediate prominence as the chief authority on the great man historians who were getting up the period wrote to consult her and to borrow documents ladies with inexplicable yearnings begged for an interpretation of phrases which had influenced them but which they had not quite understood critics applied to her to verify some doubtful citation or to decide some disputed point in chronology and the great tide of thought and investigation kept up a continuous murmur on the quiet shores of her life an explorer of another kind disembarked there one day in the shape of a young man to whom paulina was primarily a kissable girl with an afterthought in the shape of a grandfather from the outset it had been impossible to fix hewlett winsloes attention on dr anson the young man behaved with the innocent profanity of infants sporting on a tomb his excuse was that he came from new york a cimmerian outskirt which survived in paulinas geography only because dr anson had gone there once or twice to lecture the curious thing was that she should have thought it worth while to find excuses for young winsloe the fact that she did so had not escaped the attention of the village but people after a gasp of awe said it was the most natural thing in the world that a girl like paulina anson should think of marrying it would certainly seem a little odd to see a man in the house but young winsloe would of course understand that the doctors books were not to be disturbed and that he must go down to the orchard to smoke the village had barely framed this modus vivendi when it was convulsed by the announcement that young winsloe declined to live in the house on any terms hang going down to the orchard to smoke he meant to take his wife to new york the village drew its breath and watched did persephone snatched from the warm fields of enna peer halfconsentingly down the abyss that opened at her feet paulina it must be owned hung a moment over the black gulf of temptation she would have found it easy to cope with a deliberate disregard of her grandfathers rights but young winsloes unconsciousness of that shadowy claim was as much a natural function as the falling of leaves on a grave his love was an embodiment of the perpetual renewal which to some tender spirits seems a crueller process than decay on women of paulinas mould this piety toward implicit demands toward the ghosts of dead duties walking unappeased among usurping passions has a stronger hold than any tangible bond people said that she gave up young winsloe because her aunts disapproved of her leaving them but such disapproval as reached her was an emanation from the walls of the house from the bare desk the faded portraits the dozen yellowing tomes that no hand but hers ever lifted from the shelf ii after that the house possessed her as if conscious of its victory it imposed a conquerors claims it had once been suggested that she should write a life of her grandfather and the task from which she had shrunk as from a toooppressive privilege now shaped itself into a justification of her course in a burst of filial pantheism she tried to lose herself in the vast ancestral consciousness her one refuge from scepticism was a blind faith in the magnitude and the endurance of the idea to which she had sacrificed her life and with a passionate instinct of selfpreservation she labored to fortify her position the preparations for the life led her through byways that the most scrupulous of the previous biographers had left unexplored she accumulated her material with a blind animal patience unconscious of fortuitous risks the years stretched before her like some vast blank page spread out to receive the record of her toil and she had a mystic conviction that she would not die till her work was accomplished the aunts sustained by no such high purpose withdrew in turn to their respective divisions of the anson plot and paulina remained alone with her task she was forty when the book was completed she had travelled little in her life and it had become more and more difficult to her to leave the house even for a day but the dread of entrusting her document to a strange hand made her decide to carry it herself to the publisher on the way to boston she had a sudden vision of the loneliness to which this last parting condemned her all her youth all her dreams all her renunciations lay in that neat bundle on her knee it was not so much her grandfathers life as her own that she had written and the knowledge that it would come back to her in all the glorification of print was of no more help than to a mothers grief the assurance that the lad she must part with will return with epaulets she had naturally addressed herself to the firm which had published her grandfathers works its founder a personal friend of the philosophers had survived the olympian group of which he had been a subordinate member long enough to bestow his octogenarian approval on paulinas pious undertaking but he had died soon afterward and miss anson found herself confronted by his grandson a person with a brisk commercial view of his trade who was said to have put new blood into the firm this gentleman listened attentively fingering her manuscript as though literature were a tactile substance then with a confidential twist of his revolving chair he emitted the verdict we ought to have had this ten years sooner miss anson took the words as an allusion to the repressed avidity of her readers it has been a long time for the public to wait she solemnly assented the publisher smiled they havent waited he said she looked at him strangely havent waited no theyve gone off taken another train literatures like a big railwaystation now you know theres a train starting every minute people are not going to hang round the waitingroom if they cant get to a place when they want to they go somewhere else the application of this parable cost miss anson several minutes of throbbing silence at length she said then i am to understand that the public is no longer interested in in my grandfather she felt as though heaven must blast the lips that risked such a conjecture well its this way hes a name still of course people dont exactly want to be caught not knowing who he is but they dont want to spend two dollars finding out when they can look him up for nothing in any biographical dictionary miss ansons world reeled she felt herself adrift among mysterious forces and no more thought of prolonging the discussion than of opposing an earthquake with argument she went home carrying the manuscript like a wounded thing on the return journey she found herself travelling straight toward a fact that had lurked for months in the background of her life and that now seemed to await her on the very threshold the fact that fewer visitors came to the house she owned to herself that for the last four or five years the number had steadily diminished engrossed in her work she had noted the change only to feel thankful that she had fewer interruptions there had been a time when at the travelling season the bell rang continuously and the ladies of the house lived in a chronic state of best silks and expectancy it would have been impossible then to carry on any consecutive work and she now saw that the silence which had gathered round her task had been the hush of death not of his death the very walls cried out against the implication it was the worlds enthusiasm the worlds faith the worlds loyalty that had died a corrupt generation that had turned aside to worship the brazen serpent her heart yearned with a prophetic passion over the lost sheep straying in the wilderness but all great glories had their interlunar period and in due time her grandfather would once more flash fullorbed upon a darkling world the few friends to whom she confided her adventure reminded her with tender indignation that there were other publishers less subject to the fluctuations of the market but much as she had braved for her grandfather she could not again brave that particular probation she found herself in fact incapable of any immediate effort she had lost her way in a labyrinth of conjecture where her worst dread was that she might put her hand upon the clue she locked up the manuscript and sat down to wait if a pilgrim had come just then the priestess would have fallen on his neck but she continued to celebrate her rites alone it was a double solitude for she had always thought a great deal more of the people who came to see the house than of the people who came to see her she fancied that the neighbors kept a keen eye on the path to the house and there were days when the figure of a stranger strolling past the gate seemed to focus upon her the scorching sympathies of the village for a time she thought of travelling of going to europe or even to boston but to leave the house now would have seemed like deserting her post gradually her scattered energies centred themselves in the fierce resolve to understand what had happened she was not the woman to live long in an unmapped country or to accept as final her private interpretation of phenomena like a traveller in unfamiliar regions she began to store for future guidance the minutest natural signs unflinchingly she noted the accumulating symptoms of indifference that marked her grandfathers descent toward posterity she passed from the heights on which he had been grouped with the sages of his day to the lower level where he had come to be the friend of emerson the correspondent of hawthorne or later still the dr anson mentioned in their letters the change had taken place as slowly and imperceptibly as a natural process she could not say that any ruthless hand had stripped the leaves from the tree it was simply that among the evergreen glories of his group her grandfathers had proved deciduous she had still to ask herself why if the decay had been a natural process was it not the very pledge of renewal it was easier to find such arguments than to be convinced by them again and again she tried to drug her solicitude with analogies but at last she saw that such expedients were but the expression of a growing incredulity the best way of proving her faith in her grandfather was not to be afraid of his critics she had no notion where these shadowy antagonists lurked for she had never heard of the great mans doctrine being directly combated oblique assaults there must have been however parthian shots at the giant that none dared face and she thirsted to close with such assailants the difficulty was to find them she began by rereading the works thence she passed to the writers of the same school those whose rhetoric bloomed perennial in first readers from which her grandfathers prose had long since faded amid that clamor of faroff enthusiasms she detected no controversial note the little knot of olympians held their views in common with an earlychristian promiscuity they were continually proclaiming their admiration for each other the public joining as chorus in this guileless antiphon of praise and she discovered no traitor in their midst what then had happened was it simply that the main current of thought had set another way then why did the others survive why were they still marked down as tributaries to the philosophic stream this question carried her still farther afield and she pressed on with the passion of a champion whose reluctance to know the worst might be construed into a doubt of his cause at length slowly but inevitably an explanation shaped itself death had overtaken the doctrines about which her grandfather had draped his cloudy rhetoric they had disintegrated and been reabsorbed adding their little pile to the dust drifted about the mute lips of the sphinx the great mans contemporaries had survived not by reason of what they taught but of what they were and he who had been the mere mask through which they mouthed their lesson the instrument on which their tune was played lay buried deep among the obsolete tools of thought the discovery came to paulina suddenly she looked up one evening from her reading and it stood before her like a ghost it had entered her life with stealthy steps creeping close before she was aware of it she sat in the library among the carefullytended books and portraits and it seemed to her that she had been walled alive into a tomb hung with the effigies of dead ideas she felt a desperate longing to escape into the outer air where people toiled and loved and living sympathies went hand in hand it was the sense of wasted labor that oppressed her of two lives consumed in that ruthless process that uses generations of effort to build a single cell there was a dreary parallel between her grandfathers fruitless toil and her own unprofitable sacrifice each in turn had kept vigil by a corpse iii the bell rang she remembered it afterward with a loud thrilling note it was what they used to call the visitors ring not the tentative tinkle of a neighbor dropping in to borrow a saucepan or discuss parochial incidents but a decisive summons from the outer world miss anson put down her knitting and listened she sat upstairs now making her rheumatism an excuse for avoiding the rooms below her interests had insensibly adjusted themselves to the perspective of her neighbors lives and she wondered as the bell reechoed if it could mean that mrs heminways baby had come conjecture had time to ripen into certainty and she was limping toward the closet where her cloak and bonnet hung when her little maid fluttered in with the announcement a gentleman to see the house the house yes mm i dont know what he means faltered the messenger whose memory did not embrace the period when such announcements were a daily part of the domestic routine miss anson glanced at the proffered card the name it bore mr george corby was unknown to her but the blood rose to her languid cheek hand me my mechlin cap katy she said trembling a little as she laid aside her walking stick she put her cap on before the mirror with rapid unsteady touches did you draw up the library blinds she breathlessly asked she had gradually built up a wall of commonplace between herself and her illusions but at the first summons of the past filial passion swept away the frail barriers of expediency she walked downstairs so hurriedly that her stick clicked like a girlish heel but in the hall she paused wondering nervously if katy had put a match to the fire the autumn air was cold and she had the reproachful vision of a visitor with elderly ailments shivering by her inhospitable hearth she thought instinctively of the stranger as a survivor of the days when such a visit was a part of the young enthusiasts itinerary the fire was unlit and the room forbiddingly cold but the figure which as miss anson entered turned from a lingering scrutiny of the bookshelves was that of a fresheyed sanguine youth clearly independent of any artificial caloric she stood still a moment feeling herself the victim of some anterior impression that made this robust presence an insubstantial thing but the young man advanced with an air of genial assurance which rendered him at once more real and more reminiscent why this you know he exclaimed is simply immense the words which did not immediately present themselves as slang to miss ansons unaccustomed ear echoed with an odd familiarity through the academic silence the room you know i mean he explained with a comprehensive gesture these jolly portraits and the books thats the old gentleman himself over the mantelpiece i suppose and the elms outside and and the whole business i do like a congruous background dont you his hostess was silent no one but hewlett winsloe had ever spoken of her grandfather as the old gentleman its a hundred times better than i could have hoped her visitor continued with a cheerful disregard of her silence the seclusion the remoteness the philosophic atmosphere theres so little of that kind of flavor left i should have simply hated to find that he lived over a grocery you know i had the deuce of a time finding out where he did live he began again after another glance of parenthetical enjoyment but finally i got on the trail through some old book on brook farm i was bound id get the environment right before i did my article miss anson by this time had recovered sufficient selfpossession to seat herself and assign a chair to her visitor do i understand she asked slowly following his rapid eye about the room that you intend to write an article about my grandfather thats what im here for mr corby genially responded that is if youre willing to help me for i cant get on without your help he added with a confident smile there was another pause during which miss anson noticed a fleck of dust on the faded leather of the writingtable and a fresh spot of discoloration in the righthand upper corner of raphael morghens parnassus then you believe in him she said looking up she could not tell what had prompted her the words rushed out irresistibly believe in him corby cried springing to his feet believe in orestes anson why i believe hes simply the greatest the most stupendous the most phenomenal figure weve got the color rose to miss ansons brow her heart was beating passionately she kept her eyes fixed on the young mans face as though it might vanish if she looked away you you mean to say this in your article she asked say it why the facts will say it he exulted the baldest kind of a statement would make it clear when a man is as big as that he doesnt need a pedestal miss anson sighed people used to say that when i was young she murmured but now her visitor stared when you were young but how did they know when the thing hung fire as it did when the whole edition was thrown back on his hands the whole edition what edition it was miss ansons turn to stare why of his pamphlet the pamphlet the one thing that counts that survives that makes him what he is for heavens sake he tragically adjured her dont tell me there isnt a copy of it left miss anson was trembling slightly i dont think i understand what you mean she faltered less bewildered by his vehemence than by the strange sense of coming on an unexplored region in the very heart of her dominion why his account of the amphioxus of course you cant mean that his family didnt know about it that you dont know about it i came across it by the merest accident myself in a letter of vindication that he wrote in to an old scientific paper but i understood there were journals early journals there must be references to it somewhere in the twenties he must have been at least ten or twelve years ahead of yarrell and he saw the whole significance of it too he saw where it led to as i understand it he actually anticipated in his pamphlet saint hilaires theory of the universal type and supported the hypothesis by describing the notochord of the amphioxus as a cartilaginous vertebral column the specialists of the day jeered at him of course as the specialists in goethes time jeered at the plantmetamorphosis as far as i can make out the anatomists and zoologists were down on dr anson to a man that was why his cowardly publishers went back on their bargain but the pamphlet must be here somewhere he writes as though in his first disappointment he had destroyed the whole edition but surely there must be at least one copy left his scientific jargon was as bewildering as his slang and there were even moments in his discourse when miss anson ceased to distinguish between them but the suspense with which he continued to gaze on her acted as a challenge to her scattered thoughts the amphioxus she murmured halfrising its an animal isnt it a fish yes i think i remember she sank back with the inward look of one who retraces some lost line of association gradually the distance cleared the details started into life in her researches for the biography she had patiently followed every ramification of her subject and one of these overgrown paths now led her back to the episode in question the great orestess title of doctor had in fact not been merely the spontaneous tribute of a national admiration he had actually studied medicine in his youth and his diaries as his granddaughter now recalled showed that he had passed through a brief phase of anatomical ardor before his attention was diverted to supersensual problems it had indeed seemed to paulina as she scanned those early pages that they revealed a spontaneity a freshness of feeling somehow absent from his later lucubrations as though this one emotion had reached him directly the others through some intervening medium in the excess of her commemorative zeal she had even struggled through the unintelligible pamphlet to which a few lines in the journal had bitterly directed her but the subject and the phraseology were alien to her and unconnected with her conception of the great mans genius and after a hurried perusal she had averted her thoughts from the episode as from a revelation of failure at length she rose a little unsteadily supporting herself against the writingtable she looked hesitatingly about the room then she drew a key from her oldfashioned reticule and unlocked a drawer beneath one of the bookcases young corby watched her breathlessly with a tremulous hand she turned over the dusty documents that seemed to fill the drawer is this it she said holding out a thin discolored volume he seized it with a gasp oh by george he said dropping into the nearest chair she stood observing him strangely as his eye devoured the mouldy pages is this the only copy left he asked at length looking up for a moment as a thirsty man lifts his head from his glass i think it must be i found it long ago among some old papers that my aunts were burning up after my grandmothers death they said it was of no use that hed always meant to destroy the whole edition and that i ought to respect his wishes but it was something he had written to burn it was like shutting the door against his voice against something he had once wished to say and that nobody had listened to i wanted him to feel that i was always here ready to listen even when others hadnt thought it worth while and so i kept the pamphlet meaning to carry out his wish and destroy it before my death her visitor gave a groan of retrospective anguish and but for me but for today you would have i should have thought it my duty oh by george by george he repeated subdued afresh by the inadequacy of speech she continued to watch him in silence at length he jumped up and impulsively caught her by both hands hes bigger and bigger he almost shouted he simply leads the field youll help me go to the bottom of this wont you we must turn out all the papers letters journals memoranda he must have made notes he must have left some record of what led up to this we must leave nothing unexplored by jove he cried looking up at her with his bright convincing smile do you know youre the granddaughter of a great man her color flickered like a girls are you sure of him she whispered as though putting him on his guard against a possible betrayal of trust sure sure my dear lady he measured her again with his quick confident glance dont you believe in him she drew back with a confused murmur i used to she had left her hands in his their pressure seemed to send a warm current to her heart it ruined my life she cried with sudden passion he looked at her perplexedly i gave up everything she went on wildly to keep him alive i sacrificed myself others i nursed his glory in my bosom and it died and left me left me here alone she paused and gathered her courage with a gasp dont make the same mistake she warned him he shook his head still smiling no danger of that youre not alone my dear lady hes here with you hes come back to you today dont you see whats happened dont you see that its your love that has kept him alive if youd abandoned your post for an instant let things pass into other hands if your wonderful tenderness hadnt perpetually kept guard this might have been must have been irretrievably lost he laid his hand on the pamphlet and then then he would have been dead oh she said dont tell me too suddenly and she turned away and sank into a chair the young man stood watching her in an awed silence for a long time she sat motionless with her face hidden and he thought she must be weeping at length he said almost shyly youll let me come back then youll help me work this thing out she rose calmly and held out her hand ill help you she declared ill come tomorrow then can we get to work early as early as you please at eight oclock then he said briskly youll have the papers ready ill have everything ready she added with a halfplayful hesitancy and the fire shall be lit for you he went out with his bright nod she walked to the window and watched his buoyant figure hastening down the elmshaded street when she turned back into the empty room she looked as though youth had touched her on the lips the recovery to the visiting stranger hillbridges first question was have you seen kenistons things keniston took precedence of the colonial state house the gilbert stuart washington and the ethnological museum nay he ran neck and neck with the president of the university a prehistoric relic who had known emerson and who was still sent about the country in cottonwool to open educational institutions with a toothless oration on brook farm keniston was sent about the country too he opened art exhibitions laid the foundation of academies and acted in a general sense as the spokesman and apologist of art hillbridge was proud of him in his peripatetic character but his fellowtownsmen let it be understood that to know keniston one must come to hillbridge never was work more dependent for its effect on atmosphere on milieu hillbridge was kenistons milieu and there was one lady a devotee of his art who went so far as to assert that once at an exhibition in new york she had passed a keniston without recognizing it it simply didnt want to be seen in such surroundings it was hiding itself under an incognito she declared it was a source of special pride to hillbridge that it contained all the artists best works strangers were told that hillbridge had discovered him the discovery had come about in the simplest manner professor driffert who had a reputation for collecting had one day hung a sketch on his drawingroom wall and thereafter mrs drifferts visitors always a little flurried by the sense that it was the kind of house in which one might be suddenly called upon to distinguish between a drypoint and an etching or between raphael mengs and raphael sanzio were not infrequently subjected to the professors offhand inquiry bytheway have you seen my keniston the visitors perceptibly awed would retreat to a critical distance and murmur the usual guarded generalities while they tried to keep the name in

celebrity it was the proper thing to take for granted some one else emboldened by the thought bought a keniston and the next year on the occasion of the presidents golden jubilee the faculty by unanimous consent presented him with a keniston two years later there was a keniston exhibition to which the artcritics came from new york and boston and not long afterward a wellknown chicago collector vainly attempted to buy professor drifferts sketch which the art journals cited as a rare example of the painters first or silvery manner thus there gradually grew up a small circle of connoisseurs known in artistic circles as men who collected kenistons professor wildmarsh of the chair of fine arts and archaeology was the first critic to publish a detailed analysis of the masters methods and purpose the article was illustrated by engravings which though they had cost the magazine a fortune were declared by professor wildmarsh to give but an imperfect suggestion of the esoteric significance of the originals the professor with a tact that contrived to make each reader feel himself included among the exceptions went on to say that kenistons work would never appeal to any but exceptional natures and he closed with the usual assertion that to apprehend the full meaning of the masters message it was necessary to see him in the surroundings of his own home at hillbridge professor wildmarshs article was read one spring afternoon by a young lady just speeding eastward on her first visit to hillbridge and already flushed with anticipation of the intellectual opportunities awaiting her in east onondaigua where she lived hillbridge was looked on as an oxford magazine writers with the easy american use of the superlative designated it as the venerable alma mater the antique seat of learning and claudia day had been brought up to regard it as the fountainhead of knowledge and of that mental distinction which is so much rarer than knowledge an innate passion for all that was thus distinguished and exceptional made her revere hillbridge as the native soil of those intellectual amenities that were of such difficult growth in the thin air of east onondaigua at the first suggestion of a visit to hillbridge whither she went at the invitation of a girl friend who incredible apotheosis had married one of the university professors claudias spirit dilated with the sense of new possibilities the vision of herself walking under the historic elms toward the memorial library standing rapt before the stuart washington or drinking in from some obscure corner of an academic drawingroom the presidents reminiscences of the concord group this vividness of selfprojection into the emotions awaiting her made her glad of any delay that prolonged so exquisite a moment it was in this mood that she opened the article on keniston she knew about him of course she was wonderfully well up even for east onondaigua she had read of him in the magazines she had met on a visit to new york a man who collected kenistons and a photogravure of a keniston in an artistic frame hung above her writingtable at home but professor wildmarshs article made her feel how little she really knew of the master and she trembled to think of the state of relative ignorance in which but for the timely purchase of the magazine she might have entered hillbridge she had for instance been densely unaware that keniston had already had three manners and was showing symptoms of a fourth she was equally ignorant of the fact that he had founded a school and created a formula and she learned with a thrill that no one could hope to understand him who had not seen him in his studio at hillbridge surrounded by his own works the man and the art interpret each other their exponent declared and claudia day bending a brilliant eye on the future wondered if she were ever to be admitted to the privilege of that double initiation keniston to his other claims to distinction added that of being hard to know his friends always hastened to announce the fact to strangers adding after a pause of suspense that they would see what they could do visitors in whose favor he was induced to make an exception were further warned that he never spoke unless he was interested so that they mustnt mind if he remained silent it was under these reassuring conditions that some ten days after her arrival at hillbridge miss day was introduced to the masters studio she found him a tall listlesslooking man who appeared middleaged to her youth and who stood before his own pictures with a vaguely interrogative gaze leaving the task of their interpretation to the lady who had courageously contrived the visit the studio to claudias surprise was bare and shabby it formed a rambling addition to the small cheerless house in which the artist lived with his mother and a widowed sister for claudia it added the last touch to his distinction to learn that he was poor and that what he earned was devoted to the maintenance of the two limp women who formed a neutraltinted background to his impressive outline his pictures of course fetched high prices but he worked slowly painfully as his devotees preferred to phrase it with frequent intervals of ill health and inactivity and the circle of keniston connoisseurs was still as small as it was distinguished the girls fancy instantly hailed in him that favorite figure of imaginative youth the artist who would rather starve than paint a potboiler it is known to comparatively few that the production of successful potboilers is an art in itself and that such heroic abstentions as kenistons are not always purely voluntary on the occasion of her first visit the artist said so little that claudia was able to indulge to the full the harrowing sense of her inadequacy no wonder she had not been one of the few that he cared to talk to every word she uttered must so obviously have diminished the inducement she had been cheap trivial conventional at once gushing and inexpressive eager and constrained she could feel him counting the minutes till the visit was over and as the door finally closed on the scene of her discomfiture she almost shared the hope with which she confidently credited him that they might never meet again ii mrs davant glanced reverentially about the studio i have always said she murmured that they ought to be seen in europe mrs davant was young credulous and emotionally extravagant she reminded claudia of her earlier self the self that ten years before had first set an awestruck foot on that very threshold not for his sake mrs davant continued but for europes claudia smiled she was glad that her husbands pictures were to be exhibited in paris she concurred in mrs davants view of the importance of the event but she thought her visitors way of putting the case a little overcharged ten years spent in an atmosphere of kenistonworship had insensibly developed in claudia a preference for moderation of speech she believed in her husband of course to believe in him with an increasing abandonment and tenacity had become one of the necessary laws of being but she did not believe in his admirers their faith in him was perhaps as genuine as her own but it seemed to her less able to give an account of itself some few of his appreciators doubtless measured him by their own standards but it was difficult not to feel that in the hillbridge circle where rapture ran the highest he was accepted on what was at best but an indirect valuation and now and then she had a frightened doubt as to the independence of her own convictions that innate sense of relativity which even east onondaigua had not been able to check in claudia day had been fostered in mrs keniston by the artistic absolutism of hillbridge and she often wondered that her husband remained so uncritical of the quality of admiration accorded him her husbands uncritical attitude toward himself and his admirers had in fact been one of the surprises of her marriage that an artist should believe in his potential powers seemed to her at once the incentive and the pledge of excellence she knew there was no future for a hesitating talent what perplexed her was kenistons satisfaction in his achievement she had always imagined that the true artist must regard himself as the imperfect vehicle of the cosmic emotion that beneath every difficulty overcome a new one lurked the vision widening as the scope enlarged to be initiated into these creative struggles to shed on the toilers path the consolatory ray of faith and encouragement had seemed the chief privilege of her marriage but there is something supererogatory in believing in a man obviously disposed to perform that service for himself and claudias ardor gradually spent itself against the dense surface of her husbands complacency she could smile now at her vision of an intellectual communion which should admit her to the inmost precincts of his inspiration she had learned that the creative processes are seldom selfexplanatory and kenistons inarticulateness no longer discouraged her but she could not reconcile her sense of the continuity of all high effort to his unperturbed air of finishing each picture as though he had despatched a masterpiece to posterity in the first recoil from her disillusionment she even allowed herself to perceive that if he worked slowly it was not because he mistrusted his powers of expression but because he had really so little to express its for europe mrs davant vaguely repeated and claudia noticed that she was blushingly intent on tracing with the tip of her elaborate sunshade the pattern of the shabby carpet it will be a revelation to them she went on provisionally as though claudia had missed her cue and left an awkward interval to fill claudia had in fact a sudden sense of deficient intuition she felt that her visitor had something to communicate which required on her own part an intelligent cooperation but what it was her insight failed to suggest she was in truth a little tired of mrs davant who was kenistons latest worshipper who ordered pictures recklessly who paid for them regally in advance and whose gallery was figuratively speaking crowded with the artists unpainted masterpieces claudias impatience was perhaps complicated by the uneasy sense that mrs davant was too young too rich too inexperienced that somehow she ought to be warned warned of what that some of the pictures might never be painted scarcely that since keniston who was scrupulous in business transactions might be trusted not to take any material advantage of such evidence of faith claudias impulse remained undefined she merely felt that she would have liked to help mrs davant and that she did not know how youll be there to see them she asked as her visitor lingered in paris mrs davants blush deepened we must all be there together claudia smiled my husband and i mean to go abroad some day but i dont see any chance of it at present but he ought to go you ought both to go this summer mrs davant persisted i know professor wildmarsh and professor driffert and all the other critics think that mr kenistons never having been to europe has given his work much of its wonderful individuality its peculiar flavor and meaning but now that his talent is formed that he has full command of his means of expression claudia recognized one of professor drifferts favorite formulas they all think he ought to see the work of the other great masters that he ought to visit the home of his ancestors as professor wildmarsh says she stretched an impulsive hand to claudia you ought to let him go mrs keniston claudia accepted the admonition with the philosophy of the wife who is used to being advised on the management of her husband i shant interfere with him she declared and mrs davant instantly caught her up with a cry of oh its too lovely of you to say that with this exclamation she left claudia to a silent renewal of wonder a moment later keniston entered to a mind curious in combinations it might have occurred that he had met mrs davant on the doorstep in one sense he might for all his wife cared have met fifty mrs davants on the doorstep it was long since claudia had enjoyed the solace of resenting such coincidences her only thought now was that her husbands first words might not improbably explain mrs davants last and she waited for him to speak he paused with his hands in his pockets before an unfinished picture on the easel then as his habit was he began to stroll touristlike from canvas to canvas standing before each in a musing ecstasy of contemplation that no readjustment of view ever seemed to disturb her eye instinctively joined his in its inspection it was the one point where their natures merged thank god there was no doubt about the pictures she was what she had always dreamed of being the wife of a great artist keniston dropped into an armchair and filled his pipe how should you like to go to europe he asked his wife looked up quickly when now this spring i mean he paused to light the pipe i should like to be over there while these things are being exhibited claudia was silent well he repeated after a moment how can we afford it she asked keniston had always scrupulously fulfilled his duty to the mother and sister whom his marriage had dislodged and claudia who had the atoning temperament which seeks to pay for every happiness by making it a source of fresh obligations had from the outset accepted his ties with an exaggerated devotion any disregard of such a claim would have vulgarized her most delicate pleasures and her husbands sensitiveness to it in great measure extenuated the artistic obtuseness that often seemed to her like a failure of the moral sense his loyalty to the dull women who depended on him was after all compounded of finer tissues than any mere sensibility to ideal demands oh i dont see why we shouldnt he rejoined i think we might manage it at mrs davants expense leaped from claudia she could not tell why she had said it some inner barrier seemed to have given way under a confused pressure of emotions he looked up at her with frank surprise well she has been very jolly about it why not she has a tremendous feeling for art the keenest i ever knew in a woman claudia imperceptibly smiled she wants me to let her pay in advance for the four panels she has ordered for the memorial library that would give us plenty of money for the trip and my having the panels to do is another reason for my wanting to go abroad just now another reason yes ive never worked on such a big scale i want to see how those old chaps did the trick i want to measure myself with the big fellows over there an artist ought to once in his life she gave him a wondering look for the first time his words implied a sense of possible limitation but his easy tone seemed to retract what they conceded what he really wanted was fresh food for his selfsatisfaction he was like an army that moves on after exhausting the resources of the country womanlike she abandoned the general survey of the case for the consideration of a minor point are you sure you can do that kind of thing she asked what kind of thing the panels he glanced at her indulgently his selfconfidence was too impenetrable to feel the pinprick of such a doubt immensely sure he said with a smile and you dont mind taking so much money from her in advance he stared why should i shell get it back with interest he laughed and drew at his pipe it will be an uncommonly interesting experience i shouldnt wonder if it freshened me up a bit she looked at him again this second hint of selfdistrust struck her as the sign of a quickened sensibility what if after all he was beginning to be dissatisfied with his work the thought filled her with a renovating sense of his sufficiency iii they stopped in london to see the national gallery it was thus that in their inexperience they had narrowly put it but in reality every stone of the streets every trick of the atmosphere had its message of surprise for their virgin sensibilities the pictures were simply the summing up the final interpretation of the cumulative pressure of an unimagined world and it seemed to claudia that long before they reached the doors of the gallery she had some intuitive revelation of what awaited them within they moved about from room to room without exchanging a word the vast noiseless spaces seemed full of sound like the roar of a distant multitude heard only by the inner ear had their speech been articulate their language would have been incomprehensible and even that faroff murmur of meaning pressed intolerably on claudias nerves keniston took the onset without outward sign of disturbance now and then he paused before a canvas or prolonged from one of the benches his silent communion with some miracle of line or color but he neither looked at his wife nor spoke to her he seemed to have forgotten her presence claudia was conscious of keeping a furtive watch on him but the sum total of her impressions was negative she remembered thinking when she first met him that his face was rather expressionless and he had the habit of selfengrossed silences all that evening at the hotel they talked about london and he surprised her by an acuteness of observation that she had sometimes inwardly accused him of lacking he seemed to have seen everything to have examined felt compared with nerves as finely adjusted as her own but he said nothing of the pictures the next day they returned to the national gallery and he began to study the paintings in detail pointing out differences of technique analyzing and criticising but still without summing up his conclusions he seemed to have a sort of provincial dread of showing himself too much impressed claudias own sensations were too complex too overwhelming to be readily classified lacking the craftsmans instinct to steady her she felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent impressions one point she consciously avoided and that was the comparison of her husbands work with what they were daily seeing art she inwardly argued was too various too complex dependent on too many interrelations of feeling and environment to allow of its being judged by any provisional standard even the subtleties of technique must be modified by the artists changing purpose as this in turn is acted on by influences of which he is himself unconscious how then was an unprepared imagination to distinguish between such varied reflections of the elusive vision she took refuge in a passionate exaggeration of her own ignorance and insufficiency after a week in london they went to paris the exhibition of kenistons pictures had been opened a few days earlier and as they drove through the streets on the way to the station an impressionist poster here and there invited them to the display of the american artists work mrs davant who had been in paris for the opening had already written rapturously of the impression produced enclosing commendatory notices from one or two papers she reported that there had been a great crowd on the first day and that the critics had been immensely struck the kenistons arrived in the evening and the next morning claudia as a matter of course asked her husband at what time he meant to go and see the pictures he looked up absently from his guidebook what pictures why yours she said surprised oh theyll keep he answered adding with a slightly embarrassed laugh well give the other chaps a show first presently he laid down his book and proposed that they should go to the louvre they spent the morning there lunched at a restaurant near by and returned to the gallery in the afternoon keniston had passed from inarticulateness to an eager volubility it was clear that he was beginning to coordinate his impressions to find his way about in a corner of the great imaginative universe he seemed extraordinarily ready to impart his discoveries and claudia felt that her ignorance served him as a convenient buffer against the terrific impact of new sensations on the way home she asked when he meant to see mrs davant his answer surprised her does she know were here not unless youve sent her word said claudia with a touch of harmless irony thats all right then he returned simply i want to wait and look about a day or two longer shed want us to go sightseeing with her and id rather get my impressions alone the next two days were hampered by the necessity of eluding mrs davant claudia under different circumstances would have scrupled to share in this somewhat shabby conspiracy but she found herself in a state of suspended judgment wherein her husbands treatment of mrs davant became for the moment merely a clue to larger meanings they had been four days in paris when claudia returning one afternoon from a parenthetical excursion to the rue de la paix was confronted on her threshold by the reproachful figure of their benefactress it was not to her however that mrs davants reproaches were addressed keniston it appeared had borne the brunt of them for he stood leaning against the mantelpiece of their modest salon in that attitude of convicted negligence when if ever a man is glad to take refuge behind his wife claudia had however no immediate intention of affording him such shelter she wanted to observe and wait hes too impossible cried mrs davant sweeping her at once into the central current of her grievance claudia looked from one to the other for not going to see you for not going to see his pictures cried the other nobly claudia colored and keniston shifted his position uneasily i cant make her understand he said turning to his wife i dont care about myself mrs davant interjected i do then its the only thing i do care about he hurriedly protested i meant to go at once to write claudia wanted to go but i wouldnt let her he looked helplessly about the pleasant redcurtained room which was rapidly burning itself into claudias consciousness as a visible extension of mrs davants claims i cant explain he broke off mrs davant in turn addressed herself to claudia people think its so odd she complained so many of the artists here are anxious to meet him theyve all been so charming about the pictures and several of our american friends have come over from london expressly for the exhibition i told every one that he would be here for the opening there was a private view you know and they were so disappointed they wanted to give him an ovation and i didnt know what to say what am i to say she abruptly ended theres nothing to say said keniston slowly but the exhibition closes the day after tomorrow well i shant close i shall be here he declared with an effort at playfulness if they want to see me all these people youre kind enough to mention wont there be other chances but i wanted them to see you among your pictures to hear you talk about them explain them in that wonderful way i wanted you to interpret each other as professor wildmarsh says oh hang professor wildmarsh said keniston softening the commination with a smile if my pictures are good for anything they oughtnt to need explaining mrs davant stared but i thought that was what made them so interesting she exclaimed keniston looked down perhaps it was he murmured there was an awkward silence which claudia broke by saying with a glance at her husband but if the exhibition is to remain open tomorrow could we not meet you there and perhaps you could send word to some of our friends mrs davant brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together oh do make him she implored ill ask them to come in the afternoon well make it into a little tea a five oclock ill send word at once to everybody she gathered up her beruffled boa and sunshade settling her plumage like a reassured bird it will be too lovely she ended in a selfconsoling murmur but in the doorway a new doubt assailed her you wont fail me she said turning plaintively to keniston youll make him come mrs keniston ill bring him claudia promised iv when the next morning she appeared equipped for their customary ramble her husband surprised her by announcing that he meant to stay at home the fact is im rather surfeited he said smiling i suppose my appetite isnt equal to such a plethora i think ill write some letters and join you somewhere later she detected the wish to be alone and responded to it with her usual readiness i shall sink to my proper level and buy a bonnet then she said i havent had time to take the edge off that appetite they agreed to meet at the hotel cluny at midday and she set out alone with a vague sense of relief neither she nor keniston had made any direct reference to mrs davants visit but its effect was implicit in their eagerness to avoid each other claudia accomplished some shopping in the spirit of perfunctoriness that robs even new bonnets of their bloom and this business despatched she turned aimlessly into the wide inviting brightness of the streets never had she felt more isolated amid that ordered beauty which gives a social quality to the very stones and mortar of paris all about her were evidences of an artistic sensibility pervading every form of life like the nervous structure of the huge frame a sensibility so delicate alert and universal that it seemed to leave no room for obtuseness or error in such a medium the faculty of plastic expression must develop as unconsciously as any organ in its normal surroundings to be artistic must cease to be an attitude and become a natural function to claudia the significance of the whole vast revelation was centred in the light it shed on one tiny spot of consciousness the value of her husbands work there are moments when to the groping soul the worlds accumulated experiences are but steppingstones across a private difficulty she stood hesitating on a street corner it was barely eleven and she had an hour to spare before going to the hotel cluny she seemed to be letting her inclination float as it would on the crosscurrents of suggestion emanating from the brilliant complex scene before her but suddenly in obedience to an impulse that she became aware of only in acting on it she called a cab and drove to the gallery where her husbands pictures were exhibited a magnificent official in gold braid sold her a ticket and pointed the way up the empty crimsoncarpeted stairs his duplicate on the upper landing held out a catalogue with an air of recognizing the futility of the offer and a moment later she found herself in the long noiseless impressive room full of velvetcovered ottomans and exotic plants it was clear that the public ardor on which mrs davant had expatiated had spent itself earlier in the week for claudia had this luxurious apartment to herself something about its air of rich privacy its diffusion of that sympathetic quality in other countries so conspicuously absent from the public showroom seemed to emphasize its present emptiness it was as though the flowers the carpet the lounges surrounded their visitors solitary advance with the mute assurance that they had done all they could toward making the thing go off and that if they had failed it was simply for lack of cooperation she stood still and looked about her the pictures struck her instantly as odd gaps in the general harmony it was selfevident that they had not cooperated they had not been pushing aggressive discordant they had merely effaced themselves she swept a startled eye from one familiar painting to another the canvases were all there and the frames but the miracle the mirage of life and meaning had vanished like some atmospheric illusion what was it that had happened and had it happened to her or to the pictures she tried to rally her frightened thoughts to push or coax them into a semblance of resistance but argument was swept off its feet by the huge rush of a single conviction the conviction that the pictures were bad there was no standing up against that she felt herself submerged the stealthy fear that had been following her all these days had her by the throat now the great vision of beauty through which she had been moving as one enchanted was turned to a phantasmagoria of evil mocking shapes she hated the past she hated its splendor its power its wicked magical vitality she dropped into a seat and continued to stare at the wall before her gradually as she stared there stole out to her from the dimmed humbled canvases a reminder of what she had once seen in them a spectral appeal to her faith to call them back to life what proof had she that her present estimate of them was less subjective than the other the confused impressions of the last few days were hardly to be pleaded as a valid theory of art how after all did she know that the pictures were bad on what suddenly acquired technical standard had she thus decided the case against them it seemed as though it were a standard outside of herself as though some unheeded inner sense were gradually making her aware of the presence in that empty room of a critical intelligence that was giving out a subtle effluence of disapproval the fancy was so vivid that to shake it off she rose and began to move about again in the middle of the room stood a monumental divan surmounted by a massif of palms and azaleas as claudias muffled wanderings carried her around the angle of this seat she saw that its farther side was occupied by the figure of a man who sat with his hands resting on his stick and his head bowed upon them she gave a little cry and her husband rose and faced her instantly the live point of consciousness was shifted and she became aware that the quality of the pictures no longer mattered it was what he thought of them that counted her life hung on that they looked at each other a moment in silence such concussions are not apt to flash into immediate speech at length he said simply i didnt know you were coming here she colored as though he had charged her with something underhand i didnt mean to she stammered but i was too early for our appointment her words cast a revealing glare on the situation neither of them looked at the pictures but to claudia those unobtruding presences seemed suddenly to press upon them and force them apart keniston glanced at his watch its twelve oclock he said shall we go on v at the door he called a cab and put her in it then drawing out his watch again he said abruptly i believe ill let you go alone ill join you at the hotel in time for luncheon she wondered for a moment if he meant to return to the gallery but looking back as she drove off she saw him walk rapidly away in the opposite direction the cabman had carried her halfway to the hotel cluny before she realized where she was going and cried out to him to turn home there was an acute irony in this mechanical prolongation of the quest of beauty she had had enough of it too much of it her one longing was to escape to hide herself away from its allsuffusing implacable light at the hotel alone in her room a few tears came to soften her seared vision but her mood was too tense to be eased by weeping her whole being was centred in the longing to know what her husband thought their short exchange of words had after all told her nothing she had guessed a faint resentment at her unexpected appearance but that might merely imply a dawning sense on his part of being furtively watched and criticised she had sometimes wondered if he was never conscious of her observation there were moments when it seemed to radiate from her in visible waves perhaps after all he was aware of it on his guard against it as a lurking knife behind the thick curtain of his complacency and today he must have caught the gleam of the blade claudia had not reached the age when pity is the first chord to vibrate in contact with any revelation of failure her one hope had been that keniston should be cleareyed enough to face the truth whatever it turned out to be she wanted him to measure himself with it but as his image rose before her she felt a sudden halfmaternal longing to thrust herself between him and disaster her eagerness to see him tested by circumstances seemed now like a cruel scientific curiosity she saw in a flash of sympathy that he would need her most if he fell beneath his fate he did not after all return for luncheon and when she came upstairs from her solitary meal their salon was still untenanted she permitted herself no sensational fears for she could not at the height of apprehension figure keniston as yielding to any tragic impulse but the lengthening hours brought an uneasiness that was fuel to her pity suddenly she heard the clock strike five it was the hour at which they had promised to meet mrs davant at the gallery the hour of the ovation claudia rose and went to the window straining for a glimpse of her husband in the crowded street could it be that he had forgotten her had gone to the gallery without her or had something happened that veiled something which for the last hour had grimly hovered on the outskirts of her mind she heard a hand on the door and keniston entered as she turned to meet him her whole being was swept forward on a great wave of pity she was so sure now that he must know but he confronted her with a glance of preoccupied brightness her first impression was that she had never seen him so vividly so expressively pleased if he needed her it was not to bind up his wounds he gave her a smile which was clearly the lingering reflection of some inner light i didnt mean to be so late he said tossing aside his hat and the little red volume that served as a clue to his explorations i turned in to the louvre for a minute after i left you this morning and the place fairly swallowed me up i couldnt get away from it ive been there ever since he threw himself into a chair and glanced about for his pipe it takes time he continued musingly to get at them to make out what theyre saying the big fellows i mean theyre not a communicative lot at first i couldnt make much out of their lingo it was too different from mine but gradually by picking up a hint here and there and piecing them together ive begun to understand and today by jove i got one or two of the old chaps by the throat and fairly turned them inside out made them deliver up their last drop he lifted a brilliant eye to her lord it was tremendous he declared he had found his pipe and was musingly filling it claudia waited in silence at first he began again i was afraid their language was too hard for me that i should never quite know what they were driving at they seemed to coldshoulder me to be bent on shutting me out but i was bound i wouldnt be beaten and now today he paused a moment to strike a match when i went to look at those things of mine it all came over me in a flash by jove it was as if id made them all into a big bonfire to light me on my road his wife was trembling with a kind of sacred terror she had been afraid to pray for light for him and here he was joyfully casting his whole past upon the pyre is there nothing left she faltered nothing left theres everything he exulted why here i am not much over forty and ive found out already already he stood up and began to move excitedly about the room my god suppose id never known suppose id gone on painting things like that forever why i feel like those chaps at revivalist meetings when they get up and say theyre saved wont somebody please start a hymn claudia with a tremulous joy was letting herself go on the strong current of his emotion but it had not yet carried her beyond her depth and suddenly she felt hard ground underfoot mrs davant she exclaimed he stared as though suddenly recalled from a long distance mrs davant we were to have met her this afternoon now at the gallery oh thats all right i put a stop to that i went to see her after i left you i explained it all to her all i told her i was going to begin all over again claudias heart gave a forward bound and then sank back hopelessly but the panels thats all right too i told her about the panels he reassured her you told her that i cant paint them now she doesnt understand of course but shes the best little woman and she trusts me she could have wept for joy at his exquisite obtuseness but that isnt all she wailed it doesnt matter how much youve explained to her it doesnt do away with the fact that were living on those panels living on them on the money that she paid you to paint them isnt that what brought us here and if you mean to do as you say to begin all over again how in the world are we ever to pay her back her husband turned on her an inspired eye theres only one way that i know of he imperturbably declared and thats to stay out here till i learn how to paint them copy a dialogue mrs ambrose dale forty slender still young sits in her drawingroom at the teatable the winter twilight is falling a lamp has been lit there is a fire on the hearth and the room is pleasantly dim and flowerscented books are scattered everywhere mostly with autograph inscriptions from the author and a large portrait of mrs dale at her desk with papers strewn about her takes up one of the wallpanels before mrs dale stands hilda fair and twenty her hands full of letters mrs dale ten more applications for autographs isnt it strange that people whod blush to borrow twenty dollars dont scruple to beg for an autograph hilda reproachfully oh mrs dale whats the difference pray hilda only that your last autograph sold for fifty mrs dale not displeased ah i sent for you hilda because im dining out tonight and if theres nothing important to attend to among these letters you neednt sit up for me hilda you dont mean to work mrs dale perhaps but i shant need you youll see that my cigarettes and coffeemachine are in place and that i dont have to crawl about the floor in search of my penwiper thats all now about these letters hilda impulsively oh mrs dale mrs dale well hilda id rather sit up for you mrs dale child ive nothing for you to do i shall be blocking out the tenth chapter of winged purposes and it wont be ready for you till next week hilda it isnt that but its so beautiful to sit here watching and listening all alone in the night and to feel that youre in there she points to the studydoor creating impulsively what do i care for sleep mrs dale indulgently child silly child yes i should have felt so at your age it would have been an inspiration hilda rapt it is mrs dale but you must go to bed i must have you fresh in the morning for youre still at the age when one is fresh in the morning she sighs the letters abruptly do you take notes of what you feel hilda here all alone in the night as you say hilda shyly i have mrs dale smiling for the diary hilda nods and blushes mrs dale caressingly goose well to business what is there hilda nothing important except a letter from stroud fayerweather to say that the question of the royalty on pomegranate seed has been settled in your favor the english publishers of immolation write to consult you about a sixshilling edition olafson the copenhagen publisher applies for permission to bring out a danish translation of the idols feet and the editor of the semaphore wants a new serial i think thats all except that womans sphere and the droplight ask for interviews with photographs mrs dale the same old story im so toed of it all to herself in an undertone but how should i feel if it all stopped the servant brings in a card mrs dale reading it is it possible paul ventnor to the servant show mr ventnor up to herself paul ventnor hilda breathless oh mrs dale the mr ventnor mrs dale smiling i fancy theres only one hilda the great great poet irresolute no i dont dare mrs dale with a tinge of impatience what hilda fervently ask you if i might oh here in this corner where he cant possibly notice me stay just a moment just to see him come in to see the meeting between you the greatest novelist and the greatest poet of the age oh its too much to ask its an historic moment mrs dale why i suppose it is i hadnt thought of it in that light well smiling for the diary hilda oh thank you thank you ill be off the very instant ive heard him speak mrs dale the very instant mind she rises looks at herself in the glass smooths her hair sits down again and rattles the teacaddy isnt the room very warm she looks over at her portrait ive grown stouter since that was painted youll make a fortune out of that diary hilda hilda modestly four publishers have applied to me already the servant announces mr paul ventnor tall nearing fifty with an incipient stoutness buttoned into a masterly frockcoat ventnor drops his glass and advances vaguely with a shortsighted stare ventnor mrs dale mrs dale my dear friend this is kind she looks over her shoulder at hilda mho vanishes through the door to the left the papers announced your arrival but i hardly hoped ventnor whose shortsighted stare is seen to conceal a deeper embarrassment you hadnt forgotten me then mrs dale delicious do you forget that youre public property ventnor forgotten i mean that we were old friends mrs dale such old friends may i remind you that its nearly twenty years since weve met or do you find cold reminiscences indigestible ventnor on the contrary ive come to ask you for a dish of them well warm them up together youre my first visit mrs dale how perfect of you so few men visit their women friends in chronological order or at least they generally do it the other way round beginning with the present day and working back if theres time to prehistoric woman ventnor but when prehistoric woman has become historic woman mrs dale oh its the reflection of my glory that has guided you here then ventnor its a spirit in my feet that has led me at the first opportunity to the most delightful spot i know mrs dale oh the first opportunity ventnor i might have seen you very often before but never just in the right way mrs dale is this the right way ventnor it depends on you to make it so mrs dale what a responsibility what shall i do ventnor talk to me make me think youre a little glad to see me give me some tea and a cigarette and say youre out to everyone else mrs dale is that all she hands him a cup of tea the cigarettes are at your elbow and do you think i shouldnt have been glad to see you before ventnor no i think i should have been too glad to see you mrs dale dear me what precautions i hope you always wear goloshes when it looks like rain and never by any chance expose yourself to a draught but i had an idea that poets courted the emotions ventnor do novelists mrs dale if you ask me on paper ventnor just so thats safest my best things about the sea have been written on shore he looks at her thoughtfully but it wouldnt have suited us in the old days would it mrs dale sighing when we were real people ventnor real people mrs dale are you now i died years ago what you see before you is a figment of the reporters brain a monster manufactured out of newspaper paragraphs with ink in its veins a keen sense of copyright is my nearest approach to an emotion ventnor sighing ah well yes as you say were public property mrs dale if one shared equally with the public but the last shred of my identity is gone ventnor most people would be glad to part with theirs on such terms i have followed your work with immense interest immolation is a masterpiece i read it last summer when it first came out mrs dale with a shade less warmth immolation has been out three years ventnor oh by jove no surely not but one is so overwhelmed one loses count reproachfully why have you never sent me your books mrs dale for that very reason ventnor deprecatingly you know i didnt mean it for you and my first book do you remember was dedicated to you mrs dale silver trumpets ventnor much interested have you a copy still by any chance the first edition i mean mine was stolen years ago do you think you could put your hand on it mrs dale taking a small shabby book from the table at her side its here ventnor eagerly may i have it ah thanks this is very interesting the last copy sold in london for р в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв

know that a pause she takes the book from him opens it and reads half to herself how much we two have seen together of other eyes unwist dear as in days of leafless weather the willows saffron mist strange as the hour when hesper swings asea in beryl green while overhead on dalliant wings the daylight hangs serene and thrilling as a meteors fall through depths of lonely sky when each to each two watchers call i saw it so did i ventnor thin thin the troubadour tinkle odd how little promise there is in first volumes mrs dale with irresistible emphasis i thought there was a distinct promise in this ventnor seeing his mistake ah the one you would never let me fulfil sentimentally how inexorable you were you never dedicated a book to me mrs dale i hadnt begun to write when we were dedicating things to each other ventnor not for the public but you wrote for me and wonderful as you are youve never written anything since that i care for half as much as mrs dale interested well ventnor your letters mrs dale in a changed voice my letters do you remember them ventnor when i dont i reread them mrs dale incredulous you have them still ventnor unguardedly you havent mine then mrs dale playfully oh you were a celebrity already of course i kept them smiling think what they are worth now i always keep them locked up in my safe over there she indicates a cabinet ventnor after a pause i always carry yours with me mrs dale laughing you ventnor wherever i go a longer pause she looks at him fixedly i have them with me now mrs dale agitated you have them with you now ventnor embarrassed why not one never knows mrs dale never knows ventnor humorously gad when the bankexaminer may come round you forget im a married man mrs dale ah yes ventnor sits down beside her i speak to you as i couldnt to anyone else without deserving a kicking you know how it all came about a pause youll bear witness that it wasnt till you denied me all hope mrs dale a little breathless yes yes ventnor till you sent me from you mrs dale its so easy to be heroic when one is young one doesnt realize how long life is going to last afterward musing nor what weary work it is gathering up the fragments ventnor but the time comes when one sends for the chinamender and has the bits riveted together and turns the cracked side to the wall mrs dale and denies that the article was ever damaged ventnor eh well the great thing you see is to keep ones self out of reach of the housemaids brush a pause if youre married you cant always smiling dont you hate to be taken down and dusted mrs dale with intention you forget how long ago my husband died its fifteen years since ive been an object of interest to anybody but the public ventnor smiling the only one of your admirers to whom youve ever given the least encouragement mrs dale say rather the most easily pleased ventnor or the only one you cared to please mrs dale ah you havent kept my letters ventnor gravely is that a challenge look here then he drams a packet from his pocket and holds it out to her mrs dale taking the packet and looking at him earnestly why have you brought me these ventnor i didnt bring them they came because i came thats all tentatively are we unwelcome mrs dale who has undone the packet and does not appear to hear him the very first i ever wrote you the day after we met at the concert how on earth did you happen to keep it she glances over it how perfectly absurd well its not a compromising document ventnor im afraid none of them are mrs dale quickly is it to that they owe their immunity because one could leave them about like safety matches ah heres another i remember i wrote that the day after we went skating together for the first time she reads it slowly how odd how very odd ventnor what mrs dale why its the most curious thing i had a letter of this kind to do the other day in the novel im at work on now the letter of a woman who is just just beginning ventnor yes just beginning mrs dale and do you know i find the best phrase in it the phrase i somehow regarded as the fruit of well of all my subsequent discoveries is simply plagiarized word for word from this ventnor eagerly i told you so you were all there mrs dale critically but the rest of its poorly done very poorly reads the letter over hm i didnt know how to leave off it takes me forever to get out of the door ventnor gayly perhaps i was there to prevent you after a pause i wonder what i said in return mrs dale interested shall we look she rises shall we really i have them all here you know she goes toward the cabinet ventnor following her with repressed eagerness oh all mrs dale throws open the door of the cabinet revealing a number of packets dont you believe me now ventnor good heavens how i must have repeated myself but then you were so very deaf mrs dale takes out a packet and returns to her seat ventnor extends an impatient hand for the letters no no wait i want to find your answer to the one i was just reading after a pause here it is yes i thought so ventnor what did you think mrs dale triumphantly i thought it was the one in which you quoted epipsychidion ventnor mercy did i quote things i dont wonder you were cruel mrs dale ah and heres the other the one i the one i didnt answer for a long time do you remember ventnor with emotion do i remember i wrote it the morning after we heard isolde mrs dale disappointed no no that wasnt the one i didnt answer here this is the one i mean ventnor takes it curiously ah hm this is very like unrolling a mummy he glances at her with a live grain of wheat in it perhaps oh by jove mrs dale what ventnor why this is the one i made a sonnet out of afterward by jove id forgotten where that idea came from you may know the lines perhaps theyre in the fourth volume of my complete edition its the thing beginning love came to me with unrelenting eyes one of my best i rather fancy of course here its very crudely put the values arent brought out ah this touch is good though very good hm i daresay there might be other material he glances toward the cabinet mrs dale drily the live grain of wheat as you said ventnor ah well my first harvest was sown on rocky ground now i plant for the fowls of the air rising and walking toward the cabinet when can i come and carry off all this rubbish mrs dale carry it off ventnor embarrassed my dear lady surely between you and me explicitness is a burden you must see that these letters of ours cant be left to take their chance like an ordinary correspondence you said yourself we were public property mrs dale to take their chance do you suppose that in my keeping your letters take any chances suddenly do mine in yours ventnor still more embarrassed helen he takes a turn through the room you force me to remind you that you and i are differently situated that in a moment of madness i sacrificed the only right you ever gave me the right to love you better than any other woman in the world a pause she says nothing and he continues with increasing difficulty you asked me just now why i carried your letters about with me kept them literally in my own hands well suppose its to be sure of their not falling into some one elses mrs dale oh ventnor throws himself into a chair for gods sake dont pity me mrs dale after a long pause am i dull or are you trying to say that you want to give me back my letters ventnor starting up i give you back god forbid your letters not for the world the only thing i have left but you cant dream that in my hands mrs dale suddenly you want yours then ventnor repressing his eagerness my dear friend if id ever dreamed that youd kept them mrs dale accusingly you do want them a pause he makes a deprecatory gesture why should they be less safe with me than mine with you i never forfeited the right to keep them ventnor after another pause its compensation enough almost to have you reproach me he moves nearer to her but she makes no response you forget that ive forfeited all my rights even that of letting you keep my letters mrs dale you do want them she rises throws all the letters into the cabinet locks the door and puts the key in her pocket theres my answer ventnor helen mrs dale ah i paid dearly enough for the right to keep them and i mean to she turns to him passionately have you ever asked yourself how i paid for it with what months and years of solitude what indifference to flattery what resistance to affection oh dont smile because i said affection and not love affections a warm cloak in cold weather and i have been cold and i shall keep on growing colder dont talk to me about living in the hearts of my readers we both know what kind of a domicile that is why before long i shall become a classic bound in sets and kept on the top bookshelf brr doesnt that sound freezing i foresee the day when i shall be as lonely as an etruscan museum she breaks into a laugh thats what ive paid for the right to keep your letters she holds out her hand and now give me mine ventnor yours mrs dale haughtily yes i claim them ventnor in the same tone on what ground mrs dale hear the man because i wrote them of course ventnor but it seems to me that under your inspiration i admit i also wrote mine mrs dale oh i dont dispute their authenticity its yours i deny ventnor mine mrs dale you voluntarily ceased to be the man who wrote me those letters youve admitted as much you traded paper for flesh and blood i dont dispute your wisdom only you must hold to your bargain the letters are all mine ventnor groping between two tones your arguments are as convincing as ever he hazards a faint laugh youre a marvellous dialectician but if were going to settle the matter in the spirit of an arbitration treaty why there are accepted conventions in such cases its an odious way to put it but since you wont help me one of them is mrs dale one of them is ventnor that it is usual that technically i mean the letter belongs to its writer mrs dale after a pause such letters as these ventnor such letters especially mrs dale but you couldnt have written them if i hadnt been willing to read them surely theres more of myself in them than of you ventnor surely theres nothing in which a man puts more of himself than in his loveletters mrs dale with emotion but a womans loveletters are like her child they belong to her more than to anybody else ventnor and a mans mrs dale with sudden violence are all he risks there take them she flings the key of the cabinet at his feet and sinks into a chair ventnor starts as though to pick up the key then approaches and bends over her helen oh helen mrs dale she yields her hands to him murmuring paul suddenly she straightens herself and draws back illuminated what a fool i am i see it all now you want them for your memoirs ventnor disconcerted helen mrs dale agitated come come the rule is to unmask when the signals given you want them for your memoirs ventnor with a forced laugh what makes you think so mrs dale triumphantly because i want them for mine ventnor in a changed tone ah he moves away from her and leans against the mantelpiece she remains seated with her eyes fixed on him mrs dale i wonder i didnt see it sooner your reasons were lame enough ventnor ironically yours were masterly youre the more accomplished actor of the two i was completely deceived mrs dale oh im a novelist i can keep up that sort of thing for five hundred pages ventnor i congratulate you a pause mrs dale moving to her seat behind the teatable ive never offered you any tea she bends over the kettle why dont you take your letters ventnor because youve been clever enough to make it impossible for me he picks up the key and hands it to her then abruptly was it all acting just now mrs dale by what right do you ask ventnor by right of renouncing my claim to my letters keep them and tell me mrs dale i give you back your claim and i refuse to tell you ventnor sadly ah helen if you deceived me you deceived yourself also mrs dale what does it matter now that were both undeceived i played a losing game thats all ventnor why losing since all the letters are yours mrs dale the letters slowly id forgotten the letters ventnor exultant ah i knew youd end by telling me the truth mrs dale the truth where is the truth half to herself i thought i was lying when i began but the lies turned into truth as i uttered them she looks at ventnor i did want your letters for my memoirs i did think id kept them for that purpose and i wanted to get mine back for the same reason but now she puts out her hand and picks up some of her letters which are lying scattered on the table near her how fresh they seem and how they take me back to the time when we lived instead of writing about life ventnor smiling the time when we didnt prepare our impromptu effects beforehand and copyright our remarks about the weather mrs dale or keep our epigrams in cold storage and our adjectives under lock and key ventnor when our emotions werent worth ten cents a word and a signature wasnt an autograph ah helen after all theres nothing like the exhilaration of spending ones capital mrs dale of wasting it you mean she points to the letters do you suppose we could have written a word of these if wed known we were putting our dreams out at interest she sits musing with her eyes on the fire and he watches her in silence paul do you remember the deserted garden we sometimes used to walk in ventnor the old garden with the high wall at the end of the village street the garden with the ruined boxborders and the brokendown arbor why i remember every weed in the paths and every patch of moss on the walls mrs dale well i went back there the other day the village is immensely improved theres a new hotel with gasfires and a trolley in the main street and the garden has been turned into a public park where excursionists sit on castiron benches admiring the statue of an abolitionist ventnor an abolitionist how appropriate mrs dale and the man who sold the garden has made a fortune that he doesnt know how to spend ventnor rising impulsively helen he approaches and lays his hand on her letters lets sacrifice our fortune and keep the excursionists out mrs dale with a responsive movement paul do you really mean it ventnor gayly mean it why i feel like a landed proprietor already its more than a garden its a park mrs dale its more than a park its a world as long as we keep it to ourselves ventnor ah yes even the pyramids look small when one sees a cooks tourist on top of them he takes the key from the table unlocks the cabinet and brings out his letters which he lays beside hers shall we burn the key to our garden mrs dale ah then it will indeed be boundless watching him while he throws the letters into the fire ventnor turning back to her with a halfsad smile but not too big for us to find each other in mrs dale since we shall be the only people there he takes both her hands and they look at each other a moment in silence then he goes out by the door to the right as he reaches the door she takes a step toward him impulsively then turning back she leans against the chimneypiece quietly watching the letters burn the rembrandt youre so artistic my cousin eleanor copt began of all eleanors exordiums it is the one i most dread when she tells me im so clever i know this is merely the preamble to inviting me to meet the last literary obscurity of the moment a trial to be evaded or endured as circumstances dictate whereas her calling me artistic fatally connotes the request to visit in her company some distressed gentlewoman whose future hangs on my valuation of her old saxe or of her grandfathers marc antonios time was when i attempted to resist these compulsions of eleanors but i soon learned that short of actual flight there was no refuge from her beneficent despotism it is not always easy for the curator of a museum to abandon his post on the plea of escaping a pretty cousins importunities and eleanor aware of my predicament is none too magnanimous to take advantage of it magnanimity is in fact not in eleanors line the virtues she once explained to me are like bonnets the very ones that look best on other people may not happen to suit ones own particular style and she added with a slight deflection of metaphor that none of the readymade virtues ever had fitted her they all pinched somewhere and shed given up trying to wear them therefore when she said to me youre so artistic emphasizing the conjunction with a tap of her dripping umbrella eleanor is out in all weathers the elements are as powerless against her as man i merely stipulated its not old saxe again she shook her head reassuringly a picture a rembrandt good lord why not a leonardo well she smiled that of course depends on you on me on your attribution i dare say mrs fontage would consent to the change though shes very conservative a gleam of hope came to me and i pronounced one cant judge of a picture in this weather of course not im coming for you tomorrow ive an engagement tomorrow ill come before or after your engagement the afternoon paper lay at my elbow and i contrived a furtive consultation of the weatherreport it said rain tomorrow and i answered briskly all right then come at ten rapidly calculating that the clouds on which i counted might lift by noon my ingenuity failed of its due reward for the heavens as if in league with my cousin emptied themselves before morning and punctually at ten eleanor and the sun appeared together in my office i hardly listened as we descended the museum steps and got into eleanors hansom to her vivid summingup of the case i guessed beforehand that the lady we were about to visit had lapsed by the most distressful degrees from opulence to a hallbedroom that her grandfather if he had not been minister to france had signed the declaration of independence that the rembrandt was an heirloom sole remnant of disbanded treasures that for years its possessor had been unwilling to part with it and that even now the question of its disposal must be approached with the most diplomatic obliquity previous experience had taught me that all eleanors cases presented a harrowing similarity of detail no circumstance tending to excite the spectators sympathy and involve his action was omitted from the history of her beneficiaries the lights and shades were indeed so skilfully adjusted that any impartial expression of opinion took on the hue of cruelty i could have produced closetfuls of heirlooms in attestation of this fact for it is one more mark of eleanors competence that her friends usually pay the interest on her philanthropy my one hope was that in this case the object being a picture might reasonably be rated beyond my means and as our cab drew up before a blistered brownstone doorstep i formed the selfdefensive resolve to place an extreme valuation on mrs fontages rembrandt it is eleanors fault if she is sometimes fought with her own weapons the house stood in one of those shabby provisionallooking new york streets that seem resignedly awaiting demolition it was the kind of house that in its high days must have had a bowwindow with a bronze in it the bowwindow had been replaced by a plumbers devanture and one might conceive the bronze to have gravitated to the limbo where mexican onyx tables and bricabrac in buffalohorn await the first signs of our next aesthetic reaction eleanor swept me through a hall that smelled of poverty up unlit stairs to a bare slit of a room and she must leave this in a month she whispered across her knock i had prepared myself for the limp widows weed of a woman that one figures in such a setting and confronted abruptly with mrs fontages whitehaired erectness i had the disconcerting sense that i was somehow in her presence at my own solicitation i instinctively charged eleanor with this reversal of the situation but a moment later i saw it must be ascribed to a something about mrs fontage that precluded the possibility of her asking any one a favor it was not that she was of forbidding or even majestic demeanor but that one guessed under her aquiline prettiness a dignity nervously on guard against the petty betrayal of her surroundings the room was unconcealably poor the little faded relics the highstocked ancestral silhouettes the steelengravings after raphael and correggio grouped in a vain attempt to hide the most obvious stains on the wallpaper served only to accentuate the contrast of a past evidently diversified by foreign travel and the enjoyment of the arts even mrs fontages dress had the air of being a last expedient the ultimate outcome of a muchtaxed ingenuity in darning and turning one felt that all the poor ladys barriers were falling save that of her impregnable manner to this manner i found myself conveying my appreciation of being admitted to a view of the rembrandt mrs fontages smile took my homage for granted it is always she conceded a privilege to be in the presence of the great masters her slim wrinkled hand waved me to a dusky canvas near the window its so interesting dear mrs fontage i heard eleanor exclaiming and my cousin will be able to tell you exactly eleanor in my presence always admits that she knows nothing about art but she gives the impression that this is merely because she hasnt had time to look into the matter and has had me to do it for her mrs fontage seated herself without speaking as though fearful that a breath might disturb my communion with the masterpiece i felt that she thought eleanors reassuring ejaculations illtimed and in this i was of one mind with her for the impossibility of telling her exactly what i thought of her rembrandt had become clear to me at a glance my cousins vivacities began to languish and the silence seemed to shape itself into a receptacle for my verdict i stepped back affecting a more distant scrutiny and as i did so my eye caught mrs fontages profile her lids trembled slightly i took refuge in the familiar expedient of asking the history of the picture and she waved me brightly to a seat this was indeed a topic on which she could dilate the rembrandt it appeared had come into mr fontages possession many years ago while the young couple were on their weddingtour and under circumstances so romantic that she made no excuse for relating them in all their parenthetic fulness the picture belonged to an old belgian countess of redundant quarterings whom the extravagances of an ungovernable nephew had compelled to part with her possessions in the most private manner about the time of the fontages arrival by a really remarkable coincidence it happened that their courier an exceptionally intelligent and superior man was an old servant of the countesss and had thus been able to put them in the way of securing the rembrandt under the very nose of an english duke whose agent had been sent to brussels to negotiate for its purchase mrs fontage could not recall the dukes name but he was a great collector and had a famous highland castle where somebody had been murdered and which she herself had visited by moonlight when she had travelled in scotland as a girl the episode had in short been one of the most interesting experiences of a tour almost chromolithographic in vivacity of impression and they had always meant to go back to brussels for the sake of reliving so picturesque a moment circumstances of which the narrators surroundings declared the nature had persistently interfered with the projected return to europe and the picture had grown doubly valuable as representing the highwater mark of their artistic emotions mrs fontages moist eye caressed the canvas there is only she added with a perceptible effort one slight drawback the picture is not signed but for that the countess of course would have sold it to a museum all the connoisseurs who have seen it pronounce it an undoubted rembrandt in the artists best manner but the museums she arched her brows in smiling recognition of a wellknown weakness give the preference to signed examples mrs fontages words evoked so touching a vision of the young tourists of fifty years ago entrusting to an accomplished and versatile courier the direction of their helpless zeal for art that i lost sight for a moment of the point at issue the old belgian countess the wealthy duke with a feudal castle in scotland mrs fontages own maiden pilgrimage to arthurs seat and holyrood all the

seemed a part of that vanished europe to which our young race carried its indiscriminate ardors its tender romantic credulity the legendary castellated europe of keepsakes brigands and old masters that compensated by one such experience as mrs fontages for an afterlife of aesthetic privation i was restored to the present by eleanors looking at her watch the action mutely conveyed that something was expected of me i risked the temporizing statement that the picture was very interesting but mrs fontages polite assent revealed the poverty of the expedient eleanors impatience overflowed you would like my cousin to give you an idea of its value she suggested mrs fontage grew more erect no one she corrected with great gentleness can know its value quite as well as i who live with it we murmured our hasty concurrence but it might be interesting to hear she addressed herself to me as a mere matter of curiosity what estimate would be put on it from the purely commercial point of view if such a term may be used in speaking of a work of art i sounded a note of deprecation oh i understand of course she delicately anticipated me that that could never be your view your personal view but since occasions may arise do arise when it becomes necessary to to put a price on the priceless as it were i have thought miss copt has suggested some day eleanor encouraged her you might feel that the picture ought to belong to some one who has more more opportunity of showing it letting it be seen by the public for educational reasons i have tried mrs fontage admitted to see it in that light the crucial moment was upon me to escape the challenge of mrs fontages brilliant composure i turned once more to the picture if my courage needed reinforcement the picture amply furnished it looking at that lamentable canvas seemed the surest way of gathering strength to denounce it but behind me all the while i felt mrs fontages shuddering pride drawn up in a final effort of selfdefense i hated myself for my sentimental perversion of the situation reason argued that it was more cruel to deceive mrs fontage than to tell her the truth but that merely proved the inferiority of reason to instinct in situations involving any concession to the emotions along with her faith in the rembrandt i must destroy not only the whole fabric of mrs fontages past but even that lifelong habit of acquiescence in untested formulas that makes the best part of the average feminine strength i guessed the episode of the picture to be inextricably interwoven with the traditions and convictions which served to veil mrs fontages destitution not only from others but from herself viewed in that light the rembrandt had perhaps been worth its purchasemoney and i regretted that works of art do not commonly sell on the merit of the moral support they may have rendered from this unavailing flight i was recalled by the sense that something must be done to place a fictitious value on the picture was at best a provisional measure while the brutal alternative of advising mrs fontage to sell it for a hundred dollars at least afforded an opening to the charitably disposed purchaser i intended if other resources failed to put myself forward in that light but delicacy of course forbade my coupling my unflattering estimate of the rembrandt with an immediate offer to buy it all i could do was to inflict the wound the healing unguent must be withheld for later application i turned to mrs fontage who sat motionless her finelylined cheeks touched with an expectant color her eyes averted from the picture which was so evidently the one object they beheld my dear madam i began her vivid smile was like a light held up to dazzle me it shrouded every alternative in darkness and i had the flurried sense of having lost my way among the intricacies of my contention of a sudden i felt the hopelessness of finding a crack in her impenetrable conviction my words slipped from me like broken weapons the picture i faltered would of course be worth more if it were signed as it is i i hardly think on a conservative estimate it can be valued at at more than a thousand dollars say my deflected argument ran on somewhat aimlessly till it found itself plunging full tilt against the barrier of mrs fontages silence she sat as impassive as though i had not spoken eleanor loosed a few fluttering words of congratulation and encouragement but their flight was suddenly cut short mrs fontage had risen with a certain solemnity i could never she said gently her gentleness was adamantine under any circumstances whatever consider for a moment even the possibility of parting with the picture at such a price ii within three weeks a tremulous note from mrs fontage requested the favor of another visit if the writing was tremulous however the writers tone was firm she named her own day and hour without the conventional reference to her visitors convenience my first impulse was to turn the note over to eleanor i had acquitted myself of my share in the ungrateful business of coming to mrs fontages aid and if as her letter denoted she had now yielded to the closer pressure of need the business of finding a purchaser for the rembrandt might well be left to my cousins ingenuity but here conscience put in the uncomfortable reminder that it was i who in putting a price on the picture had raised the real obstacle in the way of mrs fontages rescue no one would give a thousand dollars for the rembrandt but to tell mrs fontage so had become as unthinkable as murder i had in fact on returning from my first inspection of the picture refrained from imparting to eleanor my opinion of its value eleanor is porous and i knew that sooner or later the unnecessary truth would exude through the loose texture of her dissimulation not infrequently she thus creates the misery she alleviates and i have sometimes suspected her of paining people in order that she might be sorry for them i had at all events cut off retreat in eleanors direction and the remaining alternative carried me straight to mrs fontage she received me with the same commanding sweetness the room was even barer than before i believe the carpet was gone but her manner built up about her a palace to which i was welcomed with high state and it was as a mere incident of the ceremony that i was presently made aware of her decision to sell the rembrandt my previous unsuccess in planning how to deal with mrs fontage had warned me to leave my farther course to chance and i listened to her explanation with complete detachment she had resolved to travel for her health her doctor advised it and as her absence might be indefinitely prolonged she had reluctantly decided to part with the picture in order to avoid the expense of storage and insurance her voice drooped at the admission and she hurried on detailing the vague itinerary of a journey that was to combine longpromised visits to impatient friends with various interesting opportunities less definitely specified the poor ladys skill in rearing a screen of verbiage about her enforced avowal had distracted me from my own share in the situation and it was with dismay that i suddenly caught the drift of her assumptions she expected me to buy the rembrandt for the museum she had taken my previous valuation as a tentative bid and when i came to my senses she was in the act of accepting my offer had i had a thousand dollars of my own to dispose of the bargain would have been concluded on the spot but i was in the impossible position of being materially unable to buy the picture and morally unable to tell her that it was not worth acquiring for the museum i dashed into the first evasion in sight i had no authority i explained to purchase pictures for the museum without the consent of the committee mrs fontage coped for a moment in silence with the incredible fact that i had rejected her offer then she ventured with a kind of pale precipitation but i understood miss copt tells me that you practically decide such matters for the committee i could guess what the effort had cost her my cousin is given to generalizations my opinion may have some weight with the committee well then she timidly prompted for that very reason i cant buy the picture she said with a drooping note i dont understand yet you told me i reminded her that you knew museums didnt buy unsigned pictures not for what they are worth every one knows that but i i understood the price you named her pride shuddered back from the abasement its a misunderstanding then she faltered to avoid looking at her i glanced desperately at the rembrandt could i but reason rejected the possibility even if the committee had been blind and they all were but crozier i simply shouldnt have dared to do it i stood up feeling that to cut the matter short was the only alleviation within reach mrs fontage had summoned her indomitable smile but its brilliancy dropped as i opened the door like a candle blown out by a draught if theres any one else if you knew any one who would care to see the picture i should be most happy she kept her eyes on me and i saw that in her case it hurt less than to look at the rembrandt i shall have to leave here you know she panted if nobody cares to have it iii that evening at my club i had just succeeded in losing sight of mrs fontage in the fumes of an excellent cigar when a voice at my elbow evoked her harassing image i want to talk to you the speaker said about mrs fontages rembrandt there isnt any i was about to growl but looking up i recognized the confiding countenance of mr jefferson rose mr rose was known to me chiefly as a young man suffused with a vague enthusiasm for virtue and my cousin eleanor one glance at his glossy exterior conveyed the assurance that his morals were as immaculate as his complexion and his linen goodness exuded from his moist eye his liquid voice the warm damp pressure of his trustful hand he had always struck me as one of the most uncomplicated organisms i had ever met his ideas were as simple and inconsecutive as the propositions in a primer and he spoke slowly with a kind of uniformity of emphasis that made his words stand out like the raised type for the blind an obvious incapacity for abstract conceptions made him peculiarly susceptible to the magic of generalization and one felt he would have been at the mercy of any cause that spelled itself with a capital letter it was hard to explain how with such a superabundance of merit he managed to be a good fellow i can only say that he performed the astonishing feat as naturally as he supported an invalid mother and two sisters on the slender salary of a bankers clerk he sat down beside me with an air of bright expectancy its a remarkable picture isnt it he said youve seen it ive been so fortunate miss copt was kind enough to get mrs fontages permission we went this afternoon i inwardly wished that eleanor had selected another victim unless indeed the visit were part of a plan whereby some third person better equipped for the cultivation of delusions was to be made to think the rembrandt remarkable knowing the limitations of mr roses resources i began to wonder if he had any rich aunts and her buying it in that way too he went on with his limpid smile from that old countess in brussels makes it all the more interesting doesnt it miss copt tells me its very seldom old pictures can be traced back for more than a generation i suppose the fact of mrs fontages knowing its history must add a good deal to its value uncertain as to his drift i said in her eyes it certainly appears to implications are lost on mr rose who glowingly continued thats the reason why i wanted to talk to you about it to consult you miss copt tells me you value it at a thousand dollars there was no denying this and i grunted a reluctant assent of course he went on earnestly your valuation is based on the fact that the picture isnt signed mrs fontage explained that and it does make a difference certainly but the thing is if the pictures really good ought one to take advantage i mean one can see that mrs fontage is in a tight place and i wouldnt for the world my astonished stare arrested him you wouldnt i mean you see its just this way he coughed and blushed i cant give more than a thousand dollars myself its as big a sum as i can manage to scrape together but before i make the offer i want to be sure im not standing in the way of her getting more money my astonishment lapsed to dismay youre going to buy the picture for a thousand dollars his blush deepened why yes it sounds rather absurd i suppose it isnt much in my line of course i can see the pictures very beautiful but im no judge it isnt the kind of thing naturally that i could afford to go in for but in this case im very glad to do what i can the circumstances are so distressing and knowing what you think of the picture i feel its a pretty safe investment i dont think i blurted out you i dont think the pictures worth a thousand dollars i dont think its worth ten cents i simply lied about it thats all mr rose looked as frightened as though i had charged him with the offense hang it man cant you see how it happened i saw the poor womans pride and happiness hung on her faith in that picture i tried to make her understand that it was worthless but she wouldnt i tried to tell her so but i couldnt i behaved like a maudlin ass but you shant pay for my infernal bungling you mustnt buy the picture mr rose sat silent tapping one glossy boottip with another suddenly he turned on me a glance of stored intelligence but you know he said goodhumoredly i rather think i must you havent already oh no the offers not made well then his look gathered a brighter significance but if the pictures worth nothing nobody will buy it i groaned except he continued some fellow like me who doesnt know anything i think its lovely you know i mean to hang it in my mothers sittingroom he rose and clasped my hand in his adhesive pressure im awfully obliged to you for telling me this but perhaps you wont mind my asking you not to mention our talk to miss copt it might bother her you know to think the picture isnt exactly up to the mark and it wont make a rap of difference to me iv mr rose left me to a sleepless night the next morning my resolve was formed and it carried me straight to mrs fontages she answered my knock by stepping out on the landing and as she shut the door behind her i caught a glimpse of her devastated interior she mentioned with a careful avoidance of the note of pathos on which our last conversation had closed that she was preparing to leave that afternoon and the trunks obstructing the threshold showed that her preparations were nearly complete they were i felt certain the same trunks that strapped behind a rattling vettura had accompanied the bride and groom on that memorable voyage of discovery of which the booty had till recently adorned her walls and there was a dim consolation in the thought that those early finds in coral and swiss woodcarving in lava and alabaster still lay behind the worn locks in the security of worthlessness mrs fontage on the landing among her strapped and corded treasures maintained the same air of stability that made it impossible even under such conditions to regard her flight as anything less dignified than a departure it was the moral support of what she tacitly assumed that enabled me to set forth with proper deliberation the object of my visit and she received my announcement with an absence of surprise that struck me as the very flower of tact under cover of these mutual assumptions the transaction was rapidly concluded and it was not till the canvas passed into my hands that as though the physical contact had unnerved her mrs fontage suddenly faltered its the giving it up she stammered disguising herself to the last and i hastened away from the collapse of her splendid effrontery i need hardly point out that i had acted impulsively and that reaction from the most honorable impulses is sometimes attended by moral perturbation my motives had indeed been mixed enough to justify some uneasiness but this was allayed by the instinctive feeling that it is more venial to defraud an institution than a man since mrs fontage had to be kept from starving by means not wholly defensible it was better that the obligation should be borne by a rich institution than an impecunious youth i doubt in fact if my scruples would have survived a nights sleep had they not been complicated by some uncertainty as to my own future it was true that subject to the purely formal assent of the committee i had full power to buy for the museum and that the one member of the committee likely to dispute my decision was opportunely travelling in europe but the picture once in place i must face the risk of any expert criticism to which chance might expose it i dismissed this contingency for future study stored the rembrandt in the cellar of the museum and thanked heaven that crozier was abroad six months later he strolled into my office i had just concluded under conditions of exceptional difficulty and on terms unexpectedly benign the purchase of the great bartley reynolds and this circumstance by relegating the matter of the rembrandt to a lower stratum of consciousness enabled me to welcome crozier with unmixed pleasure my security was enhanced by his appearance his smile was charged with amiable reminiscences and i inferred that his trip had put him in the humor to approve of everything or at least to ignore what fell short of his approval i had therefore no uneasiness in accepting his invitation to dine that evening it is always pleasant to dine with crozier and never more so than when he is just back from europe his conversation gives even the food a flavor of the cafр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в

after it i think we got it cheap connu connu said crozier pleasantly i know all about the reynolds it was the biggest kind of a haul and i congratulate you best stroke of business weve done yet but tell me about the other picture the rembrandt i never said it was a rembrandt i could hardly have said why but i felt distinctly annoyed with crozier of course not theres rembrandt on the frame but i saw youd modified it to dutch school i apologize he paused but i offered no explanation what about it he went on where did you pick it up as he leaned to the flame of the cigarlighter his face seemed ruddy with enjoyment i got it for a song i said a thousand i think have you seen it i asked abruptly went over the place this afternoon and found it in the cellar why hasnt it been hung by the way i paused a moment im waiting to to have it varnished ah he leaned back and poured himself a second glass of chartreuse the smile he confided to its golden depths provoked me to challenge him with what do you think of it the rembrandt he lifted his eyes from the glass just what you do it isnt a rembrandt i apologize again you call it i believe a picture of the same period im uncertain of the period hm he glanced appreciatively along his cigar what are you certain of that its a damned bad picture i said savagely he nodded just so thats all we wanted to know we we i the committee in short you see my dear fellow if you hadnt been certain it was a damned bad picture our position would have been a little awkward as it is my remaining duty i ought to explain that in this matter im acting for the committee is as simple as its agreeable ill be hanged i burst out if i understand one word youre saying he fixed me with a kind of cruel joyousness you will you will he assured me at least youll begin

restrict the assertion she doesnt know my opinion of the picture i thirsted for five minutes with eleanor are you quite sure crozier took me up mr jefferson rose does ah i see i thought you would he

look up anything and i found she knew all about the rembrandt all precisely the knowledge was in fact causing her sleepless nights mr rose who was suffering from the same form of insomnia had taken her into his confidence and she ultimately took me into hers of course i must ask you to do your cousin justice she didnt speak till it became evident to her uncommonly quick perceptions that your buying the picture on its merits would have been infinitely worse for for everybody than your diverting a small portion of the museums funds to philanthropic uses then she told me the moving incident of mr rose good fellow rose and the old ladys case was desperate somebody had to buy that picture i moved uneasily in my seat wait a moment will you i havent finished my cigar theres a little head of il fiammingos that you havent seen by the way i picked it up the other day in parma well go in and have a look at it presently but meanwhile what i want to say is that ive been charged in the most informal way to express to you the committees appreciation of your admirable promptness and energy in capturing the bartley reynolds we shouldnt have got it at all if you hadnt been uncommonly wideawake and to get it at such a price is a double triumph wed have thought nothing of a few more thousands i dont see i impatiently interposed that as far as im concerned that alters the case the case of mrs fontages rembrandt i bought the picture because as you say the situation was desperate and i couldnt raise a thousand myself what i did was of course indefensible but the money shall be refunded tomorrow crozier raised a protesting hand dont interrupt me when im talking ex cathedra the moneys been refunded already the fact is the museum has sold the rembrandt i stared at him wildly sold it to whom why to the committee hold on a bit please wont you take another cigar then perhaps i can finish what ive got to say why my dear fellow the committees under an obligation to you thats the way we look at it ive investigated mrs fontages case and well the picture had to be bought shes eating meat now i believe for the first time in a year and theyd have turned her out into the street that very day your cousin tells me something had to be done at once and youve simply given a number of welltodo and selfindulgent gentlemen the opportunity of performing at very small individual expense a meritorious action in the nick of time thats the first thing ive got to thank you for and then youll remember please that i have the floor that im still speaking for the committee and secondly as a slight recognition of your services in securing the bartley reynolds at a very much lower figure than we were prepared to pay we beg you the committee begs you to accept the gift of mrs fontages rembrandt now well go in and look at that little head the moving finger the news of mrs grancys death came to me with the shock of an immense blunder one of fates most irretrievable acts of vandalism it was as though all sorts of renovating forces had been checked by the clogging of that one wheel not that mrs grancy contributed any perceptible momentum to the social machine her unique distinction was that of filling to perfection her special place in the world so many people are like badlycomposed statues overlapping their niches at one point and leaving them vacant at another mrs grancys niche was her husbands life and if it be argued that the space was not large enough for its vacancy to leave a very big gap i can only say that at the last resort such dimensions must be determined by finer instruments than any readymade standard of utility ralph grancys was in short a kind of disembodied usefulness one of those constructive influences that instead of crystallizing into definite forms remain as it were a medium for the development of clear thinking and fine feeling he faithfully irrigated his own dusty patch of life and the fruitful moisture stole far beyond his boundaries if to carry on the metaphor grancys life was a sedulouslycultivated enclosure his wife was the flower he had planted in its midst the embowering tree rather which gave him rest and shade at its foot and the wind of dreams in its upper branches we had all his small but devoted band of followers known a moment when it seemed likely that grancy would fail us we had watched him pitted against one stupid obstacle after another illhealth poverty misunderstanding and worst of all for a man of his texture his first wifes soft insidious egotism we had seen him sinking under the leaden embrace of her affection like a swimmer in a drowning clutch but just as we despaired he had always come to the surface again blinded panting but striking out fiercely for the shore when at last her death released him it became a question as to how much of the man she had carried with her left alone he revealed numb withered patches like a tree from which a parasite has been stripped but gradually he began to put out new leaves and when he met the lady who was to become his second wife his one real wife as his friends reckoned the whole man burst into flower the second mrs grancy was past thirty when he married her and it was clear that she had harvested that crop of middle joy which is rooted in young despair but if she had lost the surface of eighteen she had kept its inner light if her cheek lacked the gloss of immaturity her eyes were young with the stored youth of half a lifetime grancy had first known her somewhere in the east i believe she was the sister of one of our consuls out there and when he brought her home to new york she came among us as a stranger the idea of grancys remarriage had been a shock to us all after one such calcining most men would have kept out of the fire but we agreed that he was predestined to sentimental blunders and we awaited with resignation the embodiment of his latest mistake then mrs grancy came and we understood she was the most beautiful and the most complete of explanations we shuffled our defeated omniscience out of sight and gave it hasty burial under a prodigality of welcome for the first time in years we had grancy off our minds hell do something great now the least sanguine of us prophesied and our sentimentalist emended he has done it in marrying her it was claydon the portraitpainter who risked this hyperbole and who soon afterward at the happy husbands request prepared to defend it in a portrait of mrs grancy we were all even claydon ready to concede that mrs grancys unwontedness was in some degree a matter of environment her graces were complementary and it needed the mates call to reveal the flash of color beneath her neutraltinted wings but if she needed grancy to interpret her how much greater was the service she rendered him claydon professionally described her as the right frame for him but if she defined she also enlarged if she threw the whole into perspective she also cleared new ground opened fresh vistas reclaimed whole areas of activity that had run to waste under the harsh husbandry of privation this interaction of sympathies was not without its visible expression claydon was not alone in maintaining that grancys presence or indeed the mere mention of his name had a perceptible effect on his wifes appearance it was as though a light were shifted a curtain drawn back as though to borrow another of claydons metaphors love the indefatigable artist were perpetually seeking a happier pose for his model in this interpretative light mrs grancy acquired the charm which makes some womens faces like a book of which the last page is never turned there was always something new to read in her eyes what claydon read there or at least such scattered hints of the ritual as reached him through the sanctuary doors his portrait in due course declared to us when the picture was exhibited it was at once acclaimed as his masterpiece but the people who knew mrs grancy smiled and said it was flattered claydon however had not set out to paint their mrs grancy or ours even but ralphs and ralph knew his own at a glance at the first confrontation he saw that claydon had understood as for mrs grancy when the finished picture was shown to her she turned to the painter and said simply ah youve done me facing the east the picture then for all its value seemed a mere incident in the unfolding of their double destiny a footnote to the illuminated text of their lives it was not till afterward that it acquired the significance of last words spoken on a threshold never to be recrossed grancy a year after his marriage had given up his town house and carried his bliss an hours journey away to a little place among the hills his various duties and interests brought him frequently to new york but we necessarily saw him less often than when his house had served as the rallyingpoint of kindred enthusiasms it seemed a pity that such an influence should be withdrawn but we all felt that his long arrears of happiness should be paid in whatever coin he chose the distance from which the fortunate couple radiated warmth on us was not too great for friendship to traverse and our conception of a glorified leisure took the form of sundays spent in the grancys library with its sedative rural outlook and the portrait of mrs grancy illuminating its studious walls the picture was at its best in that setting and we used to accuse claydon of visiting mrs grancy in order to see her portrait he met this by declaring that the portrait was mrs grancy and there were moments when the statement seemed unanswerable one of us indeed i think it must have been the novelist said that clayton had been saved from falling in love with mrs grancy only by falling in love with his picture of her and it was noticeable that he to whom his finished work was no more than the shed husk of future effort showed a perennial tenderness for this one achievement we smiled afterward to think how often when mrs grancy was in the room her presence reflecting itself in our talk like a gleam of sky in a hurrying current claydon averted from the real woman would sit as it were listening to the picture his attitude at the time seemed only a part of the unusualness of those picturesque afternoons when the most familiar combinations of life underwent a magical change some human happiness is a landlocked lake but the grancys was an open sea stretching a buoyant and illimitable surface to the voyaging interests of life there was room and to spare on those waters for all our separate ventures and always beyond the sunset a mirage of the fortunate isles toward which our prows bent ii it was in rome that three years later i heard of her death the notice said suddenly i was glad of that i was glad too basely perhaps to be away from grancy at a time when silence must have seemed obtuse and speech derisive i was still in rome when a few months afterward he suddenly arrived there he had been appointed secretary of legation at constantinople and was on the way to his post he had taken the place he said frankly to get away our relations with the porte held out a prospect of hard work and that he explained was what he needed he could never be satisfied to sit down among the ruins i saw that like most of us in moments of extreme moral tension he was playing a part behaving as he thought it became a man to behave in the eye of disaster the instinctive posture of grief is a shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration and pride feels the need of striking a worthier attitude in face of such a foe grancy by nature musing and retrospective had chosen the rр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр в рірвўр вђрв

daffaires he acquitted himself under trying conditions with conspicuous zeal and discretion a political redistribution of matter removed him from office just as he had proved his usefulness to the government and the following summer i heard that he had come home and was down at his place in the country on my return to town i wrote him and his reply came by the next post he answered as it were in his natural voice urging me to spend the following sunday with him and suggesting that i should bring down any of the old set who could be persuaded to join me i thought this a good sign and yet shall i own it i was vaguely disappointed perhaps we are apt to feel that our friends sorrows should be kept like those historic monuments from which the encroaching ivy is periodically removed that very evening at the club i ran across claydon i told him of grancys invitation and proposed that we should go down together but he pleaded an engagement i was sorry for i had always felt that he and i stood nearer ralph than the others and if the old sundays were to be renewed i should have preferred that we two should spend the first alone with him i said as much to claydon and offered to fit my time to his but he met this by a general refusal i dont want to go to grancys he said bluntly i waited a moment but he appended no qualifying clause youve seen him since he came back i finally ventured claydon nodded and is he so awfully bad bad no hes all right all right how can he be unless hes changed beyond all recognition oh youll recognize him said claydon with a puzzling deflection of emphasis his ambiguity was beginning to exasperate me and i felt myself shut out from some knowledge to which i had as good a right as he youve been down there already i suppose yes ive been down there and youve done with each other the partnership is dissolved done with each other i wish to god we had he rose nervously and tossed aside the review from which my approach had diverted him look here he said standing before me ralphs the best fellow going and theres nothing under heaven i wouldnt do for him short of going down there again and with that he walked out of the room claydon was incalculable enough for me to read a dozen different meanings into his words but none of my interpretations satisfied me i determined at any rate to seek no farther for a companion and the next sunday i travelled down to grancys alone he met me at the station and i saw at once that he had changed since our last meeting then he had been in fighting array but now if he and grief still housed together it was no longer as enemies physically the transformation was as marked but less reassuring if the spirit triumphed the body showed its scars at fiveandforty he was gray and stooping with the tired gait of an old man his serenity however was not the resignation of age i saw that he did not mean to drop out of the game almost immediately he began to speak of our old interests not with an effort as at our former meeting but simply and naturally in the tone of a man whose life has flowed back into its normal channels i remembered with a touch of selfreproach how i had distrusted his reconstructive powers but my admiration for his reserved force was now tinged by the sense that after all such happiness as his ought to have been paid with his last coin the feeling grew as we neared the house and i found how inextricably his wife was interwoven with my remembrance of the place how the whole scene was but an extension of that vivid presence within doors nothing was changed and my hand would have dropped without surprise into her welcoming clasp it was luncheontime and grancy led me at once to the diningroom where the walls the furniture the very plate and porcelain seemed a mirror in which a moment since her face had been reflected i wondered whether grancy under the recovered tranquillity of his smile concealed the same sense of her nearness saw perpetually between himself and the actual her bright unappeasable ghost he spoke of her once or twice in an easy incidental way and her name seemed to hang in the air after he had uttered it like a chord that continues to vibrate if he felt her presence it was evidently as an enveloping medium the moral atmosphere in which he breathed i had never before known how completely the dead may survive after luncheon we went for a long walk through the autumnal fields and woods and dusk was falling when we reentered the house grancy led the way to the library where at this hour his wife had always welcomed us back to a bright fire and a cup of tea the room faced the west and held a clear light of its own after the rest of the house had grown dark i remembered how young she had looked in this pale gold light which irradiated her eyes and hair or silhouetted her girlish outline as she passed before the windows of all the rooms the library was most peculiarly hers and here i felt that her nearness might take visible shape then all in a moment as grancy opened the door the feeling vanished and a kind of resistance met me on the threshold i looked about me was the room changed had some desecrating hand effaced the traces of her presence no here too the setting was undisturbed my feet sank into the same deeppiled daghestan the bookshelves took the firelight on the same rows of rich subdued bindings her armchair stood in its old place near the teatable and from the opposite wall her face confronted me her face but was it hers i moved nearer and stood looking up at the portrait grancys glance had followed mine and i heard him move to my side you see a change in it he said what does it mean i asked it means that five years have passed over her why not look at me he pointed to his gray hair and furrowed temples what do you think kept her so young it was happiness but now he looked up at her with infinite tenderness i like her better so he said its what she would have wished have wished that we should grow old together do you think she would have wanted to be left behind i stood speechless my gaze travelling from his worn griefbeaten features to the painted face above it was not furrowed like his but a veil of years seemed to have descended on it the bright hair had lost its elasticity the cheek its clearness the brow its light the whole woman had waned grancy laid his hand on my arm you dont like it he said sadly like it i ive lost her i burst out and ive found her he answered in that i cried with a reproachful gesture yes in that he swung round on me almost defiantly the other had become a sham a lie this is the way she would have looked does look i mean claydon ought to know oughtnt he i turned suddenly did claydon do this for you grancy nodded since your return yes i sent for him after id been back a week he turned away and gave a thrust to the smouldering fire i followed glad to leave the picture behind me grancy threw himself into a chair near the hearth so that the light fell on his sensitive variable face he leaned his head back shading his eyes with his hand and began to speak iii you fellows knew enough of my early history to a guess what my second marriage meant to me i say guess because no one could understand really ive always had a feminine streak in me i suppose the need of a pair of eyes that should see with me of a pulse that should keep time with mine life is a big thing of course a magnificent spectacle but i got so tired of looking at it alone still its always good to live and i had plenty of happiness of the evolved kind what id never had a taste of was the simple inconscient sort that one breathes in like the air well i met her it was like finding the climate in which i was meant to live you know what she was how indefinitely she multiplied ones points of contact with life how she lit up the caverns and bridged the abysses well i swear to you though i suppose the sense of all that was latent in me that what i used to think of on my way home at the end of the day was simply that when i opened this door shed be sitting over there with the lamplight falling in a particular way on one little curl in her neck when claydon painted her he caught just the look she used to lift to mine when i came in ive wondered sometimes at his knowing how she looked when she and i were alone how i rejoiced in that picture i used to say to her youre my prisoner now i shall never lose you if you grew tired of me and left me youd leave your real self there on the wall it was always one of our jokes that she was going to grow tired of me three years of it and then she died it was so sudden that there was no change no diminution it was as if she had suddenly become fixed immovable like her own portrait as if time had ceased at its happiest hour just as claydon had thrown down his brush one day and said i cant do better than that i went away as you know and stayed over there five years i worked as hard as i knew how and after the first black months a little light stole in on me from thinking that she would have been interested in what i was doing i came to feel that she was interested that she was there and that she knew im not talking any psychical jargon im simply trying to express the sense i had that an influence so full so abounding as hers couldnt pass like a spring shower we had so lived into each others hearts and minds that the consciousness of what she would have thought and felt illuminated all i did at first she used to come back shyly tentatively as though not sure of finding me then she stayed longer and longer till at last she became again the very air i breathed there were bad moments of course when her nearness mocked me with the loss of the real woman but gradually the distinction between the two was effaced and the mere thought of her grew warm as flesh and blood then i came home i landed in the morning and came straight down here the thought of seeing her portrait possessed me and my heart beat like a lovers as i opened the library door it was in the afternoon and the room was full of light it fell on her picture the picture of a young and radiant woman she smiled at me coldly across the distance that divided us i had the feeling that she didnt even recognize me and then i caught sight of myself in the mirror over there a grayhaired broken man whom she had never known for a week we two lived together the strange woman and the strange man i used to sit night after night and question her smiling face but no answer ever came what did she know of me after all we were irrevocably separated by the five years of life that lay between us at times as i sat here i almost grew to hate her for her presence had driven away my gentle ghost the real wife who had wept aged struggled with me during those awful years it was the worst loneliness ive ever known then gradually i began to notice a look of sadness in the pictures eyes a look that seemed to say dont you see that i am lonely too and all at once it came over me how she would have hated to be left behind i remembered her comparing life to a heavy book that could not be read with ease unless two people held it together and i thought how impatiently her hand would have turned the pages that divided us so the idea came to me its the picture that stands between us the picture that is dead and not my wife to sit in this room is to keep watch beside a corpse as this feeling grew on me the portrait became like a beautiful mausoleum in which she had been buried alive i could hear her beating against the painted walls and crying to me faintly for help one day i found i couldnt stand it any longer and i sent for claydon he came down and i told him what id been through and what i wanted him to do at first he refused pointblank to touch the picture the next morning i went off for a long tramp and when i came home i found him sitting here alone he looked at me sharply for a moment and then he said ive changed my mind ill do it i arranged one of the north rooms as a studio and he shut himself up there for a day then he sent for me the picture stood there as you see it now it was as though shed met me on the threshold and taken me in her arms i tried to thank him to tell him what it meant to me but he cut me short theres an up train at five isnt there he asked im booked for a dinner tonight i shall just have time to make a bolt for the station and you can send my traps after me i havent seen him since i can guess what it cost him to lay hands on his masterpiece but after all to him it was only a picture lost to me it was my wife regained iv after that for ten years or more i watched the strange spectacle of a life of hopeful and productive effort based on the structure of a dream there could be no doubt to those who saw grancy during this period that he drew his strength and courage from the sense of his wifes mystic participation in his task when i went back to see him a few months later i found the portrait had been removed from the library and placed in a small study upstairs to which he had transferred his desk and a few books he told me he always sat there when he was alone keeping the library for his sunday visitors those who missed the portrait of course made no comment on its absence and the few who were in his secret respected it gradually all his old friends had gathered about him and our sunday afternoons regained something of their former character but claydon never reappeared among us as i look back now i see that grancy must have been failing from the time of his return home his invincible spirit belied and disguised the signs of weakness that afterward asserted themselves in my remembrance of him he seemed to have an inexhaustible fund of life to draw on and more than one of us was a pensioner on his superfluity nevertheless when i came back one summer from my european holiday and heard that he had been at the point of death i understood at once that we had believed him well only because he wished us to i hastened down to the country and found him midway in a slow convalescence i felt then that he was lost to us and he read my thought at a glance ah he said im an old man now and no mistake i suppose we shall have to go halfspeed after this but we shant need towing just yet the plural pronoun struck me and involuntarily i looked up at mrs grancys portrait line by line i saw my fear reflected in it it was the face of a woman who knows that her husband is dying my heart stood still at the thought of what claydon had done grancy had followed my glance yes its changed her he said quietly for months you know it was touch and go with me we had a long fight of it and it was worse for her than for me after a pause he added claydon has been very kind hes so busy nowadays that i seldom see him but when i sent for him the other day he came down at once i was silent and we spoke no more of grancys illness but when i took leave it seemed like shutting him in alone with his deathwarrant the next time i went down to see him he looked much better it was a sunday and he received me in the library so that i did not see the portrait again he continued to improve and toward spring we began to feel that as he had said he might yet travel a long way without being towed one evening on returning to town after a visit which had confirmed my sense of reassurance i found claydon dining alone at the club he asked me to join him and over the coffee our talk turned to his work if youre not too busy i said at length you ought to make time to go down to grancys again he looked up quickly why he asked because hes quite well again i returned with a touch of cruelty his wifes prognostications were mistaken claydon stared at me a moment oh she knows he affirmed with a smile that chilled me you mean to leave the portrait as it is then i persisted he shrugged his shoulders he hasnt sent for me yet a waiter came up with the cigars and claydon rose and joined another group it was just a fortnight later that grancys housekeeper telegraphed for me she met me at the station with the news that he had been taken bad and that the doctors were with him i had to wait for some time in the deserted library before the medical men appeared they had the baffled manner of empirics who have been superseded by the great healer and i lingered only long enough to hear that grancy was not suffering and that my presence could do him no harm i found him seated in his armchair in the little study he held out his hand with a smile you see she was right after all he said she i repeated perplexed for the moment my wife he indicated the picture of course i knew she had no hope from the first i saw that he lowered his voice after claydon had been here but i wouldnt believe it at first i caught his hands in mine for gods sake dont believe it now i adjured him he shook his head gently its too late he said i might have known that she knew but grancy listen to me i began and then i stopped what could i say that would convince him there was no common ground of argument on which we could meet and after all it would be easier for him to die feeling that she had known strangely enough i saw that claydon had missed his mark v grancys will named me as one of his executors and my associate having other duties on his hands begged me to assume the task of carrying out our friends wishes this placed me under the necessity of informing claydon that the portrait of mrs grancy had been bequeathed to him and he replied by the next post that he would send for the picture at once i was staying in the deserted house when the portrait was taken away and as the door closed on it i felt that grancys presence had vanished too was it his turn to follow her now and could one ghost haunt another after that for a year or two i heard nothing more of the picture and though i met claydon from time to time we had little to say to each other i had no definable grievance against the man and i tried to remember that he had done a fine thing in sacrificing his best picture to a friend but my resentment had all the tenacity of unreason one day however a lady whose portrait he had just finished begged me to go with her to see it to refuse was impossible and i went with the less reluctance that i knew i was not the only friend she had invited the others were all grouped around the easel when i entered and after contributing my share to the chorus of approval i turned away and began to stroll about the studio claydon was something of a collector and his things were generally worth looking at the studio was a long tapestried room with a curtained archway at one end the curtains were looped back showing a smaller apartment with books and flowers and a few fine bits of bronze and porcelain the teatable standing in this inner room proclaimed that it was open to inspection and i wandered in a bleu poudrр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр

face with mrs grancys portrait i stared up at her blankly and she smiled back at me in all the recovered radiance of youth the artist had effaced every trace of his later touches and the original picture had reappeared it throned alone on the panelled wall asserting a brilliant supremacy over its carefullychosen surroundings i felt in an instant that the whole room was tributary to it that claydon had heaped his treasures at the feet of the woman he loved yes it was the woman he had loved and not the picture and my instinctive resentment was explained suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder ah how could you i cried turning on him how could i he retorted how could i not doesnt she belong to me now i moved away impatiently wait a moment he said with a detaining gesture the others have gone and i want to say a word to you oh i know what youve thought of me i can guess you think i killed grancy i suppose i was startled by his sudden vehemence i think you tried to do a cruel thing i said ah what a little way you others see into life he murmured sit down a moment here where we can look at her and ill tell you he threw himself on the ottoman beside me and sat gazing up at the picture with his hands clasped about his knee pygmalion he began slowly turned his statue into a real woman i turned my real woman into a picture small compensation you think but you dont know how much of a woman belongs to you after youve painted her well i made the best of it at any rate i gave her the best i had in me and she gave me in return what such a woman gives by merely being and after all she rewarded me enough by making me paint as i shall never paint again there was one side of her though that was mine alone and that was her beauty for no one else understood it to grancy even it was the mere expression of herself what language is to thought even when he saw the picture he didnt guess my secret he was so sure she was all his as though a man should think he owned the moon because it was reflected in the pool at his door well when he came home and sent for me to change the picture it was like asking me to commit murder he wanted me to make an old woman of her of her who had been so divinely unchangeably young as if any man who really loved a woman would ask her to sacrifice her youth and beauty for his sake at first i told him i couldnt do it but afterward when he left me alone with the picture something queer happened i suppose it was because i was always so confoundedly fond of grancy that it went against me to refuse what he asked anyhow as i sat looking up at her she seemed to say im not yours but his and i want you to make me what he wishes and so i did it i could have cut my hand off when the work was done i daresay he told you i never would go back and look at it he thought i was too busy he never understood well and then last year he sent for me again you remember it was after his illness and he told me hed grown twenty years older and that he wanted her to grow older too he didnt want her to be left behind the doctors all thought he was going to get well at that time and he thought so too and so did i when i first looked at him but when i turned to the picture ah now i dont ask you to believe me but i swear it was her face that told me he was dying and that she wanted him to know it she had a message for him and she made me deliver it he rose abruptly and walked toward the portrait then he sat down beside me again cruel yes it seemed so to me at first and this time if i resisted it was for his sake and not for mine but all the while i felt her eyes drawing me and gradually she made me understand if shed been there in the flesh she seemed to say wouldnt she have seen before any of us that he was dying wouldnt he have read the news first in her face and wouldnt it be horrible if now he should discover it instead in strange eyes well that was what she wanted of me and i did it i kept them together to the last he looked up at the picture again but now she belongs to me he repeated the confessional when i was a young man i thought a great deal of local color at that time it was still a pigment of recent discovery and supposed to have a peculiarly stimulating effect on the mental eye as an aid to the imagination its value was perhaps overrated but as an object of pursuit to that vagrant faculty it had all the merits claimed for it i certainly never hunted any game better worth my powder and to a young man with rare holidays and long working hours its value was enhanced by the fact that one might bring it down at any turn if only one kept ones eye alert and ones hand on the trigger even the large manufacturing city where for some years my young enthusiasms were chained to an accountants desk was not without its romantic opportunities many of the millhands at dunstable were italians and a foreign settlement had formed itself in that unsavory and unsanitary portion of the town known as the point the point like more aristocratic communities had its residential and commercial districts its church its theatre and its restaurant when the craving for local color was on me it was my habit

materially aided by agostino the holloweyed and lowcollared waiter whose slimy napkin never lost its latin flourish and whose zeal for my comfort was not infrequently displayed by his testing the warmth of my soup with his finger through agostino i became acquainted with the inner history of the colony heard the details of its feuds and vendettas and learned to know by sight the leading characters in these domestic dramas the restaurant was frequented by the chief personages of the community the overseer of the italian hands at the meriton mills the doctor his wife the levatrice a plump neapolitan with greasy ringlets a plush picturehat and a charm against the evileye hanging in a crease of her neck and lastly by don egidio the parocco of the little church across the street the doctor and his wife came only on feast days but the overseer and don egidio were regular patrons the former was a quiet saturninelooking man of accomplished manners but reluctant speech and i depended for my diversion chiefly on don egidio whose large looselyhung lips were always ajar for conversation the remarks issuing from them were richly tinged by the gutturals of the bergamasque dialect and it needed but a slight acquaintance with italian types to detect the lombard peasant under the priests rusty cassock this inference was confirmed by don egidios telling me that he came from a village of val camonica the radiant valley which extends northward from the lake of iseo to the adamello glaciers his stepfather had been a laborer on one of the fruitfarms of a milanese count who owned large estates in the val camonica and that gentleman taking a fancy to the lad whom he had seen at work in his orchards had removed him to his villa on the lake of iseo and had subsequently educated him for the church it was doubtless to this picturesque accident that don egidio owed the mingling of ease and simplicity that gave an inimitable charm to his stout shabby presence it was as though some wild mountainfruit had been transplanted to the counts orchards and had mellowed under cultivation without losing its sylvan flavor i have never seen the social art carried farther without suggestion of artifice the fact that don egidios amenities were mainly exercised on the millhands composing his parish proved the genuineness of his gift it is easier to simulate gentility among gentlemen than among navvies and the plain man is a touchstone who draws out all the alloy in the gold among his parishioners don egidio ruled with the cheerful despotism of the good priest on cardinal points he was inflexible but in minor matters he had that elasticity of judgment which enables the catholic discipline to fit itself to every inequality of the human conscience there was no appeal from his verdict but his judgmentseat was a revolving chair from which he could view the same act at various angles his influence was acknowledged not only by his flock but by the policeman at the corner the barkeep in the dive the ward politician in the corner grocery the general verdict of dunstable was that the point would have been hell without the priest it was perhaps not precisely heaven with him but such light of the upper sky as pierced its murky atmosphere was reflected from don egidios countenance it is hardly possible for any one to exercise such influence without taking pleasure in it and on the whole the priest was probably a contented man though it does not follow that he was a happy one on this point the first stages of our acquaintance yielded much food for conjecture at first sight don egidio was the image of cheerfulness he had all the physical indications of a mind at ease the leisurely rolling gait the ready laugh the hospitable eye of the man whose sympathies are always on the latch it took me some time to discover under his surface garrulity the impenetrable reticence of his profession and under his enjoyment of trifles a levelling melancholy which made all enjoyment trifling don egidios aspect and conversation were so unsuggestive of psychological complexities that i set down this trait to poverty or homesickness there are few classes of men more frugal in tastes and habit than the village priest in italy but don egidio by his own account had been introduced at an impressionable age to a way of living that must have surpassed his wildest dreams of selfindulgence to whatever privations his parochial work had since accustomed him the influences of that earlier life were too perceptible in his talk not to have made a profound impression on his tastes and he remained for all his apostolic simplicity the image of the family priest who has his seat at the rich mans table it chanced that i had used one of my short european holidays to explore afoot the romantic passes connecting the valtelline with the lake of iseo and my remembrance of that enchanting region made it seem impossible that don egidio should ever look without a reminiscent pang on the grimy perspective of his parochial streets the transition was too complete too ironical from those rich glades and titianesque acclivities to the brick hovels and fissured sidewalks of the point this impression was confirmed when don egidio in response to my urgent invitation paid his first visit to my modest lodgings he called one winter evening when a woodfire in its happiest humor was giving a factitious lustre to my bookshelves and bringing out the values of the one or two old prints and chinese porcelains that accounted for the perennial shabbiness of my wardrobe ah said he with a murmur of satisfaction as he laid aside his shiny hat and bulging umbrella it is a long time since i have been in a casa signorile my remembrance of his own room he lodged with the doctor and

was the most temperate of men and never exceeded his one glass but he liked to sit by the hour puffing at my cabanas which i suspected him of preferring to the black weed of his native country under the influence of my tobacco he became even more blandly garrulous and i sometimes fancied that of all the obligations of his calling none could have placed such a strain on him as that of preserving the secrets of the confessional he often talked of his early life at the counts villa where he had been educated with his patrons two sons till he was of age to be sent to the seminary and i could see that the years spent in simple and familiar intercourse with his benefactors had been the most vivid chapter in his experience the italian peasants inarticulate tenderness for the beauty of his birthplace had been specialized in him by contact with cultivated tastes and he could tell me not only that the count had a stupendous collection of pictures but that the chapel of the villa contained a sepulchral monument by bambaja and that the artcritics were divided as to the authenticity of the leonardo in the family palace at milan on all these subjects he was inexhaustibly voluble but there was one point which he always avoided and that was his reason for coming to america i remember the round turn with which he brought me up when i questioned him a priest said he is a soldier and must obey orders like a soldier he set down his glass of marsala and strolled across the room i had not observed he went on that you have here a photograph of the sposalizio of the brera what a picture р в

a point where his native garrulity was protected by the chainmail of religious discipline that every catholic priest wears beneath his cassock i had too much respect for my friend to wish to penetrate his armor and now and then i almost fancied he was grateful to me for not putting his reticence to the test don egidio must have been past sixty when i made his acquaintance but it was not till the close of an exceptionally harsh winter some five or six years after our first meeting that i began to think of him as an old man it was as though the longcontinued cold had cracked and shrivelled him he had grown bent and hollowchested and his lower lip shook like an unhinged door the summer heat did little to revive him and in september when i came home from my vacation i found him just recovering from an attack of pneumonia that autumn he did not care to venture often into the night air and now and then i used to go and sit with him in his little room to which i had contributed the unheardof luxuries of an easychair and a gasstove my engagements however made these visits infrequent and several weeks had elapsed without my seeing the parocco when one snowy november morning i ran across him in the railwaystation i was on my way to new york for the day and had just time to wave a greeting to him as i jumped into the railwaycarriage but a moment later to my surprise i saw him stiffly clambering into the same train i found him seated in the common car with his umbrella between his knees and a bundle done up in a red cotton handkerchief on the seat at his side the caution with which at my approach he transferred this bundle to his arms caused me to glance at it in surprise and he answered my look by saying with a smile they are flowers for the dead the most exquisite flowers from the greenhouses of mr meriton si figuri and he waved a descriptive hand one of my lads gianpietro is employed by the gardener there and every year on this day he brings me a beautiful bunch of flowers for such a purpose it is no sin he added with the charming italian pliancy of judgment and why are you travelling in this snowy weather signor parocco i asked as he ended with a cough he fixed me gravely with his simple shallow eye because it is the day of the dead my son he said and i go to place these on the grave of the noblest man that ever lived you are going to new york to brooklyn i hesitated a moment wishing to question him yet uncertain whether his replies were curtailed by the persistency of his cough or by the desire to avoid interrogation this is no weather to be travelling with such a cough i said at length he made a deprecating gesture i have never missed the day not once in eighteen years but for me he would have no one he folded his hands on his umbrella and looked away from me to hide the trembling of his lip i resolved on a last attempt to storm his confidence your friend is buried in calvary cemetery he signed an assent that is a long way for you to go alone signor parocco the streets are sure to be slippery and there is an icy wind blowing give me your flowers and let me send them to the cemetery by a messenger i give you my word they shall reach their destination safely he turned a quiet look on me my son you are young he said and you dont know how the dead need us he drew his breviary from his pocket and opened it with a smile mi scusi he murmured the business which had called me to town obliged me to part from him as soon as the train entered the station and in my dash for the street i left his unwieldy figure laboring far behind me through the crowd on the platform before we separated however i had learned that he was returning to dunstable by the four oclock train and had resolved to despatch my business in time to travel home with him when i reached wall street i was received with the news that the man i had appointed to meet was ill and detained in the country my business was off and i found myself with the rest of the day at my disposal i had no difficulty in deciding how to employ my time i was at an age when in such contingencies there is always a feminine alternative and even now i dont know how it was that on my way to a certain hospitable luncheontable i suddenly found myself in a cab which was carrying me at fullspeed to the twentythird street ferry it was not till i had bought my ticket and seated myself in the varnished tunnel of the ferryboat that i was aware of having been diverted from my purpose by an overmastering anxiety for don egidio i rapidly calculated that he had not more than an hours advance on me and that allowing for my greater agility and for the fact that i had a cab at my call i was likely to reach the cemetery in time to see him under shelter before the gusts of sleet that were already sweeping across the river had thickened to a snowstorm at the gates of the cemetery i began to take a less sanguine view of my attempt the commemorative anniversary had filled the silent avenues with visitors and i felt the futility of my quest as i tried to fix the gatekeepers attention on my delineation of a stout italian priest with a bad cough and a bunch of flowers tied up in a red cotton handkerchief the gatekeeper showed that delusive desire to oblige that is certain to send its victims in the wrong direction but i had the presence of mind to go exactly contrary to his indication and thanks to this precaution i came after half an hours search on the figure of my poor parocco kneeling on the wet ground in one of the humblest byways of the great necropolis the mound before which he knelt was strewn with the spoils of mr meritons conservatories and on the weatherworn tablet at its head i read the inscription il conte siviano da milano super flumina babylonis illic sedimus et flevimus so engrossed was don egidio that for some moments i stood behind him unobserved and when he rose and faced me grief had left so little room for any minor emotion that he looked at me almost without surprise don egidio i said i have a carriage waiting for you at the gate you must come home with me he nodded quietly and i drew his hand through my arm he turned back to the grave one moment my son he said it may be for the last time he stood motionless his eyes on the heapedup flowers which were already bruised and blackened by the cold to leave him alone after sixty years but god is everywhere he murmured as i led him away on the journey home he did not care to talk and my chief concern was to keep him wrapped in my greatcoat and to see that his bed was made ready as soon as i had restored him to his lodgings the levatrice brought a quilted coverlet from her own room and hovered over him as gently as though he had been of the sex to require her services while agostino at my summons appeared with a bowl of hot soup that was heralded down the street by a reviving waft of garlic to these ministrations i left the parocco intending to call for news of him the next evening but an unexpected pressure of work kept me late at my desk and the following day some fresh obstacle delayed me on the third afternoon as i was leaving the office an agateeyed infant from the point hailed me with a message from the doctor the parocco was worse and had asked for me i jumped into the nearest car and ten minutes later was running up the doctors greasy stairs to my dismay i found don egidios room cold and untenanted but i was reassured a moment later by the appearance of the levatrice who announced that she had transferred the blessed man to her own apartment where he could have the sunlight and a good bed to lie in there in fact he lay weak but smiling in a setting which contrasted oddly enough with his own monastic surroundings a cheerful grimy room hung with anecdotic chromos photographs of ladypatients proudly presenting their offspring to the camera and innumerable neapolitan santolini decked out with shrivelled palmleaves the levatrice whispered that the good man had the pleurisy and that as she phrased it he was nearing his last milestone i saw that he was in fact in a bad way but his condition did not indicate any pressing danger and i had the presentiment that he would still as the saying is put up a good fight it was clear however that he knew what turn the conflict must take and the solemnity with which he welcomed me showed that my summons was a part of that spiritual strategy with which the catholic opposes the surprise of death my son he said when the levatrice had left us i have a favor to ask you you found me yesterday bidding goodbye to my best friend his cough interrupted him i have never told you he went on the name of the family in which i was brought up it was siviano and that was the grave of the counts eldest son with whom i grew up as a brother for eighteen years he has lain in that strange ground in terra aliena and when i die there will be no one to care for his grave i saw what he waited for i will care for it signor parocco i knew i should have your promise my child and what you promise you keep but my friend is a stranger to you you are young and at your age life is a mistress who kisses away sad memories why should you remember the grave of a stranger i cannot lay such a claim on you but i will tell you his story and then i think that neither joy nor grief will let you forget him for when you rejoice you will remember how he sorrowed and when you sorrow the thought of him will be like a friends hand in yours ii you tell me don egidio began that you know our little lake and if you have seen it you will understand why it always used to remind me of the garden enclosed of the canticles hortus inclusus columba mea in foraminibus petrр в рв р вђрв р в рірвўр вђрв р в рв р рр вђљрівђћсћр

hills like a happy secret in a stern heart we were never envious of the glory of the great lakes they are like the show pictures that some nobleman hangs in his public gallery but our iseo is the treasure that he hides in his inner chamber you tell me you saw it in summer when it looks up like a saints eye reflecting the whole of heaven it was then too that i first saw it my future friend the old count had found me at work on one of his fruitfarms up the valley and hearing that i was illtreated by my stepfather a drunken pedlar from the val mastellone whom my poor mother a year or two earlier had come across at the fair of lovere he had taken me home with him to iseo i used to serve mass in our hillvillage of cerveno and the village children called me the little priest because when my work was done i often crept back to the church to get away from my stepfathers blows and curses i will make a real priest of him the count declared and that afternoon perched on the box of his travellingcarriage i was whirled away from the dark scenes of my childhood into a world where as it seemed to me every one was as happy as an angel on a presepio i wonder if you remember the counts villa it lies on the shore of the lake facing the green knoll of monte isola and overlooked by the village of siviano and by the old parishchurch where i said mass for fifteen happy years the village hangs on a ledge of the mountain but the villa dips its foot in the lake smiling at its reflection like a bather lingering on the brink what paradise it seemed to me that day in our church up the valley there hung an old brown picture with a saint sabastian in the foreground and behind him the most wonderful palace with terraced gardens adorned with statues and fountains where fine folk in resplendent dresses walked up and down without heeding the blessed martyrs pangs the counts villa with its terraces its roses its marble steps descending to the lake reminded me of that palace only instead of being inhabited by wicked people engrossed in their selfish pleasures it was the home of the kindest friends that ever took a poor lad by the hand the old count was a widower when i first knew him he had been twice married and his first wife had left him two children a son and a daughter the eldest donna marianna was then a girl of twenty who kept her fathers house and was a mother to the two lads she was not handsome or learned and had no taste for the world but she was like the lavenderplant in a poor mans window just a little gray flower but a sweetness that fills the whole house her brother count roberto had been ailing from his birth and was a studious lad with a melancholy musing face such as you may see in some of titians portraits of young men he looked like an exiled prince dressed in mourning there was one child by the second marriage count andrea a boy of my own age handsome as a saint george but not as kind as the others no doubt being younger he was less able to understand why an uncouth peasant lad should have been brought to his fathers table and the others were so fearful of hurting my feelings that but for his teasing i might never have mended my clumsy manners or learned how to behave in the presence of my betters count andrea was not sparing in such lessons and count roberto in spite of his weak arms chastised his brother roundly when he thought the discipline had been too severe but for my part it seemed to me natural enough that such a godlike being should lord it over a poor clodhopper like myself well i will not linger over the beginning of my new life for my story has to do with its close only i should like to make you understand what the change meant to me an ignorant peasant lad coming from hard words and blows and a smokeblackened hut in the hills to that great house full of rare and beautiful things and of beings who seemed to me even more rare and beautiful do you wonder i was ready to kiss the ground they trod and would have given the last drop of my blood to serve them in due course i was sent to the seminary at lodi and on holidays i used to visit the family in milan count andrea was growing up to be one of the handsomest young men imaginable but a trifle wild and the old count married him in haste to the daughter of a venetian noble who brought as her dower a great estate in istria the countess gemma as this lady was called was as light as thistledown and had an eye like a babys but while she was cooing for the moon her pretty white hands were always stealing toward something within reach that she had not been meant to have the old count was not alert enough to follow these manoeuvres and the countess hid her designs under a torrent of guileless chatter as pickpockets wear long sleeves to conceal their movements her only fault he used to say was that one of her aunts had married an austrian and this event having taken place before she was born he laughingly acquitted her of any direct share in it she confirmed his good opinion of her by giving her husband two sons and roberto showing no inclination to marry these boys naturally came to be looked on as the heirs of the house meanwhile i had finished my course of studies and the old count on my twentyfirst birthday had appointed me priest of the parish of siviano it was the year of count andreas marriage and there were great festivities at the villa three years later the old count died to the sorrow of his two eldest children donna marianna and count roberto closed their apartments in the palace at milan and withdrew for a year to siviano it was then that i first began to know my friend before that i had loved him without understanding him now i learned of what metal he was made his bookish tastes inclined him to a secluded way of living and his younger brother perhaps fancied that he would not care to assume the charge of the estate but if andrea thought this he was disappointed roberto resolutely took up the tradition of his fathers rule and as if conscious of lacking the old counts easy way with the peasants made up for it by a redoubled zeal for their welfare i have seen him toil for days to adjust some trifling difficulty that his father would have set right with a ready word like the sainted bishop who when a beggar asked him for a penny cried out alas my brother i have not a penny in my purse but here are two gold pieces if they can be made to serve you instead we had many conferences over the condition of his people and he often sent me up the valley to look into the needs of the peasantry on the fruitfarms no grievance was too trifling for him to consider it no abuse too deepseated for him to root it out and many an hour that other men of his rank would have given to books or pleasure was devoted to adjusting a quarrel about boundarylines or to weighing the merits of a complaint against the taxcollector i often said that he was as much his peoples priest as i and he smiled and answered that every landowner was a king and that in old days the king was always a priest donna marianna was urgent with him to marry but he always declared that he had a family in his tenantry and that as for a wife she had never let him feel the want of one he had that musing temper which gives a man a name for coldness though in fact he may all the while be storing fuel for a great conflagration but to me he whispered another reason for not marrying a man he said does not take wife and rejoice while his mother is on her deathbed and italy his mother lay dying with the foreign vultures waiting to tear her apart you are too young to know anything of those days my son and how can any one understand them who did not live through them italy lay dying indeed but lombardy was her heart and the heart still beat and sent the faint blood creeping to her cold extremities her torturers weary of their work had allowed her to fall into a painless stupor but just as she was sinking from sleep to death heaven sent radetsky to scourge her back to consciousness and at the first sting of his lash she sprang maimed and bleeding to her feet ah those days those days my son italy italy was the word on our lips but the thought in our hearts was just austria we clamored for liberty unity the franchise but under our breath we prayed only to smite the whitecoats remove the beam from our eye we cried and we shall see our salvation clearly enough we priests in the north were all liberals and worked with the nobles and the men of letters gioberti was our breviary and his holiness the new pope was soon to be the tancred of our crusade but meanwhile mind you all this went on in silence underground as it were while on the surface lombardy still danced feasted married and took office under the austrian in the ironmines up our valley there used to be certain miners who stayed below ground for months at a time and like one of these roberto remained buried in his purpose while life went its way overhead though i was not in his confidence i knew well enough where his thoughts were for he went among us with the eye of a lover the visionary look of one who hears a voice we all heard that voice to be sure mingling faintly with the other noises of life but to roberto it was already as the roar of mighty waters drowning every other sound with its thunder on the surface as i have said things looked smooth enough an austrian cardinal throned in milan and an austrianhearted pope ruled in rome in lombardy austria couched like a beast of prey ready to spring at our throats if we stirred or struggled the moderates to whose party count roberto belonged talked of prudence compromise the education of the masses but if their words were a velvet sheath their thought was a dagger for many years as you know the milanese had maintained an outward show of friendliness with their rulers the nobles had accepted office under the viceroy and in the past there had been frequent intermarriage between the two aristocracies but now one by one the great houses had closed their doors against official society though some of the younger and more careless those who must dance and dine at any cost still went to the palace and sat beside the enemy at the opera fashion was gradually taking sides against them and those who had once been laughed at as old fogeys were now applauded as patriots among these of course was count roberto who for several years had refused to associate with the austrians and had silently resented his easygoing brothers disregard of political distinctions andrea and gemma belonged to the moth tribe who flock to the brightest light and gemmas istrian possessions and her familys connection with the austrian nobility gave them a pretext for fluttering about the viceregal candle roberto let them go their way but his own course was a tacit protest against their conduct they were always welcome at the palazzo siviano but he and donna marianna withdrew from society in order to have an excuse for not showing themselves at the countess gemmas entertainments if andrea and gemma were aware of his disapproval they were clever enough to ignore it for the rich elder brother who paid their debts and never meant to marry was too important a person to be quarrelled with on political grounds they seemed to think that if he married it would be only to spite them and they were persuaded that their future depended on their giving him no cause to take such reprisals i shall never be more than a plain peasant at heart and i have little natural skill in discerning hidden motives but the experience of the confessional gives every priest a certain insight into the secret springs of action and i often wondered that the worldly wisdom of andrea and gemma did not help them to a clearer reading of their brothers character for my part i knew that in robertos heart no great passion could spring from a mean motive and i had always thought that if he ever loved any woman as he loved italy it must be from his countrys hand that he received his bride and so it came about have you ever noticed on one of those still autumn days before a storm how here and there a yellow leaf will suddenly detach itself from the bough and whirl through the air as though some warning of the gale had reached it so it was then in lombardy all round was the silence of decay but now and then a word a look a trivial incident fluttered ominously through the stillness it was in only a year earlier the glorious death of the bandiera brothers had sent a long shudder through italy in the romagna renzi and his comrades had tried to uphold by action the protest set forth in the manifesto of rimini and their failure had sowed the seed which dazeglio and cavour were to harvest everywhere the forces were silently gathering and nowhere was the hush more profound the least reverberation more audible than in the streets of milan it was count robertos habit to attend early mass in the cathedral and one morning as he was standing in the aisle a young girl passed him with her father roberto knew the father a beggarly milanese of the noble family of intelvi who had cut himself off from his class by accepting an appointment in one of the government offices as the two went by he saw a group of austrian officers looking after the girl and heard one of them say such a choice morsel as that is too good for slaves and another answer with a laugh yes its a dish for the masters table the girl heard too she was as white as a windflower and he saw the words come out on her cheek like the red mark from a blow she whispered to her father but he shook his head and drew her away without so much as a glance at the austrians roberto heard mass and then hastened out and placed himself in the porch of the cathedral a moment later the officers appeared and they too stationed themselves near the doorway presently the girl came out on her fathers arm her admirers stepped forward to greet intelvi and the cringing wretch stood there exchanging compliments with them while their insolent stare devoured his daughters beauty she poor thing shook like a leaf and her eyes in avoiding theirs suddenly encountered robertos her look was a wounded bird that flew to him for shelter he carried it away in his breast and its live warmth beat against his heart he thought that italy had looked at him through those eyes for love is the wiliest of masqueraders and has a thousand disguises at his command within a month faustina intelvi was his wife donna marianna and i rejoiced for we knew he had chosen her because he loved her and she seemed to us almost worthy of such a choice as for count andrea and his wife i leave you to guess what ingredients were mingled in the kiss with which they welcomed the bride they were all smiles at robertos marriage and had only words of praise for his wife donna marianna who had sometimes taxed me with suspecting their motives rejoiced in this fresh proof of their magnanimity but for my part i could have wished to see them a little less kind all such twilight fears however vanished in the flush of my friends happiness over some natures love steals gradually as the morning light widens across a valley but it had flashed on roberto like the leap of dawn to a snowpeak he walked the world with the wondering step of a blind man suddenly restored to sight and once he said to me with a laugh love makes a columbus of every one of us and the countess the countess my son was eighteen and her husband was forty count roberto had the heart of a poet but he walked with a limp and his skin was sallow youth plucks the fruit for its color rather than its flavor and first love does not serenade its mistress on a churchorgan in italy girls are married as land is sold if two estates adjoin two lives are united as for the portionless girl she is a knickknack that goes to the highest bidder faustina was handed over to her purchaser as if she had been a picture for his gallery and the transaction doubtless seemed as natural to her as to her parents she walked to the altar like an iphigenia but pallor becomes a bride and it looks well for a daughter to weep on leaving her mother perhaps it would have been different if she had guessed that the threshold of her new home was carpeted with love and its four corners hung with tender thoughts of her but her husband was a silent man who never called attention to his treasures the great palace in milan was a gloomy house for a girl to enter roberto and his sister lived in it as if it had been a monastery going nowhere and receiving only those who labored for the cause to faustina accustomed to the easy austrian society the sunday evening receptions at the palazzo siviano must have seemed as dreary as a scientific congress it pleased roberto to regard her as a victim of barbarian insolence an embodiment of his country desecrated by the desire of the enemy but though like any handsome penniless girl faustina had now and then been exposed to a free look or a familiar word i doubt if she connected such incidents with the political condition of italy she knew of course that in marrying siviano she was entering a house closed against the austrian one of sivianos first cares had been to pension his fatherinlaw with the stipulation that intelvi should resign his appointment and give up all relations with the government and the old hypocrite only too glad to purchase idleness on such terms embraced the liberal cause with a zeal which left his daughter no excuse for halfheartedness but he found it less easy than he had expected to recover a footing among his own people in spite of his patriotic bluster the milanese held aloof from him and being the kind of man who must always take his glass in company he gradually drifted back to his old associates it was impossible to forbid faustina to visit her parents and in their house she breathed an air that was at least tolerant of austria but i must not let you think that the young countess appeared ungrateful or unhappy she was silent and shy and it needed a more enterprising temper than robertos to break down the barrier between them they seemed to talk to one another through a conventgrating rather than across a hearth but if roberto had asked more of her than she could give outwardly she was a model wife she chose me at once as her confessor and i watched over the first steps of her new life never was younger sister tenderer to her elder than she to donna marianna never was young wife more mindful of her religious duties kinder to her dependents more charitable to the poor yet to be with her was like living in a room with shuttered windows she was always the caged bird the transplanted flower for all robertos care she never bloomed or sang donna marianna was the first to speak of it the child needs more light and air she said light air roberto repeated does she not go to mass every morning does she not drive on the corso every evening donna marianna was not called clever but her heart was wiser than most womens heads at our age brother said she the windows of the mind face north and look out on a landscape full of lengthening shadows faustina needs another outlook she is as pale as a hyacinth grown in a cellar roberto himself turned pale and i saw that she had uttered his own thought you want me to let her go to gemmas he exclaimed let her go wherever there is a little careless laughter laughter now he cried with a gesture toward the sombre line of portraits above his head let her laugh while she can my brother that evening after dinner he called faustina to him my child he said go and put on your jewels your sister gemma gives a ball tonight and the carriage waits to take you there i am too much of a recluse to be at ease in such scenes but i have sent word to your father to go with you andrea and gemma welcomed their young sisterinlaw with effusion and from that time she was often in their company gemma forbade any mention of politics in her drawingroom and it was natural that faustina should be glad to escape from the solemn conclaves of the palazzo siviano to a house where life went as gaily as in that villa above florence where boccaccios careless storytellers took refuge from the plague but meanwhile the political distemper was rapidly spreading and in spite of gemmas austrian affiliations it was no longer possible for her to receive the enemy openly it was whispered that her door was still ajar to her old friends but the rumor may have risen from the fact that one of the austrian cavalry officers stationed at milan was her own cousin the son of the aunt on whose misalliance the old count had so often bantered her no one could blame the countess gemma for not turning her own flesh and blood out of doors and the social famine to which the officers of the garrison were reduced made it natural that young welkenstern should press the claims of consanguinity all this must have reached robertos ears but he made no sign and his wife came and went as she pleased when they returned the following year to the old dusky villa at siviano she was like the voice of a brook in a twilight wood one could not look at her without ransacking the spring for new similes to paint her freshness with roberto it was different i found him older more preoccupied and silent but i guessed that his preoccupations were political for when his eye rested on his wife it cleared like the lake when a cloudshadow lifts from it count andrea and his wife occupied an adjoining villa and during the villeggiatura the two households lived almost as one family roberto however was often absent in milan called thither on business of which the nature was not hard to guess sometimes he brought back guests to the villa and on these occasions faustina and donna marianna went to count andreas for the day i have said that i was not in his confidence but he knew my sympathies were with the liberals and now and then he let fall a word of the work going on underground meanwhile the new pope had been elected and from piedmont to calabria we hailed in him the banner that was to lead our hosts to war so time passed and we reached the last months of the villa on iseo had been closed since the end of august roberto had no great liking for his gloomy palace in milan and it had been his habit to spend nine months of the year at siviano but he was now too much engrossed in his work to remain away from milan and his wife and sister had joined him there as soon as the midsummer heat was over during the autumn he had called me once or twice to the city to consult me on business connected with his fruitfarms and in the course of our talks he had sometimes let fall a hint of graver matters it was in july of that year that a troop of croats had marched into ferrara with muskets and cannon loaded the lighted matches of their cannon had fired the sleeping hate of austria and the whole country now echoed the lombard cry out with the barbarian all talk of adjustment compromise reorganization shrivelled on lips that the live coal of patriotism had touched italy for the italians and then monarchy federation republic it mattered not what the oppressors grip had tightened on our throats and the clearsighted saw well enough that metternichs policy was to provoke a rebellion and then crush it under the croat heel but it was too late to cry prudence in lombardy with the first days of the new year the tobacco riots had drawn blood in milan soon afterward the lions club was closed and edicts were issued forbidding the singing of pio nonos hymn the wearing of white and blue the collecting of subscriptions for the victims of the riots to each prohibition milan returned a fresh defiance the ladies of the nobility put on mourning for the rioters who had been shot down by the soldiery half the members of the guardia nobile resigned and count borromeo sent back his golden fleece to the emperor fresh regiments were continually pouring into milan and it was no secret that radetsky was strengthening the fortifications late in january several leading liberals were arrested and sent into exile and two weeks later martial law was proclaimed in milan at the first arrests several members of the liberal party had hastily left milan and i was not surprised to hear a few days later that orders had been given to reopen the villa at siviano the count and countess arrived there early in february it was seven months since i had seen the countess and i was struck with the change in her appearance she was paler than ever and her step had lost its lightness yet she did not seem to share her husbands political anxieties one would have said that she was hardly aware of them she seemed wrapped in a veil of lassitude like iseo on a still gray morning when dawn is bloodred on the mountains but a mist blurs its reflection in the lake i felt as though her soul were slipping away from me and longed to win her back to my care but she made her illhealth a pretext for not coming to confession and for the present i could only wait and carry the thought of her to the altar she had not been long at siviano before i discovered that this drooping mood was only one phase of her humor now and then she flung back the cowl of melancholy and laughed life in the eye but next moment she was in shadow again and her muffled thoughts had given us the slip she was like the lake on one of those days when the wind blows twenty ways and every promontory holds a gust in ambush meanwhile there was a continual coming and going of messengers between siviano and the city they came mostly at night when the household slept and were away again with the last shadows but the news they brought stayed and widened shining through every cranny of the old house the whole of lombardy was up from pavia to mantua from como to brescia the streets ran blood like the arteries of one great body at pavia and padua the universities were closed the frightened viceroy was preparing to withdraw from milan to verona and radetsky continued to pour his men across the alps till a hundred thousand were massed between the piave and the ticino and now every eye was turned to turin ah how we watched for the blue banner of piedmont on the mountains charles albert was pledged to our cause his whole people had armed to rescue us the streets echoed with avanti savoia and yet savoy was silent and hung back each day was a lifetime strained to the crackingpoint with hopes and disappointments we reckoned the hours by rumors the very minutes by hearsay then suddenly ah it was worth living through word came to us that vienna was in revolt the points of the compass had shifted and our sun had risen in the north i shall never forget that day at the villa roberto sent for me early and i found him smiling and resolute as becomes a soldier on the eve of action he had made all his preparations to leave for milan and was awaiting a summons from his party the whole household felt that great events impended and donna marianna awed and tearful had pleaded with her brother that they should all receive the sacrament together the next morning roberto and his sister had been to confession the previous day but the countess faustina had again excused herself i did not see her while i was with the count but as i left the house she met me in the laurelwalk the morning was damp and cold and she had drawn a black scarf over her hair and walked with a listless dragging step but at my approach she lifted her head quickly and signed to me to follow her into one of the recesses of clipped laurel that bordered the path don egidio she said you have heard the news i assented the count goes to milan tomorrow it seems probable your excellency there will be fighting we are on the eve of war i mean we are in gods hands your excellency in gods hands she murmured her eyes wandered and for a moment we stood silent then she drew a purse from her pocket i was forgetting she exclaimed this is for that poor girl you spoke to me about the other day what was her name the girl who met the austrian soldier at the fair at peschiera ah vannina i said but she is dead your excellency dead she turned white and the purse dropped from her hand i picked it up and held it out to her but she put back my hand that is for masses then she said and with that she moved away toward the house i walked on to the gate but before i had reached it i heard her step behind me don egidio she called and i turned back you are coming to say mass in the chapel tomorrow morning that is the counts wish she wavered a moment i am not well enough to walk up to the village this afternoon she said at length will you come back later and hear my confession here willingly your excellency come at sunset then she looked at me gravely it is a long time since i have been to confession she added my child the door of heaven is always unlatched she made no answer and i went my way i returned to the villa a little before sunset hoping for a few words with roberto i felt with faustina that we were on the eve of war and the uncertainty of the outlook made me treasure every moment of my friends company i knew he had been busy all day but hoped to find that his preparations were ended and that he could spare me a half hour i was not disappointed for the servant who met me asked me to follow him to the counts apartment roberto was sitting alone with his back to the door at a table spread with maps and papers he stood up and turned an ashen face on me roberto i cried as if we had been boys together he signed to me to be seated egidio he said suddenly my wife has sent for you to confess her the countess met me on my way home this morning and expressed a wish to receive the sacrament tomorrow morning with you and donna marianna and i promised to return this afternoon to hear her confession roberto sat silent staring before him as though he hardly heard at length he raised his head and began to speak you have noticed lately that my wife has been ailing he asked every one must have seen that the countess is not in her usual health she has seemed nervous out of spirits i have fancied that she might be anxious about your excellency he leaned across the table and laid his wasted hand on mine call me roberto he said there was another pause before he went on since i saw you this morning he said slowly something horrible has happened after you left i sent for andrea and gemma to tell them the news from vienna and the probability of my being summoned to milan before night you know as well as i that we have reached a crisis there will be fighting within twentyfour hours if i know my people and war may follow sooner than we think i felt it my duty to leave my affairs in andreas hands and to entrust my wife to his care dont look startled he added with a faint smile no reasonable man goes on a journey without setting his house in order and if things take the turn i expect it may be some months before you see me back at siviano but it was not to hear this that i sent for you he pushed his chair aside and walked up and down the room with his short limping step my god he broke out wildly how can i say it when andrea had heard me i saw him exchange a glance with his wife and she said with that infernal sweet voice of hers yes andrea it is our duty your duty i asked what is your duty andrea wetted his lips with his tongue and looked at her again and her look was like a blade in his hand your wife has a lover he said she caught my arm as i flung myself on him he is ten times stronger than i but you remember how i made him howl for mercy in the old days when he used to bully you let me go i said to his wife he must live to unsay it andrea began to whimper oh my poor brother i would give my hearts blood to unsay it the secret has been killing us she chimed in the secret whose secret how dare you gemma fell on her knees like a tragedy actress strike me kill me it is i who am the offender it was at my house that she met him him franz welkenstern my cousin she wailed i suppose i stood before them like a stunned ox for they repeated the name again and again as if they were not sure of my having heard it not hear it he cried suddenly dropping into a chair and hiding his face in his hands shall i ever on earth hear anything else again he sat a long time with his face hidden and i waited my head was like a great bronze bell with one thought for the clapper after a while he went on in a low deliberate voice as though his words were balancing themselves on the brink of madness with strange composure he repeated each detail of his brothers charges the meetings in the countess gemmas drawingroom the innocent friendliness of the two young people the talk of mysterious visits to a villa outside the porta ticinese the everwidening circle of scandal that had spread about their names at first andrea said he and his wife had refused to listen to the reports which reached them then when the talk became too loud they had sent for welkenstern remonstrated with him implored him to exchange into another regiment but in vain the young officer indignantly denied the reports and declared that to leave his post at such a moment would be desertion with a laborious accuracy roberto went on detailing one by one each incident of the hateful story till suddenly he cried out springing from his chair and now to leave her with this lie unburied his cry was like the lifting of a gravestone from my breast you must not leave her i exclaimed he shook his head i am pledged this is your first duty it would be any other mans not an italians i was silent in those days the argument seemed unanswerable at length i said no harm can come to her while you are away donna marianna and i are here to watch over her and when you come back he looked at me gravely if i come back roberto we are men egidio we both know what is coming milan is up already and there is a rumor that charles albert is moving this year the spring rains will be red in italy in your absence not a breath shall touch her and if i never come back to defend her they hate her as hell hates egidio they kept repeating he is of her own age and youth draws youth she is in their way egidio consider my son they do not love her perhaps but why should they hate her at such cost she has given you no child no child he paused but what if she has ailed lately he cried and broke off to grapple with the stabbing thought roberto roberto i adjured him he jumped up and gripped my arm egidio you believe in her shes as pure as a lily on the altar those eyes are wells of truth and she has been like a daughter to marianna egidio do i look like an old man quiet yourself roberto i entreated quiet myself with this sting in my blood a lover and an austrian lover oh italy italy my bride i stake my life on her truth i cried and who knows better than i has her soul not lain before me like the bed of a clear stream and if what you saw there was only the reflection of your faith in her my son i am a priest and the priest penetrates to the soul as the angel passed through the walls of peters prison i see the truth in her heart as i see christ in the host no no she is false he cried i sprang up terrified roberto be silent he looked at me with a wild incredulous smile poor simple man of god he said i would not exchange my simplicity for yours the dupe of envys first malicious whisper envy you think that is it questionable you would stake your life on it my life your faith my faith your vows as a priest my vows i stopped and stared at him he had risen and laid his hand on my shoulder you see now what i would be at he said quietly i must take your place presently my place when my wife comes down you understand me ah now you are quite mad i cried breaking away from him am i he returned maintaining his strange composure consider a moment she has not confessed to you before since our return from milan her illhealth he cut me short with a gesture yet today she sends for you in order that she may receive the sacrament with you on the eve of your first separation if that is her only reason her first words will clear her i must hear those words egidio you are quite mad i repeated strange he said slowly you stake your life on my wifes innocence yet you refuse me the only means of vindicating it i would give my life for any one of you but what you ask is not mine to give the priest first the man afterward he sneered long afterward he measured me with a contemptuous eye we laymen are ready to give the last shred of flesh from our bones but you priests intend to keep your cassocks whole i tell you my cassock is not mine i repeated and by god he cried you are right for its mine who put it on your back but my father what kept it there but my charity peasant beggar hear his holiness pontificate yes i said i was a peasant and a beggar when your father found me and if he had left me one i might have been excused for putting my hand to any ugly job that my betters required of me but he made me a priest and so set me above all of you and laid on me the charge of your souls as well as mine he sat down shaken with dreadful tears ah he broke out would you have answered me thus when we were boys together and i stood between you and andrea if god had given me the strength you call it strength to make a womans soul your steppingstone to heaven her soul is in my care not yours my son she is safe with me she but i i go out to meet death and leave a worse death behind me he leaned over and clutched my arm it is not for myself i plead but for her for her egidio dont you see to what a hell you condemn her if i dont come back what chance has she against that slow unsleeping hate their lies will fasten themselves to her and suck out her life you and marianna are powerless against such enemies you leave her in gods hands my son easily said but ah priest if you were a man what if their poison works in me and i go to battle thinking that every austrian bullet may be sent by her lovers hand what if i die not only to free italy but to free my wife as well i laid my hand on his shoulder my son i answer for her leave your faith in her in my hands and i will keep it whole he stared at me strangely and what if your own fail you in her never i call every saint to witness and yet and yet ah this is a blind he shouted you know all and perjure yourself to spare me at that my son i felt a knife in my breast i looked at him in anguish and his gaze was a wall of metal mine seemed to slip away from it like a clawless thing struggling up the sheer side of a precipice you know all he repeated and you dare not let me hear her i dare not betray my trust he waved the answer aside is this a time to quibble over church discipline if you believed in her you would save her at any cost i said to myself eternity can hold nothing worse than this for me and clutched my resolve again like a cross to my bosom just then there was a hand on the door and we heard donna marianna faustina has sent to know if the signar parocco is here he is here bid her come down to the chapel roberta spoke quietly and closed the door on her so that she should not see his face we heard her patter away across the brick floor of the salone roberto turned to me egidio he said and all at once i was no more than a straw on the torrent of his will the chapel adjoined the room in which we sat he opened the door and in the twilight i saw the light glimmering before the virgins shrine and the old carved confessional standing like a cowled watcher in its corner but i saw it all in a dream for nothing in heaven or earth was real to me but the iron grip on my shoulder quick he said and drove me forward i heard him shoot back the bolt of the outer door and a moment later i stood alone in the garden the sun had set and the cold spring dusk was falling lights shone here and there in the long front of the villa the statues glimmered gray among the thickets through the windowpane of the chapel i caught the faint red gleam of the virgins lamp but i turned my back on it and walked away all night i lay like a heretic on the fire before dawn there came a call from the villa the count had received a second summons from milan and was to set out in an hour i hurried down the cold dewy path to the lake all was new and hushed and strange as on the day of resurrection and in the dark twilight of the garden alleys the statues stared at me like the shrouded dead in the salone where the old counts portrait hung i found the family assembled andrea and gemma sat together a little pinched i thought but decent and selfcontained like mourners who expect to inherit donna marianna drooped near them with something black over her head and her face dim with weeping roberto received me calmly and then turned to his sister go fetch my wife he said while she was gone there was silence we could hear the cold drip of the gardenfountain and the patter of rats in the wall andrea and his wife stared out of window and roberto sat in his fathers carved seat at the head of the long table then the door opened and faustina entered when i saw her i stopped breathing she seemed no more than the shell of herself a hollow thing that grief has voided her eyes returned our images like polished agate but conveyed to her no sense of our presence marianna led her to a seat and she crossed her hands and nailed her dull gaze on roberto i looked from one to another and in that spectral light it seemed to me that we were all souls come to judgment and naked to each other as to god as to my own wrongdoing it weighed on me no more than dust the only feeling i had room for was fear a fear that seemed to fill my throat and lungs and bubble coldly over my drowning head suddenly roberto began to speak his voice was clear and steady and i clutched at his words to drag myself above the surface of my terror he touched on the charge that had been made against his wife he did not say by whom the foul rumor that had made itself heard on the eve of their first parting duty he said had sent him a double summons to fight for his country and for his wife he must clear his wifes name before he was worthy to draw sword for italy there was no time to tame the slander before throttling it he had to take the shortest way to its throat at this point he looked at me and my soul shook then he turned to andrea and gemma when you came to me with this rumor he said quietly you agreed to consider the family honor satisfied if i could induce don egidio to let me take his place and overhear my wifes confession and if that confession convinced me of her innocence was this the understanding andrea muttered something and gemma tapped a sullen foot after you had left roberto continued i laid the case before don egidio and threw myself on his mercy he looked at me fixedly so strong was his faith in my wifes innocence that for her sake he agreed to violate the sanctity of the confessional i took his place marianna sobbed and crossed herself and a strange look flitted over faustinas face there was a moments pause then roberto rising walked across the room to his wife and took her by the hand your seat is beside me countess siviano he said and led her to the empty chair by his own gemma started to her feet but her husband pulled her down again jesus mary we heard donna marianna moan roberto raised his wifes hand to his lips you forgive me he said the means i took to defend you and turning to andrea he added slowly i declare my wife innocent and my honor satisfied you swear to stand by my decision what andrea stammered out what hissing serpents of speech gemmas clinched teeth bit back i never knew for my eyes were on faustina and her face was a wonder to behold she had let herself be led across the room like a blind woman and had listened without change of feature to her husbands first words but as he ceased her frozen gaze broke and her whole body seemed to melt against his breast he put his arm out but she slipped to his feet and marianna hastened forward to raise her up at that moment we heard the stroke of oars across the quiet water and saw the counts boat touch the landingsteps four strong oarsmen from monte isola were to row him down to iseo to take horse for milan and his servant knapsack on shoulder knocked warningly at the terrace window no time to lose excellency he cried roberto turned and gripped my hand pray for me he said low and with a brief gesture to the others ran down the terrace to the boat marianna was bathing faustina with happy tears look up dear think how soon he will come back and there is the sunrise see andrea and gemma had slunk away like ghosts at cockcrow and a red dawn stood over milan if that sun rose red it set scarlet it was the first of the five days in milan the five glorious days as they are called roberto reached the city just before the gates closed so much we knew little more we heard of him in the broletto whence he must have escaped when the austrians blew in the door and in the casa vidiserti with casati cattaneo and the rest but after the barricading began we could trace him only as having been seen here and there in the thick of the fighting or tending the wounded under bertanis orders his place one would have said was in the councilchamber with the soberer heads but that was an hour when every man gave his blood where it was most needed and cernuschi dandolo anfossi della porta fought shoulder to shoulder with students artisans and peasants certain it is that he was seen on the fifth day for among the volunteers who swarmed after manara in his assault on the porta tosa was a servant of palazzo siviano and this fellow swore he had seen his master charge with manara in the last assault had watched him sword in hand press close to the gates and then as they swung open before the victorious dash of our men had seen him drop and disappear in the inrushing tide of peasants that almost swept the little company off its feet after that we heard nothing there was savage work in milan in those days and more than one wellknown figure lay lost among the heaps of dead hacked and disfeatured by croat blades at the villa we waited breathless news came to us hour by hour the very wind seemed to carry it and it was swept to us on the incessant rush of the rain on the twentythird radetsky had fled from milan to face venice rising in his path on the twentyfourth the first piedmontese had crossed the ticino and charles albert himself was in pavia on the twentyninth the bells of milan had carried the word from turin to naples from genoa to ancona and the whole country was pouring like a floodtide into lombardy heroes sprang up from the bloody soil as thick as wheat after rain and every day carried some new name to us but never the one for which we prayed and waited weeks passed we heard of pastrengo goito rivoli of radetsky hemmed into the quadrilateral and our troops closing in on him from rome tuscany and venetia months passed and we heard of custozza we saw charles alberts broken forces flung back from the mincio to the oglio from the oglio to the adda we followed the dreadful retreat from milan and saw our rescuers dispersed like dust before the wind but all the while no word came to us of roberto these were dark days in lombardy and nowhere darker than in the old villa on iseo in september donna marianna and the young countess put on black and count andrea and his wife followed their example in october the countess gave birth to a daughter count andrea then took possession of the palazzo siviano and the two women remained at the villa i have no heart to tell you of the days that followed donna marianna wept and prayed incessantly and it was long before the baby could snatch a smile from her as for the countess faustina she went among us like one of the statues in the garden the child had a wetnurse from the village and it was small wonder there was no milk for it in that marble breast i spent much of my time at the villa comforting donna marianna as best i could but sometimes in the long winter evenings when we three sat in the dimlylit salone with the old counts portrait overhead and i looked up and saw the countess faustina in the tall carved seat beside her husbands empty chair my spine grew chill and i felt a cold wind in my hair the end of it was that in the spring i went to see my bishop and laid my sin before him he was a saintly and merciful old man and gave me a patient hearing you believed the lady innocent he asked when i had ended monsignore on my soul you thought to avert a great calamity from the house to which you owed more than your life it was my only thought he laid his hand on my shoulder go home my son you shall learn my decision three months later i was ordered to resign my living and go to america where a priest was needed for the italian mission church in new york i packed my possessions and set sail from genoa i knew no more of america than any peasant up in the hills i fully expected to be speared by naked savages on landing and for the first few months after my arrival i wished at least once a day that such a blessed fate had befallen me but it is no part of my story to tell you what i suffered in those early days the church had dealt with me mercifully as is her wont and her punishment fell far below my deserts i had been some four years in new york and no longer thought of looking back from the plough when one day word was brought me that an italian professor lay ill and had asked for a priest there were many italian refugees in new york at that time and the greater number being welleducated men earned a living by teaching their language which was then included among the accomplishments of fashionable new york the messenger led me to a poor boardinghouse and up to a small bare room on the top floor on the visitingcard nailed to the door i read the name de roberti professor of italian inside a grayhaired haggard man tossed on the narrow bed he turned a glazed eye on me as i entered and i recognized roberto siviano i steadied myself against the doorpost and stood staring at him without a word whats the matter asked the doctor who was bending over the bed i stammered that the sick man was an old friend he wouldnt know his oldest friend just now said the doctor the fevers on him but it will go down toward sunset i sat down at the head of the bed and took robertos hand in mine is he going to die i asked i dont believe so but he wants nursing i will nurse him the doctor nodded and went out i sat in the little room with robertos burning hand in mine gradually his skin cooled the fingers grew quiet and the flush faded from his sallow cheekbones toward dusk he looked up at me and smiled egidio he said quietly i administered the sacrament which he received with the most fervent devotion then he fell into a deep sleep during the weeks that followed i had no time to ask myself the meaning of it all my one business was to keep him alive if i could i fought the fever day and night and at length it yielded for the most part he raved or lay unconscious but now and then he knew me for a moment and whispered egidio with a look of peace i had stolen many hours from my duties to nurse him and as soon as the danger was past i had to go back to my parish work then it was that i began to ask myself what had brought him to america but i dared not face the answer on the fourth day i snatched a moment from my work and climbed to his room i found him sitting propped against his pillows weak as a child but cleareyed and quiet i ran forward but his look stopped me signor parocco he said the doctor tells me that i owe my life to your nursing and i have to thank you for the kindness you have shown to a friendless stranger a stranger i gasped he looked at me steadily i am not aware that we have met before he said for a moment i thought the fever was on him but a second glance convinced me that he was master of himself roberto i cried trembling you have the advantage of me he said civilly but my name is roberti not roberto the floor swam under me and i had to lean against the wall you are not count roberto siviano of milan i am tommaso de roberti professor of italian from modena and you have never seen me before never that i know of were you never at siviano on the lake of iseo i faltered he said calmly i am unacquainted with that part of italy my heart grew cold and i was silent you mistook me for a friend i suppose he added yes i cried i mistook you for a friend and with that i fell on my knees by his bed and cried like a child suddenly i felt a touch on my shoulder egidio said he in a broken voice look up i raised my eyes and there was his old smile above me and we clung to each other without a word presently however he drew back and put me quietly aside sit over there egidio my bones are like water and i am not good for much talking yet let us wait roberto sleep now we can talk tomorrow no what i have to say must be said at once he examined me thoughtfully you have a parish here in new york i assented and my work keeps me here i have pupils it is too late to make a change a change he continued to look at me calmly it would be difficult for me he explained to find employment in a new place but why should you leave here i shall have to he returned deliberately if you persist in recognizing in me your former friend count siviano roberto he lifted his hand egidio he said i am alone here and without friends the companionship the sympathy of my parish priest would be a consolation in this strange city but it must not be the companionship of the parocco of siviano you understand roberto i cried it is too dreadful to understand be a man egidio said he with a touch of impatience the choice lies with you and you must make it now if you are willing to ask no questions to name no names to make no allusions to the past let us live as friends together in gods name if not as soon as my legs can carry me i must be off again the world is wide luckily but why should we be parted i was on my knees at his side in an instant we must never be parted i cried do as you will with me give me your orders and i obey have i not always obeyed you i felt his hand close sharply on mine egidio he admonished me no no i shall remember i shall say nothing think nothing think nothing i said with a last effort god bless you he answered my son for eight years i kept my word to him we met daily almost we ate and walked and talked together we lived like david and jonathan but without so much as a glance at the past how he had escaped from milan how he had reached new york i never knew we talked often of italys liberation as what italians would not but never touched on his share in the work once only a word slipped from him and that was when one day he asked me how it was that i had been sent to america the blood rushed to my face and before i could answer he had raised a silencing hand i see he said it was your penance too during the first years he had plenty of work to do but he lived so frugally that i guessed he had some secret use for his earnings it was easy to conjecture what it was all over the world italian exiles were toiling and saving to further the great cause he had political friends in new york and sometimes he went to other cities to attend meetings and make addresses his zeal never slackened and but for me he would often have gone hungry that some shivering patriot might dine i was with him heart and soul but i had the parish on my shoulders and perhaps my long experience of men had made me a little less credulous than christian charity requires for i could have sworn that some of the heroes who hung on him had never had a whiff of austrian blood and would have fed out of the same trough with the whitecoats if there had been polenta enough to go round happily my friend had no such doubts he believed in the patriots as devoutly as in the cause and if some of his hardearned dollars travelled no farther than the nearest winecellar or cigarshop he never suspected the course they took his health was never the same after the fever and by and by he began to lose his pupils and the patriots cooled off as his pockets fell in toward the end i took him to live in my shabby attic he had grown weak and had a troublesome cough and he spent the greater part of his days indoors cruel days they must have been to him but he made no sign and always welcomed me with a cheerful word when his pupils dropped off and his health made it difficult for him to pick up work outside he set up a letterwriters sign and used to earn a few pennies by serving as amanuensis to my poor parishioners but it went against him to take their money and half the time he did the work for nothing i knew it was hard for him to live on charity as he called it and i used to find what jobs i could for him among my friends the negozianti who would send him letters to copy accounts to make up and what not but we were all poor together and the master had licked the platter before the dog got it so lived that just man my son and so after eight years of exile he died one day in my arms god had let him live long enough to see solferino and villafranca and was perhaps never more merciful than in sparing him monte rotondo and mentana but these are things of which it does not become me to speak the new italy does not wear the face of our visions but it is written that god shall know his own and it cannot be that he shall misread the hearts of those who dreamed of fashioning her in his image as for my friend he is at peace i doubt not and his just life and holy death intercede for me who sinned for his sake alone
