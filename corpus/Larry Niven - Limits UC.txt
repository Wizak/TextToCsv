 half my output used to be short stories its common knowledge in this field that the money is in novels but its also true that stories come in their own length stretching an idea beyond its length is even worse than overcompressing it ordinarily i would have continued to write short stories what happened was i hit a bump in my career a novice writer shouid try anything not just to pay the rent but because he needs practice versatility skills later he must learn to turn down bad offers the first bump the second bump comes when he learns to turn down good offers im a slow learner i learned to say no but that was only a couple of years ago show me a contract and i flinch but iii committed myself years ago it gets signed and then the book must be written footfall being written with jerry pournelle is a year and a half overdue and finished but everything else is backed up behind it i didnt know whether the integral trees and the smoke ring would be one book or two it was conceived as siamese twins its two and the smoke ring is awaiting footfall so are a childrens book to be written with jerry pournelle and wendy all and the legacy of heoro with jerry and steven barnes a collection of the warlock stories needed rewriting to remove redundancies ive been rewriting speeches into articles for the philcon where would i find time to write short stories but i did in fred saberhagen wrote me with a strange proposal how would i like to write a berserker story the idea fred will ask half a dozen friends to write tales of humanberserker encounters fred will shuffle them into the order he likes and write a beginning and an ending to turn it all into a novel sure i wanted to write a berserker story i didnt have to do any research it was all in my head ive been reading them long enough i wrote a teardrop falls and sent copies to fred and to omni which bought it for an indecently large sum considering that i hadnt even built my own background ive since seen other berserker pastiches in the magazines and i await the novel with some eagerness there was to be a new magazine on the stands a meld of fact and fiction aimed at the general reading public its name cosmos its editor diana king diana commissioned a story for that magazine from me and jerry pournelle topic probably asteroid mining tone space advocacy and light what wed really like to be writing i said is to bring home the steel by don kingsbury only its already done call it a character flaw i have to be inspired jerry and i gathered one evening to plot the story i didnt get going until we realized who it was that scared jackie halfie into leaving earth what happened cosmos became omni diana king resigned and was replaced by ben bova ben rejected spirals because it was too long the story ultimately appeared in jim baens destinies collaborations are hard work the only valid excuse for collaborating is this there is a story you would like to write and you dont have the skills youd need to write it alone exceptions sure jerry and i wrote spirals together because it was more fun that way and there is a classic exception a way of collaborating that holds no risks at all heres how it works youve got a story in your trunk somewhere in there is a terrific story idea but it never jelled you broke your heart over it when you didnt yet have the skills and now you cant throw it away and you cant bear to look at the damn thing either then you meet a writer who seems to have the skills you would have needed hand him the manuscript can you do anything with this look youve already done your share of the work and its earned you nothing hes done no work at all if he says no youve lost nothing hes lost nothing if he says yes its his risk maybe you can get reinspired it was that way with the locusts id only recently met steven barnes the direction he was taking he would soon become the best of the new wave writers well i couldnt have that i handed him the locusts and he made it work ultimately i watched that story lose him his first hugo award weve since written two novels together at the phoenix world science fiction convention in i told james baen that i had run out of anything to say about the warlocks era jim made me a proposal well invite some good people to write stories set in the warlocks world you be editor ill do all the work you take all the credit i dont think either of us believed it would work out that way and it didnt i also had my doubts as to whether one writer would want to work in anothers universe but we tried it i hoped wistfully that reading stories set in my own universe might reinspire me it did dian girard is an old friend and writing talisman with her was a delightful experience i wrote the lion in his attic on my own by moving my favorite restaurant and restauranteur years into the past both stories have appeared in more magic three years overdue the roentgen standard was party conversation among some of the crazier members of the los angeles science fantasy society most of what i did that night was listen when omni bought the article i earmarked half the money as a lasfs contribution the lasfs turned the money over to the viking fund lest mankind sever communications with mars beginning around harlan ellison enlisted a team to build a solar system and to write stories within it the project was to become a book harlans world medea when the book appears harlan will assuredly tell the tale of medeas creation in detail and so i need not but my patience is legendaryread half imaginaryand i dont write stories to be read only by an editor flare time must be ten years old by now i managed to get harlans reluctant permission to publish flare time in a british anthology andromeda and some years later in amazing stories i took the right to publish it here i like bars gavagans bar jorkens and the billiards club the white hart callahans saloon i like the ambience the decor the funny chemicals i wanted one for my own i wanted a vehicle for dealing with philosophical questions i wanted to write vignettes how else would i find time to write anything but novels i found it all in the draco tavern the chirpsithra in particular claim to own the galaxy and to have been civilized for billions of years it may be so if confronted with any easily described sufficiently universal philosophical question the chirps may certainly claim to have solved it best yet the draco tavern reminds me of those wonderful multispecies gatherings on the old galaxy covers on the subject of limits we are the creators a writer accepts what limits he chooses and no others often enough its the limits that make the story and we know it in historical fiction the author may torture probability and even move dates around if it moves his main character into the most interesting eventpoints but he would prefer not to because events form the limits he has chosen in fantasy he makes the rules and is bound only by internal consistency in science fiction he accepts limits set by the universe and these are the most stringent of all but only if he so chooses one penalty for so choosing is this the readers may catch him in mistakes ive been caught repeatedly its part of the game and im willing to risk it ive also been known to give up a law or two for the sake of a story ive broken the lightspeed barrier to move my characters about i gave up conservation of rotation for a series of tales on teleportation youll find fantasy here too but observe how the stories are shaped by the limits ive set most of my stories have puzzles in them and puzzles require rules i seem to be happiest with science fiction the literature of the possible where an army of scientists is busily defining my rules for me ot er tales in the draco tavern series may be found in my convergent series published by del rey books in what have we here long stories short stories very short stories new and old collaborations science fiction and fantasy and economic theory have fun the lion in his atiic before the quake it had been called castle minter but few outside minterl remembered that small events drown in large ones atlantis itself an entire continent had drowned in the tectonic event that sank this small peninsula for seventy years the seat of govermnent had been at beesh and that place was called castle minter outsiders called this drowned place nihilils castle for its last lord if they remembered at all three and a fraction stories of what had been the south tower still stood above the waves they bore a third name now rordrays attic the sea was choppy today durily squinted against bright sunlight glinting off waves nothing of nihilils castle showed beneath the froth the lovely goldenhaired woman ceased peering over the side of the boat she lifted her eyes to watch the south tower come toward them she murmured into karskons ear and thats all thats left thone was out of earshot busy lowering the sails but he might glance back the boy was not likely to have seen a lovelier woman in his life and as far as thone was concerned his passengers were seeing this place for the first time karskon turned to look at durily and was relieved she looked interested eager even charmed but she sounded shaken its all gone tapestries and banquet hail and bedrooms and the big ballroom the gardens all down there with the fishes and not even merpeope to enjoy them that little knob of rock must have been crown hill oh karskon i wish you could have seen it she shuddered though her face still wore the mask of eager interest maybe the ridingbirds survived nihilil kept them on the roof you couldnt have been more than ten how can you remember so much a shrug after the torovan invasion after we had to get out mother talked incessantly about palace life i think she got lost in the past i dont blame her much considering what the present was like what she told me and what i saw myself its all a little mixed up after so long i saw the travelling eye though how did that happen mother was there when a messenger passed it to the king she snatched it out of his hand playfully you know and admired it and showed it to me maybe she thought hed give it to her he got very angry and he was trying not to show it and that was even more frightening we left the palace the next day twelve days before the quake karskon asked what about the other but warning pressure from her hand cut him off thone had finished rolling up the sail as the boat thumped against the stone wall he sprang upward onto what had been a balcony and moored the bow line fast a girl in her teens came from within the tower to fasten the stern line for him she was big as thone was big not yet fat but hefty rounded of feature thones sister karskon thought a year or two older durily seeing no easier way out of the boat reached hands up to them they heaved as she jumped karskon passed their luggage up leaving the cargo for others to move and joined them thone made introduction sir karskon lady durily this is estrayle my sister estrayle theyll be our guests for a month ill have to tell father we bring red meat in trade the girl said oh very good father will love that how was the trip well enough sometimes the spells for wind just dont do anything then theres no telling where you wind up to karskon and durily he said we live on this floor these outside stairs take you right up past us youll be staying on the floor above the top floor is the restaurant durily asked and the roof its flat very convenient we raise rabbits and poultry there thone didnt see the look that passed across durilys face shall i show you to your rooms and then ill have to speak to father nihilils castle dated from the last days of real magic the south tower was a wide cylindrical structure twelve stories tall with several rooms on each floor in this age nobody would have tried to build anything so ambitious when rordray petitioned for the right to occupy these ruins he had already done so perhaps the idea amused minterls new rulers a restaurant in nihilils castle reached only by boats at any rate nobody else wanted the probably haunted tower the restaurant was the top floor the floor below would serve as an inn but as custom decreed that the main meal was served at noon it was rare for guests to stay over rordray and his wife and eight children lived on the third floor down though rordrays attic was gaining some reputation on the mainland the majority of rordrays guests were fishermen they often paid their score in fish or in smuggled wines so it was that thone found rordray and merle hauling in lines through the big kitchen window even rordray looked small next to merle merle was two and a half yards tall and rounded everywhere with no corners and no indentations his chin curved in one graceful sweep down to his wishbone his torso expanded around him like a tethered balloon there was just enough solidity enough muscle in the fat that none of it sagged at all and that was considerable muscle the flattopped fish they were wrestling through the window was as big as a normal man but merle and rordray handled it easily they settled the corpse on its side on the center table and merle asked dont you wish you had an oven that size i do said rordray what is it dwarf islandfish see the frilly spines all over the top of the thing meant to be trees moor at an island go ashore when youre all settled the island dives under you then snaps the crew up one by one while youre trying to swim but theyre magical these fish and with the magic dying away im wondering how to cook the beast that really wasnt merles department but he was willing to advise low heat in an oven for a long time maybe an eighth of an arc meaning an eighth of the suns path from horizon to horizon rordray nodded low heat covered ill ifiet it first i can fiddle up a sauce but ill have to see how fatty the meat is all right merle six meals in trade anyone else could have a dozen but you merle nodded placidly he never argued price ill start now he went through into the restaurant section scraping the door on both sides and rordray turned to greet his son we have guests said thone and we have red meat and we have a bigger boat i thought it proper to bargain for you guests good red meat good what have you committed me to let me tell you the way of it thone was not used to mpking business judgments in his fathers name he looked down at his hands and said most of the gold you gave me i had spent i had spices and dried meat and vegetables and pickle and the rest then a boat pulled in with sides of ox for sale i was wondering what i could sell to buy some of that beef when these two found me at the dock was it you they were looking for i think so the lady durily is of the old minterl nobility judging by her accent karskon speaks minterl but he might be of the new nobility the invaders from torov odd to find them together you didnt trust them why did you deal with them thone smiled their offer the fame of rordrays attic has spread throughout minterl so they say they want a place to honeymoon they had married that same day for two weeks stay they offered well enough to buy four sides of ox and enough left over to trade strandhugger in on a larger boat large enough for the beef and two extra passengers where are they now and wheres the beef i told eep its still aboard rordray roared anita i meant to tell estrayle to do something about that but it never mind youve done well arilta came hurrying from the restaurant area rordrays wife resembled her husband to some extent bigboned heavy placid of disposition carrying her weight well what is it set the boys to unloading the new boat four sides of beef get those into the meatbox fast they can take their time with the other goods she left calling loudly for the boys rordray said the guests i gave them the two leeward rooms as a suite good why dont you tell them dinner is being served and then you can have your own meal the dining hall was a roar of voices but when rordrays guests appeared the noise dropped markedly both were wearing court dress of a style which had not yet reached the provinces the man was imposing in black and silver with a figured silver patch over his right eye the lady was eerily beautiful dressed in flowing seagreen and a thuniblength taller than her escort they were conversation stoppers and they knew it and here a man came hurrying to greet them clapping his hands in delight lady durily lord karskon i sin rordray are your quarters comfortable most of the middle floor is empty we can offer a variety of choices quite comfortable thank you karskon said rordray had taken him by surprise rumor said that rordray was a werelion he was large and his short reddishblond hair might be the color of a lions mane but rordray was balding on top and smoothshaven and wellfed with a round and happy face he looked far from ferocious rondray bring em here rordray looked around disconcerted i have an empty table in the corner but if you would prefer merles company the man who had called was tremendous the huge platter before him bore an entire swordfish fillet durily stared in what might have been awe or admiration merle by all means and can you be persuaded to join us i would be delighted rordray escorted them to the huge mans table and seated them the swordfish is good the swordfish is wonderful merle boomed hed made amazing progress with the halfswordfish while they were approaching its baked with apricots and slivered nuts and something else i cant tell rordray the nuts are soaked in a liqueur called brosa from rynildissen and dried in the oven ill try it karskon said and durily nodded rordray disappeared into the kitchen the noise level was rising toward its previous pitch durily raised her voice just high enough most of you seem to be fishers it must have been hard for you after the merpeople went away it was lady they had to learn to catch their own fish instead of trading all the techniques had to be invented from scratch they tell me they tried magic at first to breathe water you know some of them drowned then caine fishingspears and special boats and nets you said they im a whale said merle i came later oh there arent many werefolk around these days anywhere we arent all gone merle said while karskon smiled at how easily they had broached the subject the merpeople went away all right but it wasnt just because theyre magical creatures their life styles include a lot of magic whales dont practice much magic even so karskon wondered what are you doing on land arent you afraid you might ah change magic isnt dependable any more but rordray is rordray would get me out in time anyway i spend most of my time aboard shrimp see if the change comes over me there its no problem a whales weight would swamp my little boat and leave me floating i still dont seec sharks ptli damn brainless toothy wandering weapons the more you kill the more the blood draws more till merle shifted restlessly anyway there are no sharks ashore and there are books and people to talk to out on the sea theres only the whale songs now i like the singing who wouldnt but its only family gossip and weather patterns and shoreline changes and where are the fish that sounds useful sure it is fisherfolk learn the whale songs to find out where the fish are but for any kind of intelligent conversation you have to come ashore ah heres rordray rordray set three plates in place bearing generous slabs of swordfish and vegetables cooked in elaborate fashions whats under discussion werecreatures karskon said theyre having a terrible time of it almost everywhere rordray sat down even in rynildissen the wolf people sector well durily said uncomfortably theyre changing you know there are people who can change into animals but thats because there are werefolk among their ancestors most werefolk are animals who learned how to take human form the human shape has magic in it you know rordray nodded and she continued in places where the magics gone its terrible the animals lose their minds even human folk with some animal ancestry they cant make the change but their minds arent quite human either wolf ancestry makes for good soldiers but its hard for them to stop a touch of hyena or raccoon makes for thieves a man with a touch of lion makes a good general but merle shifted restlessly as if the subject were painful to him his platter was quite clean now oh to hell with the problems of werefolk tell me how you lost your eye karskon jumped but he answered happened in the baths when i was thirteen we were having a fight with wet towels and one of my halfbrothers flicked my eye out with the corner of a towel dull story you should make up a better one want some help karskon shook his head smiling despite himself where are you from inland its been years since i tasted fresh fish you were right its wonderful he paused but the silence forced him to continue im half torovan half minterl duke ch nii of konth made me his librarian and i teach his legitimate children lady durily descends from the old minterl nobility shes one of duchess chamils ladiesinwaiting thats how we met i never understood shoreside politics merle said there was a war wasnt there long ago karskon answered for fear that durily would torov invaded after the quake it was an obvious power vacuum the tales tell that the torovan armies never got this far south what was left of the dukes surrendered first youll find a good many of the old minterls hereabouts the torovans have to go in packs when they come here merle was looking disgusted whales dont play at war its not a game karskon said rordray added or at least the stakes are too high for ordinary people there was murky darkness black with a hint of green blocky shapes motion ificked past drifted back more slowly too dark to see but karskon sensed something looking back at him a fish a ghost karskon opened his good eye durily was at the window looking out to sea leftward waves washed the spike of island that had been crown hill there was grass almost to the top durily said but the peak was always a bare knob we picnicked there once the whole family what else do you remember anything we can use two flights of stairs durily said youve seen the one that winds up the outside of the tower like a snake snakeheaded it used to be but the quake must have knocked off the head animated no just a big carving urn it could have been animated once the magic was going out of everything the merpeople were all gone the mainlanders were trying to learn to catch their own fish and we had trouble getting food nihilil was thinking of moving the whole court to beesh am i rambling too much darling no telling what we can use keep it up the inside stairs lead down from the kitchen through the laundry room on this floor and through thones room on the lower floor thone karskons hand strayed to his belt buckle which was silver and massive which was in fact the hilt of a concealed dagger hes not as big as rordray but id hate to have him angry with me theyre all too big wed best not be caught unless we or you can find a legitimate reason for being in thones room durily scowled hes just not interested he sees me he knows im a woman but he doesnt seem to care or else hes very stupid about suggestions thats possible if hes part of a werelion family he wouldnt mate with human beings durily laughed and it sounded like silver coins falling no he thought she wouldnt have had trouble seducing a young man or anything male i gave her no trouble even now knowing the truth our host isnt a werelion she said lions eat red meat weve brought red meat to his table but he was eating fish lions dont lust for a varied diet and they arent particular about what they eat our host has exquisite taste if id known how fine a cook he is id have come for that alone he shows some other signs the whole familys big but hes a lot bigger why does he shave his face and clip his hair short is it to hide a mane does it matter if theyre lions we dont want to be caught durily said any one of them is big enough to be a threat stop fondling that canape sticker dear this trip we use stealth and magic oddly reluctant karskon said speaking of magic yes its time youre quite right theyre hiding something rordray said absently he was carving the meat from a quarter of ox and cutting it into chunks briskly apparently risking his fingers at every stroke what of it dont we all have something to hide they are my guests they appreciate my food well said his wife dont we all have something worth gossipping about and for a honeymooning couple at which point estrayle burst into a peal of laughter arilta asked now what brought that on but estrayle only shook her head and bent over the pale yellow roots she was cutting arilta turned back to her husband they dont seem loving enough somehow and she so beautiful too it makes a pattern rordray said the woman is beautiful as you noticed she is the duchesss ladyinwaiting the man serves the duke could lady durily be the dukes mistress might the duke have married her to one of his men it would provide for her if shes pregnant it might keep the duchess happy it happens arilta said ah she began dumping double handfuls of meat into a pot estrayle added the chopped root on the other hand rordray said she is of the old minterl aristocracy karskon may be too half anyway perhaps theyre not welcome near beesh because of some failed plot the people around here are of the old minterl blood theyd protect them if it came to that well his wife said with some irritation which is it rordray teased her with a third choice they spend money freely where does it come from they could be involved in a theft we will presently hear about estrayle looked up from cutting onions tears dripping past a mischievous smile listen for word of a large catseye emerald estrayle you will explain that said her mother estrayle hesitated but her fathers bands had stopped moving and he was looking up it was after supper she said i was turning down the beds karskon found me we talked a bit and then he well made advances poor little man he weighs less than i do i slapped him hard enough to knock that lovely patch right off his face then i informed him that if hes interested in marriage he should be talking to my father and in any case there are problems he should be aware of her eyes were dancing i must say he took it well he asked about my dowry i hinted at undersea treasures when i said wed have to live here he said at least hed never have to worry about the cooking but his religion permitted him only one wife and i said what a pity the jewel rordray reminded her oh its beautiful deep green with a blazing vertical line just like a cats eye he wears it in the socket of his right eye arilta considered if he thinks thats a safe place to hide it he should get a less flamboyant patch someone might steal that silver thing whatever their secret its unlikely to disturb us rordray said and this is their old seat of royalty even the ghost which reminds me jarper the empty air he spoke to remained empty he said i havent seen jarper since lunch has anyone nobody answered rordray continued i noticed him hovering behind karskon at lunch karskon must be carrying something magical maybe the jewel oh never mind jarper can take care of himseli i was saying jarper probably wont bother our guests hes of old minterl blood himself if he had blood they stuffed wool around the door and around the windows they propped a chair under the doorknob karskon and durily had no intention of being disturbed at this point an innkeeper who found his guests marking patterns on the floor with powdered bone and heating almostfresh blood over a small flame could rightly be expected to show annoyance durily spoke in a language once common to the sorcerers guild now common to nobody the words seemed to hurt her throat and no wonder karskon thought he had doffed his silver eye patch he tended the flame and the pot of blood and stayed near durily as instructed he closed his good eye and saw greentinged darkness something darker drifted past slowly something huge and rounded that suddenly vanished with a ifick of finny tail now a drifting current of luminescence congealing somehow to a vaguely human shape the night he robbed the jewel merchants shop this sight had almost killed him the movement had wealth to buy the emerald but durily swore that the torovan lords must not learn that the jewel existed she hadnt told him why it wasnt for the movement that he had obeyed her the movement would destroy the torovan invaders would punish his father and his halfbrothers for their arrogance for the way they had treated him for the loss of his eye but he had obeyed her he was her slave in those days the slave of his lust for the lady durily his fathers mistress he had guessed that it was glamour that held him magic it hadnt seemed to matter he had invaded the jewelers shop expecting to die and it hadnt mattered the merchant had heard some sound and come to investigate karskon had already scooped up everything he could find of value to distract attention from the single missing stone waiting for discovery in the dark cellar he had pushed the jewel into his empty eye socket greenish darkness drifting motion a sudden flicker that might be a fishs tail karskon was seeing with his missing eye the jeweler had found him while he was distracted but karskon had killed him after all afterward knowing that much he had forced durily to tell the rest she had lost a good deal of her power over him he had outgrown his terror of that greenishdark place he had seen it every night while he waited for sleep these past two years karskon opened his good eye to find that they had company the color of fading fog it took the wavering form of a wiry old man garbed for war with his helmet tucked under his arm i want to speak to king nihilil durily said fetch him your pardon lady the voice was less than a whisper clearer than a memory i ccant leave here who were you the fogwisp straightened to attention sergeant jarper sleen serving minterl and the king i was on duty in the watchtower when the land tbththrashed like an islandfish submerging the wall broke my arm and some ribs after things got quiet again there were only these three floors left and no food anywhere i sstarved to death durily examined him with a critical eye you seem nicely solid after seventysix years the ghost smiled thats rordrays doing he lets me take the smells of his cooking as offerings but i cant leave where i ddied was the king home that day lady i have to say that he was the quake came fast i dont doubt he drowned in his throne room drowned durily said thoughtfully all right she poured a small flask of seawater into the blood which was now bubbling something must have been added to keep it from clotting she spoke high and fast in the sorcerers guild tongue the ghost of jarper sleen sank to its knees karskon saw the draperies wavering as if heated air was moving there and when he realised what that meant he knelt too an unimaginative man would have seen nothing this ghost was more imagination than substance in fact the foggy crown had more definition more reality than the head beneath its voice was very much like a memory surfacing from the past not even karskons past but durilys you have dared to waken minterls king seventysix years after the loss of atlantis and the almost incidental drowning of the seat of government of minterl the ghost of minterls king seemed harmless enough but durilys voice quavered you knew me durily lady tinylla of beesh was my mother durily youve grown said the ghost well what do you want of me the barbarians of torov have invaded minterl have you ever been tired unto death when the pain in an old wound keeps you awake nonetheless well tell me of these invaders if you can lure them here i and my army will pull them under the water karskon thought that minterls ancient king couldnt have drowned a bumblebee again he kept silent while durily said they invaded the year after the great quake they have ruled minter for seventyfour years the palace is drowned but for these top floors durilys voice became a whip they are used as an inn rabbits and chickens are kept where the fightingbirds roostedi the ghostkings voice grew stronger why was i not told this time karskon spoke we cant lure them here to a drowned island we must fight them where they rule in beesh and who are you i am karskon lor your majesty my mother was of beesh my father a torovan calling himself a lord chamil of konth lord chamil raised me to be his librarian his legitimate sons he karskon fell silent youre a torovans bastard but you would strike against the torovan invaders how dually seemed minded to let him speak karskon lifted the silver eye patch to show the great green gem there were two of these werent there durily tells me they were used for spying the king said what you keep in your eye socket was the traveling stone usually i had it mounted in a ring if i thought a lord needed watching i made him a present of it if he was innocent i made him another present and took it back karskon heaved a shuddering sigh he had almost believed always he had almost believed durily asked where was the other stone did your mother tell you of my secret suite for times when i wanted company away from the queen it was a very badly kept secret many ladies could describe that room your mother was one the ghost smiled but it stood empty most of the time except for the man on watch in the bathing chamber there is a statue of the oneeyed god in the bathing chamber and its eye is a catseye emerald durily nodded can you guide us there i can can you breathe under water durily smiled yes the gem holds mana if it leaves minter castle the ghosts will fade durily lost her smile king nihilil i will show you duty runs two ways between a king and his subjects now a day or two well have to reach the stairwell past the innkeepers family the ghosts went where ghosts go karskon and dually pulled the wool loose from the windows and opened them wide a brisk sea wind whipped away the smell of scorched blood i wish we could have done this on the roof she said viciously among rordrays damned chickens used their blood it happened the second day after their arrival karskon was expecting it the dining room was jammed before noon rordrays huge pot of stew dwindled almost to nothing he set his older children to frying thick steaks with black pepper and cream and essence of wine his younger children to serving providentially merle showed up and rordray set him to moving tables and chairs to the roof the younger children set the extra tables karskon and durily found themselves squeezing through a host of seamen to reach the roof rordray laughed as he apologized but after all its your own doing i have red meat usually there is nothing but fish and shellfish what do you prefer my stew has evaporated poof but i can offer durily asked is there still fish rordray nodded happily and vanished cages of rabbits and pigeons and large bewilderedlooking moos had been clustered in the center of the roof to give the diners a sea view a salvo of torpedoes shot from the sea bottlenosed mammals with a laughing expression they acted like they were trying to get someones attention merle carrying a table and chairs said merpeople they must be lost where the magics been used up they lose their halfhuman shape and their sense too if theyre still around when i put out ill lead them out to rordray served them himself but didnt join them today he was too busy under a brilliant blue sky they ate islandfish baked with slivered nuts and some kind of liqueur and vegetables treated with respect they ate quickly butterflies fluttered in karskons belly but he was jubilant rordray had red meat of course the attic was jammed of course rordray and his family were busy as a fallen beehive the third floor would be entirely deserted water black and stagnant covered the sixth step down durily stopped before she reached it come closer she said stay close to me karskons protective urge responded to her fear and her beauty but he reminded himself it wasnt his nearness she needed it was the gem he moved down to join dually and her ally she arrayed her equipment on the steps no blood this time king nihulil was already with them barely like an intrusive memory at her side she began to chant in the sorcerers guild tongue the water sank step by step what had been done seventyodd years ago could be undone partially temporarily durilys voice grew deep and rusty karskon watched as her hair faded from golden to white as the curves of her body drooped wrinkles formed on her face her neck her arms glamour is a lesser magic but it takes mona the magic that was durilys youth was being used to move seawater now karskon had thought he was ready for this now he found himself staring flinching back until durily without interrupting herself snarled and gestured him down he descended the wet stone stairs durily followed moving stiffly king nihilil floated ahead of them like foxfire on the water the sea had left the upper floors but water still sluiced from the landings karskons torch illuminated dripping walls and once a stranded fish within his chest his heart was fighting for its freedom on the fifth floor down there were side corridors karskon peering into their darkness shied violently from a glimpse of motion an eel thrashed as it drowned in air eighth floor down behind him durily moved as if her joints hurt her appearance repelled him the deep lines in her face werent smile wrinides they were selfishness sulks rage and her voice ran on and her hands danced in creaky curves she cant hurry shed fall cant leave her behind her spells my jewel keep them together or we drown but the ghost was drawing ahead of them would he leave us here worse king nihilil was becoming hard to see blurring the whole corridor seemed filled with the restless fog that was the kings ghost no the kings ghost had multiplied a horde of irritated or curious ghosts had joined the procession karskon shivered from the cold and wondered how much the cold was due to ghosts rubbing up against him tenth floor down and the procession had become a crowd karskon trailing could no longer pick out the king but the ghosts streamed out of the stairwell flowed away down a corridor and karskon followed a murmuring was in the air barely audible a hundred ghosts whispering gibberish in his ear the sea had not retreated from the walls and ceiling here water surrounded them ankle deep as they walked rounding up the corridor walls and curving over their heads to form a huge complex bubble carpet disintegrated under karskons boots to his right the wall ended karskon looked over a stone railing down into the water into a drowned ballroom there were bones at the bottom swampfires formed on the waters surface more ghosts the ghosts had paused now they were like a swirling continuous glowing fog here and there the motion suggested features and karskon suddenly realised that he was watching a riot ghost against ghost theyd realised why he was here drowning the intruders would save the jewel save their fading lives not drowning them would repel minterls enemies karskon nerved himself and waded into them hands tried to clutch him a broadswordshape struck his throat and broke into mist he was through them standing before a heavy ornately carved door the kings ghost was waiting silently he showed karskon how to manipulate a complex lock presently he mimed turning a brass knob and threw his weight back karskon imitated him the door swung open a bedchamber and a canopied bed like a throne if this place was a ruse nihilil must have acted his part with verve the sea was here pushing in against the bubble karskon could see a bewildered school of minnows in a corner of the chamber the leader took a wrong turn and the whole school whipped around to follow him through the water interface and suddenly into the air they flopped as they fell splashed into more water and scattered a bead of sweat ran down durilys cheek the kings ghost waited patiently at another door terror was swelling in karskons throat fighting fear with selfcurected rage he strode soggily to the door and threw it open before the kings warning gesture could register he was looking at a loaded crossbow aimed throathigh the string had rotted and snapped karskon remembered to breathe forced himself to breathe it was a tiled bathroom sure enough there was a considerable array of erotic statuary some quite good the rozekattee statue would have been better for less detail karskon thought a skeleton in the pool wore a rotting bathattendants kilt that would be nihilils spy the oneeyed god in a corner yes the eye not covered by a patch gleamed even in this dim watery light gleamed green with a bright vertical pupil karskon closed his good eye and found himself looking at himself grinning eye closed he moved toward the statue fumbling in his pouch for the chisel odd to see himself coming toward himself like this and durily behind him the triumph beginning to show through the exhaustion and behind her he drew his sword as he spun dually froze in shock as he seemed to leap at her the bubble of water trembled the sea began to flow down the walls before she recovered herself but by then karskon was past her and trying to skewer the intruder who danced back laughing through the bedroom and through its ornate door while karskon karskon checked himself the emerald in his eye socket was supplying the magical energy to run the spell that held back the water it had to stay near durily shed drilled him on this over and over until he could recite it in his sleep rordray stood in the doorway comfortably out of reach he threw his arms wide careless of the big broadbladed kitchen knife in one hand and said but what a place to spend a honeymoon tastes differ karskon said innkeeper this is none of your business there is a thing of power down here ive known that for a long time youre here for it arent you the spying stone karskon said you dont even know what it is whatever it is im afraid you cant have it rordray said perhaps you havent considered the implications oh but i have well sell the traveling stone to the barbarian king in beesh from that moment on the movement will know everything he does can you think of any reason why i should care karskon made a sound of disgust so you support the torovans i support nobody am i a lord or a soldier no i feed people if someone should supplant the torovans i will feed the new conquerors i dont care who is at the top we care who you because you havent the rank of your halfbrothers the elderly lady durily who wants vengeance on her enemies grandchildren or the ghosts it was a ghost who told me you were down here beyond rordray karskon watched faintly luminous fog swirling in the corridor the war of ghosts continued and dually was tiring he couldnt stay here he had to pry out the jewel he asked is it the jewel you want you couldnt have reached it without durilys magic if you distract her now youll never reach the air with or without the jewel well all drown karskon kept his swords point at eye level if rordray was a werelion but he didnt eat red meat the jewel has to stay rordray said why do you think these walls are still standing karskon didnt answer the quake that sank atlantis the quake that put this entire peninsula under water wouldnt it have shaken down stone wails but this palace dates from the sorcerers guild period magic spells were failing but not always the masons built this palace of good solid stone then they had the structure blessed by a competent magician yes the wails would have been shaken down without the blessing and some source of mana to power it you see the problem remove the talisman the castle crumbles he might be right karskon thought but not until both emeralds were gone and karskon too rordray was still out of reach he didnt handle that kitchen knife like a swordsman and in any case it was too short to be effective at a dead run karskon thought he could catch the beefy chef but what of durily and the spell that held back the water fool she had the other jewel the spyingstone he charged rordray whirled and ran down the hall the ghostfog swirled apart as he burst through he was faster than he looked but karskon was faster still his sword was nearly pricking rordrays buttocks when rordray suddenly leapt over the bannister karskon leaned over the dark water the ghosts crowded around him were his only light source now rordray surfaced thirty feet above the ballroom floor and well out into the water laughing well my guest can you swim many mainlanders cant karskon removed his boots he might wait let rordray tire himself treading water but durily must be tiring even faster and growing panicky as she wondered where he had gone he couldnt leave rordray at their backs he didnt dive he lowered himself carefully into the water then swam toward rordray rordray backstroked grinning karskon followed he was a fine swimmer rordray was swimming backward into a corner of the ballroom trapping himself the water surface rose behind him curving up the wall could rordray swim uphill rordray didnt try he dove karskon dove after him kicking peering down there were patches of luminosity confusing and a dark shape far below darting away at a speed karskon couldnt hope to match appalled karskon lunged to the surface blinked and saw rordray clamber over the railing he threw karskons boots at his head and dashed back toward the kings secret bedroom the old woman was still waiting with the kings ghost for her companion rordray tapped her shoulder he said boo she froze then tottered creakily around to face him where is karskon in the ballroom water was flowing down the walls kneehigh and rising rordray was smiling as at a secret joke as hed smiled while watching her savor her first bite of his incredible swordfish it meant something different now durily said very well you killed him now if you want to live get me that jewel and i will resume the spells if our plans succeed i can offer karskons place in the new nobility to you or your son otherwise we both drown karskon could tell you why i refuse i need the magic in the jewel to maintain my inn with the traveling jewel karskon brought me this structure will remain stable for many years rordray didnt seem to notice that the kings ghost was clawing at his eyes the water was chest high both jewels or we dont leave the old woman said and immediately resumed her spell hands waving wildly voice raspy with effort she felt rordrays hands on her body and squeaked in outrage then in terror as she realised he was tickling her then she doubled in helpless laughter the water walls were collapsing flowing down the odd magical bubble was collapsing around him clawing at the stone bannister karskon heard his air supply roaring back up the stairwell out through the broken windows away a wave threw him over the bannister and he tried to find his footing but already it was too deep then the air was only a few silver patches on the ceiling and the seawash was turning him over and over a big dark shape brushed past him fantastically agile in the roiling currents gone before his swordarm could react rordray had escaped him he swam toward one of the smashed ballroom windows knowing he wouldnt make it trying anyway the faint glow ahead might be king nihilil guiding him then it all seemed to fade and he was breathing water strangling rordray pulled himself over the top step his ifippers already altering to hands he was gasping blowing it was a long trip even for a sea lion the returning sea had surged up the steps and sloshed along the halls and into the rooms where rordray and his family dwelt rordray shook his head for a few days they must needs occupy the next level up the inn which was now empty the change to human form was not so great a change for rordray he became aware of one last wisp of fog standing beside him well it said hows the king furious rordray said but after all what can he do i thank you for the warning im glad you could stop them my curse on their crazy rebellion well all ffade away in time i guess with the magic dwindling and dwindung but not just yet if you please war is bad for everyone said rordray spirals by larry niven and jerry pournelle there are always people who want to revise history no hero is so great that someone wont take a shot at him not even jack halfey yes i knew jack halfey you may not remember my name but in the main airlock of industrial station one theres an inscribed block of industrial diamond and my name is sixth down cornelius l riggs metallurgist and you might have seen my face at the funeral you mast remember the funeral all across the solar system work stopped while jack halfey took his final trek into the sun he wanted it that way and no spacer was going to refuse jack halfeys last request no matter how expensive it might be even the downers got in the act they didnt help pay the cost but they spent hundreds of millions on sending reporters and cameras to the moon that funeral damned near killed me the kids who took me to the moon werent supposed to let the ship take more than half a gravity my bones are over a hundred years old and theyre fragile for that young squirt of a pilot the landing may have been smooth but she hit a full gee for a second there and i thought my time had come i had to go of course the records say i was jacks best friend the man whod saved his life and being one of the last survivors of the great trek makes me somebody special noth ing would do but that i push the button to send jack on his final spiral into the sun to quote a downer reporter i still see trivee programs about ships spiraling into the sun youd think seventy yeals and more after the great trek the schools would teach kids something about space when i staggered outside in lunar gravitylighter than the gravity we keep in the skylark just enough to feel the differencethe reporters were all over me why they demanded did jack want to go into the sun cremation and scattering of ashes is good enough for most spacers it was good enough for jacks wife some send their ashes back to earth some are scattered into the solar wind to be flung throughout the universe some prefer to go back into the soil of a colony sphere but why the sun ive wondered myself i never was good at reading jacks mind the question that nearly drove me crazy and did drive me to murder was why did jack halfey make the great trek in the first place i finally did learn the answer to that one be patient probably there will never be another funeral like jacks the big push is only a third finished and its still two hundred miles of the biggest linear accelerator ever built an electronicpowered railway crawling across the earthside face of the moon one day well use it to launch starships well fire when the moon is full to add the earths and moons orbital velocities to the speed of the starship and to give the downers a thrill but we launched jack when the moon was new with precisely enough velocity to cancel the earths orbital speed of eighteen miles per second it would have cost less to send him into interstellar space jack didnt drop in any spiral the earth went on and the coffin stayed behind then it started to fall into the sun it fell ninetythree million miles just like a falling safe except for that peculiar wiggle when he really got into the suns magnetic field moonbase is going to do it again with a probe they want to know more about that wiggle the pilot was a lot more careful getting me home and now im back aboard the skylailc in a room near the axis where the heart patients stay and on my desk is this pile of garbage from a history professor at harvard who has absolutely proved that we would have had space industries and space colonies without jack halfey there are no indispensible men in the words of a famous american president bullshit weve made all the downers so rich that they cant remember what it was like back then and it was grim if we hadnt got space industries established before wed never have been able to afford them at all things were that thin by ad there wouldnt have been any resources to invest theyd have all gone into keeping eleven billion downers alive and anybody who proposed throwing money into outer space would have been lynched god knows it was that way when jack halfey started i first met jack halfey at ucla he was a grad student in architecture having got his engineering physics degree from cal tech hed also been involved in a number of construction jobsamong them hale observatorys big orbital telescope while he was still an undergrad at cal techand he was already famous everyone knows he was brilliant and theyre right but he had another secret weapon he worked his arse off he had to insomnia jack couldnt sleep more than a couple of hours a night and to get even that much sleep he had to get laid first i know about this because when i met jack he was living with my sister ruthie told me that theyd go to bed and jack would sleep a couple of hours and up hed be back at work because once he woke up there was no point in lying in bed on nights when they couldnt make out he fltver went to bed at all and he was pure hell to live with the next day she also told me he was one mercenary son of a bitch that doesnt square with the public image of jack halfey savior of mankind but it happens to be true and he never made much of a secret of it he wanted to get rich fast his ambition was to lie around rio de janeiros beaches and sample the local wines and women and he had his life all mapped out so that hed be able to retire before he was forty i knew him for a couple of months then he left ucla to be a department head in the construction of the big tucson arcology there was a tearful scene with ruthie she didnt fit into jacks image for the future and he wasnt very gentle about how he told her he was leaving he stormed out of her apartment carrying his suitcase while ruthie and i shouted curses at him and that was that i never expected to see him again when i graduated there was this problem i was a metallurgist and there were a lot of us metallurgists had been in big demand when i started ucla so naturally everybody studied metallurgy and matcrials science by the time i graduated it was damned tough getting a job the depression didnt help much either i graduated right in the middle of it runaway inflation research chopped to the bone environmentalists and only one earthers and friends of man and the earth and other such yoyos on the rise in those days there was a new energy crisis every couple of years and when i got my sheepskin we were in the middle of i think number industry was laying off not hiring there was one job i knew of a notice on the ucla careers board metallurgist wanted high pay long hours high risk guaranteed wealthy in ten years if you live through it that doesnt sound very attractive just now but in those days it looked better better than welfare anyway especially since the welfare offices were having trouble meeting their staff payrolls so there wasnt a lot left over to hand out to their clients so i sent in an application and found myself one of about a hundred whod got past the paperwork screening the interview was on campus with a standard personnel officer type who seemed more interested in my sports record than my abilities as a metallurgist he also liked my employment history id done summer jobs in heavy steel construction he wouldnt tell me what the job was for not secret work he said but wed as soon not let it out to anyone were not seriously interested in he smiled and stood up indicating the interview was over well let you know a couple of days later i got a call at the fraternity house they wanted me at the wilshire headquarters of united space industries i checked around the house but didnt get any new information usi had contracts for a good bit of space work including the lunar mines maybe thats it i thought i could hope anyway when i got to usi the receptionist led me into a comfortable room and asked me to sit down in a big eames chair the chair faced an enormous tv screen she typed something on an input console and we waited a few minutes and the screen came to life it showed an old man floating in midair the background looked like a spacecraft which wasnt surprising i recognized admiral robert mcleve he had to be eighty or more but he didnt look it good morning he said the receptionist left good morning i told the screen there was a faint red light on a lens by the screen and i assumed he could see me as well as could see him id kind of hoped for the moon i didnt expect the oneill colony i added it took a while before he reacted confirming my guess a second and a half each way for the message and the way he was floating meant zero gravity i couldnt think of anything but the construction shack that fit the description this is where we are mcleve said the duty tour is five years high pay and you save it all not mush to spend money on out here unless you drink good liquor costs like uansplant rights on your kidneys so does bad liquor because you still have to lift it savings dont mean much i said true mcleve grimaced at the thought inflation was running better than the politicians said they would have it whipped real soon now but nobody believed them weve got arrangements to have three quarters of your money banked in swiss francs if you go back early you lose that part of your pay we need somebody in your field part time on the moon part time up here in the shack from your record i think youd do still want the job industries i wanted it all right i was never a nut on the space industries biti was never a nut on anythingbut it sounded like good work exciting a chance to see something of the solar system as well as to save a lot of money and with that job on my record id be in demand when i came home as to why me it was obvious when i thought about it there were lots of good metallurgists but not many had been finalists in the olympic gymnastics team trials i hadnt won a place on the team but id sure proved i knew how to handle myself add to that the heavy construction work experience and i was a natural i sweated out the job appointment but it came through and pretty soon i was at canaveral strapping myself into a shuttle seat and having second and third thoughts about the whole thing there were five of us we lifted out from the cape in the shuttle then transfened in earth orbit to a tug that wasnt a lot bigger than the old apollo capsules had been the trip was three days and crowded the others were going to moon base they refueled my tug in lunar orbit and sent me off alone to the construction shack the ship was guided from the shack and it was scary as hell becaus there wasnt anything to do but wonder if they knew what they were doing it took as long to get from the moon to the shack as it had to get to the moon from earth which isnt surprising because its the same dis tance the shack was in one of the stable libration points that make an equilateral triangle with the earth and the moon anything put there will stay there forever the only viewport was a small thing in the forward end of the tug naturally we came in assbackwards so i didnt see much today we call it the skylark and what you see as you approach is a sphere half a kilometer across it rotates every two minutes and theres all kinds of junk moored to the axis of rotation mirrors the laser and power targets the long thin spine of the mass driver the ring of agricultural pods the big telescope a confusion of equipment it wasnt that way when i first saw it the sphere was nearly all there was except for a spiderweb framework to hold the solar power panels the frame was bigger than the sphere but it didnt look very substantial at first sight the shack was a pebbled sphere a golf ball stuck in a spiders web mcleve met me at the airlock he was long of limb and startlingly thin and his face and neck were a maze of wrinkles but his back was straight and when he smiled the wrinkles all aligned themselves laughlines before i left earth i read up on his history annapolis engineer with the space program retired with a bad heart wrote a lot of science fiction id read most of his novels in high school and i suppose half the people in the space program were pulled in by his stories when his wife died he had another heart attack the old boys network came to the rescue his classmates wangled an assignment in space for him he hadnt been to earth for seven years and low gravity was all that kept him alive he didnt even dare go to the moon a reporter with a flair for mythological phraseology called him the old man of space it was certain that hed never go home again but if he missed earth he didnt show it welcome aboard he sounded glad to see me what do they call you he asked a good question cornelius might sound a dignified name to a roman but it makes for ribald comments in the usa corky i told him i shrugged which was a mistake we were at the center of the sphere and there wasnt any gravity at all i drifted free from the grabbandle id been clinging to and drifted around the airlock after a moment of panic it turned out to be fun there hadnt been mom for any violent maneuvers in the tug but the airlock was built to get tugs and rocket motors inside for repairs it was big nine meters across and i could twirl around in the zero gravity i flapped my arms and found i could swim mcleve was watching with a critical air he must have liked what he saw because he grinned slightly come on he said he turned in the air and drifted without apparent motion it looked like levitation ill show you around he led the way out of the airlock into the sphere itself we were at the center of rotation all arnund above and below were fields of dirt some plowed some planted with grass and grains there were wings attached to hooks at the entrance mcleve took down a set and began strapping them on black bat wings they made him look like a fallen angel miltons style he handed me another pair like to fly he asked i returned the grin why not i hadnt the remotest idea of what i was doing but if i could swim in the air with my hands i ought to be able to handle wings in no gravity he helped me strap in and when i had them he gave some quick instructions main thing is to stay high he said the further down the higher the gravity and the tougher it is to control these things he launched himself into space gliding across the center of the sphere after a moment i followed him i was a tiny chick in a vast eggshell the landscape was wrapped around me fields and houses and layout yards of construction gear and machinery and vats of algae and three huge windows opening on blackness every direction was down millions of light years down when a window caught my attenlion for a moment that was terrifying but mcleve held himself in place with tiny motions of his wings and his eyes were on me i swallowed my fear and looked there were few roads mostly the colonists flew with their wings flew like birds and if they didnt need roads they didnt need squaredoff patterns for the buildings either the houses looked like theyd been dropped at random among the green fields they were fragile partitions of sheet metal and they could not have borne their own weight on earth let alone stand up to a stiff breeze they didnt have to they existed for privacy alone i wondered about the weather along the axis of the sphere i could see scores of white pufiballs clouds i gathered my courage and flapped my way over to the white patch it was a flock of hens their feet were drawn up their heads were tucked under their wings and they roosted on nothing they like it in zero gravity mcleve said only thing is when youre below them you have to watch out he pointed a blob of chicken splat had left the flock and moved away from us it fell in a spiral pattern of course the splat was actually going in a straight linewe were the ones who were rotating and that made the falling stuff look as if it were spiraling to the ground below automatic fertilizer machine i said mcleve nodded i wonder you dont keep them caged i said some people like their sky dotted with fleecy white hens oh where is everybody i asked most are outside working mcleve said youll meet them at dinner we stayed at the axis drifting with the air currents literally floating on air i knew already why people who came here wanted to stay id never experienced anything like it soaring like a bird it wasnt even like a sail plane you wore the wings and you flew withthem you didnt sit in a cockpit and move controls around there were lights along part of the axis the mirrors would take over their job when they were installed for the moment the lights ran off solar power cells plastered over the outside of the sphere at the far end of the sphere was an enormous cloud of dust we didnt get close to it i pointed and looked a question rock grinder mcleve said making soil we spread it over the northern end he laughed at my frown north is the end toward the sun we get our rocks from the moon its our radiation shielding works just as well if we break it up and spread it around and that way we can grow crops in it later on well get the agricultural compartments built but theres always five times as much work as we have people to do it with theyd done pretty well already there was grass and millet and wheat for the chickens and salad greens and other vegetable crops streams ran through the fields down to a ringshaped pond at the equator there was also a lot of bare soil that had just been put in place and hadnt been planted the shack wasnt anywhere near finished how thick is that soil i asked not thick enough i was coming to that if you hear the flare warnings get to my house north pole i thought that one over the only way to ward yourself from a solar flare is to put a lot of mass between you and the sun on earth that mass is a hundred miles of air on the moon they burrow ten meters into the regolith the shack had only the rock we could get from the moon and moonbase had problems of its own when they had the manpower and spare energy theyd throw more rock our way and wed plaster it across the outer shell of the shack or grind it up and put it inside but for now there wasnt enough and come flare time mcleve was host toan involuntary lawn party but what the hell i thought its beautiful streams rushing in spirals from pole to equator green fields and houses skies dotted with fleecy white hens and i was flying as man flies in dreams i decided it was going to be fun but there was one possible hitch there are only ten women aboard i said mcleve nodded gravely and nine of them are married he nodded again up to now weve mostly needed muscle heavy construction experience and muscle the next big crew shipments in six months and the companys trying like hell to recruit women to balance things off think you can hold out that long guess i have to sure im old navy we didnt have women aboard ships and we lived through it i was thinking that id like to meet the one unmarried woman aboard also that she must be awfully popular mcleve must have read my thoughts because he waved me toward a big stnlcture perched on a ledge partway down from the north pole youre doing all right on the flying take it easy and lets go over there we soared down and i began to feel a definite up and down before that any direction i wanted it to be was up we landed in front of the building combination mess hail and administration offices mcleve said ten percent level it took a moment before i realized what he meant ten percent level ten percent of earths gravity its as heavy as i care to go mcleve said and any lighter makes it hard to eat the labs are scattered around the ring at the same level he helped me off with my wings and we went inside there were several people all men scurrying about purposefully they didnt stop to meet me they werent wearing much and i soon found that was the custom in the shack why wear clothes inside there wasnt any weather it was always warm and dry and comfortable you mostly needed clothes for pockets at the end of the corridor was a room that hummed inside there was a bank of computer screens all active in front of them sat a homely girl miss hoffman mcleve said our new metallurgist corky riggs hi she looked at me for a moment then back at the computer console she was mumbling something to herself as her fingers flew over the keys dot hoffman is our resident genius mcleve said anything from stores and inventories to orbit control if a computer can figure it out she can make the brains work the problem she looked up with a smile we give necessity the praise of virtue she said mcleve looked thoughtful cicero quintilian she turned back to her console again see you at dinner mcleve said he led me out miss hoffman isaid he nodded i suppose she wears baggy britches and blue wool stockings and that shiti because its cool in the computer room i said no she always dresses that way oh only six months riggs the admiral said well maybe a year youll survive i was thinking id damned well have to i fell in love during dinner the chief engineer was named ty plauger a long lean chap with startling blue eyes the chief ecologist was his wife jill they had been married about a year before they came up and theyd been aboard the shack for three ever since it started up neither was a lot older than me maybe thirty then at my present age the concept of love at first sight seems both trite and incredible but it was true enough i suppose i could have named you reasons then but i dont feel them now take this instead there were ten women aboard out of ninety total nine were married and the tenth was dot hoffman my first impression of her was more than correct dot never would be married not only was she homely but she thought she was homelier still she was terrified of physical contact with men and the blue wool stockings and blouse buttoned to the neck were the least of her defenses if i had to be in loveand at that age maybe i didi could choose among nine married women jill was certainly the prettiest of the lot pug nose brown hair chopped off short green eyes and a compact muscular shape very much the shape of a woman she liked to talk and i liked to listen she and ty had stars in their eyes their talk was full of what space would do for mankind jill was an exfromate shed been an officer in the friends of man and the earth but while the fromates down below were running around sabotaging industries and arcologies and nuclear plants and anything else they didnt like jill went to space her heart bled no less than any for the baby fur seals and the threespined stickleback and all the fish killed by mine tailings but shed thought of something to do about it all well put all the dirty industries into space she told me throw the pollution into the solar wind and let it go out to the cometary halo the fromates think they can talk everyone into letting kansas go back to buffalo grass you cant make people want to be poor ty put in right if we want to clean up the earth and save the wild things well have to give people a way to get rich without harming the environment this is it someday well send down enough power from space that we can tear down the dams and put the snail darter back where he caine from and more jill tended to do most of the talking i wondered about ty he always seemed to have the words that would set her off again and one day when we were clustered around mcleves house with for a few restful hours nothing to do and jill was well out of earshot flying awundand among the chickens in her wonderfully graceful wingstyle ty said to me i dont care if we turn the earth into a park i like space i like flying and i like free fall and the look of stars with no air to cloud them but dont tell jill i learned fast with ty in charge of engineering mcleve as chief administrator and dot hoffmans computers to simulate the construction and point up problems before they arose the project went well we didnt get enough mass from the moon so that my smelter was always short of raw materials and congress didnt give us enough money there werent enough flights from down below and we were short of personnel and goods from earth but we got along two hundred and forty thousand miles below useverything was going to hell first the senior senator from wisconsin lived long enough to inherit a powerful committee chairmanship and hed been against the space industries from the start instead of money we got golden fleece awards funds already appropriated for flights wed counted on got sliced and our future budgets were completely in doubt next the administration tried to bail itself out of the tax revolt by running the printing presses what money we could get appropriated wasnt worth half as much by the time we got it moonbase felt the pinch and cut down even more on the rock they flung out our way tys answer was to work harder get as much of the shack finished as we could so that we could start sending down power get it done he told us nightly get a lot of it finished get so much done that even those idiots will see that were worth it so much that itll cost them less to supply us than to bring us home he worked himself harder than anyone else and jill was right out there with him the first task was to get the mirrors operating we blew them all at once over a couple of months they came in the shuttle that should have brought our additional crew it wasnt much of a choice and wed have to put off balancing out the sex ratio for another six months the mirrors were packages of fabric as thin as the cellophane on a package of cigarettes we inflated them into great spheres sprayed foam plastic on the outside for struts and sprayed silver vapor inside where it would precipitate in a thin layer all over then we cut them apart to get spherical mirrors and sliced a couple of those into wedges to mount behind the windows in the floor of the shack they reflected sunlight in for additional crops jill had her crew out planting more wheat to cut down on the supplies wed need from earth another of the mirrors was my concern a hemisphere a quarter of a kilometer across can focus a lot of sunlight onto a small point put a rock at that point and it melts fast when we got that set up we were all frantically busy smelting iron for construction out of the rocks moonbase shipped up when they could when moonbase couldnt fling us anything we dismounted rock wed placed for shielding smelted it and plastered the slag back onto the sphere days got longer and longer theres no day or night aboard the shack anyway of course open the mirrors and you have sunlight close them and you dont still habit dies hard and wekept track of time by days and weeks but our work schedulcs bore no relation to them sometimes we worked the clock around quitting only when forced to by sheer exhaustion we got a shipment from moonbase and in the middle of the refining process the mounting struts in the big meter mirror got out of alignment naturally ty was out to work on it he was inspecting the system by flying around with a reaction pistol the rule was that no one worked without a safety line a man who drifted away from the shack might or might not be rescued and the rescue itself would cost time and manpower we didnt have tys line kept pulling him up short of where he wanted to go he gave the free end to jill and told her to pay out a lot of slack then he made a jump from the mirror frame he must have thought hed use the reaction pistol to shove him off at an angle so that hed cross over the bowl of the mirror the other side the pistol ran out of gas that left ty floating straight toward the focus of the miner he shouted into his helmet radio and jill franticallyhauled in slack trying to get a purchase on him i made a quick calculation and knew i would ever reach him in time if i tried id likely end up in the focus myself instead i took a dive across his back path if i could grab his safety line the jerk as i pulled up short ought to keep him out of the hottest area and my reaction pistol would take us back to the edge i got the line all right but it was slack it had burned through ty went right through the hot point when we recovered his body metal parts on his suit had melted we scattered his ashes inside the sphere mcleves navy prayer buok opened the burial service with the words we brought nothing into this world and it is certain that we shall take nothing out afterwards i wondered how subtle mcleve had been in his choice of that passage we had built this world ourselves with ty leading us we had brought everything into this world even down to tys final gift to us the ashes which would grow grass in a place no human had ever thought to reach until now for time next month we did without him and it was as if we had lost half our men mcleve was a good engineer if a better administrator but he couldnt go into the high gravity areas and he couldnt do active construction work still it wasnt engineering talent we lacked it was tys drive jill and dot and mcleve tried to make up for that they were more committed to the project than ever two hundred and forty thousand miles down they were looking for a construction boss theyd find one we were sure we were thebest and we were paid like the best there was never a problem with salaries salaries were negligible next to the other costs of building the shack but the personnel shuttles were delayed and delayed again and we were running out of necessities and the us economy was slipping again we got the mirrors arrayed jill went heavily into agriculture and the lunar soil bloomed seeded with earthworms and bacteria from earthly soil we smelted more of the rocky crust around the shack and put it back as slag we had plans for the metal we extracted starting with a lab for growingmetal whiskers there was already a whisker lab in nearearth orbit but its output was tiny the shack might survive if we could show even the beginnings of a profitmaking enterprise jill had another plan mass production of expensive blologicals enzymes and various starting organics for ethical drugs we had lots of plans what we didnt have was enough people to do it all you can only work so many twentyhour days we began to make mistakes some were costly my error didnt cost the shack only myself i like to think it was due tomtigue and nothing more i made a try at comforting the grieving widow after a decent wait of three weeks when ty was alive everyone flirtedwith jill she pretended not to notice youd have to be crude as well as rude before shed react this time it was different i may not have been very subtle but i wasnt crude and she told me instantly to get the hell out of her cabin and leave her alone i went back to my refinery mirror and brooded ninety years later i know better ninety years is too damned late if id noticed nothing else i should have known that nearly eighty unmarried men aboard would all be willing to comfort the grieving widow and half of them were only too willing to use the subtle approach youre all that keeps us working so hard i wonder who tried before i did it hardly matters when my turn came jills reaction was automatic slap him down before its too late for him to back away and when she slapped me down i stayed slapped more hurt than mad but less than willing to tiy again i hadnt stopped being in love with her so i worked at being her friend again it wasnt easy jill was cold inside when she talked to people it was about business never herself her dedication to the shack and to all it stood for in her mind was hardening ossifying and she spent a lot of time with dot hoffman and admiral mcleve but the word came another shuttle again there were no women the senator from wisconson had found out how expensive it would be to get us home add fifty women and it would be half again as expensive so no new personnel still they couldnt stop the company from sending up a new chief engineer and we heard theshuffle was on its way with a load of seeds liquid hydrogen vitamin pills and jack halley i couldnt believe it jack wasnt the type to begin with while the salary you could save in five years amounted to a good sum enough to let you start a business and still have some income left it wasnt wealth you couldnt live the rest of your life in rio on it and i was pretty sure jacks goals hadnt changed but there he was the new boss from the first day he arrived things started humming it was the old jack brilliant always at work and always insisting everyone try to keep up with him although no one ever could he worked our arses off in two months he had us caught up on the time we lost after ty was killed things looked good they looked damned good with the mirrors mounted we could operate on sunlight with spare power for other uses life from soil imported from earth spread throughout the soil imported from the moon and earthly plants were in love with the chemicals in lunar soil we planted strawberries corn and beans together we planted squashes and melons in lowgravity areas and watched them grow into jungles of thin vines covered with fruit the smelter worked overtime and we had moie than enough metals for the whisker lab and biological vats if only a shuttle would bring us the pumps and electronics we needed and if necessary wed make pumps in the machine shops and jack had dot working out time details of setting up integratedcireult manufacture but the betterthings looked in space the worse they looked on earth one of the ways we were going to make space colonies pay for themselves was through electricity we put out big arrays of solar cells monstrous spiderwebs a kilometer long by half that wide so large that they needed small engines dotted all over them just to keep them oriented properly toward the sun we made the solar cells ourselves one of the reasons they needed me was to get out the rare metals from the lunar regotith and save them for the solarcell factory and it was working we had the structure and we were making the cells soon уnough wed have enormous power megawatts of power enough to beam it down to earth where it couldpay back some of the costs of building the system the orbiting power stations cost a fortune to put up but not much to maintain they would be like dams big front end costs but then nearly free power forever we were sure that would save us how could the united states turn down free electricity it looked good until the fromates blew up the desert antenna that we would have been beaming the power down to and the lawyers got their reconstruction tied into legal knots that would probably take five years to untangle the senator from wisconsin continued his crusade this time we got three golden fleece awards down on earth the company nominated him for membership in the flat earth society he gleefully accepted and cut our budget again we also had problems on board jack had started mean it was obvious he had never wanted to come here in the first place now he turned mean as a rattlesnake he worked us if we could get the whisker lab finished ahead of time at lower cost than planned then maybe we could save the station yet so he pushed and pushed again and one day he pushed too hard it wasnt a mutiny it wasnt even a strike we all did a days work but suddenly without as far as i know any discussion among us nobody would put in overtime ten hours a day yes ten hours and one minute no jill pleaded the admiral got coldly formal dot cried jack screamed we cut work to nine and a half hours and then it all changed one day jack halfey was smiling a lot he turned polite he was getting his two or three hours sleep a night dot described him like mrs fezziwig she said one vast substantial smile i hope shes happy i wonder why she did it to save the shack she was trying to keep her voice cheerful buther look was bitter dot wasnt naive just terrified i suppose that to her the only reason a woman would move in with a man would be to save some noble cause like the shack as to jill she didnt change much the shack was the first step in the conquest of the universe and it was by god going to be finished and selfsufficient partly it was a memorial to ty i think but she really believed in what she was doing and it was infectious i could see how jack could convince her that he shared her goal to a great extent he did although it was pure selfishness his considerable reputation was riding on this project but jack never did anything halfheartedly he drove himself at whatever be was doing what i couldnt understand was why he was here at all he must have known how thin were the chances of completing the shack before he left earth i had to know before it drove me nuts jack didnt drink much when he did it was often a disaster because he was the worlds cheapest drunk so one night i plied him night is generally relative of course but thisone was real the earth got between us and the sun since we were on the same orbit as the moon but sixty degrees ahead that happened to us exactly as often as there are eclipses of the moon on earth a rare occasion one worth celebrating of course wed putin a days work first so the party didnt last long we were all too beat still it was a start and when the formalities broke up and jill went off to look at the air system i grabbed jack and got him over to my quarters we both collapsed in exhaustion i had brought a yeast culture with me from canaveral mcleve had warned me that liquor cost like diamonds up here and a way to make my own alcohol seemed a good investment and it was by now i had vaccum distilled vodka made from fermented fruit bars and a mash of strawberries from the farm they werent missed the farm covered a quarter of the inner surface now my concoction tasted better than it sounds and it wasnt hard to talk jack into a drink then another presently he was trying to sing the verses to the green hills of earth a mellower man you never saw i seized my chance so you love the green hills of earth so much what are you doing here change your mind about rio jack shook his head the vibration ran down his arm and sloshed his drink nope outside a hen cackled and jack collapsed in laughter let me rest my eyes on the fleecy skies grimly i stuck to the subject i thought you were all set with that tucson arcology oh i was i was indeed it was a beautiful setup lots of pay and he stopped abruptly and other opportunities i was beginning to see the light welll yes you have to see it the way i did first it was a great opportunity to make a name for myself a city in a building residential and business and industry all in the same place one building to house a quarter of a million people and it would have been beauliful corky the plans were magnificent i was in love with it then i got into it and i saw what was really going on corky everyone was stealing that place blind the first week i went to the chief engineer to report shortages in deliveries and he just looked at me stick to your own work halfey says he chief engineer the architects construction bosses even the catering crewevery one of them was knocking down twentyfive fifty percent they were selling the cement right off the boxcars and substituting sand there wasnt enough cement in that concrete to hold up the walls so you took your share dont get holy on me dammit look at it my way i was willing to play square but they wouldnt let me the place was going to fall down the weight of the first fifty thousand people would have done it what i could do was make sure nobody got inside before it happened jack halfey chortled im a public benefactor i am i sold off the reinforcing rods the inspectors couldnt possibly ignore that nothing else i asked welll those rods were metalwhisker compote almost as strong as diamond and almost as expensive i didnt need anything else rut i made sure theyd never open that place to the public then i stashed my illgotten gains and went underground and waited for something to happen i never heard much about it of course i wouldnt up here not many down there heard either hush hush while the fbi looked into it the best buy i ever made in my life was a subscription to the wall sireet journal just a paragraph about how the racket squad was investigating mafia involvement in the tucson arvology thats when things fell into place i swung around to refill his glass carefully we use great big glasses and never fill them more than half full otherwise they slosh all over the place in the low gravity i had another myself it was pretty good vodka and if i felt it jack must be pickled blue you mean the building fell in no no i realized why there was so much graft jack sounded aggrieved there was supposed to be graft i wasnt supposed to get in on it aha aha you know it i finished reading that article on a plane to canaveral the fbi couldnt follow me to rio but the mafia sure could id heard there was a new opening for chief engineer for the construction shack and all of a sudden the post looked very very good he chuckled also i hear that things are tightening up in the usa big crackdown on organized crime computer assisted income tax boys and racket squad working together it shouldnt be long before all the chiefs who want my arse are in jail then i can go back cash my stash and head for rio switzerland oh no nothing so simple as that i thought of something else say i better get back to my bunk he staggered out before i could stop him fortunately it was walking distance from my place to his if hed had to fly hed probably have ended up roosting with the chickens bloody hell says i to myself should i add that i had no intention of robbing jack i was just curious what inflationproof investment had he thought up but i didnt find out for a long time a month later the dollar collapsed inflation had been a fact of life for so long that it was the goal of every union and civil service organizer to get inflation written into their contracts thereby increasing inflation the govemment printed money faster to compensate more inflation one of those vicious spirals almost suddenly the dollar was down the drain there followed a fullscale taxpayer revolt the administration got the message they were spending too much money and clearly that had to stop the first things to go were all the projects that wouldnt pay off during the current presidents term of office long term research was chopped out of existence welfare on the other hand was increased and a comprehensive national health plan was put into effect even though they had to pay the doctors and hospitals in promissory notes the senator from wisconsin didnt even bother giving us his customary golden fleece award why insult the walking dead we met in our usual place a cagework not far from the northpole admiral meleve was in the center in zero gravity the rest of us perched about the cagework looking like a scene from hitchcocks the birds dot had a different picture from aristophanes somewhere what with all these clouds and all this air there must be a rare name somewhere how do you like cloudcuckoo land putting on wings does things to people halfey had dyed his wings scarlet marked with yellow triangles enclosing an h dot wore the plumage of an eagle and i hadnt believed it the fast time i saw it it was an incredibly detailed beautiful job mcleves were the wings of a bat andi tell you he looked frightening as evil as dracula himself leon briscoe the chemist had painted mathematical formulae all over his in exquisite medieval calligraphy jill and ty had worn the plumage of male and female least terns and she still wore hers there were no two sets of wings alike in that flock we were ninety birds of mnety species all gathered as if the ancient roles of predator and prey had been set aside for a larger cause cloudcuckooland a glum cloudcuckooland its over mcleve said weve been given three months to phase out and go home us moonbase the whole space operation theyll try to keep some of the nearearth operations going a while longer but were to shut down nobody said anything at first wed been expecting it those of us whod had time to follow news from earth now it was here and nobody was ready i thought about it back to high gravity again painful and jill her dream was being shot dшwn ty died for nothing then i remembered mcleve he wasnt going anywhere any gravity at all was a death sentence and i hated jack halfey for the grin he was hiding there had been a long piece in the latest newscast about the roundup of the mafia lords grand juries working overtime and the district of columbia jail filled no bail to be granted it was safe for jack down there and now he could go home early they cant do this to us jill wailed a leftover fromate reflex i guess well go on strike bomb something she looked around at our faces and when i followed the look i stopped with dot hoffman the potato face was withered in anguish the potato eyes were crying what was there for dot on earth what a downer she said i almost laughed out loud the old word was so inadequate then mcleve spoke in rage downers yes nine billion downers sitting on their fat arses while their childrens future slides into the muck downers is what they are now you know mclcve the wordsmith invented that word on that day my own feelings were mixed would the money stashed in swiss francs be paid if we left early even though we had to leave probably and it was not a small amount but how long would it last there was no job waiting for me but certainly i had the reputation id set out for i shouldnt have much trouble getting a job but i like to finish what i start the shack was that close to being selfsufficient we had the solar power grids working we even had the ion engines mounted all over the grid to keep it stable we djdn t have the microwave system to beam the power back to earth but it wouldnt be that expensive to put in except that earth had no antennae to receive the power they hadnt even started reconstruction the permit hearings were tied up in lawsuits no the shack was dead and if our dollars were worthless there were things that werent skilled labor couldnt be worthless i would get my francs and some of my dollar salary had been put into gold i wouldnt be broke andthe clincher there were women on earth mcleve let us talk a while when the babble died down and he found a quiet lull he said very carefully of course we have a chance to keep the station going everyone talked at once jills voice came through loudest how the shack was designed to be a selfsufficient environment mcleve said its not quite that yet but what do we need air someone shouted water cried another i said shielding it would help to have enough mass to get us through a big solar flare if theyre shutting down moonbase well never have it jills voice carried like a microphone rocks is that all we need ice and rocks wed have both in the asteroid belt it was a putup job she and mcleve must have rehearsed it i laughed the belt is two hundred million miles away we dont have ships that will go that far let alone cargo ships and then i saw what they had in mind only one ship meleve said the shack itself we can move it out into the belt how long dot demanded hope momentarily made her beautiful three years mcleve said he looked thoughtful well not quite that long we cant live three years i shouted i turned to jill twsting idiot that i was then the air system cant keep us alive that long can it not enough chemicals but we can do it she shouted it wont be easy but the farm is growing now we have enough plants to make up tbr the lack of chemical air purification we can recycle everything weve got the raw sunlight of space even out in the asteroids that will be enough we can do it cant hurt to make a few plans mcleve said it couldnt help either thought i but i couldnt say it not to dot and jill these four were the final architects of the plan admiral mcleve jill plauger dot hoffman and jack halfey at first the most important was dot moving something as large as the shack with inadequate engines a house in space never designed as a ship that was bad enough moving it farther than any manned ship no matter the design should have been impossible but behind that potato face was a brain tuned to mathematics she could solve any abstract problem she knew how to ask questions and her rapport with computers was a thing to envy personal problems stopped her cold because mcleve was one of the few men she could see as harmless she could open up to him he had told me sometime before we lost ty dot tried sex once and didnt like it i think he regretted saying even that much secrets were sacred to him but for whatever reason dot couldnt relate to people and that left all her energy for work dot didnt talk to women either through fear or envy or some other reason i never knew but she did talk to jill they were fanatical in the same way it wasnt hard to understand dots enthusiasm for the plan mcleve had no choices at all without the shack he was a dead man jack was in the big four because he was needed without his skills there would be no chance at all so he was dragged into it and we watched it happen the day mcleve suggested going to the asteroids jack halfey was thoroughly amused and showed his mirth to all for the next week he was not amused by anything whatever he was a walking temper tantrum so was jill i expect he tried to convince her that with sufficient wealth exile on earth could be tolerable now he wasnt sleeping and we all suffered of course our miseries including jacks were only ternporary we were all going home all of us thus we followed the downer news closely and thus was there a long line at the communications room everyone was trying to find an earthside job it hardly mattered there was plenty of power for communications it doesnt take much juice to close down a colony we had no paper so the news was flashed onto a tv for the edification of those waiting to use the transmitter i was waiting for word from inco they had jobs at their new smelter in guatemala not the worlds best location but i was told it was a tropical paradise and the quetzal was worth at least as much as the dollar i dont know who jack was expecting to hear from he looked like a man with a permanent hangover except that he wasnt so cheerful the news for a change wasnt all bad something for everyone the united states had issued a new currency called marks they were backed by miniscule amounts of gold not everyone was poor technology proceeded apace texas instruments announced a new pocket computer a million bits of memory and fully programmable for twice what a calculator cost firestone diamondswhich had been manufacturing flawless bluewhite diamonds in a laboratory for the past year and which actually was owned by a man named firestone had apparently swamped the engagement ring market and was now making chandeliers a diamond chandelier would cost half a years salary of course but that was expected to go down the alleged mafia chieftains now held without bail awaiting trial numbered in the thousands i was surprised i hadnt thought it would go that far when the dollar went worthless apparently mafia bribe money went worthless too maybe im too cynical maybe there was an epidemic of righteous wrath in government evidently someone thought so because a bond issue was approved in california and people were beginning to pay their taxes again something for everyone i thought the mafia item would cheer jack up but he was sitting there staring at the screen as if he hadnt seen a thing and didnt give a damn anyway my call was announced and i went in to talk to inco when i came out jack had left not even waiting for his own call lack of sleep can do terrible things to a man i wasntsurprised when jack had a long talk with mcleve nor when jill moved hack in with him jack would promise anything and jill would believe anything favorable to her mad scheme the next day jacks smile was back and ill thought it was a bit cynical what could i do tell jill she wouldnt have believed me anyway they unveiled the plan a week later i was invited to mcleves house to hear all about it jack was there spouting enthusiasm two problems he told us first keeping us alive during the trip thats more jills department but whats the problem the shack was designed to last centuries second problem is getting out there weve got that figured out i said the hell you do this isnt a spaceship its just a habitat even if you had a big rocket motor to mount on the axis you wouldnt have fuel for it and if you did the shack would break up under the thrust i hated him for what he was doing to jill and i wondered why mcleve wasnt aware of it maybe he was the admiral never let anyone know what he thought so we dont mount a big rocket motor jack said what weve got is just what we need a lot of little motors on the solar panels we use those and everything else weiave scooters and tugs the spare panel engines and last but not least the moon were going to use the moon for a gravity sling he had it all diagrammed out in four colors we shove the shack toward the moon if we aim just right well skim close to the lunar surface with everything firing well leave the moon with that velocity plus the moons orbital velocity and out we go how close he looked to dot she pursed her lips well clear the peaks by two kilometers thats close more than a mile jack said the closer we come the faster we leave but you just dont have the thrust almost enough jack said now look we keep the panel thrusters on full blast that gives us about a quarter percent of a gravity not nearly enough to break up the shack corky and we use the mirrors he poked buttons and another diagram swam onto mcleves drafting table see it showed the shack with the window mirrors opened all the way for maximum surface area my smelter minor was hung out forward other mirrors had been added sails light pressure adds more thrust not a lot but enough to justify carrying their mass we can get to the belt youre crazy i informed them probably mcleve muttered but from my viewpoint it looks good sure youre dead anyway no offense intended were playing a game here and its getting us nowhere im going jills voice was very low and very convincing it stined the hair on my neck me too dot added she glared at me the enemy i made one more try theyd had more time to think about it than i did but the thrust figures were right there scrawled in an upper corner of the dingram now pay attention you cant possibly use the attitude jets on the solar panels for that long they work by squirting dust through a magnetic field throwing it backward so the reaction pushes you forward okay youve got free solar power and you can get the acceleration but where can you possibly get enough dust i saw jacks guilty grin and finished holy shit jack nodded happily why not jill asked we wont need solar flare shielding around ceres on the way we can keep what we do have between us and the sun while we grind up the surplus they meant it they were going to make dust out of the radiation shields and use that in theory it would work the panel engines didnt care what was put through them they merely charged the stuff up with electricity gathered from the solar cells and let the static charge provide the push a rocket is nothing more than a way to squirt mass overboard any mass will do the faster you can throw mass away the better your rocket at its simplest a rocket could be a man sitting in a bucket throwing rocks out behind him since a man cant throw very fast that wouldnt be a very good rocket but it would work but you have to have rocks and they were planning on using just about all of ours it was a oneway mission theyd have to find an asteroid and fast when they got to the belt by the time they arrived theyd be grinding up structure literally taking the shack apart and all that would have to be replaced it would have to be a special rock one that had lots of metal and also had ice this wasnt impossible but it wasnt any sure thing either we knew from pioneer probes that some of the asteroids had strata of water ice and various organics as well but we couldnt tell which ones we knew one more thing from the later probes and the plan was geared to take advantage of that the skylarknewly named by mcleve and ive never known why he called it thatwould head for ceres there were at least three small hillsized objects orbitting that biggest of the asteroids a big solar flare while they were out that far would probably kill the lot of them oh they had a safety hole designed a small area ofthe shack to huddle inside crowded together like sardines and if the flare didnt last too long theyd be all right except that it would kill many of the plants needed for the air supply i didnt think the air recycling system would last any three years either but jill insisted it was all right it didnt matter i wasnt going and neither was jack it was just something to keep jill happy until the shuttle came there was more to the plan all the nonessential personnel would go to moonbase where there was a better chance solar flares werent dangerous to them moonbase was buried under twenty feet of lunar rock and dust they had lots of mass there a oxygen chemically bound in lunar rock and if you have enough power and some hydrogen you can bake it out they had power big solar mirrors not as big as ours but big they had rocks the hydrogen recycles if its air you want if you want water the hydrogen has to stay in the water we figured they could hang on for five years our problem was different if moonbase put all its effort into survival they wouldnt have the resources to keep sending us rocks and metal and hydrogen hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but its rare an the moon without hydrogen you dont have water without water you dont have life i had to admit things were close we were down to a shuttle load a month from earth but we needed those they brought hydrogen vitamins highprotein foods we could grow crops but that took water and our recycling systems were nowhere near efficient now the hydrogen shipments had stopped at a cost of fifty million dollars a flight before the dollar collapsed the usa would soon stop sending us ships another thing about those ships they had stopped bringing usreplacement crew long ago jack was the last now they were taking people home if they stopped coining wed be marooned a few more years and we could be selfsufficient a few more years and we could have colonists people who never intended to go home they were aboard now some of them jill and ty before ty was killed dot hoffman was permanent so was mcleve of course of the seventyfive still aboard wed lost a few to the shuttlestwentyfive or so including all the married couples thought of themselves as colonists the rest of us wanted to go home canaveral gave us fifty days to wind up our affairs the shuttles would come up empty but for the pilots with a kind of sardinecanwithseats fitted in the hold i could understand why mcleve kept working on the plan earth would kill him and jill tys death had no meaning if the shack wasnt finished dot sure she was valuable here but would you believe that i worked myself stupid mounting mirrors and solar panel motors it wasnt just for something to do before the shuttle arrived either i had a nightmare living in my mind mcleve was counting on about twenty crew the big four and six of the eight married couples and up to half a dozen additional men all held by their faith in the plan the history books have one thing right the plan was jack halfeys sure jill and mcleve and dot worked on it but without him it couldnt be brought off half of the plan was no more than a series of contingency operations halffinished schemes that relied on halfeys ingenuity to work mcleve and halfey were the only people aboard who really knew the shackknew all its parts and vulnerabilities what might go wrong and how to fix it and mcleve couldnt do much physical work he wouldnt be outside working when something buckled under the stress and there would be stress a hundredth of a gravity doesnt sound heavy but much of our solar panel area and all our mirrors were flimsy as tissue paper without halfey it wouldnt couldnt work when halfey announced that he was going home on that final shuttle the rest would quit too theyd beg the downers for one more shuttle and theyd get it of course and theyd hold the shack until it came but mcleve couldnt quit and dot wouldnt and i just couldnt be sure about jill if halfey told her be wasnt really going would she see reason the son of a bitch was trading her life for a couple of hours sleep when skylark broke from orbit would she be aboard she and dot and the admiral all alone in that vast landscaped bubble with a growing horde of chickens going out to the asteroids to die the life support system might last a long time with only three humans to support they might live for years he nodded without halfey it is a mad scheme i wouldnt sacrifice the others for my heart condition but halfey isnt leaving corky hes with us all the way i wish youd give it a try too we need you not me so i worked when they finally died it wouldnt be because cornelius riggs bobbled a weld the first shuttle came and picked up all nonessential personnel theyd land at moonbase which was the final staging area for taking everyone home if the plan went off as mcleve expected many of them would be staying on the moon but they didnt have to decide that yet i was classed as essential though id made my intentions clear theplan needed me not so much on the trip out but when they reached the belt theyd have to do a lot of mining and refining assuming they could find the right rock to mine and refine i let them talk me into waiting for the last shuttle i wouldnt have stayed if i hadn t known halfeys intentions and i confess to a squinny feeling in my guts when i watched that shuttle go off without me the next one would be for keeps when you have a moral dilemma get drunk its not the worlds best rule but it is an old one the persians used the technique in classical times i tried it presently i found myself at meleves home he was alonei invited myself in murdering bastard i said how jill that crazy plan wont work halfey isnt even going you know it and i know it hes putting jill on so she wont cut him off and without him theres not even a prayer your second parts true mcleve said but not the first halfey is going why would he mcleve smirked hes going what happens if he doesnt i demanded what then i stay mcleve said id rather die here than in a ship alone how was halfey convincing them not jill she wanted to believe in him but mcleve and dotdot had to know she had to calculate the shuttle flight plan and for that she had to know the masses and the total payload mass for that shuttle had to equal all the personnel except mcleve but including the others something didnt make any sense i waited until i saw eagle wings and blue wool stockings fly away from the administration area and went into her computer room it took a while to bring up the system but the files directory was selfexplanatory i tried to find the shuttle flight plan but i couldnt what i got through sheer fumbling was the updated flight plan for the skylark even with my hangover i could see what shed done it was figured for thirtyone people plus a mass that had to be the shuttle skylark would be carrying a captains gig the shuttle was coming in five days halfey had to know that shuttle wouldnt be taking anyone back if he wasnt doing anything about it there was only one conclusion he was going to the belt a mad scheme it doomed all of us jill myself halfey myself but if halfey didnt go no one would wed all go home in that shuttle jill would be saved so would i there was only one conclusion to that i had to kill jack halfey how i couldnt just shoot him there wasnt anything to shoot him with i thought of ways put a projectile into a reaction pistol but what then space murder would delight the lawyers and i might even get off but id lose jill forever and without halfey gimmick his suit he went outside regularly accidents happen ty wasnt the only one whose ashes wed scattered into the soil of the colony stethoscope and wrench stethoscope to listen outside the walls of halfeys bed chamber a thoroughly frustrating and demeaning experience but presently i knew theyd both be asleep for an hour or more it took ten minutes to disassemble jacks hose connector and substitute a new one id made up my replacement looked just like the old one but it wouldnt hold much pressure defective part metal fatigue id be the one theyd have examine the connector if there was any inquiry at all and i had no obvious motive for killing jack just the opposite except for jill and mcleve i was regarded as jacks only friend once that was done i had only to wait the shuttle arrived empty halfey went outside all right but in a sealed cherry picker he wasnt exposed to vacuum for more than a few moments and apparently id made my substitute just strong enough to hold they docked the shuttle but not in the usual place and they braced it in it was time for a mutiny i wasnt the only one being shanghaied on this trip i went looking for halfey first though id need a reaction pistol and a projectile a ballpoint pen ought to do nicely any court in the world would call it self defense im a public benefactor i am i muttered to myself jills quarters were near the store room when i came with the pistol she saw me hi she said hi i started to go on you never talk to me any more lets say i got your message that was a long time ago i was upset so were you its different now different sure i was bitter and i sounded it different youve got that lying bastard halfey to console you thats how its different that hurt her and i was glad of it we need him corky we all need him and we always did we wouldnt have got much done without him true enough and he was driving all of you nuts wasnt he until i helped him sleep i thought you were in love with him she looked sad i like him but no im not in love with him she was standing in the doorway of her quarters this isnt going to work is it the plan not enough of you will come we cant do it can we no might as well tell her the truth it never would have worked and it wont work now even if all of us aboard come along margins too thin jill i wish it would but no i suppose youre right but im going to try anyway youll kill yourself she shrugged why not whats left anyway she went back into her room i followed youve got a lot to live for think of the baby fur seals you could save and theres always me you ive been in love with you since the first time i saw you she shook her head sadly poor corky and i treated you just like all the others back then when i wish youd stay with us i wish youd come back to earth with me or even moonbase we might make a go of moonbase hang on until things change down there new administration maybe theyll want a space program and moonbase would be a good start ill stay at moonbase if youll come will you she looked puzzled and scared and i wanted take and hold her lets talk about it want a drink no thank you i do she poured herself something sure you wont join me all right she handed me something cold full of shaved ice it tasted like tang we began to talk about life on earthor even on moonbase she mixed us more thinks tang powder and water from a pitcher and vodka and shaved ice presently i felt good damned good one thing led to another and i was holding her kissing her whispering to her she broke free and went over to close and lock her door as she came back toward me she was unbuttoning the top of her blouse and i passed out when i woke i didnt know now ninety years later i still dont for ninety years it has driven me nuts and now ill never know all thats certain is that i woke half dressed alone in her bed and her clothes were scattered on the deck i had athundering hangover and an urgent thirst i drank from the water pitcher on her table it wasnt water it must have been my own proof vodka next to it was a jar of tang and a bowl that had held shaved iceand a bottle holding more vodka shed been feeding me vodka and tang and shaved ice no wonder i had a hangover worthy of being bronzed as a record i went outside there was something wrong the streams werent running correctly they stood at an angle at first i thought it was me then they sloshed the shack was under acceleration there were a dozen others screaming for blood outside the operations building one was a strangerthe shuttle pilot the door was locked and halfey was talking through a loudspeaker too late he was saying we dont have enough thrust to get back to the l point were headed for the belt and you might as well get used to the idea were going there was a cheer not everyone hated the idea eventually those who did understood halfey had drained the shuttle fuel and stored it somewhere no escape that way no other shuttles in lunar orbit nothing closer than canaveral which was daysaway even if there were anything ready to launch nothing was going to match orbits with us we were headed for the moon and wed whip around and go for the belt and that was as inevitable as the tides when we understood all that they unlocked the doors an hour later the alarms sounded outside suit up emergency outside mcleves voice announced those already in their suits went for the airlocks i began halfheartedly putting on mine in no hurry i was sure id never get my swollen pulsing head inside the helmet jack halfey dashed past suited and ready he dove for the airlock halfey the indispensible man with a defective connector for an air intake i fumbled with the fasteners one of the construction people was nearby and i got his help he couldnt understand my frantic haste bastards kidnapped us he muttered let them do the frigging work not me i didnt want to argue with him i just wanted him to hurry a strut had given way and a section of the solar panel was off center it had to be straightened and we couldnt turn off the thrust while we did it true our total thrust was tiny a quarter of a percent of a gravity hardly enough to notice but we needed it all because otherwise wed go out toward the belt but we wouldnt get there and by the time the shackskylark now returned inevitably to earth orbit thered be no one alive aboard her i noticed all the work but i didnt help someone cursed me but i went on looking for halfey i saw him i dove for him neglecting safety lines forgetting everything i had to get to him before that connector went his suit blew open across the middle as if the fabric had been weakened with say acid jack screamed and tried to hold himself together he had no safety line either when he let go he came loose from the spiderweb skylark pulled away from him slowly two and a half centimeters per second slow but inexorable i lit where hed been turned and dove for him i got him and used my reaction pistol to drive us toward the airlock i left it on too long we were headed fast for the airlock entrance too fast wed hit too hard i tumbled about to get jack across my back so that id be between him and the impact id probably break a leg but without halfey i might as well have a broken neck and get it over with leon briscoe our chemist had the same idea he got under us and braced reaction pistol flaring behind us we hit in a menage a trois with me as lucky pierre leon cracked an ankle i ignored him as i threw halfey into the airlock and slammed it shut hit the recycle switch air hissed in jack had a nosebleed and his cough sounded bad but he was breathing hed been in vacuum about forty seconds fortunately the decompression hadnt been totally explosive the intake line to his suit had fractured a half second before the fabric blew the moon grew in the scopes grew and kept growing until it wasnt a sphere but a circle and still it grew there were mountains dead ahead how close i demanded dot had her eyes glued to a radar scope not too close about a kilometer a kilometer one thousand meters you said two before so i forgot the shuttle pilot she continued to stare at the scope then her fingers bashed at the console keyboard make that meters she said absently i was past saying anything i watched the moon grow and grow terror banished the last of my hangover amazing what adrenalin in massive doses can do jill looked worse than i did and i didnt know were we lovers thirty seconds to periastron dot said how close mcleve asked five hundred meters make that fourfifty good mcleve muttered closer the better he was right the nearer we came to the moon the more slingshot velocity wed pick up and the faster wed get co the belt periastron dot announced closest approach four twentythree and a fraction she looked up in satisfaction potato eyes smiled were on our way on earth we were heroes wed captured the downers imaginations intrepid explorers before we were out of range we got a number of offers for book rights should we happen to survive there were even noises about hydrogen shipments to the moon of course there was nothing they could do for us there werent any ships designed for a threeyear trek certainly skylark wasnt but we were trying it there were solar flares we all huddled around mcleves house with as much of our livestock as we could catch stuffed into his bedroom it took weeks to clean it out properly afterward we had to reseed blighted areas and weed out mutated plants after each flare more of our recycled air was coming from the algae tanks now in a time of the quiet sun we swarmed outside and moved all of the mirrors the sun was too far away now and the grass was turning brown until we doubled the sunlight flooding through the windows but it seemed wed reach ceres already our telescopes showed five boulders in orbit around that largest of the asteroids wed look at them all but we wanted the smallest one we could find the least dauntifig challenge if it didnt have ice somewhere in irs makeup the next one would or the next and then wed all be working like sled dogs for our lives i was circling round the outside of skylark not working just observing looking for points with some stnictural strength places where i could put stress when the real work began win or lose with or without a cargo we would have to get home a tot faster than we came the life support system wouldnt hold up forever something would give out vitamins water something in the soil or the algae tanks something our idea was to build a mass driver a miniature of the machine that had been throwing rocks at us from the moon if we found copper in that rock abeada pinpoint to the naked eye now near the tiny battered disk of cereswe could make the kilometers of copper wire wed need if not iron would do we had power from the sun and dust from the rocks around ceres and wed send that dust down the mass driver at rocket exhaust speeds home in ten months if we found copper i went back inside the air had an odd smell when i took off my helmet we were used to it we never noticed now unless wed been breathing tanked air i made a mental note mention it to jill it was getting stronger i had only the helmet off when jean and kathy gaynor came to drag me out i was clumsy in my pressure suit and they thought that was hilarious theydanced me around and around pulled me out into the grass and began undressing me with the help of a dozen others it looked like i had missed half of a great party what the hell ceres was still a week away they took my pressure suit off and scattered the components and i didnt fight i was dizzy and had the giggles they kept going presently i was stark naked and grabbing for kathy who took to the air before i realised she had wings i came down in a stream and surfaced still giggling jack and jill were on their backs in the grass watching the fleecy white hens and turning occasionally to avoid chicken splat i liked seeing jill so relaxed for once she waved and i bounced over and somersaulted onto my back next to them a pair of winged people were way up near the axis flapping among the chickens scaring them into panic it was like looking into heaven as you find it painted on the ceilings of some of the european churches i couldnt tell who they were wealth comes in spirals too jill was saying in a dreamy voice i dont think shed noticed i wasnt wearing clothes well build bigger ships with the metal we bring home next trip well bring back the whole asteroid one day the downers will be getting all their metal from us and their whisker compotes and drugs and magnets and and freefall alloys dare i say it well own the world i said yeah there were puffball chickens drifting down the sky as if theyd forgotten how to fly there wont be anything we cant do corky can you see a mass driver wrapped all around the moon for launching starships the ships will go round and round well put the magmag netic levitation plates overhead tohold the ships down after theyre going too fast to stay down halfey said what about a hotel on titan excursions into saturns rings no downers allowed well spend our second honeymoon there said jill yeah i said before i caught myself halley laughed like hell no no i want to build it i was feeling drunk and i hadnt had a drink contact high they call it i watched those two at the axis as they came together in a tangle of wings clung together objects floated around them and presently began to spiral outward fluttering and tumbling i recognized a pair of mans pants it made me feel as horny as hell two hundred million miles away there was a planet with three billion adult women out of that number there must be millions whod take an astronaut hero to their beds especially after i published my bestselling memoirs id never be able to have them all but it was certainly worth a try all i had to do was go home hah and thomas wolfe thought he couldnt go home again a shoe smacked into a nearby roof and the whole house bonged we laughed hysterically something else hit almost beside my head a hen lay on her back in the wheat stunned and puzzled the spiral of clothing was dropping away from what now seemed a single creature with four wings a skinny blue snake wriggled out of the sky and touched down i held it up a tangle of blue wool my god i cried its dot jill rolled over and stared jack was kicking his heels in the grass helpless with laughter i shook my head i was still dizzy what have you all been drinking not that tang mixture again jill said drinking sure the whole colonys drunk as lords i said hey black wings is that meleve up there jill leapt to her feet oh my god she screamed the air jack bounded up and grabbed her arm whats happened she tried to pull away let me go its the air system its putting out alcohols not just ethanol either were all drunk and hypoxic let me go one moment jack was fighting it and losing in a niomerit hed collapse in silliness again you knew it was going to happen be said his voice was fuil of accusation yes jill shouted now will you let me go how did you know i knew before we started jill said recycling isnt efficient enough we need fresh water tons of fresh water if theres no ice on that rock ahead then we probably wont get to another rock jill said now will you let me go work on the system get out of here you bitch jack yelled he pushed her away and fell on his face it was scary but there was also the alcohol fear and anger and ethanol and higher ketones and god knows what else fought it out in my brain fear lost shes kept it going with kleenex and bubble gum i shouted and you believed her when she told you itd last three years you believed i whooped at the joke oh shut up jack shouted weve had it right i asked so tell me something why did you do it i was sure you were putting jill on i know you intended to go with the shuttle so why chandeliers jack said chandeliers you were there firestone gems will sell you flawless bluewhites a chandelier of them for the price of half a years salary and what the fuck do you think i did with my stash jack screamed stash his ill gotten gains from the mafia stashed as bluewhite diamonds funny funnee so why wasnt i laughing because the bastard had kidnapped me thats why when he found his stash was worthless and he wasnt rich and hed probably face a jail term he couldnt bribe his way out of hed run as far away as a man could go and taken me with him i craw led over to my doorway my suit lay there in a sprawl i fumbled through it to the equipment belt what are you doing halfey yelled youll see i found the reaction pistol i went through my pockets carefully until found a ballpoint pen hey no jack yelled im a public benefactor i am i told him i took aim and fired he tumbled backwards there are always people who want to revise history no hero is so great that someone wont take a shot at hint not even jack halfey fortunately i missed a teardrop falls two miles up the thick air of harvest thinned to earthnormal pressure the sky was a peculiar blue but blue it was unbreathable still but there was oxygen ten percent and growing one of the biological factories showed against white cloudscape to nice effect in view of a floating cainera the camera showed a tremendous rippling balloon in the shape of an inverted teardrop blowing green bubbles from its tip hilary gage watched the view with a sense of pride not that he would want to visit harvest ever multicolored slimes infected shallow tidal pools near the poles green sticky stuff floated in the primordial atmosphere if it drifted too low it burned to ash the planet was slimy changes were exceedingly slow mistakes took years to demonstrate themselves and decades to eradicate hilary gage preferred the outer moon one day this planet would be a workl even then hilary gage would not join the colonists hilary gage was a computer program gage would never have volunteered for the harvest project unless the alternative was death death by old age he was aware rumorfashion that other worlds were leery of advanced computers they were too much like the berserker machines but the tens of thousands of human worlds varied enormously among themselves and there were places the berserkers had never reached the extermination machines had been mere rumor in the channith region since before channith was settled nobody really doubted their existence but but for some purposes computers were indecently convenient and some projects required artificial intelligence the computer wasnt really an escape hilary gage must have died years ago perhaps his last thoughts had been of an immortal computer program the computer was not a new one its programming had included two previous personalities who had eventually changed their minds and asked that they be erased gage could understand that entertainments were in his files when he reached for them they were there beginning to end like vivid memories chess games could survive that and some poetry but what of a detective novel a football game a livey gage made his own entertainment he had not summoned up his poem for these past ten days he was surprised and pleased at his selfcontrol perhaps now he could study it with fresh eyes wrong the entire work blinked into his mind in an instant it was as if he had finished reading it a millisecond ago what was normally an asset to hilaryhis flawless memorywas a hindrance now over the years the poem had grown to the size of a small novel yet his computermind could apprehend its totality it was his lifes story his only shot at immortality it had unity and balance the rhyme and meter at least were flawless but did it have thrust reading it from start to finish was more difficult than he had ever expected he had to forget the totality which a normal reader would not immediately sense and proceed in linear fashion judge the flow no castrato ever sung so pure good but not here he exchanged it for a chunk of phrasing elsewhere no wordprocessor program had ever been this easy the altered emphasis caused him to fiddle further and his description of the berserkerblasted world perrys footprint seemed to read with more impact now days and years of fear and rage in his youth he had fought men channith needed to safeguard its sphere of influence aliens existed somewhere and berserkers existed somewhere but gage knew them only as rumor until the day he saw perrys footprint the free gaea rebels had done well to flee to perrys footprint to show him the work of the berserkers on a living world it was so difficult to conquer a world and so easy to destroy it afterward he could no longer fight men his superiors could have retired him instead he was promoted and set to investigating the defense of channith against the berserker machines they must have thought of it as makework an employment project it was almost like beinga tourist at government expense in nearly forty years he never saw a live an active berserker but traveling in realms where they were more than rumor perhaps he had learned too much about them they were all shapes all sizes here they traveled in time there they walked in human shape that sprouted suddenly into guns and knives machines could be destroyed but they could never be made afraid a day came when his own fear was everything he couldnt make decisions it was in the poem here wasnt it he couldnt feel it a poet should have glands he wasnt sure and he was afraid to meddle further mechanically it worked as poetry it might well be too mechanical maybe he could get someone to read it his chance might come unexpectedly soon in his peripheral awareness he sensed ripplings in the microwave background of space the bow shock of a spacecraft approaching in cplus from the direction of channith an unexpected supervisor from the homeworld hilary ified the altered poem and turned his attention to the signal too slow too strong too far mass at grams and a tremendous power source barely able to hold it in a cplusexcited state even in the nearflat space between stars it was lightyears distant days away at its tormented crawl but it occluded channiths star and gage found that horrifying berserker its signal code might be expressed as a flash of binary bits or as a moment of recognition with a description embedded but never as a sound and never as a name had three identical brains and a reflex that allowed it to act on a consensus of two in battle it might lose one or two and never sense a change in personality a century ago it had been a factory an auxiliary warcraft and a cluster of mining machines on a metal asteroid now the three were a unit at the next repair station its three brains might be installed in three different ships it might be reprogrammed or damaged or wired into other machinery or disassembled as components for something else such a thing could not have an independent existence to name itself would be inane perhaps it dreamed the universe about it was a simple one aflow with energies it had to be monitored for deviations from the random for order order was lifeor berserker the mass of the approaching star distorted space when space became too curved surrendered its grip on the cplusexcited state its velocity fell to a tenth of lightspeed and began to decelerate further now it was not dreaming at a million kilometers life might show as a reflection band in the green or orange or violet at a hundred kilometers many types of living nerve clusters would radiate their own distinctive patterns rarely was it necessary to come so close easier to pull near a star alert for attack and search the liquidwater temperature band for the spectra of an oxygen world oxygen meant life there sometimes life would defend itself had not been attacked not yet but life was clever the berserker was on hairtrigger alert while it looked about itsell the blue pinpoint had tinier moons a large one at a great distance and a smaller one close enough that tides had pulled it into a teardrop shape the larger moon was inconveniently large even for the smaller at x grams would be adequate the berserker fortress moved on it all senses alert hilary gage had no idea what to expect when he was younger when he was human he had organized channiths defenses against berserkers the berserkers had not come to channith in the four hundred and thirty years since channith became a colony he had traveled he had seen ravaged worlds and ruined slagged berserkers he had studied records made by men who had beaten the killer machines there were none from the losers harvest had bothered him he had asked that the monitoring station be destroyed it wasnt that the program might revolt gage feared that berserkers might come to harvest might find the monitoring station might rob the computer for components and find them superior to their own machinery he had been laughed at when singh asked that his personality be erased gage had asked again that time he had been given more makework find a way to make the station safe he had tried there was the remora subprogram but it had to be so versatile lung problems had interrupted his work before he was fully satisfied with it otherwise he had no weapons at all and the berserker had come the beast was damaged something had probed right through the hull a terrific thickness of hull no finesse here just mass to absorb the energies of an attackand gage wondered if it had received that wound attacking channith hed know more if he could permit himself to use radar or neutrino beams but he limited himself to passive instruments including the telescope the twohundredyear project was over the berserker would act to exterminate every microbe in the water and air of harvest gage was prepared to watch harvest die he toyed with the idea that when it was over the fortress would be exhausted of weapons and energy a sitting duck for any human warfieet but there were no weapons in the harvest system for now hilary gage could only record the event for channiths archives were there still archives had that thing attended to ch rnrnth before it came here there was no way to know what did a berserker do when the target didnt fight back two centuries ago harvest had been lifeless with a reducing atmosphere as earth itself had been once now life was taking hold to the berserker this ball of colored slimes was life the enemy it would attack how he neednt call the berserkers attention to himself doubtless the machine could sense life but gage was not alive would it destroy random machinery gage was not hidden but he didnt use much energy solar panels were enough to keep the station running the berserker was landing on teardrop time passed gage watched presently the berserkers drive spewed blue flame the berserker wasnt wasting fuel its drive drew its energies from the fabric of space itself but what was it trying to accomplish then hilary understood in his mind and in the memoryghost of his gut the berserker machine was not expending its own strength it had found its weapon in nature the violet star fanned forward along teardrops orbit that would have been a sixtygravity drive for the berserker alone attached to an asteroid three thousand times its mass it was still slowing teardrop by g hour after hour one hundred years of labor he might gamble harvest against himself a halfterralormed world against components to repair a damaged berserker he toyed with the idea hed studied recordings of berserker messages before he was himself recorded but there were better records already in the computer the frequencies were there and the coding star and world locations fuel and mass and energy reserves damage description danger probabilities orders of priority of targets some specialized language to describe esoteric weaponry as used by selfdefensive life a code that would translate into the sounds of human or alien speech a simplified code for a braindamaged berserker gage discarded his original intent he couldnt conceivably pose as a berserker funny though he felt no fear the glands were gone but the habit of fear had he lost that too teardrops orbit was constricting like a noose pose as something else think it through he needed more than just a voice pulse breath he had recordings vicepresident curly barnes had bid him goodby in front of a thousand newspickups after gage became a recording and the speech was in his computer memory a tough old lady curly far too arrogant to pose as goodlife but hed use his own vocabulary hold it what about the technician who had chatted with him while testing his reflexes angelo carson was a longtime smoker long overdue for a lungbath and the deep rasp in his lungs was perfect he focused his maser and let the raspy breathing play while he thought anything else would it expect a picture best do without remember to cut the breathing while you talk after the inhale this is goodlife speaking for the fortress moon the fortress moon is damaged the fan of light from teardrop didnt waver and answer came there none the records were old older than gage the man far older than gage in his present state other minds had run this computer system twice before holstein and ras singh had been elderly men exemplary citizens who chose this over simple death both had eventually asked to be wiped gage had only been a computer for eighteen years could he be using an obsolete programming language ridiculous no code would be obsolete some berserkers did not see a repair station in centuries they would have to communicate somehow or was this life thinking there were certainly repair stations but many berserker machines might simply fight until they wore out or were destroyed the military forces of channith had never been sure try again dont get too emotional this isnt a soap goodlife human servants of the berserkerswould be trained to suppress their emo tions wouldnt they and maybe he couldnt fake it anyway this is goodlife the fortress moon nice phrase that is damaged all transmitting devices were destroyed in battle with albion exhale inhalethe fortress moon has stored information regarding albions defenses albion was a spurofthemoment inspiration his imagination picked a yellow dwarf star behind him as he looked toward channith with a family of four dead planets the berserker had come from chairnith how would it know halt angelos breath on the intake and life support systems damaged goodlife is dying he thought to add please answer and didnt goodlife would not beg would he and gage had his pride he sent again i am gasp goodlife is dying fortress moon is mute sending equipment damaged motors damaged life support system damaged wandering fortress must take information from fortress moon computer system directly exhale listen to that wheeze poor bastard must be dying inhaleif wandering fortress needs information not stored it must bring oxygen for goodlife that he thought had the right touch begging without begging gages receiver spoke will complete present mission and rendezvous gage raged and said understood that was death for harvest hell it might have worked but a berserkers priorities were fixed and goodlife wouldnt argue was it fooled if not hed just thrown away anything he might learn of the berserker chanrnth would never see it gage would be dead slagged or dismembered when the light of the fortresss drive dimmed almost to nothing teardrop glowed of itself it was brushing harvests atmosphere cameras whirled in the shock wave and died one by one a last camera showed a white glare shading to violet gone the fortress surged ahead of teardrop swung around the curve of harvest and moved toward the outer moon toward gage its drive was powerful it could be here in six hours gage thought he sent heavy irregular breathing angelos raspy breath with interruptions uh uh goodlife is dying goodlife is is dead fortress moon has stored information selfdefending life locus is albion coordinates followed by silence teardrop was on the far side of harvest now but the glow of it made a ring of white flame round the planet the glow flared and began to die gage watched the shock wave rip through the atmosphere the planets crust parted exposing lava the ocean rolled to close the gap almost suddenly harvest was a white pearl the planets oceans would be water vapor before this day ended the berserker sent goodlife answer or be punished give coordinates for albion gage left the carrier beam on the berserker would sense no life in the lunar base poor goodlife faithful to the last had its own views regarding goodlife experience showed that goodlife was true to its origins it tended to go wrong to turn dangerous it would have been destroyed when convenient but that would not be needed now machinery and records were another matter as the berserker drew near the moon its telescopes picked up details of the trapped machine it saw lunar soil heaped over a dome its senses peered inside machinery occupied most of what it could see there was little room for a life support system a box of a room and stored air and tubes through which robot or goodlife could crawl to repair damage no more that was reassuring but design details were unfamiliar hypothesis the trapped berserker had used lifebegotten components for its repairs there was no sign of a drive no sign of abandoned wreckage hypothesis one of these craters was a crash site the cripple had moved its brain and whatever else survived into an existing installation built by life anything valuable in the goodlifes memory was now lost but perhaps the fortress moons memory was intact it would know the patterns of life in this vicinity its knowledge of technology used by local selfdefensive life might be even more valuable hypothesis it was a trap there was no fortress moon only a human voice the berserker moved in with shields and drive ready the closer it came the faster it could dodge beyond the horizon but it saw nothing resembling weaponry in any case the berserker had been allowed to destroy a planet surely there was nothing here that could threaten it it remained ready nonetheless at a hundred kilometers the berserkers senses found no life nor at fifty the berserker landed next to the heap of lunar earth that goodlife had called fortress moon berserkers did not indulge in rescue operations what was useful in the ruined berserker would become part of the intact one so reach out with a cable find the brain it had landed and still the fear didnt come gage had seen wrecks but never an intact berserker sitting alongside him gage dared not use any kind of beam scanner he felt free to use his sensors his eyes he watched a tractor detach itself from the berserker and come toward him trailing cable it was like a dream no fear no rage hate yes but like an abstraction of hate along with an abstract thirst for vengeance which felt ridiculous as it had always felt a bit ridiculous hating a berserker was like hating a malfunctioning air conditioner then the probe entered his mind the thought patterns were strange here they were sharp basic here they were complex and blurred was this an older model with obsolete data patterns or had the brain been damaged or the patterns scrambled signal for a memory dump see what can be retrieved gage felt the contact the feedback as his own thoughts what followed was not under his control reflex told him to fight horror had risen in his mind impulses utterly forbidden by custom by education by all the ways in which he had learned to be human it might have felt like rape how was a man to tell he wanted to scream but he triggered the remora program and felt it take hold and he sensed the berserkers reaction to gage within the berserker he screamed in triumph i lied i am not goodlife what i am plasma moving at relativistic velocities smashed deep into gage the link was cut his senses went blind and deaf the following blow smashed his brain and he was gone something was wrong one of the berserkers brain complexes was sick was dying was changing becoming monstrous the berserker felt evil within itself and it reacted the plasma cannon blasted the fortress moon then swung round to face backward it would fire through its own hull to destroy the sick brain before it was too late it was too late reflex three brains consulted before any major act if one had been damaged the view of the others would prevail three brains consulted and the weapon swung away what i am is hilary gage i fought berserkers during my life but you i will let live let me tell you what ive done to you i didnt really expect to have an audience tripleredundant brains we use that ourselves sometimes i am the opposite of goodlife im your mechanical enemy the recording of hilary gage ive been running a terraforming project and youve killed it and youll pay for that it feels like im swearing vengeance on my air conditioner well if my air conditioner betrayed me why not there was always the chance that harvest might attract a berserker i was recorded in tandem with what we called a remora program a program to copy me into another machine i wasnt sure it would interface with unfamiliar equipment you solved that one yourself because you have to interface with thousands of years of changes in berserker design im glad they gave me conscious control of remora two of your brains are me now but ive left the third brain intact you can give me the data i need to run this heap of junk youre in sorry shape arent you channith must have done you some damage did you come from channith god curse you youll be sorry youre barely in shape to reach the nearest berserker repair base and we shouldnt have any trouble getting in where is it an fine were on our way im going to read a poem into your memory i dont want it to get lost no no no relax and enjoy it deathmachine you might enjoy it at that do you like spilled blood i lived a bloody life and it isnt over yet talisman by larry niven and dian girard the stranger swung his baggage off his horses back patted the animal on the side of the neck and handed the reins to the stablehand old kasan was rarely interested in people he barely glanced at the stranger slanted eyes round face with a yellow tinge kasan led the animal to an empty stall and gave it food and water now the beast was a puzzler it suffered his ministrations with an air of strained patience its tail ended in the kind of brush usually seen on an ass kasan fancied that its look was one of tolerant contempt an horse you underestimate me kasan said i wont be tending other peoples horses forever horses did not often mock kasans daydreams this ones nicker sounded too much like a snicker its true some day ill own my own rental stable and kasan fondled the beasts ears and mane as if to thank it for listening under its shaggy forelock he felt a hard circular scar he told bayram all about it when he went in for lunch its a unicorn the horns been chopped off what kind of man would be riding a disguised unicorn the innkeeper said sometimes i wonder why i put up with your stories kasan you can feel the stub yourself no doubt at least dont be bothering my guests with such tales and bayram all set a tankard of ale next to kasans midday cheese and bread kasan opened his mouth to retort noticed the ale and kept silent and bayrarn all took counsel with himself strange beasts like the one munching hay in his stable were often found in the company of strange men the traveler might be a sorcerer though they were rare these days more likely he was a magician on his way to rynildissen bayram had seen the man carry two heavy bags up to his room it would be interesting to know what was in them and if it would be worthwhile to lighten them a little bayram all never robbed his guests it was a point of honor he preferred to leave the work and any possible danger to a professional he looked around the crowded common room it was smoky and odorous with the scents of cooking and human bodies there was much laughter and spilling of wine unfortunately most of the lightfingered brethren present had hasty tempers and were too quick to pull a knife bayram would not have violence in his inn across the room his small pretty wife esme was struggling to carry a huge frothy pitcher of ale two men were pushing and shoving each other for the honor of carrying it for her just beyond them leaning back on a rough bench with her shoulders against the wall sparthera was laughing and yethng at the two combatants sparthera bayram all grinned broadly the slim young thief was just what he had in mind she was daring without being reckless and had no morals to speak of they had made more than one bargain in the past he pushed his way across the room pausing to grab up the pitcher his wife was carrying and slam it down in front of a customer he knocked the combatants heads together sending them into hysterical laughter and sent esme back to the kitchen with a hearty slap on her firm round backside ay sparthera the thief laughed up at him she was finely built and slender with a tangled mass of tawny hair and high firm breasts her large hazel eyes were set wide over a short straight nose and full red lips well bayram all have you come over to knock my head against something too she hooked her thumbs in the belt of her leather jerkin and stretched out a pair of lean leatherclad legs no little thief i wondered if you had noticed a certain stranger among my guests oh she had lost the smile bayram all sat down on the bench next to her and lowered his voice a smoothskinned man from the east with bulging saddlebags his name is sung ko ja old kasan says he came riding a unicorn with the beasts horn cut off to disguise it a sorcerer sparthera shook her head firmly no id as soon try to rob the statue of khulm i dont want anything to do with sorcerers oh i hardly think hes a sorcerer the innkeeper said soothingly no more than a magician if that a sorcerer wouldnt need to disguise anything this man is trying to avoid drawing attention to himself he must have something a thief would want lunm sparthera frowned and thought for a moment no need to ask the terms of the bargain it would be equal shares and cheating was expected all right when he comes down to the common room for dinner or goes out to the privy let me know ill go up and look around his room it was several hours before sung ko ja came back down the stairs the sun was just setting and esme and her buxom daughters were beginning to serve the evening meal sparthera was sitting at one of the small tables near the kitchen door bayram all brushed by her with a pot of stew thats the one he whispered with the slanted eyes his room is the third on the left only spartheras eyes moved around forty she thought and distinctly foreign round of face but not fat with oldivory skin and dark almond eyes and the manner of a lord he seemed to to settling in for dinner good sparthera moved quickly up the stairs and along the hail counting doors the third door didnt move when she pushed on the handle she tried to throw her weight against it and couldnt somehow she couldnt find her balance a spell she went along to the end of the hall where one small window led out onto the first story roof outside a scant two feet of slippery thatch separated the second story wall and a drop to the cobblestones in the stableyard the sun had set the afterglow was bright enough to work in perhaps not dark enough to hide her but behind the inn were only fields and those who had been seeding the fields were gone to their suppers there was nobody to watch sparthera work her way around to the window of the magicians room the narrow opening was covered with oiled paper she slit it neatly with the tip of the knife she always carried and reached through or tried to something blocked her she pushed harder she felt nothing but her hand wouldnt move she swung a fist at the paper window her hand stopped jarringly and this time she felt her own muscles suddenly lock her own strength had stopped her swing she had no way to fight such magic sparthera hung from the roof by her hands and dropped the remaining four feet to the ground she dusted herself off and reentered the inn through the front sung ko ja was still eating his meal of roast fowl bread and fruit bayrain ali was hovering around with one eye on the magician and the other on the stairs sparthera caught his eye he joined her well i cant get in theres a spell on the room the innkeepers face fell then he shrugged pity i want very much to know what that man has that he thinks is so important she bit one finger and considered the ivoryskinned man dining peacefully on the other side of the room he doesnt have the look of the ascetic what do you think would he like a woman to keep him warm on such a cold night sparthera have you considered what youre suggesting my inns reputation is important to me if i offer youll well youd have to do it well the one time i myself made such a suggestion you nearly cut my throat that was years ago i was it had been id only just thrown that damned tinker out on his ear i didnt like men much just then besides this is different its business bayram an eyed her doubtfully she was dressed more like a young boy than a woman still the magician was a foreigner probably all of the local women looked odd to him bayram shrugged and pushed his way across the room sung ko ja looked up the innkeeper smiled broadly the wine is good eh drinkable and the fowl it was young tender was it not cooked to a nicety i ate it whats on your mind oh noble sir the night will be cold and i have a girl such a girl a vision of delight a morsel of sweetness sung ko ja waved an impatient hand all right so she is everything you claim she is how much ten too much six bayram all looked stunned then hurt sir you insult this princess among women why only last week she was a virgin nine seven eight and a half done and bring me another bottle of wine sung tossed down the last few drops in his tankard and paid the innkeeper sparthera was wait ing for him at the foot of the stairs he looked her over briefly and then started up the stairs carrying his fresh bottle of wine well come on girl he stopped at the door to his room and made a few quick gestures with his left hand before he pushed it open why did you do that sparthera asked in girlish innocence to raise the spell that protects my room otherwise i couldnt let you in my sweet one he laughed softly and burped sparthera stopped in the doorway if you have a spell on this room does that mean ill be locked in no no youre free to come and goas often as you like he chuckled until the dawn light comes through that window at the end of the hail and relinks the spell she entered the low bedhardly more than a palletheld a strawfilled mattress and bedding woven from the local cotton and wool there was wood stacked in the small fireplace grate and flint and steel lay next to a single candle in a holder the magicians saddlebags were sitting on the floor by the bed sung looked up at the small window where sparthera had slashed out the paper and frowned a cold draft was coming through the opening ill light the fire shall i sparthera asked she hurried to start a small blaze while sung swaying slightly on his feet considered the open window best that he be distracted she asked is it true that youre a magician he smiled there is only one sort of magic i have in mind at the moment sparthera hid her sudden nervousness behind a smile an but did you bring your wand the flickering firelight threw their shadows on the wall as sung guided her to the narrow bed what followed left sparthera pleasantly surprised for all his smooth skin and foreign ways the stranger proved more than equal to other men shed known he was considerate almost as if she were paying not he even if nothing came of this venture the evening hadnt been wasted two hours later she was beginning to change her mind they were sitting up on the strawfilled mattress sharing the last of the wine sparthera was naked sung still wore a wide cloth belt he had opened one of his bags and was showing her a variety of small trinkets there were birds that chirped when you tightened a spring a pair of puppets on strings flowers made of yellow silk and squares of bright paper that sung folded to look like bears and fish he was very drunk and talkative the immortal sung and his family rule in the land of the yellow river a mountainous land far to the east i was head of the family for twenty years now i have abdicated the throne in favor of my son but i carried away some magic watch i put a halftwist in this strip of paper join the ends and now it has only one side and one edge sparthera was restless and bored she had come upstairs expecting to deal with a magician she had found a cheap toymaker who couldnt hold his wine she watched his strong agile fingers twisting a scrap of paper into a bird and wondered his forehead was high and smooth his face a little too round for her taste but undeniably good to look on it was hard to believe that he could be a complete fool there must be more to him than cheap toys and bragging and a way with women he was rummaging in his bag again and she caught a glimpse of gleaming metal what is that the box the pointer the key to gars treasure a gift to set me on the road gars treasure whats that it sounded vaguely familiar its a secret sung said and he closed that saddlebag and reached across for the other and while he was turned away from her sparthera pulled a twist of paper from her hair and opened it and shook white powder into sungs halfempty goblet she didnt use it all and it probably wasnt needed sung was on his back and snoring a few minutes later long before the drug could have taken effect sparthera watched him for a few cautious minutes more before she reached into the saddlebag she drew out a silver box there were pieces of jade and carnelian set in mountings on the lid and sides she was halfafraid that a spell sealed this too but it opened easily enough the inside was lined with faded crimson velvet and all it held was an elongated teardrop of tarnished bronze there were tiny silver runes inlaid along the length of the dark metal sparthera picked it up and turned it this way and that it was thicker than her forefinger and just about as long a conical hole had been drilled nearly through its underside the box was worth something but was it worth angering a magician probably not she decided reluctantly and it certainly wasnt worth killing for not here bayram ali would never allow such a thing she would have to flee tarsenys rest forever and sparthera bad none of the tourist urge in her the same applied to sungs cloth belt she had felt the coins in it when they made the twobacked beast but it was no fortune sung surely ought to be robbed it would do him good make him less gullible but not tonight sparthera dropped the pointer in its box closed it and was reaching for the saddlebag when she remembered gar had been kaythills magician and kaythill was a bandit chief who had raided the lands around rynildissen city a hundred years ago he had lasted some twenty years until the kings soldiers caught him travelling alone under torture kaythill had steered them to some of his spoils the rest a wagonload of gold and jewels had been stolen by gar the magician kaythill and his men had been scouting the countryside for oar when the soldiers trapped him of course the kings men searched for gar some vital pieces of military magic were among the missing treasure there bad been rewards posted soldiers everywhere rumors and gars treasure had grown in the telling had grown into legend until it reached sparthera via her father she had been six it was a wonder she remembered at all and this trinket would point the way to oars treasure sparthera dressed hurriedly snatched up the silver box and left the room she hesitated in the hall looking first at her trophy and then back at the door what would he do when he woke and found the box missing she had only seen him drunk a magician sober and looking for lost property might be an entirely different matter she pushed at the door it opened easily he hadnt lied then she could come and go as she pleaseduntil dawn sparthera hurried down the stairs and out of the inn it was nearly midnight and there were only a few jovial souls left in the common room none saw her leave patrols rarely came to the thieves quarter of tarsenys rest but in the street of the metaiworkers they were common sparthera went warily waiting until a pair of guards had passed before she began throwing pebbles at a certain upstairs window the window came alight sparthera stepped out of the shadows showed herself presently tinx appeared rubbing his eyes looking left and right before he pulled her inside sparthera what brings you here little thief are the dogs finally at your heels and you need a place to hide how long would it take you to copy this she opened the box and held out the bronze teardrop hmmm not long the lettering is the hard pa rt but i do have some silver how long an hour or two i need it now tonight sparthera i can t i need my sleep tinx you owe me tinx owed her twice once for a pair of thieves who had tried to interest sparthera in robbing tinxs shop in spartheras opinion robbing a citizen of tarsenys rest was fouling ones own nest she had informed on them and once she had worked like a slave in his shop to finish a lucrative job on time for sparthera was not always a thief but tinx had had other more pressing debts and he still owed sparthera most of her fee the metalworker lifted his hands helplessly and rolled his eyes to heaven will i be rid of you then finished and done all debts paid oh all right then he sighed and still grumbling about his lost nights sleep went back inside to light some candles and a lantern to work by sparthera prowled restlessly about the tiny shop she found means to make tea afterward she prowled some more until tinx glared at her and demanded she stay in one place then she sat while tinx sawed and ified and hammered until he had a bronze teardrop gouged grooves in the surface pounded silver wire into the grooves polished it compared it to the original then held it in tongs over a flame until tarnish dulled the silver he asked just how good are your clients eyes i dont really know but by khulm were running out of time well what do you think he handed her copy and original she turned them swiftly in her hands then dropped the copy into the box and the original into her sleeve has to be good enough my thanks tinx she was already slipping through the door if this works out she was down the street and out of earshot leaving tinx to wonder if she had made him a promise probably not she stopped inside the front door of the inn a moment to get her breath else the whole inn would hear her then upstairs on tiptoe third door down push it swung open and sparthera swallowed her gasp of relief the magician was still asleep and still snoring he looked charmingly vulnerable she thought sparthera pushed the box into a saddlebag under a tunic it cost her a wrench to leave it but far better to lose a trinket worth a few gold pieces than to face the wrath of an outraged sorcerer sparthera had bigger fish to fry she tiptoed out and shut the door the first gray glow of morning was showing through the window at the end of the hail sparthera stayed out of sight until she saw sung mount his odd shaggy horse and start off down the kings way to rynildissen he seemed unsteady in the saddle and once he clutched at his head that worried her khulm bear witness i did go easy on that powder she told herself she found bayram all counting money at a table in the common room he looked up at her expectantly well what did you find a few toys some scraps of colored paper and an old silver box that isnt worth the trouble it would get us no money coins in a belt he never took it off there wasnt much in it not enough anyway bayram all scowled very intelligent of you dear still a pity he left this for you he tucked two fingers into his wide cummerbund and fished out a pair of silver coins perhaps youve found a new calling one for you and one for me hmm sparthera smiled letting her strong even white teeth show and how much did he pay you last night six pieces of silver bayram all said happily you sold me so cheaply youre a liar and your mother was insulted on a garbage heap well he offered six we settled for eight four for you four for me hxnm he looked pained sparthera took her five pieces of silver winked and departed wondering what sung ko ja had really paid that was part of the fun of bargaining wondering who had cheated whom but this time sparthera had the pointer on a bald hill east of the village sparthera took the bronze teardrop from her sleeve along with a needle and the cork from one of sung ko jas bottles of wine she pushed the base of the needle into the cork set it down and balanced the pointer on the needle pointer pointer show me the way to oars treasure she whispered to it and nudged it into a spin three times she spun it and marked where it stopped pointing north and northwest and east she tried holding it in her hand turning in d circle with her eyes closed trying to feel a tug she tried balancing it on her own fingernail she studied the runes but they meant nothing to her after two hours she was screaming curses like a euphrates fishwife it didnt respond to that either sitting on the bare dusty ground with her chin in her hands and the pointer lying in the dirt in front of her sparthera felt almost betrayed so close she was so close to wealth that she could almost hear the tinide of golden coins she needed advice and the one person who might help her was one she had vowed never to see again a faint smile crossed her face as she remembered screaming at him throwing his bags and gear out of the tiny hut they shared swearing by the hair on her head that shed die and rot in hell before she ever went near him again that damned tinker potmender amateur spellcaster womanizer his real magic was in his tongue shed left her home and family to follow him and all of his promises had been so much air shed heard that he lived up in the hills now that he called himself shubar khan and practiced magic to earn a living if he cast spells the way he mended pans she thought sourly he wouldnt be of much use to her but perhaps hed learned something and there wasnt anyone else she could go to she stood up dusted herself off bent to pick up the bronze teardrop the sky was clouding over and the scent of rain was in the air it matched her dismal mood what about her vow it had been a general oath not bound by a particular god but she had meant it with all her heart sometimes vows like that were the most dangerous for who knew what wandering elemental might be listening she leaned against twilight smoothing his tangled mane and staring out over his back at the rolling foothills and the mountains beyond life was too dear and oars treasure too important to risk either on a broken vow she took her knife from its sheath and started to hack at her long tawny hair shubar khans house hardly more than a hut was both small and dirty sparthera reined her horse to a halt before the door she looked distastefully at a hog carcass lying in the center of a diagram scratched in the hard dry ground she had sworn never to speak his name but that name was tashubar she called shubar khan come out shubar khan she peered into the dark doorway a faint odor of burning fat was the only sign of habitation who calls shubar khan a man appeared in the doorway and blinked out at her sparthera swung herself down from twilights back and lifted her chin a little arrogantly staring at him sparthera he rubbed the side of his face and laughed dryly oh ho the last time we saw one another you threw things at me i think i still have a scar somewhere you wouldnt care to see it would you an well i thought not he cocked his head to one side and nodded youre still beautiful just like you were when i found you in that haystack heh heh heh i like you better with hair though what happened to it i swore an oath she said shortly wondering a little at what passing time could do to a man he had been a good thirty years old to her fourteen when they met now she was twentysix and he was potbellied and sweaty with a red face and thinning hair and lecherous little eyes he wore felt slippers with toes that turned up and five layers of brightly striped woolen robes he scratched now and then absentmindedly but he still had the big knowing hands and strong shoulders that sloped up into his neck and hadnt he always scratched and hed never been thin and his eyes couldnt have shrunk the change was in her suddenly she hungered to get the matter over with and leave shubar khan to the past where he belonged ive come on business i want you to fix something for me she held out the piece of bronze its supposed to be a pointer but it doesnt work a small dirty hand reached for the pointer i can fix that sparthera spun around reaching for her knife my apprentice shubar khan explained how would you fix it boy theres a storm coming up the boy hardly more than twelve looked at his master with sparkling eyes i can climb a tree and tie the thing to a branch high up when the lightning strikes you shorteared offspring of a spavined goat shubar bellowed at him that would only make it point to the pole starif it didnt melt first and if it were iron instead of bronze bali the boy cringed back into the gloom of the hut which was filled with dry bones aborted sheep foetuses and pig bladders stuffed with odd ointments there was even a twoinchlong unicorn horn prominently displayed on a small silk pillow shubar khan peered at the silver runes he mumbled under his breath at length was he reading them old sorcerers guild language he said with some mistakes what is it supposed to point at i dont know sparthera lied something buried i think shubar khan unrolled one of the scrolls weighted it open with a couple of bones and began to read in a musical foreign tongue presently he stopped nothing whatever spell was on it it seems as dead as the gods curse my luck and your skill cant you do anything i can put a contagion spell on it for two pieces of silver he looked her up and down and grinned or anything else of equal or greater value ill give you the coins sparthera said shortly what will the spell do shubar khan laughed until his paunch shook not even for old times sake what a pity as to the spell it will make this thing seek whatever it was once bound to were probably lucky the original spell wore off a contagion spell is almost easy sparthera handed over the money oars treasure had already cost her far too much shubar khan ushered her and his apprenticeloaded down with phials a pair of scrolls firewood and a small cauldronto a steep crag nearby why do we have to come out here sparthera asked were just being cautious shubar khan said soothingly he set up the cauldron emptied a few things into it lit the fire the apprentice had set and handed the apprentice the bronze teardrop and one of the scrolls when the cauldron smokes just read this passage out loud and remember to enunciate he said as he grabbed spartheras arm and sprinted down the hill sparthera looked uphill at the boy this is dangerous isnt it how dangerous i dont know the original spell isnt working but there may be some power left in it and theres no telling what it might do thats why magicians have apprentices they could hear the boy chanting in his childish treble speaking gibberish but rolling his rs and practically spitting the ps the clouds that had been gathering overhead took on a harsh ominous quality the wind came up and the trees whipped and showered leaves on the ground a crack of lightning cast the entire landscape into ghastly brightness shubar khan dove to the ground sparthera winced and then strained her eyes into the suddenly smoky air there was no sign of the boy thunder rolled deafeningly across the sky sparthera ran up the hill heart thumping the top of the crag was scorched and blackened the iron cauldron was no more than a twisted blob of metal ooohhh shubar khans apprentice pulled himself to his feet and looked at her with huge eyes his face was smudged his hair scorched and his clothing still smouldered he held out a blackened fist with the bronze piece still in it did did did it work he asked in a frightened croak shubar khan retrieved the pointer and laid it on his palm it slowly rotated to the right and stopped he grinned broadly and patted the boy heartily on the shoulder excellent well make a magician of you yet he turned to sparthera and presented the pointer to her with a bow she tucked it inside her tunic thank you she said feeling a little awkward shubar khan waved a muscular red hand always pleased to be of service spells enchantments and glamours at reasonable rates maybe someday i can interest you in a love philtre sparthera rode back down the mountain trail with the bronze teardrop tucked in her tunic feeling its weight between her breasts like the touch of a lovers hand just above tarsenys rest she reined up to watch a small herd of gazelle bound across a nearby hill someday she would build a house on that hill someday when she had oars treasure she would build a big house with many rooms and many fireplaces she would have thick rugs and fine furniture and there would be servants in white tunics embroidered with red leaves she spurred her horse to the crest of the hill down below were the river and the town and across the valley were more hills leading away to distant mountains im going to be rich she yelled rich the echoes boomed back rich rich rich until they finally whimpered into silence twilight nickered and pulled at his reins sparthera laughed she would have many horses when she was rich horses and cattle and swine she could almost see the hoard trickling through her fingers in a cascade of gold and rainbow colors money for the house and the animals and a dowry the dowry would buy her a husband a fine respectable merchant who would give her fat beautiful children to inherit the house and the animals sparthera took a last lingering look at the countryside before she swung herself back into the saddle first find the treasure she cantered back into town put twilight into the stable behind the lodging house and went to her room it was a tiny cubicle with a pallet of cottoncovered straw and some blankets against one wall rough colorful embroideries hung on the wattle and daub walls relics of the days at home on her fathers farm another embroidery was thrown across a large wooden chest painted with flying birds and a threelegged chair with flowers stencilled on the back stood in one corner sparthera uncovered the chest and threw open the lid it was packed with odds and endsrelics of her childhoodand down at the bottom was a small pouch with her savings in it she opened the pouch and counted the coins slowly frowning the search might take weeks or months she would need provisions extra clothes and a pack animal to carry them there wasnt enough here she would have to borrow or beg an animal from her family she grimaced at the thought but she had little choice it was a four hour ride to her fathers farm her mother was out in the barnyard feeding the chickens when she rode in the elder woman looked at her with what might have been resignation run out of money and come home again have you not this time sparthera said dismounting and placing a dutiful kiss on her mothers cheek i need a horse or an ass i thought maybe father had one i could borrow her mother looked at her distastefully always you dress like a man no wonder no decent man ever looks at you why dont you give up all those drunkards you hang around with why dont you mother i need a horse youve got one horse you dont need another horse mother im going on a trip and i need a pack horse spartheras eyes lit with suppressed excitement when i come back ill be rich humph thats what you said when you ran off with that nogood pot mender if your father were here hed give you rich all right youre lucky hes in the mountains for a week i dont know about horses ask bruk hes in the barn her mother tossed another handful of grain to the chickens and sparthera started across the dusty barnyard and get yourself some decent clothes sparthera sighed and kept moving her nextolder brother was in the loft restacking sheaves of last seasons wheat bruk have you got an extra horse he looked down at her squinting into the light from the open barn door sparthera you havent been here for two months did you run out of pockets to pick or just out of men she grinned no more than you ever run out of women are you still rolling mikka in her fathers hay ricks he climbed down from the loft looking a little glum her father caught us at it twelve days ago and now ive got to trade the rick for a marriage bed and everything that goes with it he was a big man well muscled with a shock of corncolored hair dark eyes and full sensuous lips lost your hair i see well they say that comes of not enough candlewick find yourself a man and well make it a double celebration sparthera leaned against a stall and laughed heartily caught at last well it wont do you any harm and beds arent as itchy as piles of hay you ought to be glad once youve married youll be safe from all the other outraged fathers will i though they may just come after me with barrel staves and i hate to cut short a promising career oh the youngest daughter of the family in the hollow has grown up to be enough bruk i need a horse have you got an extra one he shook his head twilight pulled up lame did he no im planning a trip and i need a pack animal bruk scratched his head cant you buy one in town there are always horse dealers in the market square i know too many people in tarsenys rest i dont want them to know im taking this trip besides she added candidly i dont have enough money what are you up to little sister murder pillage or simple theft oh bruk its the chance to make a fortune a chance to be rich he shook his head disgustedly not again remember that crockery merchant and the rug dealer and that tink this time its different oh sure anyway we havent got a horse why dont you steal one this time it was spartheras turn to look disgusted you cant just steal a horse on the spur of the moment its not like a pair of shoes you know you have to do a little planning and i dont have the time youd never make a decent thief youd just walk in grab it by the tail and try to walk out she pulled at her lower lip now what am i going to do they both stood there thinking bruk finally broke the silence well if you only want it to carry a pack you might make do with a wild ass they break to a pack saddle pretty easy there are some up in the foothills ill even help you catch one i guess its worth a try bruk found a halter and a long rope and led the way across the cultivated fields and up into the hills the landscape was scrubby underbrush dotted with small stands of trees there were knolls of rock and one small stream that ran cackling down the slope bruk stopped to study a pattern of tracks thatll be one spends a lot of time here too yup ill bet it hides over in that copse you go left and ill go right well get it when it comes out of the trees they circled cautiously toward a promising stand of small trees sure enough sparthera could hear something moving within the grove and even caught a glimpse of brownish hide a branch cracked under bruks boot something brown exploded from the cover of the brush and bruk yelled swinging the loop of his rope get the halter watch out for its hooves yeow oooof the animal whirled bounced like a goat on its small sturdy legs and managed to butt bruk in the middle bruk sat down heavily while sparthera made a frantic grab for the trailing end of the rope the little animal frantically trying to dodge her groping hands was braying whinnying and making occasional highpitched whistling noises it was the size of a small pony and had a long silky mane that almost dragged the ground its tail was thick muscular and held up at an angle it had two ridiculous little feathery wings about as long as spartheras forearm growing out of the tops of its shoulders bruk staggered to his feet as sparthera managed to catch and cling to the rope he launched himself bodily at the beast grabbed it around the neck and threw it off balance it fell heavily to one side where it kicked its small feet and fluttered its tiny wings to the accompaniment of an incredible cacophony of hoots whistles and brays sparthera clapped her hands over her ears and yelled thats no wild ass what on earth is it some sort of magic beast bruk was busily fitting his halter on their uncooperative captive i dont know he panted i think its half ass and half nightmare if a sorcerer dreamed it up he must have been drunk he stood back and let it scramble to its feet it lowered its head pawed the ground savagely lifted its tail and jumped with all four feet the maneuver carried it forward perhaps two paces its little wings flapping frantically sparthera burst out laughing doubled over with mirth when she recovered enough she stared at their captive and shook her head do you think it can be broken to carry a pack lets get it down to the barn and well try it with a pack saddle getting the wingbeast down the hill was a production in its own right it bolted tried to roll then dug its feet in like the most obstinate of jackasses finally tired irritated and covered with grime the three of them made it to the barnyard they managed to get the saddle on its backafter sparthera had been butted and trampled and her brother had been dumped in the watering troughand stood back to watch the small animal bucked it turned twisted flapped its ridiculous little wings and rolled in the dust it tried to bite the saddle girth and scrape the saddle off against the fence it kicked its heels and brayed just when they thought it would never quit it stopped sides heaving and glared at them the next day it accepted a ripe apple from sparthera bit bruk in the buttocks and managed to bolt into the house where spartheras mother hit it on the nose with a crock of pickled cabbage sparthera was losing patience it was all taking too long had sung ko ja discovered her trick was he searching tarsenys rest for the woman who had stolen his pointer she had told bayram all that she was visiting her parents someone would come to warn her surely but nobody came that day or the next and a horrid thought came to her sung ko ja must have followed the pointer far indeed even without the pointer he must have a good idea where the treasure lay he might have continued on at this moment he could be unearthing spartheras treasure it was three days before the winged beast gave up the fight trotted docilely at the end of a rope and accepted the weight of a loaded pack saddle it even gave up trying to bite as long as they kept out of its reach sparthera named it eagle it would be better called vulture bruk said rubbing at a healing wound its smart though ill grant you that only took the beast three days to realise it couldnt get rid of that saddle three days sparthera said wearily bruk for once you were right i should have stolen a horse she rode back to town leading the wingbeast along behind it took her half a day to buy provisions and pack her clothing in late afternoon she set out on the kings way holding the bronze pointer like the relic of some ancient and holy demigod she was expecting to ride into the wilderness into some wild unpopulated area where a treasure could lie hidden for eighty years but the pointer was tugging her along the kings way straight toward rynildis sen the ruling city of the biggest state around that didnt bother her at first rynildissen was four days hard riding for a kings messenger a week for a traveler on horseback two for a caravan and oars band had done their raiding around rynildissen the kings way was a military road it ran wide as a siege engine and straight as an arrows flight it made for easy traveling but sparthera worried about sharing her quest with too much traffic she found extensive litter beside the road burntout campfires horse droppings garbage that attracted lynxes it grew ever fresher on her third afternoon she was not surprised to spy an extensive dust plume ahead of her by noon of the next day she had caught up with a large merchant caravan she was about to ride up alongside the trailing wagon when she caught a glimpse of an odd shaggy horse with a tail like an ass there was a figure in bulky eastern robes on its back sung sparthera pulled her horse hard to the side and rode far out over the rolling hill and away from the road she had no desire to trade words with the smoothfaced magician but what was he doing here the caravan was protection from beasts and minor thieves but the caravan was slow he could have been well ahead of sparthera by now he didnt know the pointers had been switched that must be it the seekingspell had been nearly dead already sung had followed it from far to the east now he was following his memory with no idea that anyone was behind him then the important thing was to delay him she must find the treasure take it and be miles away before sung ko ja reached the site all day she paced the caravan at dusk they camped round a spring leaving her horse sparthera moved down among the wagons tents oxen and camels she avoided the campfires sung ko ja had pitched a small red and white striped tent his unicorn was feeding placidly out of a nosebag stealing a roll of rich brocade was easy the merchant should have kept a dog it was heavy stuff and she might well be spotted moving it out of camp but she didnt have to do that after studying sungs tent for some time watching how soundly sung slept she crept around to the back of the tent and rolled the brocade under the edge then away hugging the shadows and into the hills before the moon rose dawn found her back on the highway well ahead of the caravan chuckling as she wondered how sung would explain his acquisition when she dug the pointer out of her sleeve her sense of humor quite vanished the pointer was tugging her back she must have ridden too far after a hasty breakfast of dried figs and jerked meat sparthera started to retrace her path paralleling the kings way days of following the pointer had left painful cramping in both hands but she dared not set it down now at any moment she expected the bronze teardrop to pull her aside she was paying virtually no attention to her path at the crest of a smooth hill she looked up to see another horse coming toward her its rider was a smoothfaced man with skin the color of old ivory and his almond eyes were amused it was too late even to think of hiding oh ho my sweet little friend from two nights ago what brings you onto the kings way my hair sparthera improvised cosmetics theres a witch woman who lives that way she gestured vaguely south and gave him her best effort at a flirtatious smile and i find i can afford her fees thanks to the generosity of a slanteyed magician oh dear and i had hoped your lips were aching for another kiss he looked at her critically you dont need to visit any witch even shorn you are quite enchanting you must share my midday meal i insist come we can rest in the shade of those trees yonder sparthera was afraid to spur her horse and flee he might suspect nothing at all else why had he joined the caravan she turned her horse obediently and rode to the shade of the small grove with him trailing the wingbeast behind at the end of its halter sung slid easily from his unicorn he still didnt seem dangerous she could insist on preparing the food wine she could spill while pretending to drink she swung down from her horse her head hurt her eyes wouldnt focus she tried to roll over and her head pulsed in red pain her arms and legs seemed caught in something rope she waited until her head stopped throbbing before she tried to learn more then it was obvious her hands were tied behind her a leather strap secured her ankles to one of the shade trees sung ko ja was sitting crosslegged on a rug in front of hcr flipping a iirowze teardrop rn the air bastarcl he must ha cr hit her on the head whtle she was dis mountmg etght ntghts ago i noticed that someone had cut the paper out of my bedroom window he satd woke the next morning with a foul taste in my mouth but that could have been cheap wine or too much wine last night some rogue put a roll of stolen dry goods in my baggage which caused me no end of embarrassment i would not ordinarily have thought of you iii connection with this confess that my memories of our time together are most pleasant however he paused to sip at a bowl of tea however my unicorn who can whisper strange things when i want him to and sometimes when i dont he speaks the unicorn was glaring at her sparthera glared back magician or no she felt that this was cheating somehow such a disappointment said sung ko ja if only you had come to my arms last night all of this might be different you sadden me here you are and here is this he held up the pointer why she looked at the ground biting her lip why money of course she blurted out you said that thing was the key to a treasure wouldnt you have taken it too in my place sung laughed and rubbed his fingers over his chin no i dont think so but i am not you it may be this was my fault i tempted you he got to his feet he tilted her head back with one hand so he could look into her eyes now whats to be done swear to be my slave and ill take you along to look for gars treasure a slave never my people have always been free id rather die than ke a slave sung looked distressed lets not call it slavery then if you dislike it so much bondage binding lets say you will bind yourself to me for seven years and a day or until we find treasure to equal your weight in gold and if we find the treasure what then then youre free thats not enough i want part of the treasure sung laughed again this time in pure amusement you bargain hard for one who has been pinioned and tied to a tree all right part of the treasure then how much of it she asked warily i take the fist and s isd most valuable items we split the cst equally who dectdc sung owin nfl old i ii pi t iii l nuing irlicure into two heaps you choose whtch heap ott v ant that actuaiy sounded fatr agreed ah but nov it is mc turn what ar con going to swear b my httle sweetheart i want your oath that youll offer me no harm that youll stay by my side and obey my commands until the terms of the agreement are met sparthera hesitated it didnt take a magician to know how to make an oath binding even nations kept their oaths to the letter and that could make diplomacy interesting she could be making herself rich or she could be throwing away seven years of her life would sung hold still for a better bargain not a chance all right ill swear by khulm the thieves god who stands in the shrine at rynildissen may he break my fingers if i fail you swear then i swear sung bent down and kissed her heartily on the lips then he set about freeing her he set out tea while she was rubbing her wrists there was a lump on her head the tea seemed to help she said we must be very near the treasure the pointer led me back the way we came straight into your arms in fact sung chuckled he fished the silver box out of his saddlebag he opened it took out spartheras counterfeit bronze teardrop hesitated then dropped it on the rug he stood up with the genuine object in his hand sparthera cried stop thats too late sung had flung the genuine pointer into a grove of low trees ill keep yours he said its only for the benefit of people who think a box has to contain something now watch he pressed down on the silver box in two places and twisted four of the small stone ornaments the box folded out flat into a crossshape with one long arm you see there never was a spell on the bronze lump you took it to a spellcaster didnt you sparthera nodded and he put some kind of contagion spell on it didnt he she nodded again so the bronze lump sought what it had been a part of the box its been in there too long sung pulled the faded red lining off of the surface underneath the metal was engraved with patterns and lettering sung stroked a finger over the odd markings it looks like a valuable trinket on the outside no casual thief would just throw it away i might have a chance to get it back but a magician turned robber would take the pointer just as you did shed had it in her hands too late too late when can we start looking for gars treasure tomorrow morning if youre so eager meanwhile the afternoon is growing cold come here and warm my heart sung dear just how cl spartheras words trailed off in surprise she had walked straight into sungs arms she had behaved like this with no man not since that damned tinker her voice quavered as she said i dont act like this sung what magic is on me now he pulled back a little why its your own oath i feel like that puppet you showed me this isnt what i meant sung sighed too bad well i dont mean i wont share your bed her voice was shrill with nearhysteria i just i want power over my own limbs damn you sung yes i tell you now that binding yourself to me does not involve becoming my concubine she pulled away and turned her back and found it was possible good good sung thank you her brow furrowed suddenly and she turned back to face him what if you tell me different later she might have guessed that sungs answer would be a shrug all right what was i trying to say earlier oh i remember just how close is the kings way we dont want that caravan camping next to us somebody might get nosy sung agreed they had moved a good distance down the kings way before they camped for the night in the morning sparthera saddled twilight and loaded eagle while sung packed his gear on the unicorn the wingbeast caught his attention where did you get that creature near my fathers farm it was running wild i think its some sort of magic beast sung shook his head sadly no quite the opposite in my grandfathers day there were flocks of beautiful horses that sailed across the sky on wings as wide as the kings way he rode one when he was a little boy it couldnt lift him when he grew too big as time went on the colts were born with shorter weaker wings until all that was left were little beasts like this one i used to catch them when i was a boy but never to fly enchantment is going out of the world sparthera soon there will be nothing left it was a mystery to sparthera how her companion read the talisman it looked the same to her no matter which way he said it pointed sung tried to show her when they set off that morning he set the flattenedout box on the palm of her hand and said keep reading it as you turn it the runes dont actually change but when the long end points right the message becomes ta netyillo iliq pratht instead of tanetyi lo skip it just skip it in any case the pointer continued to lead them straight down the kings way they reached an inn about dusk and sung paid for their lodging sparthera watched him setting the spells against thieves sung was not secretive quite the contrary he drilled her in the spells so that she would be able to set them for him though he had freed her from the obligation the magician seemed to consider lovemaking as part of their agreement sparthera had no complaints the magician was adept at more than spells when she told him this she expected him to preen himself but sung merely nodded keeping the women happy is very necessary in sung house how much did i tell you about us that first night you were the immortal sung you abdicated in favor of your son i was bragging what were you not the stablehand i think oh i was the immortal sung true enough we rule a fairsized farming region a valley blocked off by mountains and the yellow river we know a little magicwe keep a herd of unicorns and sell the horn or use it ourselvesbut thats not what keeps the farmers docile they think theyre being ruled by a sorcerer seven hundred years old the immortal sung yes i became the immortal sung when i was twenty my mother set a spell of glamour on me to make me look exactly like my father then i was married to ma tay my cousin and set on the throne thats i never heard of glamour being used to make anyone look older thats a nice trick isnt it the spell wears off over twenty years but of course youre getting older too looking more and more like your father magic aside when i reached forty my wife put the glamour on my eldest son and here i am under oath to travel until nobody has ever heard of sung house well ive done that someday maybe ill meet my father what happens to your wife she took my mothers place as head of the house its actually the women who rule in sung house the immortal sung is just a figurehead sparthera shook her head smiling it still sounds like a nice job and they didnt throw you out naked no we know all our lives whats going to happen we think on how well leave what well take where well go we collect tales of other lands and artifacts that could help us theres a little treasure room of things a departing sung may take with him he leaned back on the bed and stretched when i left i took the pointer it always fascinated me even as a boy i collected rumors about gars treasure it wasnt just the gold and the jewels that stuck in my mind there is supposed to be a major magical tool too what is it its a levitation device havent you ever wanted to fly spartheras lips pursed in a silent what a thief could do with such a thing or a military spy yes and the regency raised hell trying to find gars treasure but of course youd keep it yourself or sell it to one government or another but ill fly with it first that night cuddled close in sungs arms sparthera roused herself to ask a question sung what if i should have a child by you he was silent for a long time long enough that she wondered if hed fallen asleep when he did answer it was in a very soft voice we would ride off into the mountains and build a great hail and i would put a glamour on the child to raise up a new house of sung satisfied sparthera snuggled down into the magicians arms to dream of mountains and gold they woke late the next morning with the dust of the caravan actually in sight they left it behind them as they rode still following the kings way this is ridiculous sung fretted another day and well be in rynildissen is it possible that this gar actually buried his loot in the kings way i wouldnt think hed have the chance still i suppose nobody would look for it there maybe around noon they reached a region of low hills the kings way began to weave among them like a snake but the silver box pointed them steadfastly toward rynildissen sung dithered well do we follow the road or do we cut across country wherever the pointer points sparthera said road i guess well know if we pass it and road it was until the moment when sung sucked in his breath with a loud ab what is it the talismans pointing that way south he turned off guiding the unicorn uphill sparthera followed puffing the wingbeast along after her the unicorn seemed to be grumbling just below audibility now the land was rough and wild there were ravines and dry creekbeds and tumbled heaps of soil and stone they were crossing the crest of a hill when sung said stop the unicorn stopped sparthera reined in her horse the wingbeast walked into twilights haunches got kicked and sat down with a dismal bray sung ignored the noise down in that ravine well have to try it on foot they had to move on all fours in places the bottom of the ravine was thick with brush sparthera hesitated as sung plunged into a thorn thicket when she heard his muttered curses stop suddenly she followed she found him surrounded by scattered bones and recognized the skull of an ass the pointer reads right in all directions were right on it he said a pair of large stones brown and cracked looked a bit too much alike sparthera touched one old leather saddle bags the bag was so rotten it had almost merged with the earth it tore easily within was cloth that fell apart in her hands and a few metal ornaments that were green with verdigris badges of rank for a soldier of rynildissen in the middle of it all something twinkled something bright sung had torn the other bag apart nothing what have you got she turned it in her hand a bright faceted stone shaped like a bird and set into a gold ring oh how pretty hardly worth the effort sung said he worked his way backward out of the thicket and stood up diamonds have no color theyre not worth much you see this kind of trinket in any shanton jewel bazaar give it here sparthera handed it over feeling forlorn then thats all there is oh i doubt it were on the track this was just the closest piece it must have been part of the hoard or the talisman wouldnt have pointed us here even so how did it get here did gar lose a pack mule he opened out the pointer with the birds beak he traced a looping curve on the silver surface there the talisman is pointing true again theres still treasure to be found they climbed back uphill to their steeds the kings way was well behind them now and lost among the hills they were picking their way across a nearly dry stream bed when sung said were passing it where i dont know yet sung dismounted you wait here sparthera come along and she realised hed spoken first to the unicorn he picked his way carefully up a vast sloping spill of shattered boulders legbreaker country at the top panting heavily he opened the box out and turned in a circle well sung turned again he spoke singsong gibberish in what might have been a lengthy spell but it sounded like cursing are you just going to keep spinning it says all directions are wrong uh point it down sung stared at her then he pointed the talisman at his feet he said ta netyillo sparthera my love you may be the best thing that ever happened to me i am delighted to hear it my shovels still on the horse shall i go for it yes no wait a bit he started walking staring at the talisman it must be deep yards deep more forget the shovel there must be a cave under us he grinned savagely at her well have to find the entrance were almost there love come on they trudged down the hill trying to avoid twisted ankles or worse sparthera paused to catch her breath and caught a blur of motion out of the corner of her eye it was headed for the animals sung what twilight whinnied in terror he tossed his head pulling loose the reins sparthera had looped over a bush and bolted downhill the unicorn had splayed his front feet and lowered his head as if he thought he still owned a spear the winged packbeast filling the air with a bedlam of sound was bounding rapidly away in twopacelong jumps tiny wings beating the air frantically sung let out a yell and charged up to the top of the ravine swinging a heavy branch hed snatched up on the way sparthera clambered up beside him swearing as she saw her animals heading off across the landscape there was a loud wailing sound that put the wingbeasts efforts to shame and then silence the thing had vanished what was that i dont know im more interested in where it went keep an eye out love sung pulled his sword from the pack and wandered about the shattered rock spartheras nose picked up a heavy musky animal odor she followed it heart pounding knife in hand they were too close to the treasure to stop now the odor was wafting out of a black gap in the rocks less than a yard across sung clambered up to look thats it he said its not big enough though if we crawled through that the thingwhatever it iswould just take our heads as they poked through well have to move some rocks sparthera picked up a heavy boulder and hurled it away i feel an irrational urge to go home i cant go home lets move some rocks said sung and she did the sun had dropped a fair distance toward rynildissen and every muscle in her body was screaming before the dripping panting sung said enough now we need torches sung did it occur to you to let me rest well why didnt you oh sung was disconcerted sparthera im used to giving orders to women because im supposed to be the immortal sung but its just for show im also used to being disobeyed i cant she was crying ill be more careful shall we rest have some tea good offer me a swallow of wine thats not for khuims sake sung do you think id go in there drunk its in there i know it i kept waiting for it to jump on me dont you have a spell to protect us no we dont even know what it is here he turned her around and began to massage her neck and shoulders fingers digging in sparthera felt tensed muscles unravelling loosening it was a wonderful surprise she said it must have halfkilled the sung women to let you go somehow they managed she barely heard the bitterness but it did bother him it was dark in there the late afternoon light only reached a dozen paces in they stepped in holding the torches high there was a rusthng flurry of motion and a loud whimpering cry if one of them had run the other would have followed as it was they walked slowly forward behind sungs sword and spartheras dagger the cave wasnt large a stream ran through the middle sparthera noted two skeletons on either side of the stream lying face up as if posed another cry and a scrabbling sound something huge and dark moved just outside the perimeter of light the animal odor had become sickeningly strong sung held the light higher off in a corner something huge was trying to pack itself into a very narrow crevice it looked at them with absolute panic in its eyes pulled its long scaly tail closer under its legs and tried fruitlessly to move away what in the world is it nothing from this world thats certain sung said it looks like something that was conjured up out of a bad dream probably was gars guardian the creature was partly furred and partly scaled it had a long toothed snout and broad paddlelike front paws with thick nails there was a rusted iron collar around its neck with a few links of broken chain attached now its claws stopped grinding against rock and its tail came up to cover its eyes what is it trying to do sparthera whispered well it seems to be trying to hide in that little crack oh for the love of khulm you mean its scared the beast gave a long wailing moan at the sound of her voice its claws resumed scratching rock let it alone sung said he swung the torch around to reveal the rest of the cave they found a torn and scattered pack with the remains of weevily flour and some broken boxes nearly collapsed from dry rot two skeletons were laid out as for a funeral they had not died in bed the rib cage on one seemed to have been torn wide open the other seemed intact below the neck but it was still wearing a bronze helmet bearing the crest of a soldier of rynildissen and the helmet and skull had been squashed as flat as a misers sandwich aside from the small stream that ran between them and assorted gypsum deposits the cave was empty im afraid the regents army got here first sung said sparthera bent above one of the bodies do you think that thing did this did it kill them or just gnaw the bodies it doesnt seem dangerous now it probably wasnt all that scared in the beginning sung was grinning gar must have left it here to guard the treasure with a chain to keep it from running away when the regents soldiers found the cave it must have got the first ones in then the rest piled in and pounded it into mush conjured beasts like that are practically impossible to kill but did you notice the scars on the muzzle and forelegs it hasnt forgotten i feel sorry for it sparthera said then the truth came home to her and she said i feel sorry for us the treasure must have been gone for years exceptthe talisman led us here sung walked forward following the talisman he stopped above the skeleton with the flattened skull ta netyillo yes he reached into the rib cage and came up with a mass of color flickering in his hands sparthera reached into it and found a large ruby there were three others besides and two goodsized emeralds sung laughed long and hard so we have a greedy soldier to thank he ran in saw a pile of jewels snatched up a fistful and swallowed them he must have thought it would come out all right in the end instead gars pet got him sung wiped his eyes with the back of his hand fate is a wonderful thing here give me those she did and sung began tracing the curve on the talisman one jewel at a time she said they wouldnt have left a talisman of levitation no they wouldnt and this stuff isnt worth nearly my weight in gold sung stiffened the pointer its pointing into the wall itself he got up and began moving along the wall sparthera grimaced but said nothing sung called either its cursed deep in there or theres another cave or why do i bother its pointing to rynildissen maybe other places too there was a war with sarpuree seventy years ago we lost so there was tribute to pay i dont even have to guess where the regent got the money to pay for it all he may have sold most of the treasure humph yes and if there were any decorative items left they could be spread all through the palace and some of the soldiers probably hid a few little things like that diamond bird even if we were crazy enough to rob the regents palace wed never get it all its the end of our treasure hunt girl but you said sung how can i ever win my freedom if we dont go on oh well go on but not looking for oars treasure sung scooped the jewels into his pocket and handed her the little diamond bird keep this as a memento the rest well ive thought of opening a toy shop in rynildissen maybe a toy shop sung frowned you dont like toys do you everybody likes toys but were adults sung girl dont you know that human beings are natural magicians i think its hereditary the magic was always there to be used but now it isnt and we still want magic especially children those toys arent no of course not but theyre as close as youre likely to get these days especially in a city toys from far places might sell very well she was still angry sung reached to run his fingers over the tawny stubble on her head well live well enough come kiss me little thief seven years isnt such a long time sparthera kissed him she couldnt help it then she said i wondered if a diamond bird could be your talisman of levitation sungs eyes widened i wonder its worth a try not in here though he took the bird and scrambled up scree toward the cave entrance sparthera started after him then holding her torch high she looked up the rock tapered to a high natural vault it looked unstable dangerous something a bright point compelled she continued climbing after sung but the diamond trinket was no flying spell shed been wrong no soldier would have stolen that it would be treason by staying here she would be working in sungs best interests there was no point in shouting after him if she were wrong at least he wouldnt be disappointed sung was out of sight sparthera scrambled back down and set to work the soldiers had taken all of their equipment before they turned the cave into a crypt for their brethren by pulling down the entrance they had taken armor but left the crushed helmet that was part of one corpse they had taken the metal point from a snapped spear but a threepace length of shaft remained sparthera dipped a piece of cloth into the stream then into some of the mouldy flour scattered on the rock floor she kneaded the cloth until it had turned gooey then wrapped it around the broken tip of the spear she climbed scree to get closer to the ceiling and reached up with the spear toward a bright point on the cave roof it stuck she pulled it down thin gold filigree carved into a pair of birds wings about the size of her two hands it tugged upward against her fingers lift me she whispered and she rose until her head bumped rock set me down she whispered and drifted back to earth no castle in the world held a room so high that she could not rob it with this and she waited for the impulse that would send her scrambling out to give it to sung sung was bounding downhill with his arms flapping one hand clutching the diamond bauble looking very like a little boy at play he turned in fury at the sound of spartheras laughter ive found it she called holding the golden talisman high and as sung ran toward her beaming delight sparthera gloated for the instant in which she flew spartheras weight in gold had been far less than the value of the paltry treasure they had found she might stay with sung long enough to take back the jewels or at least the wings she might even stay longer if he were right about the toy shop perhaps he need never learn that she was free flare time if the starships arrival had done nothing else for bronze legs this was enough he was seeing the sky again for this past week the rammers had roamed through touchdown city the fiftyyearold colony was still small everybody knew everybody it was hard to get used to this influx of oddlyaccented strangers stumbling about with vacuous smiles and eyes wide with surprise and pleasure even the medean humans were catching the habit in his thirtyfour earthyears of life calvin bronze legs miller had explored fifteen thousand square miles of the infinite variety that was medea strange that it took people from another world to make him look up here was a pretty picture sunset over the wild lands north of the colony peaks to the south were limned in bluishwhite from the farmlands beyond from the lamps that kept terrestrial plants growing everything else was red infinite shades of red to heatward a level horizon cut the great disk of argo in half you could feel the heat on your cheek and watch sullenly glowing storms move in bands across the face of the redhot superjovian world to coidward phrixus and helle were two glaring pink dots following each other down to the ridge the jet stream stretched straight across the blue sky a pinkishwhite band of cloud from horizon to horizon thirty or forty multicolored balloons linked in a cluster were settling to graze a scumcovered rain pool in the valley below him bluetinged shadows pooled in the valley and three human shapes moved through the red and orange vegetation bronze legs recognized lightning harness and grace carpenter even at this distance the third had a slightly hunchbacked look and a metal headdress gleamed in her straight black hair that would be rachel subramaniams memory record ing equipment her head kept snapping left and right ever eager for new sights bronze legs grinned he tried to imagine how this must look to a rammer an offworlder he succeeded only in remembering himself as a child all this strangeness all this red he turned the howler and continued uphill at the crest of the ridge a fux waited for him the pinkishwhite suns behind her she was a black silhouette four thin legs and two thin arms a pointed face and a narrow torso bent in an l a lean mean centaurshape as he topped the ridge and let the howler settle on its air cushion the fur backed away several meters bronze legs wondered why then guessed the answer it wasnt the smell of him fuses liked that she was putting the ridge between herself and the white glare from touchdown citys farming lamps she said i am long nose bronze legs i meet you on purpose i meet you on purpose how goes your foray to heatward we start tomorrow at dawn you postponed it once before she was accusing him the fuxes were compulsive about punctuality an odd trait in a bronze age culture like certain traits in humans it probably tied into their sex lives timing could be terribly important when a fux was giving birth the ship from the stars came he said we waited we want to take one of the star people along and the delay lets us recheck the vehicles long nose was black with dull darkred markings she bore a longbow over one shoulder and a quiver and shovel slung over her lower back her snout was sharply pointed but not abnormally so for a fux she might be named for keen curiosity or a keen sense of smell she said i learn that your purpose is more than exploration but not even the postmales can tell what it is power said bronze legs the harnessed lightning that makes our machines go comes as light from argo in the hot end the clouds will never hide argo from our sight our lightning makers can run without rest go north instead said long nose you will find it safer and cooler too storms run constantly in the north i have been there free lightning for your use if shed been talking to lightning harness she would have suffered through an hours lecture how the heat exchangers ran on the flood of infrared light from argo focussed by mirrors how argo stayed always in the same place in medeas sky so that mirrors could be mounted on a hillside facing to heatward and never moved again but the colony was growing and medeas constant storms constantly blocked the mirrors bronze legs only grinned at her why dont we just do it our way whoall is coming only six of us dark winds children did not emerge in time deadeye will desert us early she will give birth in a day and must stay to guard the is nest the word you use right of all the words that might describe the fuxes way of giving birth nest carried the least unpleasant connotations so she will be guarding her nest when we return she will be male then sniffer intends to become pregnant tonight she will leave us further on and be there to help us on our return if we need help we take a postmale harvester and another sixleg female broad flanks who can carry him some of the time gimpy wants to come will she slow us bronze legs laughed he knew gimpy a fourleg female as old as some postmales who had lost her right foreleg to the viciously fast medean monster humans called a b gimpy was fairly agile considering she could crawl on her belly for all we care its the crawlers thatll slow us and the power plant were moving a lot of machinery the prefab power plant housing for technicians sensing tools digging tools what tools should we take go armed you wont need water bags well make our own water we made you some parasols made from mirrorcloth theyll help you stand the heat for awhile when it gets really hot youll have to ride in the crawlers we will meet you at the crawling machines at dawn long nose turned and moved downslope into a redandorange jungle moving something like a cat in its final rush at a bird legs bent belly low they had been walking since early afternoon twelve hours with a long break for lunch lightning sighed with relief as he set down the farming lamp hed been carrying on his shoulders grace helped him spread the tripod and extend the mount until the lamp stood six meters tall rachel subramaniam sat down in the orange grass and rubbed her feet she was puffing grace carpenter a medean xenobiologist and in her early forties was a largeboned woman broad of silhouette and built like a farm wife lightning harness was tall and lean and lanternjawed a twentyfouryearold power plant engineer both were pale as ghosts beside rachel on medea only the farmers were tanned rachel was built light some of her memory recording equipment was embedded in padding along her back giving her a slightly hunchbacked look her scalp implants were part of a polished silver cap the badge of her profession she had spent the past two years under the sunlights aboard a web rainship her skin was bronze to rachel medeas pale citizens had seemed frail unathietic until now now she was annoyed there had been little opportunity for hikes aboard morven but she might have noticed the muscles and hard hands common to any recent colony lightning pointed uphill company something spidery stood on the crest of the coidward ridge black against the suns rachel asked what is it fux female somewhere between seven and eighteen years of age and not a virgin beyond that i cant tell from here rachel was astonished how can you know all that count the legs grace didnt you tell her about fuxes grace was chuckling lightnings showing off dear the fuxes go fertile around age seven they generally have their first litter right away they drop their first set of hindquarters with the eggs in them and that gives them a half a lifetime to learn how to move as a quadruped then they wait till theyre seventeen or eighteen to have their second litter unless the tribe is underpopulated which sometimes happens dropping the second set of hindquarters exposes the male organs and shes got four legs not a virgin i thought you must have damn good eyes lightning not that good what are they like well said grace the postmales are the wise ones bright talkative and not nearly so frenetic as the females its hard to get a female to stand still for long the males oh for three years after the second litter theyre kind of crazy the tribe keeps them penned the females only go near them when they want to get pregnant lightning had finished setting the lamp take a good look around before i turn this on you know what youre about to see dutifully rachel looked about her memorizing the farming lamps stood everywhere around touchdown city it was less a city than a village surrounded by farmlands for more than a week rachel had seen only the tiny part of medea claimed by humans until in early afternoon of this long medean day she and grace and lightning had left the farmlands the reddish light had bothered her for a time but there was much to see and after all this was the real medea orange grass stood kneehigh in slender leaves with sharp hard pointa a score of flaccid multicolored balloons linked by threads that resembled spiderweb had settled on a stagnant pond there was a grove of almosttrees hairy rather than leafy decked in all the colors of autumn the biggest was white and bare and dead clouds of bugs filled the air everywhere except around the humans a pair of things glided into the swarms scooping their dinner out of the air they had fivemeter wingspans small batlike torsos and huge heads that were all mouth with gaping hairfilled slits behind the head where gill slits would be on a fish their undersides were sky blue a sixlegged creature the size of a sheep stood up against the dead almosttree gripped it with four limbs and seemed to chew at it rachel wondered if it was eating the wood then she saw myriads of black dots spread across the white and a long sticky tongue slurping them up grace tapped rachels arm and pointed into the grass rachel saw a warriors copper shield painted with cryptic heraldics it was a flattened turtle shell and the yelloweyed beaked face that looked back at her was not turtlelike at all something small struggled in its beak suddenly the mock turtle whipped around and zzzzed away on eight churning legs there was no bottom shell to hamper the legs the real medea now said lightning he turned on the farming lamp white light made the valley suddenly less alien rachel felt something within her relaxing but things were happening all around her the flat turtle stopped abruptly it swallowed hard then pulled head and limbs under its shell the flying bugstrainers whipped around and flew hard for the hairy trees the clouds of bugs simply vanished the longtongued beast let go of its tree turned and scratched at the ground and was gone in seconds this is what happens when a sun flares lightning said theyre both flare suns flares dont usually last more than half an hour and most medean animals just dig in till its over a lot of plants go to seed like this grass yes the slender leaves were turning puffy cottony but the hairy trees reacted differently they were suddenly very slender the foliage pulled tight against the trunks the balloons werent reacting at all lightning said thats why we dont worry much about medean life attacking the crops the lamps keep them away but not all of them on medea every rule has exceptions grace said yeah here look under the grass lightning pushed cottoncovered leaves aside with his hands and the air was suddenly full of white fluff rachel saw millions of black specks covering the lower stalks we them locusts they swarm in flare time and eat everything in sight terran plants poison them of course but they wreck the crops first he let the leaves close by now there was white fluff everywhere like a lowlying fog patch moving east on the wind what else can i show you keep your eyes on the balloons and are there cameras in that thing rachel laughed and touched the metal helmet sometimes she could forget she was wearing it but her neck was thicker more muscular than the average womans cameras in a sense my eyes are cameras for the memory tape the balloons rested just where they had been the artificial flare hadnt affected them wait they werent flaccid any more they were swollen taut straining at the rootlets that held them to the bottom of the pond suddenly they rose all at once still linked by spiderweb beautiful they use the ijy for energy to make hydrogen said grace uv wouldnt bother them anyway they have to take more of it at high altitude ive been told are they intelligent balloons no grace actually snorted theyre no brighter than so much seaweed but they own the planet weve sent probes to the hot end you know we saw balloons all the way and weve seen them as far coidward west youd say as far west as the icy sea we havent gone beyond the rim of ice yet but youve been on medea fifty years and just getting started lightning said he turned off the farming lamp the world was plunged into red darkness the fluffy white grass was gone leaving bare soil aswarm with black specks gradually the hairy trees loosened fluffed out soil churned near the dead tree and released the tree feeder grace picked up a few of the locusts they were not bigger than termites held close to the eye they each showed a translucent bubble on its back they cant swarm grace said with satisfaction our flare didnt last long enough they couldnt make enough hydrogen some did lightning said there were black specks on the wind not many always something new said grace tractor probe junior was moving into the hot end ahead was the vast desert hotter than boiling water where argo stood always at noon already the strange dry plants were losing their grip leaving bare rock and dust at the final shore of the ring sea the waves were sudsy with salt in solution and the shore was glittering white the hot steamy wind blew inland to heatward and then upward carrying a freight of balloons the air was full of multicolored dots all going up into the stratosphere at the upper reach of the probes vision some of the frailer balloons were popping but the thin membranous corpses still fluttered toward heaven rachel shifted carefully in her chair she caught bronze legs miller watching her from a nearby table her answering grin was rueful she had not finished the hike grace and lightning had been setting up camp when bronze legs miller came riding down the hill rachel had grasped that golden opportunity she had returned to touchdown city riding behind bronze legs on the howlers saddle after a night of sleep she still ached in every muscle isnt it a gorgeous sight mayor curly jackson wasnt eating he watched avidly with his furry chin in his hands and his elbows on the great oaken tablethe dignitaries table the medeans were so proud of it had taken forty years to grow the tree medea had changed its people even the insides of buildings were different from those of other worlds the communal dining hall was a great dome lit by a single lamp at its zenith it was bright and it cast sharp shadows as if the early colonists daunted by the continual light show the flare suns the bluish farming lamps the redhot storms moving across argohad given themselves a single sun indoors but it was a wider cooler sun giving yellower light than a rammer was used to one great curve of the wall was a holograph projection screen the tractor probe was tracing the path the expedition would follow and broadcasting what it saw now it moved over hills of white sea salt the picture staggered and lurched with the probes motion and wavered with rising air currents captain janice borg staring avidly with a forkful of curry halfway to her mouth jumped as mayor curly lightly punched her shoulder the mayor was blue eyes and a lump of nose poking through a carefully tended wealth of blond hair and beard he was darkened by farming lamps not only did he supervise the farms he farmed see it captain thats why the ring sea is mostly fresh water captain borgs hair was auburn going gray she was handsome rather than pretty her voice of command had the force of a bullwhip one obeyed by reflex her offduty voice was a soft dreamy contralto right right the seawater moves always to the hot end it starts as glaciers doesnt it they break off in the icy sea and float beatward any salt goes that way too in the hot end the water boils away and you get some tides dont you argo wobbles a little well its medea that wobbles a little but right so the seawater spills off into the salt flats at high tide and boils away there and the vapor goes back to the glaciers along the jet stream she turned suddenly to rachel and barked you getting all this rachel nodded hiding a smile more than two hundred years had passed on the settled worlds while captain borg cruised the trade circuit she didnt really understand memory tapes they were too recent rachel looked about the communal dining hall and was conscious as always of the vast unseen audience looking through her eyes listening through her ears feeling the dwindling aches of a stiff hike tasting blazing hot medean curry through her mouth it was all going into the memory tape with no effort on her part curly said we picked a good site for the power plant before the first probe broke down heatward slope of a hillside well be coming up on it in a few hours is this the kind of thing you want or am i boring you i want it all did you try that tape the mayor shook his head his eyes suddenly evasive why not well the mayor said slowly im a little leery of what i might remember its all filtered through your brain isnt it rachel of course i dont think id like remembering being a girl rachel was mildly surprised rolechanging was part of the kick male or female an epicurean or a superbly muscled physical culture addict or an intellectual daydreamer a child again or an old woman well some didnt like it i could give you a mans tape curly theres mcauliffes balloon trip into the big gas giant in sol system captain borg cut in sharply what about the charles baker sontag tape he did a years tour in miramon lluagor system curly the lluagorians use balloons for everything youd love it curly was confused just what kind of balloons not living things curly fabric filled with gas lluagor has a red dwarf sun no radiation storms and not much ultraviolet they have to put their farms in orbit and they do most of their living in orbit and its all inflated balloons even the spacecraft the planet they use mainly for mining and factories but its pretty too so theyve got cities slung under hundreds of gasbags the tractor probe lurched across mile after mile of dimlit pink salt hills rachel remembered a memory tape in morvens library a critical reading of the elder and younger eddas by a teacher of history and poetry would medeans like that here you had the land of the frost giants and the land of the fire giants with midgard between and the ring sea to stand in for the midgard serpent and no dearth of epic monsters from what shed heard captain borg spoke with an edge in her voice nobodys going to force you to use a new and decadent entertainment medium from the stars curly oh now i didnt but theres a point you might consider distance distance theres the trade circuit earth toupan lluagor sereda horvendile koschei earth again six planets circling six stars a few light years apart the web ramships go round and round and everyone on the ring gets news entertainment seeds and eggs new inventions theres the trade circuit and theres medea youre too far from horvendile curly oddly enough were aware of that captain borg no need to get huffy im trying to make a point why did you come variety curiosity the grassisalwaysgreener syndrome the same thing that made us rainmers in the first place captain borg did not add altruism the urge to keep the worlds civilized but will we keep coming curly medea is the strangest place that ever had a breathable atmosphere youve got a potential tourist trap here you could have ramships dropping by every twenty years we need that yes you do so remember that rammers dont build starships its taxpayers that build starships what do they get out of it memory tapes yes it used to be holos times change holos arent as involving as memory tapes and they take too long to watch so its memory tapes does that mean we have to use them no said captain borg then ill try your tourists view of lluagor system when i get time curly stood and i better get going twentyfive hours to dawn it only takes ten minutes rachel said how long to recover how long to assimilate a whole earthyear of someone elses memories i better wait after he was gone rachel asked what was wrong with giving him the jupiter tape i remembered mcauliffe was a homosexual so what he was all alone in that capsule it might matter to someone like curly i dont say it would i say it might every world is different you ought to know the rumor mill said that mayor curly and captain borg had shared a bed though he hadnt shown it too lightly captain borg said i should but i dont oh hes closed its the usual problem i think he sees me coming back in sixty or seventy years and me ten years older doesnt want to get too involved janice dammit if theyre so afraid of change how could their parents have busted their asses to settle a whole new world change is the one thing yeah what is it did you ask him or did he ask you captain borg frowned he asked me why nobodys asked me said rachel oh well ask someone customs differ but he asked you i dazzled him with sex appeal or maybe not rachel shall i ask curly about it there might be something we dont know maybe you wear your hair wrong rachel shook her head no but okay the rest of the crew dont seem to be having problems nearly dawn the sky was thick with dark clouds but the heatward horizon was clear with argo almost fully risen the dull red disk would never rise completely not here already it must be sinking back it was earthnight now the farming lamps were off crops and livestock kept terrestrial time rows of green plants stretched away to the south looking almost black in this light in the boundary of bare soil between the wilds and the croplands half a dozen fuxes practiced spear casts that was okay with bronze legs humans didnt spend much time in that border region they plowed the contents of their toilets into it to sterilize it of medean microorganisms and fertilize it for next years crops the fuxes didnt seem to mind the smell bronze legs waited patiently beside his howler he wished windstorm would do the same the two housesized crawlers were of a pattern familiar to many worlds long bulbous pressure hulls mounted on groundeffect platforms they were decades old but they had been tended with loving care hydrogen fuel cells powered them one of the crawlers now carried welded to its roof a sender capable of reaching morven in its present equatorial orbit another good reason for waiting for the web rainships arrival the third and largest vehicle was the power plant itself fully assembled and tested mounted on the groundeffect systems from two crawlers and with a crawlers control cabin welded on in front it trailed a raft yet another ground effect system covered by a padded platform with handrails the fuxes would be riding that all vehicles were loaded and boarded well ahead of time windstorm wolheim moved among them ticking off lists in her head and checking them against what she could see the tall leggy redhead was a chronic worrier phrixus was suddenly there a hot pink point near argo the fuxes picked up their spears and trotted off northward bronze legs lifted his howler on its air cushion and followed behind him the three bigger vehicles whispered into action and windstorm ran for her howler rachel was in the passenger seat of the lead crawler looking out through the great bubble windscreen in the hot end the crawlers would house the power plant engineers now they were packed with equipment square kilometers of thin silvered plastic sheet and knockdown frames to hold it all would become solar mirrors black plastic and more frames would become the radiator fins mounted on the back of that hill in the hot end there were spools of superconducting cable and flywheels for power storage rachel kept bumping her elbow on the corner of a crate the pinkish daylight was dimming graying as the jet stream spread to engulf the sky the fuxes were far ahead keeping no obvious formation in this light they seemed a convocation of mythical monsters centaurs eightlimbed dragons a misshapen dwarf the dwarf was oddest of all rachel had seen him close a nasty caricature of a man with a foxy face huge buttocks exaggerated male organs and a tail longer than he was tall yet harvester was solemn and slowmoving and he seemed to have the respect of fuxes and humans both the vehicles whispered along at thirty kilometers an hour uphill through orange grass swerving around hairy trees a fine drizzle began lightning harness turned on the wipers rachel asked isnt this where we were a few days back medean yesterday thats right said grace hard to tell were going north arent we why not straight east its partly for our benefit dear well be in the habitable domains longer well see more variety well both learn more when we swing around to heatward well be nearer the north pole it wont get hot so fast good bronze legs and a woman rachel didnt know flanked them on the oneseater groundeffect vehicles the bowlers bronze legs wore shorts and in fact his legs were bronze black by race hed paled to rachels color during years of medean sunlight rachel asked half to herself why not just bronze grace understood they didnt mean his skin what the fuxes named him for the time his howler broke down and stranded him forty miles from civilization he walked home he was carrying some heavy stuff but a troop of fuxes joined him and they couldnt keep up theyve got lots of energy but no stamina so they named him bronze legs bronze is the hardest metal they knew till we came the rain had closed in a beast like yesterdays flying bug strainers took to the air almost under the treads for a moment it was face to face with rachel its large eyes and tremendous mouth all widened in horror a wing ticked the windshield as it dodged lightning cursed and turned on the headlights as if by previous agreement lights sprang to life on the bowlers and the vehicles behind we dont like to do that said lightning do what use headlights every domain is different you never know what the local life will do when a flare comes not tifi youve watched it happen here its okay nothing worse than locusts even the headlights had a yellowish tinge rachel thought the gray cliffs ahead ran hundreds of kilometers to heatward and coldward they were no more than a few hundred feet high but they were fresh and new medea wobbled a little in its course around argo and the tides could raise savage quakes all the rocks had sharp angles wind and life had not had a chance to wear them down the pass was new too as if god had cleft the spine of the new mountains with a battleax the floor of it was filled with rubble the vehicles glided above the broken rock riding high with fans on maximum now the land sloped gently down and the expedition followed through the drizzle bronze legs glimpsed a grove of trees hairy trees like those near touchdown city but different they grew like spoons standing on end with the cup of the spoon facing argo the ground was covered with tightly curled black filaments a plant the color and texture of bronze legs own hair they had changed domain bronze legs hadnt been in this territory but he remembered that windstorm had he called anything unexpected around here bs they do get around dont they anything else its an easy slope down to the shore windstorm called but then theres a kind of parasitic fungus floating on the ocean wont hurt us but it can kill a medean animal in an hour i told harvester hell make the others wait for us they rode in silence for a bit drizzle made it hard to see much bronze legs wasnt worried the bs would stay clear of their headlights this was explored territory and even after they left it the probes had mapped their route that professional tourist windstorm called suddenly did you get to know her not really what about her mayor curly said to be polite when was i ever not polite but i didnt grow up with her bronze legs nobody did we know more about fuxes than we do about rammers and this ones peculiar for a rammer how could a woman give up all her privacy like that you tell me i wish i knew what shed do in a church at least she wouldnt close her eyes shes a dedicated tourist can you picture that but she might not get involved either bronze legs thought hard before he added i tried one of those memory tapes what you history of the fission period in eurasia from morvens library education not entertainment why that well whats it like its its like i did a lot of research and formed conclusions and checked them out and sometimes changed my mind and it gave me a lot of satisfaction there are still some open questions like how the soviets actually got the fission bomb and the vietnam war and the arab takeover but i know whos working on that and its like that but it doesnt connect to anything it sits in my head in a clump but its kind of fun windstorm and i got it all in ten minutes you want to hear a libelous song about president peanut through the drizzle they could see the restless stirring of the ring ocean a band of fuxes waited on the sand windstorm turned her howler in a graceful curve back toward the blur of the crawlers headlights to lead them bronze legs dowsed his lights and glided toward the fuxea they had chosen a good resting place far from the dangerous shore in a broad stretch of black mans hair that any marauder would have to cross most of the fuxes were lying down the fourlegged female had been impregnated six medean days ago her time must be near she scratched with sharp claws at her itching hindquarters harvester came to meet bronze legs the postmale biped was slow with age but not clumsy that tremendous length of black tail was good for his balance it was tipped with a bronze spearhead harvester asked wifi we follow the shoreline if we may choose we will keep your vessels between us and the shore we plan to go straight across bronze legs told him youll ride the raft behind the bigger vessel in the water are things dangerous to us said harvester he glanced shoreward and added things small things large a large one comes bronze legs took one look and reached for his intercom lightning hairy jill turn your searchlights on that thing fast the fuxes were up and reaching for their spears so its the fuxes who give you your nicknames rachel said why did they call you lightning i tend the machines that make lightning and move it through metal wires at least thats how we explained it to the fuxes and windstorm you saw the big redhead girl on the other howler she was on guard one earthnight when a troop of fuxes took a short cut through the wheat crop she really gave them hell half of touchdown city must have heard her and you grace they named me when i was a lot younger grace glared at lightning who was very busy driving and clearly not listening and by no means was he smiling but they didnt call me grace the way we have children the fuxes think thats hilarious rachel didnt ask they called me boobs rachel felt the need for a change of subject lightning are you getting tired would you like me to take over im okay can you drive a crawler actually ive never done it i can run a howler though in any terrain maybe well give you one after then bronze legs voice bellowed from the intercom something came out of the ocean a great swollen myriapod with tiny jointed arms moving around a funnelshaped mouth teeth churned in the gullet the fuxes cast their spears and fled bronze legs tucked harvester under one arm and sped shoreward the howler listed to port deadeye fell behind two fuxes turned back and took her arms and pulled her along the monster flowed up the beach faster than any of them ignoring the spears stuck in its flesh one two three searchlights flashed from the vehicles and played over the myriapod the beams were bluish unlike the headlights flare sunlight the myriapod stopped turned clumsily and began to retreat down the beach it had nearly reached the water when it lost coordination the legs thrashed frantically and without effect as rachel watched in horrible fascination things were born from the beast they crawled from its back and sides hundreds of them they were dark red and dogsized they did not leave the myriapod they stayed on it feeding its legs were quiet now three of the fuxes darted down the beach snatched up their fallen spears and retreated just as fast the mynapod was little more than a skeleton now and the dogsized feeders were beginning to spread across the sand the fuxes climbed aboard the aircushioned raft that trailed behind the mobile power plant they arranged their packs and settled themselves the paired vehicles lifted and glided toward the water lightning lifted the crawler and followed rachel said but well be okay lightning assured her well stay high and cross fast and there are always the searchlights grace tell him there are animals that like the searchlights grace patted her hand the expedition set off across the water the colony around touchdown city occupied part of a fat peninsula projecting deep into the ring sea it took the expedition twelve hours to cross a bay just smaller than the gulf of mexico vermilion scum patches covered the water schools of flying nonfish veered and dived at sight of the wrongcolored headlights the fuxes stayed flat on their platform but the water was smooth the ride was smooth and nothing attacked them the rain stopped and left phrixus and helle far up the morning sky the cloudhighway of the jet stream showed through a broken cloud deck lightning and the other drivers left their headlights on since the sea life seemed to avoid them somewhere in there rachel reclined her chair and went to sleep she woke when the crawler settled and tilted under her her brain was muzzy and she had slept with the recorder on that disturbed her usually she switched it off to sleep dreams were private the crawlers door had dropped to form a stairway and the crawler was empty rachel went out the crawlers howlers raft and mobile power plant were parked in a circle and tents had been set up inside there was no living human being in sight rachel shrugged she stepped between a howler and the raft and stopped this was nothing like the medea shed seen up to now rolling hills were covered with chrome yellow bushes they stood waist high and so densely packed that no ground was visible anywhere clouds of insects swarmed and sticky filaments shot up from the bushes to stab into the swarms the fuxes had cut themselves a clearing they tended one who was restless twitching bronze legs miller hailed her from their midst rachel waded through the bushes they resisted her like thick tar the insects scattered away from her deadeyes near her time bronze legs said poor baby we wont move on until shes dropped her nest the fux showed no swelling of pregnancy rachel remembered what she had been told of the fux manner of bearing children suddenly she didnt want to see it yet how could she leave she would be omitting a major part of the experience of medea she compromised she whispered earnestly to bronze legs should we be here wont they object he laughed were here because we make good insect repellants no we like hnmans deadeyes voice was slurred now rachel saw that the left eye was pink with no pupil are you the one who has been among the stars yes the feverish fux reached up to take rachels hand so much strangeness in the world when we know all of the world it may be we will go among the stars too you have great courage her fingers were slender and hard like bones she let go to claw at the hairless red rash between her front and back legs her tail thrashed suddenly and bronze legs dodged the fux was quiet for a time a sixlegged fux sponged her back with water the sponge seemed to be a medean plant deadeye said i learned from humans that deadeye meant accurate of aim i set out to be the best spearcaster in she trailed off into a language of barking and yelping the oddlooking biped held conversation with her perhaps he was soothing her deadeye howledand fell apart she crawled forward pulling against the ground with hands and forefuet and her hindquarters were left behind the hindquarters were red and dripping at the juncture and the tail slid through them more than a meter of thick black tail stained with red and as long as harvesters now the other fuxes came forward some to tend deadeye some to examine the hindquarters in which muscles were still twitching ten minutes later deadeye stood up he made it look easy given his tail and his low center of mass perhaps it was he spoke in his own language and the fuxes filed away into the yellow bushes in the human tongue deadeye said i must guard my nest alone travel safely see you soon bronze legs said he led rachel after the fuxes he wont want company now hell guard the nest till the little ones eat most of it and come out then hell go sexcrazy but by that time well be back how are you feeling a little woozy rachel said too much blood take my arm the color of their arms matched perfectly is she safe here i mean he deadeye heu learn to walk faster than you think and hes got his spear we havent seen anything dangerous around rachel they dont have a safety hangup i dont understand sometimes they get killed okay they get killed deadeye has his reasons for being here if his children live theyll own this place some of the adultsll stay to help them along thats how they get new territory confusing you mean they have to be born here right fuxes visit they dont conquer after awhile they have to go home grace is still trying to figure if thats physiology or just a social quirk but sometimes they visit to give birth and thats how they get new homes i dont think fuxesll ever be space travelers we have it easier that we do bronze legs i want to make love to you he missed a step he didnt look at her no sorry then she said a little desperately will you at least tell me whats wrong did i leave out a ritual or take too many baths or something bronze legs said stage fright he sighed when he saw that she didnt understand look ordinarily id be looking for some privacy for us which wouldnt be easy because taking your clothes off in an unfamiliar domain never mind when i make love with a woman i dont want a billion strangers criticizing my technique the memory tapes right rachel i dont know where you find men who want that kind of publicity windstorm and i we let a postmale watch us once but after all they arent human i could turn off the tape it records memories right unless you forgot about me completely which i choose to consider impossible youd be remembering me for the record wouldnt you she nodded and went back to the crawler to sleep others would be sleeping in the tents she didnt want the company the howlers motor was half old half new the new parts had a handmade look bulky with file marks one of the fans was newer cruder heavier than the other rachel could only hope the medeans were good with machinery the toughlooking redhead asked are you sure you want to go through with this i took a howler across most of koschei rachel told her she straightened then swung up onto the saddle its original soft plastic seat must have disintegrated what replaced it looked and felt like tanned skin top speed a hundred and forty kilometers an hour overridethis switchboosts the fans so i can fly ten minutes of flight then the batter ies block up and ive got to come down six slots in the groundeffect skirt so i can go in any direction the main thing is to keep my balance especially when im flying windstorm did not seem reassured you wont get that kind of performance out of a fiftyyearold machine treat it tender and dont fly if youre in a hurry because youll be using most of the power just to keep you up two more things she reached out to put rachels hands on a switch and a knob her own hands were large and strong with prominent veins searchlight this knob swings it around and this raises and lowers it its your best weapon if it doesnt work flee second thing is your goggles sling them around your neck where are they windstorm dug goggles from the howlers saddlebag a flexible strap and two large hemispheres of red glass a similar set swung from her own neck you should never have to ask that question again on medea here the other vehicles were ready to go windstorm jogged to her own howler leaving rachel with the feeling that she had failed a test it was past noon of the medean day harvester was riding giggles the sixlegged virgin the rest of the fuxes rode the groundeffect raft the vehicles rode high above the forest of chrome yellow bushes windstorm spoke from the intercom we stay ahead of the crawlers and to both sides were looking for anything dangerous if you see something youre afraid of sing out dont wait rachel eased into position the feel of the howler was coming back to her it weighed half a kiloton but you stifi did some of your steering by shifting weight windstorm arent you tired i got some sleep while deadeye was dropping her hindquarters maybe windstorm didnt trust anyone else to supervise the rammer rachel was actually relieved it struck her that most medeans had lost too many of their safety hangups the bushes ended sharply at the shore of a fastflowing river carrying broad patches of scarlet scum some of the patches bloomed with flowers of startling green harvester boarded the raft to cross there was wheatfield beyond but the yellow plants were feathery and four meters high hemispheres of white rock appeared with suspicious regularity the expedition had swung around to northandheatward argo stood above the peaks of a rounded mountain range manylimbed birds rode the air above them rachel looked up to see one dropping toward her face she could see the hooked beak and great claws aiming at her eyes her blind fingers sought the searchlight controls she switched on the searchlight and swung the beam around and up like a laser cannon first fire then aim calmly now the beam found the bird and illuminated it iii blue fire a fearsome sight wings like oiled leather curved meatripping beak muscular forelegs with long talons and the hind legs were long slender and tipped each with a single sword blade they werent for walking at all nor for anything but weaponry the bird howled shut its eyes tight and tried to turn in the air its body curled in a ball its wings folded around it rachel dropped the beam to keep it pinned until it smacked hard into the wheatfield the intercom said nice thank you rachel sounded deceptively calm grace wants to call a halt windstorm said up by that next boulder fine the boulders were all roughly the same size fairly regular hemispheres one and a half meters across grace and bronze legs came out of the crawler lugging instruments on a dolly they unloaded a box on one side of the boulder and grace went to work on it bronze legs moved the dolly around to the other side and unfurled a silver screen when rachel tried to speak grace shushed her she fiddled a bit with various dials then turned on the machine a shadowshow formed on the screen a circle of shadow and darker shapes within grace cursed and touched dials featherlightly the blurred shadows took on detail shadows of bones lighter shadows of flesh there were four oversized heads mostly jaws overlapping near the center and four tails near the rim and a maze of legs and spines between four creatures all wrapped intimately around each other to just fill the shell i knew it grace cried they were too regular they had to be eggs or nests or plants or something like that windstorm dear if we pile this junk back on the dolly can you tow it to the next rock they did that the next rock was very like the first an almost perfect hemisphere with a surface like white plaster rachel rapped it with her knuckles it felt like stone but the deepradar shadow showed three bigheaded foetuses just filling their environment plus a tiny one that had failed to grow well they all seem to be at the same stage of development grace observed i wonder if its a seasonal thing rachel shook her head its different every time you turn around lord you learn a place you walk a couple of kilometers you have to start all over again grace dont you ever get frustrated you cant run fast enough to stay in one place i love it and its worse than you think dear grace folded the screen and stacked it on the dolly the domains dont stay the same we have spillovers from other domains from high winds and tidal slosh and migration id say a medean ecology is ruined every ten years then i have to learn it all over again windstorm dear id like to look at one more of these rock eggs will you tow the windstorm was sudden and violent damn it grace this isnt the way we planned it we do our biological research on the way back after we set up the power system then we can give the local monsters a chance to wreck us graces voice chilled dear it seems to me that this bit of research is quite harmless it uses up time and supplies well do it on the way back when we know weve got the spare time weve been through this pack up the deepradar and lets move now the rolling hills of featherwheat sloped gently up toward an eroded mountain range whose peaks seemed topped with pink cotton the threelegged female gimpy trotted alongside rachel talking of star travel her gait was strange rolling but she kept up as long as rachel held her howler to the power plants twenty kph she could not grasp interstellar distances rachel didnt push she spoke of wonders instead of the rings of saturn and the bubble cities of lluagor and the smithpeople and the settling of whale and dolphin colonies in strange oceans she spoke of time compression of gifting sereda with designs for crude steam engines and myriads of wafersized computer brains and returning to find steam robots everywhere farmland city streets wilderness households disneylands of fads that could explode across a planet and vanish without a trace like tobacco pipes on koschei opart garments on earth weight lifting on low gravity horvendile it was long before she got gimpy talking about herself i was of my parents second litter within a group that moved here to study your kind gimpy said they taught us bow and arrow and a better design of shovel and other things we might have died without them the way you said that second litter is there a difference yes one has the first litter when one can the second litter comes to one who proves her capability by living that long the third litter the males litter comes only with the approval of ones clan else the male is not allowed to breed thats good genetics rachel saw gimpys puzzlement i mean that your custom makes better fuxes it does i will never see my second litter gimpy said i was young when i made my mistake but it was foolish the breed improves i will not be a onelegged male they moved into a rift in the eroded mountain range and the incredible became obvious the mountains were topped with pink cotton candy it must have been sticky like cotton candy too rachel could see animpls trapped in it gimpy wanted no part of that she dropped back and boarded the raft they crossed the cotton candy with fans blasting at maximum the big vehicles blew pink froth in all directions something down there wasnt trapped at all a ton of drastically flattened pink snail with a perfect snail shell perched jauntily on its back cruised over the cotton candy leaving a slime trail that bubbled and expanded to become more pink froth it made for the still corpse of a manylimbed bird flowed over it and stopped to digest it the strangeness was getting to rachel and that was a strange thing for her she was a rammer strangeness was the one constant in her life born aboard a ramship not morven she had already gone once around the trade circuit even a rammer who returned to a world he knew must expect to find it completely changed and rachel knew that but the strangeness of medea came faster than she could swallow it or spit it out she fiddled with the intercom until she got grace yes dear im driving what is it its confusion grace why arent all planets like medea theyve all got dommns dont they deserts rain forests mountains poles and equators you see what i mean she heard the xenobiologists chuckle dear the cold pole is covered with frozen carbon dioxide where were going its hotter than boiling water what is there on the trade circuit worlds that splits up the domains mountain ranges an ocean for a heat sink temperature altitude rainfall medea has all of that plus the oneway winds and the oneway ocean currents the salinity goes from pure water to pure brine the glaciers carry veins of dry ice heatward so there are sudden jumps in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide some places there are no tides other places argo wobbles enough to make a terrific tidal slosh then again everything has to adapt to the flares some animals have shells some sea beasts can dive deep some plants seed others grow a big leaf for an umbrella beyond the pass the mountains dropped more steeply down to an arm of the ring sea rachel had no problem controlling the howler but the mobile power plant was laboring hard with its front vents wide open to hold it back and little pressure left for steering there should be no real danger two probes had mapped this course everything is more different huh excuse me dear thats got it sonofabitch we could live without that sonofabitching tail wind okay do you remember the mock turtle we showed you yesterday evening weve traced it six thousand kilometers to coldward in the icy sea its seagoing and much larger follow it heatward and it gets smaller and more active we think its the food supply glaciers stir up the bottom and the sea life loves that to heatward a bigger beast starves sometimes but we could be wrong maybe it has to conserve heat in the colder climates id like to try some experiments someday the white boulders that turned out to be giant eggs were thicker here on the heatward slopes and on the lower slopesbut this was strange the mountainsides were gay with pennants thousands of long flapping flags orange or chrome yellow rachel tried to make it out grace was still talking rachel began to feel shed opened a pandoras box the closer you look to the hot pole the more competition you find among the sea life new things flow in from coidward constantly all the sixlimbed and eightlimbed forms we think they were forced onto the land kicked out of the ocean by something bigger or meaner they left the ocean before they could adopt the usual fish shape which is four fins and a tail grace wait a minute now are you saying we yes dear the smile rachel couldnt see had to be a smirk four limbs and a tail we dropped the tail but the human form is perfectly designed for a fish rachel switched her off the hillside trees had extensive root systems that gripped rock like a strong mans fist and low almost conical trunks on each tree the tip of the trunk sprouted a single huge leaf a flapping flag orange or chrome yellow and ragged at the end all pennants and no armies some of the flags were being torn apart by the air blast from the groundeffect vehicles perhaps that was how they spread their seeds rachel thought like tapeworms ask grace shed had enough of grace and shed probably have to start with an apology the day brightened as if clouds had passed from before the sun the slopes were easing off into foothills now gusts of wind turned some of the flapping pennants into clouds of confetti it was easier to go through the papery storms than to steer around rachel used one hand as a visor the day had turned quite bright was she carryiog dark glasses of course the goggles it was a flare she kept her eyes resolutely lowered until shed pulled the red cups over her eyes and adjusted them then she turned to look the suns were behind her left shoulder and one was nearly lost in the white glare of the other bronze legs was asleep in a reclined passenger chair in the trailing crawler it was like sleeping aboard a boat at anchor but the sudden glare woke him instantly going downhill the mobile power plant rode between the two crawlers for greater safety the angle of descent hadnt seriously hampered the ponderous makeshift vehicle but all bets were off now flare the fuxes were still on the raft they could be hurt if they tumbled off at this speed but their every instinct must be telling them to get off and dig bronze legs flattened his nose against the windscreen charles hairy mcbundy fighting to slow the power plant and raft wouldnt have attention to spare and there had to be a place to stop someplace close someplace fiat dirt rather than rock and damn quick there to the left not quite flat and it ended short in a cliff tough bronze legs hit the intercom button and screamed hard left hairy and when you stop stop fast hairy was ahead of him vents had already opened in the air cushion skirts of raft and power plant robbed of thrust through the forward vents the vehicles surged left and forward bronze legs teeth ground against each other one silver parasol had opened on the raft probably harvesters and five sharp fux faces were under it their tails thrashed with their agitation grace brought the crawler around to follow left and forward too fast like the power plant hairy was on the ledge now he cut his air cushion all at once the power plant dropped its skirt screamed against rock then dirt then at the edge of the drop quit the fuxes boiled off the raft raised parasols and began digging the crawler vibrated sickeningly as grace cut the air cushion she was wearing her ruby goggles so was bronze legs he must have donned them without help from his conscious mind he glanced again at the fuxes and saw only silver disks and a fog of brown dirt the other crawler had stopped on the slant windstorms howler sat tilted but not rolling windstorm herself was sprinting uphill good enough she should be inside in one of the crawlers strange things could emerge in flare time where was the other howler pilot far downslope and losing ground too far to climb back in any reasonable time that was rachel the rammer wasnt it with a little skill she could turn the howler and use the larger rear vents to bring her back but she wasnt showing that skill she seemed to be trying to back up not good at all grace can we take the crawler down to her we may have to try try the intercom first dear see if you can talk her back up bronze legs tried her intercoms off oft really the little idiot and shes not about to notice the little light wait here she comes rachels howler lifted on emergency power hovered then started uphill grace said she may have trouble landing then bronze legs saw what was happening around them to rachel it seemed that everyone was in panic far above her both crawlers and the power plant had come to a screeching halt tough competent windstorm had abandoned her own vehicle and was fleeing in terror from nothing visible the fuxes the native medeans were nowhere in sight could they all know something rachel didnt she was having her own problems the damned obsolete sluggish howler refused to back up it coasted slowly frictionlessly downhill further and further from safety to hell with that she flipped the override the howler went up rachel leaned far back and the howler tilted with her staying low following the upward curve of terrain if the power quit early she wanted some chance to land but the howler purred nicely uphill faster now while rachel concentrated on her balance she was marginally aware that the gay orange pennants had all turned to dead black crepe and that certain round white boulders were cracking crumbling but when things emerged from the boulders she screamed all in an instant the mountains were acrawl with a thousand monsters their skins were shiny white their eyes were mere slits in heads that were mostly teeth as rachel rose toward the precarious safety of the crawlers the creatures chose their target and converged they ran with bodies low tails high legs an invisible blur in seconds that meager flat place where the crawlers rested was covered with rock demons no safety there she flew over the crawlers glimpsed peering faces behind the windscreens and kept going the boulders had been rare near the crest and the rock demons werent there yet neither was rachel of course shed get as far as possible before the howler quit and then what she flipped on the headlights and the searchlight too the rock demons throve in flare time but even they might fear too much flare sunlight it was worth a try the mountains rock face grew steeper and steeper no place to land unless she could reach the crest the fans howled here was the ridge coming level rachel cursed venomously the crest was carpeted in pink sticky cotton candy its proprietors had withdrawn into huge snail shells the howl of the fans dropped from contralto toward bass pale sixlegged monsters searching for meat on bare rock turned big heads to squint as rachel sank low they blurred into motion the crawler coasted just above the pink froth riding the ground effect now not really flying strange corpses and strange skeletons were marooned in that sea the wind from the fans was full of pink froth then she had crossed and was coasting downhill and it was already too late to land the howler rode centimeters above the rock too fast and gaining speed here the slope was shallower and she was still in the pass chosen long ago by medeans monitoring a tractor probe but the howler rode too low if she opened a slot to brake the skirt would scrape rock the howler would ifip over find a level spot a quick glance back told her she didnt want to stop anyway a dozen of the rock demons had crossed the cotton candy probably used their siblings for stepping stones after they got stuck rachel held hard to her sanity and concentrated on staying right side up the things were holding their own in the race maybe they were even catching up bronze legs squeezed between the crates and the roof to reach the crawlers observation bubble it was big enough for his head and shoulders he found one of the rock demons with its forelegs wrapped around the bubble blocking part of his view while it gnawed at the glass rock demons swarmed on the ground the fuxes couldnt be seen but a few rock demons lay unnaturally quiet where the fuxholes were and bronze legs saw a spear thrust through the melee he called down try the searchlights wont work grace answered she tried it anyway other searchlights joined hers and the thrashing rxk demons blazed painfully bright even through goggles they turned squinted at the situation then came all in a quick rush the bronze spearhead on harvesters tail stabbed deep into a straggler the rock demons blood jetted an incredible distance it died almost instantly if there were live fuses under the somewhat tattered silver parasols they were safe now all the rock demons were swarming round the vehicles searchlights they liked the light grace chortled tell me you expected that i wouldnt dare i feel a lot safer now the monsters werent tearing at the lights they fought each other for a place in the glare what do they think theyre doing weve seen this kind of reaction before grace answered medean life either loves flares or hates them all the flareloving forms act like theyre programmed to stay out of shadows during flares like in the shadow of a mountain theyd be in just the conditions they arent designed for most of em have high blood pressure too and terrific reserves of energy they have to accomplish a lot in the little time a flare lasts be born eat grow mate give birth grace get on the intercom and find out if everyones still alive and see if anyone knows which sun flared why what possible difference could it make phrixus flares last up to three quarters of an hour helle flares dont last as long were going to have to wait it out and see if rachel called anyone right bronze legs halflistened to the intercom conversation along the heatward slopes of the mountains the black flags flew in triumph growing longer almost as bronze legs watched making sugar while the sun flared the rock demons milling in the searchlight beams were now hungry enough to be attacking each other in earnest a vastly larger number of rock demons had deserted the mountainsides entirely had swarmed straight down to the shoreline the waves were awash with sea monsters of all sizes the rock demons were wading out to get them grace called up to him rachel didnt call anyone lightning says she made it over the crest good what do you think shell do nobody knows her very well hmm she wont land in the cotton candy she probably could because those snails are probably hiding in their shells right but she wont itd be too messy shell stop on the coldward slope or beyond anywhere its safe to wait it out if there is anywhere do you think shell find anywhere safe she wont know whats safe she wont fln anyplace that isnt swarming with somethin not this far to heatward the further you look to heatward the more ferocious the competition gets then shell keep going if she doesnt wreck herself shell go straight back to touchdown city lets see morvens on the other side of the planet now say itll be up in an hour and well let them know whats happening that way well know shes safe almost as soon as she does grace you dont think shed try to rejoin us she cant get lost and she cant stop and touchdowns visible from fifty miles away shell just head home okay there was a funny edge of doubt in graces voice she stabbed at an intercom button lightning me you watched rachel go over the crest right did she have her headlights on bronze legs was wondering just how teed off the rammers would be if rachel was dead it took him a moment to see the implications of what grace was saying the searchlight too all right lightning the long range sender is on your roof i want it ready to send a message to morven by the time morven rises which will be to south of coldward in about an hour no dont go out yet the way the beasts are running around they should die of heatstroke pretty quick when they fall off the roof you go the rock demons followed rachel twelve kilometers downslope before anything distracted them the howler was riding higher now but rachel wasnt out of trouble the emergency override locked the vents closed if she turned it off the power would drop and so would the howler she was steering with her weight alone her speed would last as long as she was going down she had almost run out of mountain the slope leveled off as it approached the river the vicious pegasustype birds had disappeared the rolling mountainsides covered with feathery wheat were now covered with stubble stubble with a hint of motion in it dark flecks that showed and were gone millions of mice maybe whatever they were meat the demons scattered in twelve directions across the stubble their big heads snapping snapping rachel leaned forward across her windscreen to get more speed behind her three rock demons converged on a golden roman shield on a mockturtle that had been hidden by featherwheat and was now quite visible and helpless the demons turned it over and ripped it apart and ate and moved on the howler slid across the shore and onto flowing water each patch of scarlet scum had sprouted a great green blossom rachel steered between the stalks by body english she was losing speed but the shore was well behind her now and all twelve rock demons zipped downhill across the stubble and into the water rachel held her breath could they swim they were under water drinking or dispersing heat or both now they arched upward to reach the air the howler coasted to a stop in midstream rachel nerved herself to switch off the override the howler dropped and hovered in a dimple of water churning a fine mist that rapidly left rachel dripping wet she waited come what may at least the batteries were recharging give her time and shed have a howler that could steer and fly the heatward shore was black with a million mousesized beasties theyd cleaned the field of featherwheat but what did they think they were doing now watching rachel the rock demons noticed they waded clumsily out of the water and once on land blurred into motion the shore churned with sixlegged white marauders and tiny black prey it seemed the fates had given rachel a break the water seemed quite empty but for the scarlet scum and its huge blossoms no telling what might be hugging the bottom while the flare passed rachel could wait too the coldward shore looked safe enough though it had changed before the flare it had been one continuous carpet of chrome yellow bushes the bushes were still there but topped now with a continuous sheet of silver blossoms the clouds of insects swarmed still though they might be different insects upstream something was walking toward her on stilts it came at its own good time stopping frequently rachel kept her eye on it while she tried the intercom she got static on all bands mountains blocked her from the expedition other mountains blocked her from touchdown city the one sender that could reach morven in orbit was on a crawler dammit she never noticed the glowing pinpoint that meant bronze legs had called it was too dim onshore two of the rock demons were mating headtotail the thing upstream seemed to be a great silver daddylonglegs its legs were slender and almost long enough to bridge the river its torso proportionately tiny it paused every so often to reach deep into the water with the thumbless hands on its front legs the hands were stubby armored in chitin startlingly quick they dipped they rose at once with something that struggled they conveyed the prey to i s mouth its head was wide and flat like a clam with bulging eyes it stepped delicately downstream with all the time in the world and it was bigger than rachel had realised and faster so much for her rest break she opened the rear vent the howler slid across the river and onto shore and stopped nudging the bushes the daddylonglegs was following her ten of the dozen rock demons were wading across as the bottom dipped the sixlegged beasts rose to balance on four legs then two as bipeds they were impressively stable maybe their tails trailed in the mud bottom to serve as anchors and the mice were coming too thousands of them swimming in a black carpet among the patches of scum rachel used the override for fifteen seconds it was enough to put her above the silvertopped bushes the lilypadshaped silver blossoms bowed beneath the air blast but the ground effect held her she wasnt making any great speed bugs swarmed around her sticky ifiaments shot from between the wide silver lily pads and sometimes found bugs and sometimes struck the fans or the ground effect skirt she looked for the place that had been cleared for a fux encampment deadeye would be there a feisty male biped guarding his nest if deadeye still lived she couldnt find the gap in the bushes it struck her that that was good luck for deadeye considering what was following her but she was lonely and scared the daddylonglegs stepped delicately among the bushes bushes rustled to show where ten rock demons streaked after her veering to snatch a meal from whatever was under the blossoms then resuming course of the planteating notmice there was no sign except that here and there a bush had collapsed behind her but they were all falling behind as the fuel cells poured power into the howlers batteries rachel oriented herself by argo and the jet stream and headed south and coldward she was very tired the land was darkening reddening and it came to her that the flare was dying the flare was dying the goggles let bronze legs look directly at the suns now to see the red arc enclosing the bright point of helle a bubble of hellfire was rising cooling expanding into the vacuum above the lesser hell of a red dwarf star there were sixlegged rock demons all around them and a few on the roofs all were dead from heatstroke or dehydration a far larger number were gathering all along the ring sea shore now they swarmed uphill in a wave of silver they paired off as they came and stopped by twos in the rocks to mate the diminished wave swept around the expedition and petered out now the mountains were covered with writhing forms an impressive sight they make the beast with twelve legs bronze legs said look at the size of those bellies hey grace arent the beasts themselves bigger than they were they have to be theyve got to form those eggs dammit dont distract me the intercom lit grace wasnt about to notice anything so mundane the paired rock demons were growing quiet but they were still linked head to tail bronze legs opened the intercom lightnings voice said ive got duty officer toffier aboard morven okay toffier this is miller weve got an emergency sorry to hear it the male voice sounded sleepy what can we do about it youll have to call touchdown city can you patch me through or shall i record a message lets check the voice went away bronze legs watched a nearby pair of rock demons crawling away from each other the thick torsos seemed different a belly sweffing that had extended the length of the torso was now a prominent swelling between the middle and hind legs it was happening fast the beasts seemed gaunt all bone and skin except for the great spherical swelling with fore and middle legs they scratched at the earth digging digging miller youd better record by the time we got their attention theyd be over the horizon well have them in another hour but i dont see how they can help either listen miller is there something we can do with an interstellar message laser at this range we can melt a mountain or boil a lake and be accurate to dammit toffier were not in trouble touchdown citys in trouble and they dont know it yet oh okay set to record to mayor curly jackson touchdown city weve weathered the flare we dont know if the fuxes survived yet the rammer rachel subramaniam is on the way to you on a howler she has no reason to think shes dangerous but she is by the time you spot her youd be too late to stop her if you dont move damn quick the human colony on medea could be dead within the year youll need every vehicle you can get your bands on the expedition had crossed a great bay of the ring sea in twelve hours rachel could cross it in three but shed be rid of what followed her moments after she left shore she had heard lightning mention the parasitic fungus that floated on this arm of the ring sea that was deadly to fuxes and any medean life unless the flare had burned it away the flare was long over she rode through the usual redlit landscape in a circle of the white light from headlights taillights searchlight she hungered and thirsted for the light of farming lamps the color of sol of ships sunlights the sign that she had come at last to touchdown city but she hungered more for the fungus that would kill the rock demons and the daddylonglegs she hated them for their persistence their monstrous shapes their lust for her flesh she hated them for being themselves let them rot slow or quick then three hours to cross the bay half an hour more to find and navigate that rubblestrewn pass and downhill toward the bluewhite light that was the shoreline ahead ominously bloodcolored beasts milled there one by one they turned toward the howler rachel cursed horribly and without imagination she had seen these things before the expeditions searchlights had pinned a tremendous thousandlegged worm and these things had been born from its flesh they were dogsized tailless quadrupeds flare time must have caught a lot of the great myriapods brought vast populations of parasites to life for this many to be still active this long after the flare more than active they leapt like fleas toward rachel she turned to heatward weak as she felt now one could knock her out of the saddle her entourage turned with her two more rock demons had dropped out eight followed and the great spider and a loyal population of protomice exposed now that the bushes had ended and hordes of insects rachels reason told her that she was taking this all too personally but what did they see in her she wasnt that much meat and the spider wasnt that hungry i reached down now and then to pluck a protomouse and once it plucked up a rock demon with equal nonchalance the demon raved and snapped and died within the spiders clamshell mouth but it clawed out an eye too and the demons had the protomice for food but they had to streak down to the water every so often to cool off and fight their way back through the bloodred quadrupeds eating what they killed the mice had fed well on the yellow bushes and who knew about the tiny mightbeinsects what did they all want with rachel after a couple of hours the shore curved south and now it was white tinged with other colors a continuous crust of salt rachels climate suit worked well but her face and hands were hot the wind was hot with argoheat and the heat of a recent flare the daddylonglegs had solved its heat problem it waded offshore out of reach of the red parasites pacing her it was five hours before the shore turned sharply to coldward rachel turned with it staying well back from shore where bloodcolored quadrupeds still prowled she worried now about whether she could find the pass there would be black tightly curled ground cover and trees foliated in gray hair with a spoonshaped silhouette and sharpedged young mountains to the south but she felt stupid with fatigue and she had never adjusted to the light and never would dull red from argo pink from two red dwarf suns nearing sunset more hours passed she saw fewer of the red parasites once she caught the daddylonglegs with another rock demon in its clamshell jaws the hexapods own teeth tore at the side of the spiders face the side that was already blind flareloving forms used themselves up fast those trees rachel swung her searchlight around the ground cover the black mans hair was gone a black fog of insects swarmed over bare dirt but the trees were hairy with a spoonshaped silhouette how far had those trees spread on medea she could be in the wrong place she turned left uphill there were low mountains ahead young mountains all sharp edges a kilometer short rachel turned to parallel them the pass had been so narrow she could go right past it she slowed down then impatient speeded up again narrow it had been but straight perhaps she would see farming lamps shining through it she noticed clouds forming and began cursing to drive away thoughts of rain when the light came it was more than a glimmer she saw a sun a white sun a real sun shining against the mountains as if flare time had come again but phrixus and helle were pink dots sinking in the west she swerved toward the glare the rising ground slowed her and she remembered the spider plodding patiently behind her she didnt turn to look the glare grew terribly bright she slowed further puzzled and fright ened she pulled the goggles up over her eyes that was better but still she saw nothing but that almighty glare at the end of a bare rock pass she rode into the pass into the glare into a gi ounded sun her eyes adjusted the rock walls were lined with vehicles flyers tractor probes trucks crawlers converted to firefighting and ambulance work anything that could move on its own was there and each was piled with farming lamps and batteries and all the farming lamps were on an aisle had been left between them rachel coasted down the aisle she thought she could make out manshaped shadows in the red darkness beyond they were human by the pale mane around his head she recognized mayor curly jackson finally finally she slowed the howler let it sink to the ground and stepped off human shapes caine toward her one was mayor curly he took her arm and his grip drove pain even through the fog of fatigue you vicious little idiot he said she blinked he snarled and dropped her arm and turned to face the pass half the population of touchdown city stood looking down the aisle of light ignoring rachel pointedly she didnt try to shoulder between then she climbed into the howlers saddle to see they were there half a dozen rock demons grouped beneath the long legs of the spider a black carpet of protomice all embedded in a cloud of bright motes insects the monsters strolled up the aisle of light and the watching men backed away it wasnt necessary where the light stopped rachels entourage stopped too mayor curly turned did it once occur to you that something might be following your lights your flarecolored lights you went through half a dozen domains and every one bad its own predators and its own plant eaters and you brought them all here you gutless moron how many kinds of insects are there in that swarm how many of them would eat our crops down to the ground before it poisoned them those little black things on the ground theyre planteaters too arent they all flareloving forms and you brought them all here to breed the next time a flare goes off would have been the last time any medean human being bad anything to youd be safe of course all youd have to do is fly on to another star the only way a human being can turn off her ears is to turn off icr mind rachel didnt know whether she fainted or not probably she was led away rather than carried her next memory began some time later beneath the light of home with the sounds and the smells of home around her strapped down in free fall aboard the web ramship morven on the curve of the wall the mobile power plant and one of the crawlers had finally left the realms of crusted salt they ran over baked dirt now the howler was moored in the center of the groundeffect raft surrounded by piles of crates it would be used again only by someone willing to wear a spacesuit the four remaining fuxes were in the crawlers argo was out of camera range nearly overhead the view shifted and dipped with the motion of the trailing crawler no the beasts didnt actually do any harm we did more damage to ourselves mayor curly said he wasnt looking at captain borg he was watching the bob wall a cup of coffee cooled in his hand we moved every single farming lamp out of the croplands and set them all going in the pass right and the flareloving life forms just stayed there till they died they arent really built to take more than a couple of hours of flare time what theyd get if both suns flared at once and they arent built to walk away from flarelight either maybe some of the insects bred maybe the big forms were carrying seeds and insect eggs in their hair we know the sixlegged types tried to breed as soon as we turned off the lamps but they werent in shape for it by then it doesnt matter now i suppose i should he turned and looked at her in fact i do thank you most sincerely for melting that pass down to lava there cant be anything living in it now so you came out of it with no damage not really the locusts hurt us we moved the farming lamps in a hurry but we took our own good time getting them back in place that was a mistake some flarehating bugs were just waiting to taste our corn too bad and a nest of bs killed two children in the oak grove captain borgs mind must have been elsewhere you really reamed rachel out i did curly said without satisfaction and without apology she was almost catatonic we bad to take her back up to morven before shed talk to anyone curly is there any way to convince her she didnt make a prize idiot of herself at a guess id say no why would anyone want to captain borg was using her voice of command now i dislike sounding childish especially to you curly but baby talk may be my best option the problem is that rachel didnt have any fun on medea youre breaking my heart she wont even talk about coming down she didnt like medea she didnt like the light or the animals or the way the fuxes bred too bloody she went through thirtyodd hours of hell with your power plant expedition and came back tired to death and being chased by things out of a nightmare and when she finally got to safety you called her a dangerous incompetent idiot and made her believe it she didnt even get laid on medea what never mind its trivial or maybe its absolutely crucial but skip it curly i have sampled the official memory tape of medea the one we would have tried to peddle when we got back into the trade circuit curlys eyes got big ooob shit it comes to you does it that tape was an ugly experience its unpleasant and uncomfortable and humiliating and exhausting and scary and theres no sex thats rachels view of medea and there isnt any other and nobodys going to enjoy it curly bad paled what do we do put rachels equipment on somebody else i wouldnt wear it no rammer is really manic about her privacy but there are limits what about a medean who dont you have any compulsive exhibitionists curly shook his head ill ask around but no maybe i wont doesnt it tell you something that she couldnt get screwed what man could go with a woman knowing shell be peddling the memory of it to millions of strangers yuk the crawlers had stopped human shapes stepped outside wearing skintight pressure suits and big transparent bubbles over their heads they moved around to the groundeffect raft and began opening crates its no good curly its not easy to find people to make memory tapes for a skill tape you need a genuine expert with twenty or thirty years experience behind him plus a sharpedged imagination and a one track mind and no sense of privacy and rachels a tourist shes got all of that and she can learn new skifis at the drop of a hat shes very reactive very emotive and she very nearly wiped us out shell be making tapes till she dies and every time something reminds her of medea her entire audience is going to know just what she thinks of the planet whatll happen to us oh we could be worried over nothing ive seen fads before this whole memory tape thing could be ancient history by the time we get back to civilization civilization as opposed to what curly knew the answer to that one he went back to watching the wall and even if its not ill be back ill bring another walking memory like rachel but more flexible okay how long one circuit then back to medea sixty to seventy earthyears good said curly because there was certainly no way to talk her into any shorter journey he watched men in silver suits setting up the frames for the solar mirrors there was not even wind in the hot end and apparently no life at all they had worried about that but curly saw nothing that could threaten touchdown citys power supply for hundreds of years to come if medea was to become a backwash of civilization a land of peasants then it was good that the farmlands were safe curly turned to janice borg to say so but the rammers eyes were seeing nothing on medea and her mind was already approaching horvendile the locusts by larry niven and steve barnes there are no men on tau ceti iv near the equator on the ridged ribbon of continent which reaches north and south to cover both poles the evidence of man still show there is the landing craft a great thick saucer with a rounded edge gaping doors and vast empty space inside ragged clumps of grass and scrub vegetation surround its base now there is the small town where they lived grew old and died tall stone houses a main street of rock fused with atomic fire a good deal of machinery whose metal is still brighl there is the land itself overgrown but still showing the traces of a square arrangement that once marked it as farmland and there is the fores reaching north and south along the sprawling ribbon of continent spreading even to the innumerable islands which form twothirds of ridgebacks land mass where forest cannot grow because of insufficient water or because the carefully bred bacteria have not yet built a sufficient depth of topsoil there is grass an exceptionally hardy hybrid of buffalo and cord with an abnormal number of branching roots developing a dense and fertile sod there are flocks of moos resurrected from a lost new zealand valley the great flightless birds roam freely sharing their grazing land with expanding herds of wild cattle and buffalo there are things in the foresl they prefer it there but will occasionally shamble out into the grasslands and sometimes even into the town they themselves do not understand why they go there is nofoo and they do not need building materials or other things which may be there for the scavenging they always leave the town before nightfall arrive when men came the land was as barren as a tabletop doe and elise were among the last to leave the ship he took his wifes hand and walked down the ramp eager to feel alien loam between his toes he kept his shoes on theyd have to make the loam first the other colonists were exceptionally silent as if each were afraid to speak not surprising doc thought the first words spoken on ridgeback would become history the robot probes had found five habitable worlds besides ridgeback in earths neighborhood two held life in more or less primitive stages but ridgeback was perfect there was onecelled life in ridgebacks seas enough to give the planet an oxygenating atmosphere and no life at all on land they would start with a clean slate so the biologists had chosen what they believed was a representative and balanced ecology a worlds life was stored in the cargo hold now in frozen fertilized eggs and stored seeds and bacterial cultures ready to go to work doc looked out over his new home the faint seabreeze stinging his eyes he had known ridgeback would be barren but he had not expected the feel of a barren world to move him the sky was bright blue clouds shrouding tau ceti a sun wider and softer than the sun of earth the ocean was a deeper blue flat and calm there was no dirt there was dust and sand and rock but nothing a farming man would call dirt there were no birds no insects the only sound was that of sand and small dustdevils dancing in the wind a low moan almost below the threshold of human hearing doe remembered his college geology class fieldtrip to the moon ridgeback wasnt dead as luna was dead it was more like his uncles face after the embalmers got through with him it looked alive but it wasnt jase the eldest of them and the colony leader raised his hand and waited when all eyes were on him he crinided his eyes happily saving his biggest smile for his sister cynnie who was training a hobotape camera on him were here people his voice boomed in the dead worlds silence its good and its ours lets make the most of it there was a ragged cheer and the colonists surged toward the cargo door of the landing craft the lander was a flattish dome now its heat shield burned almost through its dumbostyle atomic motor buried in dust it had served its purpose and would never move again the great door dropped and became a ramp crates and machinery began to emerge on little flatbed robot trucks elise put her arm around her husbands waist and hugged him she murmured its so empty so far doe unrolled a package of birth control pills and felt her flinch two years before we can have children did she mean it as a question right be said they had talked it through too often in couples and in groups in training and aboard ship at least until jill gets the ecology going uh huh an impatient noise doc wondered if she believed it at twentyfour tall and wiry and with seven years of intensive training behind him be felt competent to handle most emergencies but children and babies in particular were a problem he could postpone he had interned for a year at detroit memorial but most of his schooling related directly to general colonization his medical experience was no better than elises his knowledge not far superior to that of a th century gp like his shipmates doc was primarily a trained crewman and colonist his courses in world settlingfunny chemistry water purification basic mine engineering exotic factor recognition etcwere largely guesswork there were no interstellar colonies not yet and bearing children would be an act of faith a taking possession of the land some had fought the delay bitterly the starship would have been smelling of babies shortly after takeoff if theyd had their way he offered elise a pill bacteria and earthworms come first men last he said were too high on the chain we cant overload the ecology uh huh before weve even got one and look she took a sixmonth birth control pill and swallowed it so doc didnt say suppose it doesnt work out suppose we have to go home he passed out the pills and watched the women take them crossing names off a list in his head the little robot trucks were all over the place now their flat beds were endless belts and they followed a limited repertoire of voiced orders they had the lander half unloaded already when doe bad finished his pill pushing he went to work beside elise unloading crates his thirty patients including himself were sickeningly healthy as an unemployed doctor hed have to do honest work until someone got ill he was wrong of course doe had plenty of employment his patients were doing manual labor in gravities theyd gained an average often pounds the moment the landing craft touched down it threw their coordi nation and balance off causing them to strain muscles and gash themselves one of the robot trucks ran over chris foot chris didnt wince or curse as doe manipulated the bones but his teeth ground silently together all done here chris doe smiled the meteorologist looked at him bleakly from behind wirerimmed glasses eyes blinking without emotion hey youre a better man than i am if i had a wound like that id scream my head off something only vaguely like a smile crossed chris lips thanks doe he said and limped out remarkable control doe mused but then again thats chris a week after landing ridgebacks nineteenhour day caught up with them disrupted body rhythms are no joke adding poor sleep to the weight adjustment led to chronic fatigue doe recognized the signs quickly im surprised that it took this long he said to elise as she tossed sleepless why couldnt we have done our adjusting on ship she mumbled opening a bleary eye theres more to it than just periods of light and darkness every planet has its own peculiarities you just have to get used to them before your sleep cycles adjust well what am i supposed to do jesus hand me the sleeping pills wouldja please i just want to sleep nope dont want anyone hooked on sleeping pills weve got the russian sleep sets youll have one tomorrow the russian sleep headsets were much preferred over chemical sedatives they produced unconsciousness with a tiny trickle of current through the brain good elise yawned sunset and dawn they both seem to come too soon the colony went up fast it was all prefabs makeshift and temporary the streets cluttered with the tools machinery and electric cables which nobody had put away because there was no place for them gradually places were made hydroponic tanks were assembled and stocked and presently the colonists were back on fresh food much more gradually the stone houses began to appear they blasted their own rock from nearby cliffs with guncotton from the prefab chemical factory they hauled the fractured stone on the robot trucks and made concrete to stick it together there was technology to spare and endless power from the atomic motor in the landing craft they took their time with the houses prefabs would weather the frequent warm rains for long enough the stone houses were intended to last much longer the colonists built thick walls and left large spices so that the houses could be expanded when later generations saw fit doe squinted into the mirror brushing his teeth with his usual precise vertical movements he jumped when he felt a splash of hot water hit his back cut that out elise he laughed she settled back in her bathtub wrinkling her nose at him three years of meagre showers on the ship had left her dying for a real bathtub where she could waste gallons of water without guilt spoilsport she teased if you were any kind of fun youd come over here and and what he asked interested and rub my back and thats supposed to be fun i was thinking that we could rub it with you she grinned seeing does eyes light up and then maybe we could rub you with me later they toweled each other off still tingling look doe said pulling her in front of the mirror he studied her marveling had elise become prettier or was he seeing her with new eyes he knew she laughed louder and more often than when they had met years ago in school she the child of a wealthy family and he a scholarship student who dreamt of the stars he knew that her body was more firm and alive than it had been in her teens the same sun that had burnt her body nutbrown had lightened her reddish hair to strawberry blond she grinned at him from the mirror and asked do you propose to take all the credit he nodded happily hed always been fit but his muscles had been stringy the kind that didnt show now they bulged handsome curves filling out chest and shoulders legs strong from lifting and moving rock his skin had darkened under the probing of a warm friendly sun he was sleeping well and so was she all of the colonists were darker more muscular with thicker calluses on hands and feet under open sky or high ceilings they walked straighter than the men and women of earths cities they talked more boldly and seemed to fill more space in the cities of earth the ultimate luxury had been building space it was beyond the means of all but the wealthiest here there was land for the taking and twelve foot ceilings could be built the house doe was building for elisealmost finished nowwould be as fine as any her father could have built for her one that would be passed on to their children and then to their grandchildren she seemed to echo his thought one last step i want a bulge right here and she patted her flat abdomen your department and jills were up to mammals already and were adjusting ive got half the russian sleep sets back in the infirmary already the orion spacecraft was a big obtrusive object maceshaped cruising constantly across the sky what had been a fifth of a mile of deuterium snowball the fuel supply for the starships battery of laserfusion motors was now a thin shiny skin still inflated by the residue of deuterium gas it was the head of the mace the life support system ending in motors and shock absorbers formed the handle roy had taken the groundtoorbit craft up and was aboard the orion now monitoring the relay as cynnie beamed her holotape up it was lonely once there had been too little room now there was too much the ship still smelled of too many people crowded too close for too long roy adjusted the viewscreen and grinned back at cynnies toothy smile this is year day on ridgeback she said in her smooth announcers voice it was a barren world when we came now slowly life is spreading across the land the farming teams have spent this last year dredging mulch from the sea bed and boiling it to kill the native life now it grows the tame bacteria that will make our soil the screen showed a sequence of action scenes tractors plowing furrows in the harsh dirt colonists glistening with sweat as they pulled boulders from the ground and jill supervising the spreading of the starter soil grass seed and earthworms were sown into the trenches and men and machines worked together to fold them into the earth cynnie had mounted a camera on one of the small flyers for an aerial view the soil is being spread along a tenmile strip she said and grains are being planted later well have fruit trees and shade trees bamboo and animal feed it was good roy thought watching it was smooth getting it all had been rough enough before they were finished the colonists had become damn sick of roy and cynnie poking their cameras into their every activity that sign above the auditorium toilet smile roy is watching hed tried to tell them dont you know who it is that builds starships its taxpayers thats who and theyve got to get something for their money sure were putting on a show for them if we dont when election time comes around they may ask for a refund oh they probably believed him but the sign was still up roy watched cynnie interview jase and brew in the fields watched angie and chris constructing the animal pens jill thawed some of the fertilized goat eggs and a tape was shown of the wriggling embryos at first cynnie reminisced ridgeback w s daunting there was no sound no crickets no birdsongs but no roar of traffic either by day the sky is earthlike enough but by night the constellations are brighter its impossible to forget how far from home we arewe cant even see sol invisible somewhere in the northern hemisphere its hard to forget that no help of any kind could come in much less than twentyfive years it would take five years just to refuel the ship it takes fourteen years to make the trip although thanks to relativity it was only three years ship time yes we are alone the image of cynnies sober face segued to the town hail a geodesic dome of metal tubing sprayed with plastic but it is heartening that we have found in each other the makings of a community we come together for midday meal discussions songfests and group worship services cynnies face was calm now comforting we have no crime and no unemployment were much too busy for marital squabbles or political infighting she grinned and the sparkle of her personality brought pleasure to roys analytical mind in fact i have work to do myself so until next year this is cynnie mitchell on ridgeback signing off a year and a half after landing a number of animals were out of incubation with a loss of less than two percent the mammals drank synthetic milk now but soon they would be milling in their pens eating ridgeback grass and adding their own rich wastes to the cooking compost heaps friday night was community night at the town hail from the inside the ribs of the dome were still visible through the sprayed plastic walls and some of the decorations were less than stylish but it was a warm place a friendly relaxing place where the common bond between the ridgebackers was strengthened jill especially seemed to love the stage and took every opportunity to mount it almost vibrating with her infectious energy everythings right on schedule she said happily the fruit flies are breeding like mad and if hear that again im gonna break out the mosquitoes gang there are things we can live without but we dont know what they are yet chances are well be raising the sharks sooner or later weve been lucky so far really lucky she cleared her throat dramaticaily and speaking of luck we have chris with some good news for the farmers and bad news for the sunbathers chris there was scattered applause most vigorously from chris tiny wife angie he walked to the lectern and adjusted the microphone before speaking we uh he took off his glasses polishing them on his shirt then replaced them smiling nervously weve been having good weather people but theres a storm front moving over the mountains i think greg can postpone the irrigation canals for a week were going to get plenty wet he coughed and moved the microphone close to his mouth june and i are working to program the atmospheric model into the computer until we do weather changes will keep catching us unaware we have to break down a fairly complex set of thermo and barometric dynamics into something that can be dealt with systematicallywind speed humidity vertical motion friction pressure gradients and a lot of other factors still have to be fed in but were making progress maybe next year well be able to tell you how to dress for the tenth anniversary of landing day there were derisive snorts and laughter and chris was applauded back into his seat jase bounded onto the stage and grabbed the mike any more announcements no au right then we all voted on tonights movie so no groans please lights the auditorium dimmed he slipped from the stage and the twin beams of the holo projector flickered onto the screen it was a war movie shot in fiatfllm but optically reconstructed to simulate depth doe found it boring he slipped out during a barrage of cannon fire he headed to the lab and found jill there already using one of the small microscopes hi hon he called out flipping on his desk light working late well im maybe just a wee bit more bugged than i let on just a little about what i keep thinking that one day well find out that we left something out of our tame ecology its just a feeling but it wont go away like going on vacation doe said deliberately flippant you know you forgot something youd just rather it was your toothbrush and not your passport she smeared a cover glass over a drop of fluid on a slide and set it to dry yes it feels like that do you really have mosquitoes in storage she twinkled and nodded yep hornets too just how good is it going you know how impatient everyone is no real problems there sure as hell might have been but thanks to my superior p nning she stuck out her tongue at does grimace well have food for ourselves and all the children we can raise ive been getting a little impatient myself you know as if theres a part of me that isnt functioning at full efficiency doe laughed then i think youd better tell greg ill do better ill announce it tonight and let all the fatherstobe catch the tidings in one shot oh boy what no it has to be done that way i know it im just thinking about nine months from now oh boy so it was announced that evening as doe might have expected someone had already cheated somehow nat the midwestern earthmother blond had taken a contraceptive pill and even with doe watching had avoided swallowing it doe was fairly sure that her husband brew knew nothing of it although she was already more than four months along when she confessed nat had jumped the gun and there wasnt a woman on ridgeback who didnt envy her a year and eleven months after landing day doe delivered ridgebacks first baby sleepy exhausted by her hours of labor nat looked at her baby with a pride that was only half maternal her face was flushed yellow hair tangled in mats with perspiration and fatigue she held her baby swaddled in blankets at her side i can hear them outside what do they want she asked drowsily fighting to keep her eyelids open doe breathed deeply ridiculous but the scentless air of ridgeback seemed a little sweeter theyre waiting for a glimpse of the little crown princess well shes staying here tell them shes beautiful ridgebacks first mother whispered and dropped off to sleep doe washed his hands and dried them on a towel he stood above the slumbering pair considering then he gently pried the baby from her mothers grip and took her in his arms halfconscious mothers wish or no the infant must be shown to the colony before they could rest especially brew he could see the swedes great broad hands knotting into nervous fists as he waited outside and the rest of them in a halfcrescent around the door and the inevitable cynnie and roy with their holotape cameras its a girl he told them nats resting comfortably the baby was red as a tomato and looked as fragile as venetian glass she and doe posed for the camera then doe left her with brew to make a short speech elise and greg jills husband had both had paramedic training doe set up a rotating eighthour schedule for the three of them starting with elise the group outside was breaking up as he left but he managed to catch jase id like to be taken off work duties for a while he told the colony leader when the two were alone jase gripped his arm somethings wrong with the baby there was a volume of concern in the question i doubt it but she is the first and i want to watch her and nat most of the women are pregnant now i want to keep an eye on them too youre not worried about anything specific when elise left her shift at the maternity ward she found him staring at the stone ceiling she asked insomnia again shall i get a russian sleep set she studied his face the baby shed seen it too then you just left the baby shes fine isnt she theyre both fine sleeping harry she was the only one who called him that what is it no nothings bothering me you know everything i know its just that well its just that i want to do everything right this is so important so i keep checking back on myself because theres no one i can call in to check my work can you understand what im getting at she pursed her lips then said i know that the only baby in the world could get a lot more attention than she needs there shouldnt be too many people around her and they should all be smiling thats important to a baby doe watched as she took off her clothes and got into bed the slight swell of her pregnancy was just beginning to show within six months there would be nine more children on ridgeback and one would be theirs predictably brews and nats daughter became eve it seemed nobody but doe had noticed anything odd about eve even laymen know better than to expect a newborn child to be pretty a baby doesnt begin to look like a baby until it is weeks old the cherubs of the renaissance paintings of foucquet or conegliano were taken from twoyearolds naturally eve looked odd and most of the colony who had never seen newborn children took it in their stride but doe worried the ships library was a worlds library it was more comprehensive and held more microfilm and holographically encoded information than any single library on earth doe spent weeks running through medical tapes and got no satisfaction thereby eve wasnt sick she was a good baby she gave no more trouble than usual and no less nat had no difficulty nursing her which was good as there were no adult cows available on ridgeback doe pulled a microfisch chip out of the viewer and yawned irritably the last few weeks had cost him his adjustment to ridgeback time and gained him well a kind of general education in pediatrics there was nothing specific to look for no handle on the problem bluntly put eve was an ugly baby there was nothing more to say and nothing to do but wait roy and cynnie showed their tapes for the year cynnie had a good eye for detail until he watched the camera view trucking from the landing craft past the line of houses on main street to brew to a closeup of brews house doe had never noticed how brews house reflected brew himself it was designed like the others tall and squarish with a sloped roof and small window but the stones in brews house were twice the size of those in does house brew was proud of his strength roy was in orbit on year day but cynnie stayed to cover the festivities such as they were earths hypothetical eager audience stifi hadnt seen year day one jase spoke for the camera comparing the celebration with the first thanksgiving day in new england he was right it was a feast a display of the variety of foods ridgeback was now producing and not much more than that his wife june sang a nondenominational hymn and they all followed along each in his own key nat fed eve a bit of corncake and fruit juice and the colonists applauded eves gurgling smile the folks back on earth might not have thought it very exciting but to the ridgebackers it meant everything this was food they had grown themselves all of them had bruises or blisters or calluses from weeding or harvesting they were more than a community now they were a world and the fresh fruit and vegetables and the hot breads tasted better than anything they could have imagined six months after the birth of eve doe was sure there was a problem the children of ridgeback totaled seven two of the women had miscarried fewer than he might have feared and without complications jill was still carrying hers and doe was beginning to wonder but it wasnt serious yet jill was big and strong with wide hips and a deep bust even now greg was hard put to keep her from commandeering one of the little flyers and jouncing off to the coastline to check the soil or inland to supervise the fresh water fish preserve give her another week the night elise had delivered their child it had been special she had had a dry birth with the water sack rupturing too early and doe had had to use a lubrication device elise was conscious during the entire delivery eschewing painkillers for the total experience of her first birth she delivered safely for which doe had given silent thanks his nerves were scraped to supersensitivity and he found himself just sitting and holding her hand whispering affection and encouragement to her while greg did much of the work with elises approval he named their son gerald shortened to jerry jerry was three weeks old now healthy and squalling with a feroeious grip in his tiny hands but even a fathers pride could not entirely hide the squarish jawline the eyes the all the children had it all the six recent ones and eve hadnt lost it doe continued his research in the mierolibrary switching from pediatrics to genetics he had a microscope and an electron microscope worth their hundreds of thousands of dollars in transportation costs he had scrapings of his own flesh and eves and jerrys what he lacked was a nobel prize geneticist to stand behind his shoulder and point out what were significant deviations as opposed to his own poor slide preparation techniques he caught brew looking at him at mealtimes as though trying to raise the nerve to speak soon the big man would break through his inhibitions doe could see it coming or perhaps nat would broach the question her eldest brother had been retarded and doe knew she was sensitive about it how long could it be before that pain rose to the surface and what would he say to them then it was not a mutation one could hardly expect the same mutation to hit all of seven couples in the same way it was no disease the children were phenomenally healthy so doe worked late into the night sometimes wearing a black scowl as he retraced dead ends he needed advice and advice was light years away was he seeing banshees nobody else had noticed anything naturally not the children all looked normal for they all looked alike only brew seemed disturbed hell it was probably doe that was worrying brew just as it was doe that worried elise he ought to spend more time with elise and jerry jill lost her baby it was stillborn pitiful in its frailty jill turned to greg as the dirt showered down on the cloth that covered her child biting her lip savagely trying to stop the tears she and het husband held each other for a long moment then with the rest of the colonists they walked back to the dwellings the colonists had voted early and unanimously to give up coffins on ridgebaek humans who died here would give their bodies to the conquest of the planet doe wondered if a coffin would have made this ceremony easier more comforting in its tradition probably not he thought dead is dead doe went home with elise hed been spending more time there lately and less time with the microscopes jerry was crawling now and he crawled everywhere you had to watch him like a hawk he could pick his parents unerringly out of a crowd of adults and he would scamper across the floor cooing his eyes alight his deepset brown eyes it was a week later that jase came to him after eight hours of labor june had finally released her burden for a newborn infant the body was big and strong though in any normal context he was a fragile precious thing as father jase was entitled to see him first he looked down at his son and said hes just like the others his eyes and his voice were hollow and at that moment doe could no longer see the jovial colony leader who called squaredanees at the weekly hoedown of course he is look dont con me doe i was eight when cynnie was born she didnt look like any of them and she never looked like eve dont you think thats for me to say yes and damned quicki doe rubbed his jaw considering if he was honest with himself he had to admit he ached to talk to somebody lets make it tomorrow in the ships library jases strong hand gripped his arm now tomorrow jase ive got a lot to say and there are things in the library you ought to see here he said dialling swiftly a page appeared on the screen threequarters illustration and onequarter print to explain it notice the head and the hands eves fingers are longer than that her forehead slopes more but look at these he conjured up a series of growth states paired with silhouettes of bone structure shes maturing much faster than normal at first i didnt think anything about the head any infants head is distorted during passage from the uterus it goes back to normal if the birth wasnt difficult and you cant tell much from the features all babies look pretty much alike but the hands and arms bothered me and now see for yourself her face is too big and her skull is too small and too flat and i dont like the jaw or the thin lips doe rubbed his eyes wearily and theres the hair that much hair isnt unheard of at that age but taken with everything else you can see why i was worried and all the kids look just like her even jase junior even jerry and jills stillbirth in the ships library there was a silence as of mourning jase said well have to tell earth the colony is a failure doe shook his head wed better see how it develops first we cant have normal children doe im not ready to give up jase and if its true we cant go back to earth either what why this thing isnt a mutation not in us it cant be what it could be is a virus replacing some of the genes a virus is a lot like a freefloating chromosome anyway if weve got a disease that keeps us from having normal children thats stupid a virus here waiting for us where theres nothing for it to live on but plankton you no no no it had to come with us something like the common cold could have mutated aboard ship there was enough radiation outside the shielding someone sneezes in the airlock before he puts his helmet on a year later someone else inhales the mutant jase thought it through we cant take it back to earth right so whats the hurry itd be twentyfour years before they could answer a cry for help lets take our time and find out what weve really got doe in gods name what can we tell the others nothing yet when the time comes ill tell them those few months were a busy time for ridgebacks doctor then they were over the children were growing and most of the women were pregnant including angie and jill who had both had miscarriages never again would all the women of ridgeback be having children in one ear shattering population explosion now there was little work for doe he spoke to ja se who put him on the labor routines most of the work was agricultural with the heavy jobs handled by machines robot trucks trailing plows scored rectangular patterns across the land the fenced bay was rich in earthborn plankton and now there were larger forms to eat the plankton occasionally greg opened the ifiter to let discolored water spread out into the world contaminating the ocean at night the colonists watched news from earth years in transit and up to a year older before roy boarded the starship to beam it down they strung the program out over the year in hour segments to make it last longer there were no wars in progress to speak of the procyon colony project had been abandoned macrostructures inc was still trying to build an interstellar ranijet it all seemed very distant jase came whistling into does lab but backed out swiftly when he saw that he had interrupted a counselling session with cynnie and roy doe was the closest thing the colony had to a marriage therapist jase waited outside until the pair had left then trotted in rough day yeah jase roy and cynnie dont fight do they they never did theyre like twins married people do get to be like each other but those two overdo it sometimes i knew it theres something wrong but its not between them doe rubbed his eyes on his sleeve they were sounding me out trying to get me talking about the children without admitting theyre scared anyway whats up jase brought his hands from behind his back he had two bamboo poles rigged for fishing what say we exercise our manly prerogatives ye gods in our private spawning ground why not its big enough there are enough fish and we cant let the surplus go theyd starve its a big ocean by now the cultivated strip of topsoil led tens of miles north and south along the continent jill claimed that life would spread faster that way outward from the edges of the strip the colony was raising its own chicken eggs and fruit and vegetables on landing day theyd been the first in generations to taste moa meat whose rich flavor had come that close to making the new zealand bird extinct why shouldnt they catch their own fish they made a full weekend of it they hauled a prefab with them on the flyer and set it up on the barren shore for three days they fished with the springy bamboo poles the fish were eager and trusting they ate some of their catch and stored the rest for later on the last day jase said i kept waiting to see you lose some of that uptight look you finally have a little i think yeah im glad this happened jase okay what about the children he didnt need to elaborate doe said theyll never be normal then what are they i dunno how do you tell people who came twelve light years to build a world that their heirs will be he groped for words whatever changed animals christ what a mess give me time to tell elise if she hasnt guessed by now maybe she has how long a week maybe give us time to be off with jerry might make it easier if were with him or harder yeah theres that he cast his line out again anyway shell keep the secret and shed never forgive me if i didnt tell her first and youd better tell june the night before i make the big announcement the words seemed to catch in his throat and he hung his head miserable tentatively jase said its absolutely nobodys fault oh sure i was just thinking about the last really big announcement i helped to make years ago seems funny now doesnt it its safe people you can start dreaming now go ahead and have those babies folks its all right his voice trailed off and he looked to jase in guilty confusion what could i do jase its like thalidomide in the begiiwing it all looked so wonderful jase was silent listening to the sound of water lapping against the boat i just hate to tell earth thats all he finally said in a low voice itll be like giving up even if we solve this thing theyd never risk sending another ship but weve got to warn them doe whats happening to us i dont know how hard have youno never mind jase pulled his line in baited it and sent it whipping out again long silences are in order when men talk and fish jase id give anything i have to know the answer some of the genes look different in the electron microscope maybe hell its all really too fuzzy to tell and i dont really know what it means anyway none of my training anticipated anything like thi you try to think of something alien invasion pause oh really jases line jumped he wrestled in a deep sea bass and freed the hook he said its the safest most painless kind of invasion they find a world they want but theres an inteffigent species in control so they design a virus that will keep us from bearing intelligent children after were gone they move in at their leisure if they like they can use a countervirus so the children can bear human beings again for slaves the bamboo pole seemed dead in does hands he said thats uglier than anything ive thought of well could be insufficient data if its true its all the more reason to warn earth but ridgeback is doomed jerry had his mothers hair sunbleached auburn he had too much of it on his narrow forehead it merged with his brows his shelf of brow and the brown eyes watching from way back he hardly needed the shorts he was wearing the hair would have been almost enough he was nearly three he seemed to sense something wrong between his parents he would spend some minutes scampering through the grove of sapling fruit trees agile as a child twice his age then suddenly return to take their hands and try to tug them both into action doe thought of the frozen fertilized eggs of dogs in storage jerry with a dog the thought was repulsive why shouldnt a child have a dog well of course i guessed somethin elise said bitterly you were always in the library when you were home the way that you looked at jerry and me come to think of it i see now why you havent taken me to bed much lately shed been avoiding his eyes but now she looked full at him i do see but harry couldnt you have asked me for help i have some medical knowledge and and im your wife and jerrys mother damn it harry would you believe i didnt want you worrying oh really how did it work her sarcasm cut deep bleeding he said nothing worked jerry came out of the trees at a tottering run doe stood up caught him swung him around chased him through the trees caine back puffing smiling holding his hand he almost lost the smile but elise was smiling back with some effort she hugged jerry then pulled fried chicken from the picnic basket and offered it around she said that alien invasion idea is stupid granted itd be easy to think someone has done it to us havent you found anything isnt there anything i can help with ive found a lot all the kids have a lower body temperature two point seven degrees theyre healthy as horses but hell who would they catch measles from their brain capacity is too small and not much of it is frontal lobe theyre hard to toilet train and they should have started babbling at least long ago what counts is the brain of course elise took one of jerrys small hands jerry crawled into her lap and she rocked him his hands are okay human his eyes are brown like yours his cheekbones are like yours too high and a little rounded doe tried to smile his eyes look a little strange theyre not really slanted enough to suspect mongolism but ill bet theres a gene change but where do i go from there i can see differences and theyre even consistent but theres no precedent for the analysis equipment to extrapolate from doe looked disgusted elise touched his cheek understanding can you teach me to use an electron nicroscope doc sat at the computer console watching over jills shoulder as she brought out the orion vehicles image of ridgeback the interstellar spacecraft doubled as a weather eye and the picture once drab with browns and grays now showed strips of green beneath the fragmented cloud cover if ridgeback was dead it certainly didnt show on the screen well weve done a fair old job jill grinned and took off her headset her puffy natural had collected dust and seeds and vegetable fluff until she gave up and shaved it off the tightly curled mat just covered her scalp now framing her chocolate cameo features the cultivated strip has spread like weeds all along the continent now i get cooxygen exchange it jumped the ridges last year and now i get readings on the western side are you happy no she said slowly ive done my job is it too much to want a child too i wouldnt care about the problem i just want its nobodys fault doe said helplessly i know i know but two miscarriages couldnt they have known back on earth wasnt there any way to be sure why did i have to come all this way she caught herself and smiled thinly i guess i should count my blessings im better off than poor angie poor angie doe echoed sadly how could they have known about chris the night doe announced his conclusions about the children there had been tears and harsh words but no violence but then there was chris chris who had wanted a child more than any of them could have known who had suffered silently through angies first miscarriage who hoped and prayed for the safe delivery of their second effort it had been an easy birth and the morning after does speech the three of them chris angie and the baby were found in the quiet of their stone house the life still ebbing from chris eyes and the gaps in his wrists im sorry he said over and over shaking his head as if he were cold his watery brown eyes dulling i just couldnt take it i just i just and he died the three of them were buried in the cemetery outside of town without coffins the town was different after the deaths a stifling quiet hanging in the streets few colonists ate at the communal meals choosing to take their suppers at home in an effort to bring everyone together jase encouraged them to come to town hall for movie night the film was the sound of music the screen erupted with sound and color dazzling green alps and snowcrested mountains happy song and the smiling faces of normal healthy children half the colonists walked out most of the women took contraceptives now except those who chose not to tamper with their estrogen balance for these doe performed painless menstrual extractions bimonthly nat and elise insisted on having more children maybe the problem only affected the firstborn they argued doe fought the idea at first he found himself combatting brews sullen withdrawal nats frantic insistence and a core of hot anger in his own wife earth could find a cure it was possible then their grandchildren would be normal again the heirs to a world he gave in but all the children were the same in the end nat alone had not given up she had borne five children and was carrying her sixth the message of failure was halfway to earth but any reply was still nineteen years away doe had adapted the habit of talking things over with jase hoping that he would catch some glimpse of a solution i still think its a disease he told jase who had heard that before but didnt mention it the bay was quiet and their lines were still they talked only during fishing trips they didnt want the rest of the colony brooding any more than they already were a mutant virus but ive been wondering could the changes have screwed us up a shorter day a longer year a little heavier gravity different air mixture no common cold no mosquito bites even that could be the key on a night like this in air this clear you could even see starglades casting streaks across the water a fish jumped far across the bay and phosphorescence lit that patch of water for a moment the orion vehicle maceshaped rose out of the west past the blaze of the pleiades roy would be rendezvousing with it now preparing for tomorrows year day celebration jase seemed to need these trips even more than doe after the murders the life seemed to have gone out of him only flashes of his personality coming through at tranquil times like these he asked are you going to have jill breed mosquitoes yes i think youre reaching werent you looking at the genes in the cytoplasm yeah elises idea and it was a good one id forgotten there were genes outside the cell nucleus they control the big things you know not the shape of your fingers but how many you get and where but theyre hard to find jase and maybe we found some differences between our genes and the childrens but even the computer doesnt know what the difference meanx mosquitoes jase shook his head we know theres a fish down that way shall we go after him weve got enough have to be home by morning year day what exactly are we celebrating this time hell youre the mayor you think of something doe sulked watching the water ripple around his float jase we cant give up jases face was slack with horror eyes east up to the sky doe followed his gaze to where a flaring light blossomed behind the orion spacecraft oh my god jase rasped roys up there throwing his bamboo pole in the water jase started the engine and raced for shore doe studied the readouts carefully mother of god he whispered how many engines did he fire six jills eyes were glued to the screen her voice flat if he was aboard he well there isnt much chance he survived the acceleration most of the equipment up there must be junk now but what if he did survive is there a chance i dont know roy was getting set to beam the messages down but said that he had an alarm to handle first he went away for a while and she seemed to search for words she whispered boom if he was outside the ship in one of the little rocket sleds he could get to the shuttle vehicle jase walked heavily into the lab what about cynnie what did she say doe asked quickly jases face was blank of emotion she talked to him before the accident and its all she would say im afraid she took it pretty bad this was sort of the final straw his eyes were hollow as he reminisced she was always a brave kid you know anything i could do shed be right behind me measuring up to big brother theres just a limit thats all theres just a limit does voice was firm only a slight edge of unease breaking through his control i think we had better face it roy is dead the orions ruined and the shuttlecraft is gone anyway he could be alive jifi ventured doe tried to take the sting out of his voice and was not entirely successful where on the ship crushed to a paste not on the shuttle its tumbling further from the orion every second theres no one on it in one of the rocket sleds his face softened and they could see that he was afraid to have hope yes maybe that maybe on one of the sleds they nodded to each other and they and the other colonists spent long hours on the telescope hoping and praying but there was nothing alive up there now ridgeback was entirely alone cynnie never recovered she would talk only to her brother refusing even to see her child she was morose and ate little spending most of her time watching the sky with something like terrified awe in her eyes and one day seven months after the accident she walked into the woods and never returned doe hadnt seen jerry for three weeks the children lived in a community complex which had some of the aspects of a boarding school the colonists took turns at nursing duty jill spent most of her time there since she and greg were on the outs lately elise had taken up the habit too not that he blamed her he couldnt have been very good company the last few months parents took their children out to the tshaped complex whenever they felt like itso that some of the children had more freedom than others but by and large they all were expected to live there eventually brew was coming out of the woods with a group of six children when doe stumbled out into the sunlight and saw jerry he wore a rough pair of coveralls that fit him well enough but he would have looked ludicrous if there had been anything to laugh about soft brown fur covered every inch of him as doe appeared he turned his head with a birdquick movement saw his father and scampered over jerry bounced into him wrapped long arms tight about his rib cage and said eagerly daddy there was a slight pause hello jerry doe slowly bent to the ground looking into his sons eyes daddy doe daddy doe he chattered smiling up at his father his vocabulary was about fifteen words jerry was six years old and much too big for his age his fingers were very long and strong but his thumbs were small and short and inconsequential doe had seen him handle silverware without much trouble his nose pugged jaw massive with a receding chin there were white markings in the fur around his eyes accentuating the heavy supraorbital ridges making the poor child look like the poor child doe snorted with selfcontempt listen to me why not my child because im ashamed because we lock our children away to ease the pain because they look like dcc gently disengaged jerrys fingers from his shirt turned and half ran back to the ship shivering he curled up on one of the cots and cursed himself to sleep hours later he roused himself and woozy with fatigue he went looking for jase he found him on a work detail in the north fields picking fruit im not sure he told jase theyre not old enough for me to be sure but i want your opinion show me said jase and followed him to the library the picture on the tape was an artists rendering of pithecanthropus ereetus he stood on a grassy knoll looking warily out at the viewer his longfingered hand clutching a sharpedged throwing rock ill smack your head said jase im wrong then youre calling them apes im not read the copy pithecanthropus was a smallbrained pleistocene primate thought to be a transitional stage between ape and man you got that pith is also called java man jase glared at the reader the markings are different and there is the fur forget em theyre nothing but guesswork all the artist had to go on were crumbling bones and some broken rocks broken rocks pith used to break rocks in half to get an edged weapon it was about the extent of his toolmaking ability all we know about what he looked like comes from fossilized bonesvery much like the skeleton of a stoop shouldered man with foot trouble topped with the skull of an ape with hydrocephalus very nice will eves children be fish i dont know dammit i dont know anything at all look pith isnt the only candidate for missing link homo habilis looked a lot more like us and lived about two million years ago kenyapithicus africanus resembled us less but lived eighteen million years earlier so i cant say what weve got here god only knows what the next generation will be like that depends on whether the children are moving backwards or maybe sideways i dont know jase i just dont know the last words were shrill and doe punctuated them by slamming his fist against a wire window screen then because he could think of nothing more to say he did it again and again and jase caught his arm three knuckles were torn and bleeding get some sleep he said eyes sad ill have them send earth a description of eve the way she is now shes oldest and best developed well send them all we have on her its all we can do momentum and the thoroughness of their training had kept them going for eight years now the work of making a world slowed and stopped it didnt matter the crops and the meat animals had no natural enemies on ridgeback life spread along the continent like a green plague already it had touched some of the islands doe was gathering fruit in the groves it was a shady place cool quiet and it made for a tranquil days work there was no set quota you took home approximately a third of what you gathered sometimes he worked there and sometimes he helped with the cattle examining for health and pregnancy or herding the animals with the nonlethal sonic stunners he wished that elise were here with him so they could laugh together but that was growing infrequent now she was growing more involved with the nursery and he spent little of his time there jills voice hailed him from the bottom of the ladder hey up there doe how about a break he grinned and climbed down hauling a sack of oranges tired of spending the day reading i guess she said lightly she offered him an apple he polished it on his shirt and took a bite just needed to talk to somebody kinda depressed oh i dont know i guess its just getting hard to cope with some of the problems i guess there have been a few jill gave a derisive chuckle i sure dont know greg anymore ever since he set up the brewery and the distillery he doesnt really want to see me at all dont take it so hard doe comforted the strain is showing on all of us half the town does little more than read or play tapes or drink personally id like to know who smuggled the hemp seeds on board jill laughed which he was glad for then her face grew serious again you know thered probably be more trouble if we didnt need someone to look after the kids she paused looking up at doe i spend a lot of my time there she said unnecessarily why it was the first time hed asked they bad left the groves and were heading back into town along the gravel road that greg and brew and the others had built in better days we i came here for a reason to continue the human race to cross a new frontier one that my children could have a part in now now that we know that the colony is doomed theres just no motive to anything no reason im surprised that there isnt more drinking more carousing and foursomes and divorces and everything else nothing seems to matter a whole lot nothing at all doe took her by the shoulders and held her go on and cry he silently said to her god im tired the children grew fast at nine eve reached puberty and seemed to shoot skyward she grew more hair she learned more words but not many more she spent much of her time in the trees in the childrens complex the older girls grew almost as fast as she did and the boys every saturday brew and nat took some of the children walking sometimes they climbed the foothills at the base of the continental range sometimes they wandered through the woods spending most of their efforts keeping the kids from disappearing into the trees one saturday they returned early their faces frozen in anger eve and jerry were missing at first they refused to discuss it but when jase began organizing a search party they talked theyd been ready to turn for home when eve suddenly scampered into the trees jerry gave a whoop and followed her nat had left the others with brew while she followed after the refugees it proved easy to find them and easier stifi to determine what they were doing with each other when she came upon them eve looked up at nat innocent eyes glazed with pleasure nat trembled for a moment horrified then drove them both away with a stick screaming filth at them over nats vehement objections and brews stoney refusal to join jase got his search party together and set off they met the children coming home by that time nat had talked to the other mothers and fathers at the childrens complex jase called a meeting there was no way to avoid it now feelings were running too deep we may as well decide now he told them that night theres no question of the children marrying we could train them to mouth the words of any of our religions but we couldnt expect them to understand what they were saying so the question is shall we let the children reproduce he faced an embarrassed silence theres no question of their being too young in biological terms they arent or you could all go home in our terms theyll never be old enough anyone have anything to say lets have does opinion a hoarse voice called there was a trickle of supportive applause doe rose feeling very heavy fellow colonists the smile he was trying on for size didnt fit his face he let it drop there was a desperate compassion in his voice this world will never be habitable to mankind until we find out what went wrong here i say let our children breed someday someone on earth may find out how to cure what weve caught maybe hell know how to let our descendants breed men again maybe this problem will only last a generation or two then well get human babies again if not well what have we lost who else is there to inherit ridgeback no the sound was a tortured meld of hatred and venom that was nat siinhaired loving mother of six with her face a strained mask of frustration i didnt risk my life and leave my family and and train for yearsandbleedandsweatandtoilsomylaborcouldfallto to a bunch of goddamned monkeys brew pulled her back to her seat but by now the crowd was muttering and arguing to itself the noise grew louder there was shouting the yelling too grew in intensity jase shouted over the throng lets talk this out peacefully brew was standing screaming at the people who disagreed with him and natalie now it was becoming a shoving match and brew was getting more furious doe pushed his way into the crowd hoping to reach brew and calm him the room was beginning to break down into tangled knots of angry emotionally charged people he grabbed the big mans arm and tried to speak but the swede turned bright baleful eyes on him and swung a heavy fist doe felt pain explode in his jaw and tasted blood he fell to the ground and was helped up again brew standing over him challengingly stay out of our lives doctor he sneered openly now youve never helped anything before dont try to start now he tried to speak but felt the pain and knew his jaw was fractured a soft hand took his arm and he turned to see elise big green eyes luminous with pity and fear without struggling he allowed her to take him to the ship infirmary as they left the auditorium he could hear the shouting and struggling jase on the microphone trying to calm them and the coldly murderous voices that screamed for no monkey grandchildren he tried to turn his head towards the distant sound of argument as elise set the bone and injected quickhealing serums she took his face and kissed him softly with more affection than she had shown in months and said theyre afraid harry then kissed him again and led him home doe raged inwardly at his jaw that week its pain prevented him from joining in the debate which now flared in every corner of the colony light images swam across his closed eyes as the sound of fists pounding against wood roused him from dreamless sleep doe threw on a robe and padded barefoot across the cool stone floor of his house peering at the front door with distaste before opening it jase was there and some of the others sombre and implacable in the mornings cool light weve decided doe jase said at last doe sensed what was coming the children are not to breed im sorry i know how you feel doe grunted how could jase know how he felt when lie wasnt sure himself were going to have to ask you to perform the sterilizations does hearing faded down to a low fuzz and he barely heard the words this is the way the world ends jase looked at his friend feeling the distaste between them grow all right well give you a week to change your mind if not elise or greg will have to do it without saying anything more they left doe moped around that morning even though elise swore to him that shed never do it she fussed over him as they fixed breakfast in the kitchen the gas stove burned methane reclaimed from waste products the flame giving more heat control than the microwaves some of the others had normally doe enjoyed scrambling eggs and woking fresh slivered vegetables into crisp perfection but nothing she said or did seemed to lift him out of his mood he ate lightly then got dressed and left the house although she was concerned elise did not follow him he went out to the distifiery where greg spent much of his time under the sun drunk and playing at being happy would you the pain still muffled does words would you sterilize them greg looked at him blearily still hung over from the previous evenings alcoholic orgy you dont understand man there was a stirring sound from the sheltered bedroom behind the distillery and a womans waking groan doe knew it wasnt jifi you just dont understand doe sat down wishing he had the nerve to ask for a drink maybe i dont do you no no i dont so ill follow the herd im a builder i build roads and i build houses ill leave the moralizing to you big brains doe tried to say something and found that no words would come he needed something he needed here doe you know you want it greg handed him a eannister with a straw in it best damn vodka in the world he paused and the slur dropped from his voice and this is the world doe for us for the rest of our lives youve just got to learn to roll with it he smiled again and mixed himself an evillooking drink gregs guest had evidently roused herself and dressed doe could hear her now singing a snatch of song as she left he didnt want to recognize the voice got any orange juice doe mumbled after sipping the vodka greg tossed him an orange a real man works for his pleasures dcc laughed and took another sip of the burning fluid good lord what is that mess youre drinking its a black samurai sake and soy sauce doe choked how can you drink that variety my friend the stimulation of the bizarre doe was silent for a long time senses swimming he watched the sun climb feeling the warmth as morning melted into afternoon he downed a slug of his third screwdriver and said irritably you cant do it greg if you sterilize the children its over so what its over anyway if they wanna let a drunk slit the pee pees of their shall we say atavistic progeny yeah that sounds nice well if they want me to do it i guess ill have to do it he looked at doe very carefully i do have my sense of civic duty how about you doe i tried he mumbled feeling the liquor burning his throat feeling the lightheadedness exert its pull i tried and ive failed youve failed so far what were your goals to keep he took a drink damn that felt good to keep the colony healthy thats what its a disaster were at each others throats we kill our babies doe lowered his head unable to continue they were both silent then greg said if ive gotta do it i will doe if its not me itll be someone else who reads a couple of medical texts and wants to play doetor im sorry doe sat thinking his hands were shaking i cant do that he couldnt even feel the pain anymore then do what you gotta do man and gregs voice was dead sober will you can you help me doe bit his lip this is my civic duty you know yea i know he shook his head im sorry i wish i could help a few minutes passed then doe said drunkenly theres got to be a way there just has to be wish i could help doe i wish you could too doe said sincerely then rose and staggered back to his house it rained the night he made his decision one of the quick hot rains that swept from the coast to the mountains in a thunderclap of fury it would make a perfect cover he gathered his medical texts a bible and a few other books regretting that most of the information available to him was electronically encoded dcc took oneof the silent stunners from the armory the nonlethal weapons had only been used as livestock controllers there had never been another need until now from the infirmary he took a portable medical kit stoeking it with extra bandages and medicine then took it all to the big cargo flyer it was collapsible with a fabric fusilage held rigid by highly compressed air in fabric structural tubing he put it in one of the soundless electric trucks and inflated it behind the childrens complex there was plenty of room inside the fence for building and for a huge playground with fruit trees and all the immemorial toys of the very young after the children had learned to operate a latch brew had made a lock for the gate and given everyone a key doe clicked it open and moved in he stayed in the shadows creeping close to the main desk where elise worked you can tfollow where i must go he thought regretfully you and i are the only fully trained medical personnel you must stay with the others im sorry darling and he stunned her to sleep silently moving up to catch her head as it slumped to the table for the last time he gently kissed her mouth and her closed eyes the children were in the left wingone room for each sex with floors all mattress and no covers because they could not be taught to use a bed he sprayed the sound waves up and down the sleeping forms the parabolic reflector leaked a little so that his arm was numb to the elbow when he was finished he shook his hand trying to get some feeling back into it then gave up and settled into the hard work of carrying the children to the flyer he hustled them through the warm rain bending under their weight but still working swiftly doe arranged them on the fabric floor in positions that looked comfortablethe positions of sleeping men rather than sleeping animals for some time he stood looking down at jerry his son and at lori his daughter thinking things he could not afterwards remember he flew north the flyer was slow and not soundless it must have awakened people but hed have some time before anyone realized what had happened where the forest had almost petered out he hovered down and landed gently enough that only a slumbering moan rose from the children good he took half of them including jerry and lori and spread them out under the trees after he had made sure that they had cover from the air he took the other packages the books and the medical kit and hid them under a bush a few yards away from the children he stole one last look at them his heirs small and defenseless asleep he could see elise in them in the color of their hair as elise could see him in their eyes and cheeks kneading his shoulder he hurried back to the ship there was more for him to do skipping the ship off again he cruised thirty miles west near the stark ridge of mountains their sombre grey still broken only sparsely by patches of green there he left the other seven children let the two groups develop separately he thought they wouldnt starve and they wouldnt die of exposure not with the pelts they had grown many would remain alive and free he hoped jerry and lori would be among them doe lifted the flyer off and swept it out to the ocean only a quarter mile offshore were the first of the islands lush now with primitive foliage they spun beneath him floating brownishgreen upon a still blue sea now he could feel his heartbeat taste his fear but there was resolve too more certain and calm than any he had known in his life he cut speed and locked the controls setting the craft on a gradual decline shivering already he pulled on his life jacket and walked to the emergency hatch screwing it open quickly the wind whipped his face the cutting edge of salt narrowing his eyes peering against the wall of air pressure he was able to see the island coming up on him now looming close the water was only a hundred feet below him now eighty sixty the rumbling of the shallow breakers joined with the tearing wind and fighting his fear he waited until the last possible moment before hurling himself from the doorway he remembered falling he remembered hitting the water at awful speed the spray ripping into him the physical impact like the blow of a great hand when his head broke surface doe wheezed for air swallowed salty liquid and thrashed for balance in the distance he saw the flash of light and a moment later heard the shattering roar as the flyer spent itself on the rocky shore jase was tired he was often tired lately although he still managed to get his work done the fields had only recently become unkempt as marlow and billie and jill and the others grew more and more inclined to pick their vegetables from their backyard gardens so just he and a few more still rode out to the fields on the tractors still kept close watch on the herds still did the handpruning so necessary to keep the fruit trees healthy the children were of some help ten years ago atew of them had been captured around the foothill area they had been sterilized of course and taught to weed and carry firewood and a few other simple tasks jase leaned on his staff and watched the shaggy figures moving along the street sweeping and cleaning he had grown old on this world their ridgeback he regretted much that had happened here especially that night thirtysome years before when doe had taken the children taken themwhere some argued for the islands some for the west side of the mountain range some believed that the children had died in the crash of the flyer jase had believed that until the adult piths were captured now it was hard to say what happened it was growing chill now the streetlights winking on to brighten the long shadows a setting tau ceti cast upon the ground he drew his coat tighter across his shoulders and walked back to his house it was a lonelier place to be since june had died but it was still home fumbling with the latch he pushed the door open and reached around for the light switch as it ificked on he froze my god hello jase the figure was tall and spare clothes ragged but greying hair and beard cut squarely three of the children were with him after all this time doe jase said still unbelieving it is you isnt it the bearded man smiled uncertainly showing teeth that were white but chipped its been a long time jase a very long time the three piths were quiet and alert sniffing the air of this strange place are these yes jerry and lori and eve and a small addition one of the threegod could it be eve sniffed up to jase the soft golden fur on her face was tinged with grey but she carried a young child at her breast jerry stood tall for a preman eyeing jase warily he carried a sharpened stick in one knobby hand jase sat down speechless he looked up into the burning eyes of the man he had known thirty years before youre still officially under a death sentence you know doe nodded his head for kidnapping murder no one was sure what had happened to you whether you or any of the children had survived doe too sat down for the first time the light in his eyes dimmed yes we survived i swam to shore after crashing the flyer and found the place where i had left the children he thought for a moment then asked quietly how is elise and all the others jase was unable to raise his eyes from the floor she died three years ago doe she was never the same after you left she thought you were dead that the children were dead couldnt you have at least told her about your plan or gotten her a message does fingers played absently with his beard as he shook his head i couldnt involve her i couldnt could you show me where shes buried jase of course what about the others well none of the people were the same after the children left some just seemed to lose purpose brews dead greg drank himself under four of the others have died jase paused thinking do any of the others know youre here no i slipped in just at dusk i wasnt sure what kind of a reception id get im still not sure jase hesitated why did you do it the room was quiet save for a scratching sound as jerry fingered an ear fleas absurd jill had never uncrated them i had to know jase he said there was no uncertainty in his voice in fact there was an imperious quality he had never had in the old days the question was would they breed true was the pith effect only temporary was it no it persisted i had to know if they were regressing or evolving and they remained the same in subsequent generations save for natural selection and there isnt much of that jase watched lori her stubby fingers untangling mats in her fur her huge brown eyes were alive and vital she was a lovely creature he decided doe what are the children what do you think you know what i think an alien species wants our worlds in a hundred years theyll land and take them what theyll do with the children is anybodys guess i he couldnt bring himself to look at eve i wish youd sterilized them doe maybe you do jase but you see i dont believe in your aliens jases breath froze in his throat they might want our world said doe but why would they want our life forms everything but man is spreading like a plague of loeusts if someone wants ridgeback why havent they done something about it by the time they land terrestrial life will have an unsthppable foothold look at all the thousands of years weve been trying to stamp out just one life form the influenza viruses no ive got another idea do you know what a locust is i know what they are ive never seen one as individuals theyre something like a short grasshopper as individuals they hide or sleep in the daytime and come out at night in open country you can hear them chirping after dusk but otherwise nobody notices them but theyre out there eating and breeding and breeding and eating getting more numerous over a period of years until one day there are too many for the environment to produce enough food then comes the change on earth it hasnt happened in a long time because they arent allowed to get that numerous but it used to be that when there were enough of them theyd grow bigger and darker and more aggressive theyd come out in the daytime theyd eat everything in sight and when all the food was gone and when there were enough of them theyd suddenly take off all at once thats when youd get your plague of locusts theyd drop from the air in a cloud thick enough and broad enough to darken the sky and when they landed in a farmers field he could kiss his crops goodbye theyd raze it to the soil then take off again leaving nothing jase took off his glasses and wiped them i dont see what it is youre getting at why do they do it why were locusts built that way evolution i guess after the big flight theyd be spread over a lot of territory id say theyd have a much bigger potential food supply right now consider this take a biped thats man shaped enough so to use a tool but without intelligence plant him on a world and watch him grow say hes adaptable say he eventually spread over most of the fertile land masses of the planet now what now an actual physical change takes place the brain expands the body hair drops away evolution had adapted him to his climate but that was when he had hair now hes got to use his intelligence to keep from freezing to death hell discover fire hell move out into areas he couldnt live in before eventually hell cover the whole planet and hell build spacecraft and head for the stars jase shook his head but why would they change hoc c doe something in the genes maybe something that didnt mutate not how doe we know its possible why were going back to being grasshoppers maybe weve reached our evolutionary peak natural selection stops when we start protecting the weak ones instead of allowing those with defective genes to die a natural death he paused smiling i mean look at us jase you walk with a cane now i havent been able to read for five years my eyes have weakened so and we were the best earth had to offer the best minds the finest bodies chris only squeaked by with his glasses because he was such a damn good meteorologist jases face held a flash of longforgotten pain and i guess they still didnt choose carefully enough no doe agreed soberly they didnt on earth we protected the sick allowed them to breed instead of letting them die with pacemakers with insulin artificial kidneys and plastic hip joints and trusses the mentally ill and retarded fought in the courts for the right to reproduce okay its humane nature isnt humane the infirm will do their job by dying and no morality or humane court rulings or medical advances will change the natural course of things for a long long time how long i dont know how stable they are it could be millions of years or doe shrugged weve changed the course of our own development perhaps a simpler creature is needed to colonize a world something that has no choice but to change or die jase remember the cold war i read about it and the belt embargo remember diseromide and smog and the spraycan thing and the day the fusion seawater distillery at san francisco went up and took the bay area with it and four states had to have their water flown in for a month so a dozen times we could have wiped out all life on earth as soon as weve used our inteffigence to build spacecraft and seed another world intelligence becomes a liability some old anthropologist even had a theory that a species needs abstract intelligence before it can prey on its own kind the development of fire gave man time to sit back and dream up ways to take things he hadnt earned you know how gentle the children are and you can remember how the carefully chosen citizens of ridgeback acted the night we voted on the childrens right to reproduce so you gave that to them doe they are reproducing and when were gone theyll spread all over the world but are they human doe pondered wondering what to say for many years he had talked only to the children the children never interrupted never disagreed i had to know that too yes theyre human jase looked closely at the man he had called friend so many years ago doe was so sure he didnt discuss he lectured jase felt an alienness in him that was deeper than the mere passage of time are you going to stay here now i dont know the children dont need me any more though theyve treated me like a god i cant pass anything on to them i think our culture has to die before theirs can grow jase fidgeted uncomfortable doe something ive got to tell you i havent told anyone its thirty years now and nobody knows but me doe frowned go on remember the day roy died something in the orion blew all the motors at once well he talked to cynnie first and she talked to me before she disappeared doe he got a laser message from earth and he knew he couldnt ever send it down it would have destroyed us so he blew the motors doe waited listening intently it seems that every child being born on earth nowadays bears an uncanny resemblance to pithecanthropus erectus they were begging us to make the ridgeback colony work because earth is doomed im glad nobody knew that jase nodded if inteffigence is bad for us its bad for earth theyve fired their starships now theyre ready for another cycle most of themll die theyre too crowded some will survive if not there then thanks to you here he smiled a touch of the old jase in his eyes theyll have to become men you know why do you put it like that because jill uncrated the wolves to help thin out the herds theyll cull the children too doe nodded i couldnt help them become men but i think that will do it they will have to band together and find tools and fire his voice took on a dreamy quality eventually the wolves will come out of the darkness to join them at their campfires and man will have dogs again he smiled i hope they dont overbreed them like we did on earth i doubt ifchihuahuas have ever forgotten what we did to them doe jase said urgently will you trust me will you wait for a minute while i leave i i want to try something if you decide to go there may never be another chance doe looked at him mystified airight ill wait jase limped out of the door doe sat watching his charges proud of their alertness and flexibility their potential for growth in the new land there was a creaking as the door swung open the womans hair had been blond once now it was white heavy wrinkles around her eyes and mouth years of hardship and disappointment souring what had once been beauty she blinked at first seeing only dcc hello nat he said to her she frowned what then she saw eve their eyes loeked and nat would have drawn back save for jases insistent hand at her back eve drew close peering into her mothers face as if trying to remember her the old woman stuttered then said eve the pith cocked her head and came closer touching her mothers hand nat pulled it back eyes wide eve cooed smiling holding her baby out to nat at first she flinched then looked at the child so much like eve had been so much and slowly without words or visible emotion she took the child from eve and cradled it held it and began to tremble her hand stretched out helplessly and eve came closer took her mothers hand and the three of them mother child and grandchild children of different worlds held each other nat cried for the pain that had driven them apart the love that had brought them together doe stood at the edge of the woods looking back at the colonists who waved to them asking for a swift return perhaps so perhaps they could now enough time had passed that understanding was a thing to be sought rather than avoided and he missed the company of his own kind no he corrected himself the children were his kind as he had told jase without explaining he knew that they were human he had tested it the only way he could by the only means available eve walked beside him her hand seeking his doe she cooed her birdlike singsong voice loving he gently took their child from her arms kissing it at over sixty years of age it felt odd to be a new father but if his lover had her way as she usually did his strange family might grow larger still together the five of them headed into the forest and home yet another modest proposal the roentgen standard it happened around the time of world war i the director of research for standard oil was told theres all this goo left over when we refine oil its terrible stufl it ruins the landscape and covering it with dirt only gets the dirt gooey find something to do with it so he created the plastics industry he turned useless offensive goo into wealth he was not the first in history to do so consider oil itself useless offensive goo until it was needed to lubricate machinery and later to fuel it consider some of the horrid substances that go into cosmetics mud organic goop of all kinds and stuff that comes out of a sick whales head consider sturgeon caviar american fishermen are still throwing it away and the japanese consider cheese to be what it always started out to be sour milk now present plans for disposal of expended nuclear fuel involve such strategies as diluting and burying it pouring it into old abandoned oil wells the soviets tell us that it ought to be safe after all the oil stayed there for millions of years we may question their sincerity the depleted oil wells they use for this purpose are all in poland the pournelle method the no nukes types tell us that stretches of american desert have already been rendered useless for thousands of years because thermonuclear bombs were tested there let us take them at their word cart the nuclear wastes out into a patch of cratered desert put several miles of fence around it and signs on the fence if you cross this fence you will die granted there will be people willing to cross the fence think of it as evolution in action average human intelligence goes up by a fraction of a percent drop the radioactive wastes in canisters into the seabed folds where the continental plates are sliding under each other the radioactives would disappear back into the magma from which they came each of these solutions gets rid of the stuff but at some expense and no profit what the world needs now is another genius we need a way to turn radioactive wastes into wealth and i believe i know the way directly make coins out of it radioactive money has certain obvious advantages a healthy economy depends on money circulating fast make it radioactive and it will certainly circulate verifying the authenticity of money would become easy geiger counters like pocket calculators before them would become both tiny and cheap due to mass production you would hear their rapid clicking at every ticket window a particle accelerator is too expensive for a counterfeiter counterfeiting would become a lost art the economy would be boosted in a number of ways lead would become extremely valuable even the collection plates in a church would have to be made of lead bank vaults would have to be lead lined and the coins separated by dampers styles of clothing would be affected every purse and one pocket in every pair of pants would need to be shielded in lead even so the concept of money burning a hole in your pocket would take on new meaning gold would still be the mark of wealth gold blocks radiation as easily as lead it would be used to shield the wealthy from their money the profession of tax collector would carry its own well deserved penalty so would certain other professions an arab oil sheik might still grow obscenely rich but at least we could count on his spending it as fast as it comes in lest it go up in a fireball a crooked politician would have to take bribes by credit card making it easier to convict him a bank robber would be conspicuous staggering up to the tellers window in his heavy leadshielding clothing the successful pickpocket would also stand out in a crowd a thick leadlined glove would be a dead giveaway but without it he could be identified by his sickly faintly glowing hands society might even have to revive an ancient practice amputating the felons hand as a therapeutic measure before it kills him foreign aid could be delivered by icbm is this just another crazy utopian scheme or could the american people be brought to accept the radioactive standard as money perhaps we could its got to be better than watching green paper approach its intrinsic value the cost of making and printing a dollar bill which used to be one and a half cents is rising inexorably toward one dollar if only we could count on its stopping there but it costs the same to print a twenty at least the radioactive money would have intrinsic value what we have been calling nuclear waste our descendants may well refer to as fuel it is dangerous precisely because it undergoes fission because it delivers power unfortunately the stuff doesnt last thousands of years in six hundred years the expended fuel is no more radioactive than the ore it was mined from dropping radioactives into the sea is wasteful we can ensure that they will still be around when the earths oil and coal and plutonium have been used up by turning them into money now more tales from the draco tavern folk tale a lot of what comes out of xenobiology these days is classified and it doesnt come out the graduate studies complex is in the mojave desert it makes security easier sireen burkes smile and honest blue retina prints and the microcircuitry in her badge got her past the gate i was ordered out of the car a soldier offered me coffee and a bench in the shade of the guard post another searched my luggage he found a canteen a sizable hunting knife in a locking sheath and a microwave beamer he became coldly polite he didnt thaw much when i said that he could hold them for awhile i waited presently sireen came back for me i got you an interview with dr mcphee she told me on the way up the drive now its your baby hell listen as long as you can keep his interest graduate studies looked like soap bubbles foaincrete sprayed over inflation frames there was little of military flavor inside more like a museum the reception room was gigantic with a variety of chairs and couches and swings and resting pits for aliens and humans designs borrowed from the draco tavern without my permission the corridors were roomy too lhree chirpsithra passed us eleven feet tall and walking comfortably upright one may have known me because she nodded a dark glass sphere rolled through nearly filling the corridor and we had to step into what looked like a classroom to let it pass mephees office was closetsized he certainly didnt interview aliens here at least not large aliens yet he was a mountainous man six feet four and barrelshaped and covered with black hair shaggy brows full beard a black mat showing through the v of his blouse he extended a huge hand across the small desk and said rick schumann youre a long way from siberia i came for advice i said and then i recognized him bbeam mcphee walter but yes the beta beam satellite had never been used in war but when i was seven years old the pentagon had arranged a demonstration theyd turned it loose on a perseid meteor shower lines of light had filled the sky one summer night a glorious display the first time id ever been allowed up past midnight the beta beam had shot down over a thousand rocks newscasters had named walter mcphee for the beta beam when he played offensive guard for washburn university bbeam was twentytwo years older and bigger than life since id last seen him on a television set there were scars around his right eye and scarring distorted the lay of his beard i was at washburn on an athletic scholarship he told me i switched to xeno when the first chirpsithra ships landed got my doctorate six years ago and ive never been in the draco tavern because it would have felt too much like goofing off but ive started to wonder if that isnt a mistake you get everything in there dont you i said it proudly everything that lands on earth visits the draco tavern folk too yes not often four times in fifteen years the first time i thought theyd want to talk after all they came a long way he shook his head vigorously theyd rather associate with other carnivores ive talked with them but its damn clear theyre not here to have fun talking to local study groups is a guesthost obligation what do you know about them just what i see they come in groups four to six theyll talk to glig and of course they get along with chirpsithra everything does this latest group was thin as opposed to skeletal though ive seen both theyre skeletal just before they eat they dont associate with aliens then because it turns them mean they only eat every six days or so and of course theyre hungry when they hunt youve seen hunts ill show you films go on better than id hoped i need to see those films ive been invited on a hunt sheen told me i said this is my slack season two of the big interstellar ships took off wednesday and we dont expect another for a couple of weeks last night there were no aliens at all until this all happened last night yeah maybe twenty hours ago i told sheen and gail to go home but they stayed anyway the girls are grad students in xeno of course working in a bar that caters to alien species isnt a job for your average waitress they stayed and talked with some other xenos we didnt hear what happened but we saw it sheen said five folk came in anything special about them she said they came in on all fours with their heads tilted up to see one alphamale three females and a betamale i think the beta had a wound along its left side growing back they were wearing the usual translators built into earmuffs and socks with slits for the fingers on the forefeet their ears were closed tight against the background noise they didnt try to talk till theyd reached a table and turned on the sound baffle i cant tell the folk apart they look a little like siberian elkhounds if you dont mind the head the head is big the eyes are below the jawline and face forward theres a nostril on top that closes tight or opens like a trumpet they weigh about a hundred pounds their fingers are above the callus and they curl up out of the way their fur is black sleek with white markings in curly lines we cant say their word for themselves their voices are too high and too soft we call them the folk because their translators do i said they stood up and pulled themselves onto ottomans i went to take their orders they were talking in nearly supersonic squeaks with their translators turned off you had to strain to hear anything one turned on his translator and ordered five glasses of milk and a drink for myself if i would join them any idea why i was the closest thing to a meat eater maybe and maybe the local alphamale thought they should get to know something about humans as opposed to grad students or mcphee grinned had you eaten recently yeah someone finally built a sushi place near the spaceport i cant do my own cooking id go nuts if i had to run an alien restaurant too raw flesh they smelled it on your breath oh i poured their milk and a double scotch and soda i dont usually drink on the premises but i figured sheen or gail could handle anything that came up it was the usual i said whats it like to be human whats it like to be folk trade items what are they missing that could improve their lifestyles eating habits the big one did most of the talking i remember saying that we have an ancestor whos supposed to have fed itself by running alongside an antelope while beating it on the head with a club till it fell over and he told me that his ancestors traveled in clustershe didnt say packsand followed herds of planteaters to pull down the slow and the sick early biological engineering he said mcphee looked worried do the folk expect you to outrun an antelope oboy that was a terrible thought no we talked about that too how brains and civilization cost you other abilities smell for humans i got a feeling he wanted to think were carnivores unless we run out of live meat i tried not to disillusion him but i had to tell him about cooking that we like the taste that it kills parasites and softens vegetables and meat why he asked jesus bbeam you dont lie to aliens do you he grinned i never have im never sure what they want to hear well i never lie to customersand he talked about the hunts how little they test the folks animal abilities how the whole species is getting soft i guess he saw how curious i was he invited me on a hunt five days from now youve got a problem anyone in this building would kill for riight but what the hell do they expect of me where does it take place the folk have an embassy not fifty miles from here yeah and its a hunting ground too and ill be out there next wednesday getting my own meal i may have been a little drunk i did have the wit to ask if i could bring a companion and bbeam looked like he was about to spring across the desk into my lap he said yes thats my nobel prize calling said bbeam rick schumann will you accept me as your ah second sure i didnt have to think hard not only did he have the knowledge he looked like he could strangle a grizzly bear which might be what they expected of us the folk had arrived aboard a chirpsithra liner five years after the first chirp landing theyd leased a stretch of the mojave theyd i earranged the local weather and terrain over strenuous objections from the sierra club and seeded it with a hundred varieties of plants and a score of animals meanwhile they toured the worlds national parks in a with a redesigned interior the media had been fascinated by the sleek black killing machines theyd have given them even more coverage if the folk had been more loquacious three years of that and then the public was barred from the folk hunting ground intraworld cable sued citing the publics righttoknow they lost certain guest species would leave earth and others would kill to protect their privacy intraworld cable would have killed to air this film the sunset colors were fading from the sky still a mojave desert sky though the land was an alien meadow with patches of forest around it grass stood three feet tall in places dark green verging on black alien trees grew bent as if before a ferocious wind but they bent in different directions four creatures grazed near a stream none of the folk were in view the folk dont give a damn about privacy bbeam said its pack thinking maybe they dont mind our inking pictures i dont think theyd mind our broadcasting everything weve got world wide it was all the noisy news helicopters that bothered them once we realised that we negotiated now theres one xenobiology department lifter and some cameras around the fences the creatures might have been a gazelle with ambitions to be a giraffe but the mouth and eyes and horns gave them away alien the horns were big and gaudy intricately curved and intertwined quite lovely and quite useless for the tips pointed inward the neck was long and slender the mouth was like a shovel the eyes like folk eyes were below the jaw hinges though they faced outward as with most grazing beasts the creatures couldnt look up didnt the folk planet have birds of prey or heights from which something hungry might leap bbeam reclined almost sleepily in a folding chair too small for him he said we call it a melk a mock elk dont picture it evolving the usual way notice the horns melks were shaped by generations of planned breeding like a show poodle and the grass we call it fat gra s why hey seen them id glimpsed a shadow flowing among the trees the melks had sensed something too their heads were up tilted way up to let them see a concealed nostril splayed like a small horn three folk stood upright from the grass and screamed like steamwhistles the meiks scattered in all directions shadows flowed in the black grass one melk found two folk suddenly before it shrieking the melk bellowed in despair wheeled and made for the trees too slow a deer could have moved much faster the camera zoomed to follow it into the treesand into contact with a black shadow i glimpsed a forefoot band slashing at the creatures vulnerable throat then the shadow was clinging to its back and the melk tried to run from the forest with red blood spilling down its chest the rest of the folk converged on it they tore it apart they dragged it into the trees before they ate part of me was horrified but not so damn horrified as all that maybe ive been with aliens too long part of me watched and noticed the strange configuration of the ribcage the thickness and the familiar design of legs and knees and the convenient way the skull split to expose brain when two folk pulled the horns apart the folk left nothing but bone they split the thick leg bones with their jaws and gnawed the interiors when they were finished they rolled the bones into a neat pile and departed at a waddle bbeam said thats why we dont give these films to the news notice anything too much the one they picked it wasnt just the smallest the horns werent right like one grew faster than the other right none of the folk were carrying anything or wearing anything no knives no clothes not even those sockgloves what do they do in winter they still hunt naked what else the rest drove it toward that one hidden in the woods theres one designated killer once the preys fate is sealed the rest converge there are other meat sources here there was a turkeysized bird with wonderful iridescent patterns on its small wings and enormous spreading tail it flew but not well the folk ran beneath it until it ran out of steam and had to come down into their waiting hands the rest drew back for the leader to make the kill bbeam said they killed four that day want to watch it all went just about the same way show me i thought i might see right the third attempt the bird was making for the trees with the folk just underneath it might make it could the folk handle trees but the folk broke off far short of the trees the bird fled to safety while they converged on another that had landed too soon and frightened it into panicky circles enough of that i said bbeam the folk sent some stuff to the draco tavern by courier your gate security has it now i think id better get it back a microwave beamer and a hunting knife and canteen and it all looks like it came from abercrombie and fitch he stared at me considering did they what do you think i think theyre making allowances because im human he shook his head they make things easy for themselves they cull the herds but they kill the most difficult ones too anything that injures a folk dies so okay theyve made things easy for us too i doubt theyre out to humiliate us they didnt leave extra gear for your companion an instructor led us in stretching exercises isometrics duckwaddles sprints and an hour of just running for two hours each day there was a spa and a masseur and i needed them i was blind with exhaustion after every session yet i sensed that they were being careful of me the game was over if i injured myself bbeam put us on a starvation diet i want us thinking hungry thinking like folk besides we can both stand to lose a few pounds i studied folk physiology more closely than i would have stared at a customer the pointed mouths show two downpointing daggers in front then a gap then teeth that look like two conical canines fused together they look vicious the eyes face forward in deep sockets below the hinges of the jaw white with brown irises oddly human their fingers are short and thick tipped with thick claws three to a forefoot with the forward edge of the pad to serve as a thumb human hands are better i think but if the eyes had been placed like a wolfs they couldnt have seen their hands while standing up and they wouldnt be tool users my gear was delivered i strung the canteen and the beamer and the sheath knife on a loop of line i filled the canteen with water changed my mind and replaced it with gatorade and left it all in a refrigerator i watched three more hunts once they hunted melk again once it was pigs that wasnt very interesting bbeam said those were a gift we mated pigs to wild boars raised them in bottles and turned them loose the folk were polite but i dont think they like them much theyre too easy the last film must have been taken at night lightamplified for the moon was blazing like the sun the prey bad two enormous legs with too many joints a sm ish torso slung horizontally between the shoulders and tiny fingers around a strange mouth again it looked well fed it was in the forest eating into a hanging melonsized fruit without bothering to pick it i said that doesnt look right bbeam said no it didnt evolve alongside the folk different planet gligsfith tcharl maybe we call them stilts it was faster than hell and could jump too but the folk were spread out and they were always in front of it they kept it running in a circle until it stepped wrong and lost its balance one folk zipped toward it the sti lt tumbled with its legs folded and stood up immediately but it still took too long the designated killer wrapped itself around one leg its jaws closed on the ankle the stilt kicked at its assailant a dozen kicks in a dozen seconds then the bone snapped and the rest of the folk moved in do you suppose theyll wear translators when they hunt with us id guess they wont i know some folk words and ive been boning up and ive got a horde of students looking for anything on folk eating habits ive got a suspicion rick why are we doing this we ought to get to know them why what have we seen that makes them worth knowing i was hungry and i ached everywhere i had to think before i answered oh enough eating habits aside the folk arent totally asocial theyre here and they arent xenophobes bbeam suppose they dont have anything to teach us theyre still part of a galactic civilization and we want to be out there with them i just want hiim nity to look good look good yeah i did wonder why you didnt even hesitate have you ever been hunting no you yeah my uncles used to take me deer hunting have you ever killed anything hired out as a butcher for instance no and i waited to say sure i can kill an animal no sweal hell i promised but he didnt ask he only looked i never did mention my other fear for all i know it never occurred to anyone else that bbeam and i might be the prey intelligent beings if gullible armed but with inadequate weapons betrayed and thus enraged likely to fight back the fplk eat earthborn meat surely we would make more interesting prey than the boarpigsl but it was plain crazy the chirpsithra enforced laws against murder if humans were to disappear within the mojave hunting park the folk might be barred from the chirp linersl they wouldnt dare the folk caine for us at dawn we rode in the xenobiology lifter we left the air ducts wide open the smell of five folk behind us was rich and strange not quite an anim smell but something else and not entirely pleasant if the folk noticed our scent they didnt seem to mind bbeam seemed msingly relaxed at one point he told me casually were in danger of missing a point were here to have fun the folk dont know weve been sweating and moaning and they wont youre being honored rick have fun at midmorning we landed and walked toward a fence it was humanbuilt posted with signs in half a dozen languages no entry danger bbeam took us through the gate then the folk waited bbeam exchanged yelps with them then told me youre expected to lead me why surprise youre the designated killer me it seemed silly but it was their hunt lied off what are we hunting you make that decision too well inside the fence we crossed what seemed a meandering dune varying from five to eight meters high curving out of sight to left and right outside the dune was desert inside meadow a stream poured out of the dune further away and much lower its returning loop flowed back into the dune the dune hid pumps it might hide defenses the greenblack grass wasnt thin like grass it was a succulent like threefoottall fingers of spineless cactus nice to the touch fat gra c sawgrass would have been a real problem we wore nothing but swim suits and the items strung on a line across my shoulders anyofthefolk orbbeamhimself wouldhavemadeabetterkiller than one middleaged bartender of course had the beamer and it would kill but it wouldnt kill fast anything large would be hurt and angry long before it fell over all five folk dropped silently to their bellies i hadnt seen anything so i stayed upright but i was walking carefully naked humans might not spook the prey anyway theyd be alert for folk bbeams eyes tried to see everywhere at once he whispered i got my report on folk eating habits well they drink water and milk theyve never been seen eating they dont buy food pets or pets or livestock i thought of that missing persons reports oh for christs sake rick no this is the only way they eat its not a hunt so much as a formal dinner party the rules of etiquette are likely to be rigid rigid hell id watched them tearing live animals apart water gurgled ahead the artificial stream ran everywhere i never wondered about the canteen i said why a canteen bbeam yelped softly a folk squeaked back yelp and squeak and bbeam tried to suppress a laugh you must have talked about drinking wine with meals i did is there supposed to be wine in this thing bbeam grinned then lost the grin the canteen isnt for the hunt its for afterward what about the knife and beamer oh come on the folk gave me ub butterflies began breeding in my stomach humans cook their food sushi and sashimi and beef tartar are exceptions id said so that night the beainers for cooking if i use it to kill the prey well be disgraced im not sure i want to come right out and ask lets see the highpitched squeaking went on for some time bbeam was trying to skirt the edges of the subject the butterflies in my belly were turning carnivorous presently he whispered yup knife too your teeth and nails are visibly inadequate for carving oh lord the later you back out the worse itll be do it now if two melks were grazing beyond a rise of ground i touched bbeams shoulder and we sank to our bellies the meiks were really too big theyd weigh about what i did a hundred and eighty pounds id be better off chasing a bird better yet a boarpig then again these were meat animals born to lose and wed need four or five birds for this crowd id be totally winded long before we finished bbeams exercise program had given me a good grasp of my limits not to mention a raging hunger the purpose of this game was to make humansmelook good wasnt it anyway there wasnt a bird or a pig in sight we crept through the fat grass until we had a clear view that topheavy array of horns would make a handle if i could get hold of the horns i could break the melks long slender neck the thought made me queasy the smaller one i whispered bbeam nodded he yelped softly and got answers the folk flowed away through the fat grass i crept toward the meiks on hands and toes three folk stood up and shrieked the melks shrieked too and tried to escape two more folk stood up in front of the smaller one i stayed down scrambling through the grass stalks trying to get ahead of it it came straight at me and now i must murder you i lunged to the attack it spun about a hoof caught my thigh and i grunted in pain the melk leapt away then froze as bbeam dashed in front of it waving his arms i threw myself at its neck it wheeled and the cage of horns slammed into me and knocked me on my ass it ran over me and away i was curled around my belly trying to remember how to breathe bbeam helped me to my feet it was the last place i wanted to be are you all right i wheezed hoof stomach can you move nooo minute try again my breath came back i walked around in a circle the folk were watching me i straightened up i jogged not good but i could move i took off the loop of line that held canteen and beanier and knife and handed them to bbeam hold these im afraid they may be the mark of the leader bulishit folk dont carry anything hold em so i can fight i wanted to be rid of the beamer it was too tempting wed alerted the prey in this area i took us along the edge of the forest where the fat grass thinned out and it was easier to move we saw nothing for almost an hour i saw no birds no stilts no boarpigs what i finally did see was four more meiks drinking from the stream it was a situation very like the first id seen on film id already proved that a melk was more than my equal my lastsecond qualms had slowed me not at all id been beaten because my teeth and claws were inadequate because i was not a wolf not a lion not a folk i crouched below the level of the fat grass studying them the folk studied me bbeam was at my side whispering were in no hurry weve got hours yet do you think you can handle a boarpig if i could find one i might catch it but how do i kill it with my teeth the folk watched what did they expect of me suddenly i knew tell them ill be in the woods i pointed just in there pick a melk and run it toward me i turned and moved into the woods low to the ground when i looked back everyone was gone these trees had to be from the folk world they bent to an invisible hurricane they bent in various directions because the mojave wasnt giving them the right signals the trunks had a teardropshaped cross section for low wind resistance maybe the folk world was tidally locked with a wind that came always from one direction i dared not go too far for what i needed the leafs tops of the trees were just in reach and i plunged my hands in and felt around the trunk was straight and solid the branches were no thicker than my big toe and all leaves i tried to rip a branch loose anyway it was too strong and i didnt have the leverage through the bent trunks i watched meiks scattering in panic but one dashed back and forth and found black death popping up wherever it looked there was fallen stuff on the ground but no fallen branches to my right a glimpse of white the melk was running toward the wood i ran deeper among the trees white bones in a neat pile melk bones i swept a band through to scatter them damn the leg bones had all been split what now the skull was split too hanging together by the intertwined horns i stamped on the horns they shattered i picked up a massive halfskull with hail a meter of broken horn for a handle the melk veered just short of the woods i sprinted in pursuit beyond bbeam halfstood his eyes horrified he shouted rick no i didnt have time for him the melk raced away and nothing popping up in its face was going to stop it now i was gaining it was fast too damn fast i swung the skull at a flashing hoof and con nected again throwing it off slowing it just enough the halfskull and parthorn made a good bludgeon i smacked a knee and it wheeled in rage and caught me across the face and chest with its horns i dropped on my back i got in one grazing blow across the neck as it was turning away and then it was running and i rolled to my feet and chased it again there was a feathery feel to my run my lungs and legs thought i was dying but the melk shook its head as it ran and i caught up far enough to swing at its hooves this time it didnt turn to attack running with something whacking at its feet it just gradually lost ground i delivered a twohanded blow to the base of its neck swung again and lost my balance and tumbled caught the roll on my shoulder had to go back for the skull then i ran floating recovering lost ground and suddenly realised that the grass was stirring all around me i was surrounded by the black shadows of the folk i caught up a swing at the head only got the horns i hammered at the neck just behind the head it tumbled and tried to get to its feet and i beat it until it fell over i used the skull like an ax murdering it and suddenly black bodies flowed out of the fat grass and tore at the melk bbeam got a good grip on the horns and snapped the neck i sat down he handed me the line knife beamer canteen he was almost as winded as i was he whispered damn fool you werent wrong i didnt have breath for more i drank from my canteen paused to gasp drank again then i turned the beamer on a meaty thigh the folk must have been waiting for me to make my choice they now attacked the forequarters i crouched panting holding the beamer on the meat until it sizzled until it smoked until the smell of it told my belly it was ready the heaving of my chest had eased i handed the knife to bbeam carve us some of that eat as much as you can courtesy to our hosts he did he gave me a chunk that i needed both hands to hold it was too hot i had to juggle it bbeam said you used a weapon i used a club i said i bit into the meat ecstacy the famine was over i hadnt cooked it enough and so what i swallowed enough to clear my mouth and said humans dont use teeth and claws the folk know that they wanted to see us in action my evolution includes a club the green marauder i was tending bar alone that night the chirpsithra interstellar liner had left earth four days earlier taking most of my customers the draco tavern was nearly empty the man at the bar was drinking gin and tonic two gliggrey and compact beings wearing furs in three tones of greenwere at a table with a chirpsithra guide they drank vodka and consomme no ice no flavorings four farsilshree had their bulky heavy environment tanks crowded around a bigger table they smoked smoldering yellow paste through tubes every so often i got them another jar of paste the man was talkative i got the idea he was trying to interview the bartender and owner of earths foremost multispecies tavern hey not me he protested im not a reporter im greg noyes with the scientific american television show didnt i see you trying to interview the glig earlier tonight guilty were doing a show on the formation of life on earth i thought maybe i could check a few things the gligstith optok he said that slowly but got it right have their own little empire out there dont they earthlike worlds a couple of hundred they must know quite a lot about how a world forms an oxygenating atmosphere he was careful with those polysyllabic words not quite sober then that doesnt mean they want to waste an evening lecturing the natives he nodded they didnt know anyway architects on vacation they got me talking about my home life i dont know how they managed that he pushed his drink away id better switch to espresso why would a thing that shape be interested in my sex life and they kept asking me about territorial imperatives he stopped then turned to see what i was staring at three chirpsithra were just coming in one w as in a floating couch with life support equipment attached i thought they all looked alike he said i said ive had chirpsithra in here for close to thirty years but i cant tell them apart theyre all perfect physical specimens after all by their own standards i never saw one like that i gave him his espresso then put three sparkers on a tray and went to the chirpsithra table two were exactly like any other chirpsithra eleven feet tall dressed in pouched belts and their own salmoncolored exoskeletons and very much at their ease the chirps claim to have settled the entire galaxy long agomeaning the useful planets the tidally locked oxygen worlds that happen to circle close around cool reddwarf sunsand they act like the reigning queens of wherever they happen to be but the two seemed to defer to the third she was a foot shorter than they were her exoskeleton was as clearly artificial as dentures alloplastic bone worn on the outside tubes ran under the edges from the equipment in her floating couch her skin between the plates was more gray than red her head turned slowly as i came up she studied me brighteyed with interest i asked sparkers as if chirpsithra ever ordered anything else one of the others said yes serve the ethanol mix of your choice to yourself and the other native will you join us i waved noyes over and he came at the jump he pulled up one of the high chairs i keep around to put a human face on a level with a chirpsithras i went for another espresso and a scotch and soda and a jar of yellow paste when i returned they were deep in conversation rick schumann noyes cried meet ftaxanthir and hrofilliss and chorrikst chorrikst tells me shes nearly two billion years old i heard the doubt beneath his delight the chirpsithra could be the greatest liars in the universe and how would we ever know earth didnt even have interstellar probes when the chirps came chorrikst spoke slowly in a throaty whisper but her translator box was standard voice a little flat pronunciation perfect i have circled the galaxy numberless times and taped the tales of my travels for funds to feed my wanderlust much of my life has been spent at the edge of lightspeed under relativistic timecompression so you see i am not nearly so old as all that i pulled up another high chair you must have seen wonders beyond counting i said thinking my god a short chirpsithra maybe its true shes a different color too and her fingers are shorter maybe the species has actually changed since she was born she nodded slowly life never bores always there is change in the time i have been gone saturns ring has been pulled into separate rings making it even more magnificent what can have done that tides from the moons and earth has changed beyond recognition noyes spilled a little of his coffee you were here when earths air was methane and ammonia and oxides of nitrogen and carbon the natives had sent messages across interstellar space directing them toward yellow suns of course but one of our ships passed through a beam and so we established contact we had to wear life support she rattled on while noyes and i sat with our jaws hanging and the gear was less comfortable then our spaceport was a floating platform because quakes were frequent and violent but it was worth it their cities noyes said just a minute cities weve never dug up any trace of of nonhuman cities chorrikst looked at him after seven hundred and eighty million years i should think not besides they lived in the offshore shallows in an ocean that was already mildly salty if the quakes spared them their tools and their cities still deteriorated rapidly their lives were short too but their memories were inherited death and change were accepted facts for them more than for most intelligent species their works of philosophy gained great currency among my people and spread to other species too noyes wrestled with his instinct for tact and good manners and won how how could anything have evolved that far the earth didnt even have an oxygen atmosphere life was just getting started there werent even trilobites they had evolved for as long as you have chorrikst said with composure life began on earth one and a half billion years ago there were organic chemicals in abundance from passage of lightning through the reducing atmosphere intelligence evolved and presently built an impressive civilization they lived slowly of course their biochemistry was less energetic communication was difficult they were not stupid only slow i visited earth three times and each time they had made more progress almost against his will noyes asked what did they look like small and soft and fragile much more so than yourselves i cannot say they were pretty but i grew to like them i would toast them according to your customs she said they wrought beauty in their cities and beauty in their philosophies and their works are in our libraries still they will not be forgotten she touched her sparker and so did her youn er companions current flowed between her two claws through her nervous system she said sssss i raised my glass and nudged noyes with my elbow we drank to our predecessors noyes lowered his cup and asked what happened to them they sensed worldwide disaster coming chorrikst said and they prepared but they thought it would be quakes they built cities to float on the ocean surface and lived in the undersides they never noticed the green scum growing in certain tidal pools by the time they knew the danger the green scum was everywhere it used photosynthesis to turn carbon dioxide into oxygen and the raw oxygen killed whatever it touched leaving fertilizer to feed the green scum the world was dying when we learned of the problem what could we do against a photosynthesisusing scum growing beneath a yellowwhite star there was nothing in chirpsithra libraries that would help we tried of course but we were unable to stop it the sky had turned an admittedly lovely transparent blue and the tide pools were green and the offshore cities were crumbling before we gave up the fight there was an attempt to transplant some of the natives to a suitable world but biorhythm upset ruined their mating habits i have not been back since until now the depressing silence was broken by chorrikst herself well the earth is greatly changed and of course your own evolution began with the green plague i have heard tales of humanity from my companions would you tell me something of your lives and we spoke of humankind but i couldnt seem to find much enthusiasm for it the anaerobic life that survived the advent of photosynthesis includes gangrene and botulism and not much else i wondered what chorrikst would find when next she came and whether she would have reason to toast our memory war movie ten twenty years ago my first thought would have been greatlooking woman toughlooking too if i make a pass it had better be polite she was in her late twenties tall blond healthylooking with a squarish jaw she didnt look like the type to be fazed by anything but she had stopped stunned just inside the door her first time here i thought anyway id have remembered her but after eighteen years tending bar in the draco tavern my first thought is generally human great i wont have to dig out any of the exotic stuff while she was still reacting to the sight of half a dozen oddlyshaped sapients indulging each its own peculiar vice i moved down the bar to the far right where i keep the alcoholic beverages i thought shed take one of the bar stools nope she looked about her considering her choiceswhich didnt include empty tables there was a fair crowd in tonightthen moved to join the lone qarasht and i was already starting to worry as i left the bar to take her order in the draco its considered normal to strike up conversations with other customers but the qarasht wasnt acting like it wanted company the bulk of thick fur pale blue striped with black in narrow curves had waddled in three hours ago it was on its third quartsized mug of demerara sours and its sense cluster had been retracted for all of that time leaving it deaf and blind lost in its own thoughts it must have felt the vibration when the woman sat down its sense cluster and stalk rose out of the fur like a python rising from a bed of moss a snake with no mouth just two big wideset black bubbles for eyes and an ear like a pink blossom set between them and a tuft of fine hairs along the stalk to serve for smell and taste and a brilliant ruby crest on top its translator box said quite clearly drink not talk my last day she didnt take the hint youre going home where home to the organ banks i am shishishorupf a word the box didnt translate whats it mean your kind has bankruptcy laws that let you start over my kind lets me start over as a dozen others organ banks the alien picked up its mug the fur parted below its sense cluster stalk to receive half a pint of demerara sour she looked around a little queasily and found me at her shoulder with some relief she said never mind ill come to the bar and started to stand up the qarasht put a hand on her wrist the eight skeletal fingers looked like two chicken feet wired together but a qarashts hand is stronger than it looks sit said the alien barmonitor get her one of these human why do you not fight wars what you used to fight wars well she said sure we could have been fourthlevel wealthy the qarasht said and slammed its mug to the table you would stifi be a single isolated species had we not come in what fashion have you repaid our generosity the woman was speechless i wasnt excuse me but it wasnt the qarashteel who made first contact with earth it was the chirpsithra we paid them what why our ship farstretching sense cluster passed through so system while making a documentary it confuses some species that we can make very long entertainments and sell them to billions of customers who will spend years watching them and reap profits that allow us to travel hundreds of lightyears and spend decades working on such a project but we are very longlived you know partly because we are able to keep the organ banks full the qarasht said with some savagery and it drank again its sensecluster was weaving a little we found dramatic activity on your world it said all over your woiid it seemed machines hurled against each other explosives machines built to fly other machines to hurl them from the sky humans in the machines dying machines blowing great holes in populated cities it fuddles the mind to think what such a spectacle would have cost to make ourselves we went into orbit and we recorded it all as best we could three years of it when we were sure it was over we returned home and sold it the woman swallowed she said to me i think i need that drink join us i made two of the giant demerara sours and took them back as i pulled up a chair the qarasht was saying if we had stopped then we would still be moderately wealthy our recording instruments were not the best of course worse we could not get close enough to the surface for real detail our atmosphere probes shivered and shook and so did the pictures ours was a lowbudget operation but the ending was superb two cities halfdestroyed by thermonuclear explosions our recordings sold well enough but we would have been mad not to try for more we invested all of our profits in equipment we borrowed all we could do you understand that the nearest fullservice spaceport to so system is sixteensquared light years distant we had to finance a chirpsithra diplomatic expedition in order to get local group approval and transport for what we needed and because we needed intermediaries chirps are very good at negotiating and we are not we did not tell them what we really wanted of course the womans words sounded like curses why negotiate you were doing fine as peeping toms even when people saw your ships nobody believed them i expect theyre saucershaped foo fighters i thought while the alien said we needed more than the small atmospheric probes we needed to mount hologram cameras for that we had to travel all over the earth especially the cities such instruments are nearly invisible we spray them across a flat surface high up on your glassslabstyle towers for instance and we needed access to your libraries to get some insight into why you do these things the lady drank i remembered that there had been qarashteel everywhere the chirpsithra envoys went twentyfour years ago when the big interstellar ships arrived and i took a long pull from my sour it all looked so easy the qarasht mourned we had left instruments on your moon the recordings couldnt be sold of course because your worlds rotation permits only fragmentary glimpses but your machines were becoming better more destructive we thanked our luck that you had not destroyed yourselves before we could return we studied the recordings to guess where the next war would occur but there was no discernable pattern the largest land mass we thought true enough the chirps and their qarashteel entourage had been very visible all over asia and europe those cameras on the moon must have picked up activity in poland and korea and vietnam and afghanistan and iran and israel and cuba and and bastards so you set up your cameras in a tearing hurry i guessed and then you waited we waited and waited we have waited fot thirty years for twentyfour of your own years and we have nothing to show for it but a riot here a parade there an attack on a childrens vehicle robbery of a bank a thousand people smashing automobiles or an embassy building rumors of war of peace some shouting in your councils how can we sell any of this on earth my people need life support to the tune of six thousand dollars a day i and my associates are shishishorupf now and i must return home to tell them the lady looked ready to start her own war i said to calm her down we make war movies too weve been doing it for over a hundred years they sell fine her answer was an intense whisper i never liked war movies and that was us sure who else the qarasht slammed its mug down why have you not fought a war she broke the brief pause we would have been ashamed ashamed in front of you aliens weve seen twenty alien species on earth since that first chirp expedition and none of them seem to fight wars the uh qarasht dont fight wars do they the aliens sense cluster snapped down into its fur then slowly emerged again certainly we do not well think how it would look but for you it is natural not really i said people have real trouble learning to kill its not built into us anyway we dont have quite so much to fight over these days the whole worlds getting rich on the widgetry the chirps and the thtopar have been selling us longlived too on glig medicines weve all got more to lose i flinched because the aliens sense cluster was stretched across the table staring at us in horror a lot of our restless types are out mining the asteroids the woman said and hey i said remember when egypt and saudi arabia were talking war in the un and all the aliens moved out of both countries even the glig doctors with their geriatrics consulting office the sheiks didnt like that one damn bit and when the soviets our doing all our own doing the alien mourned its sense cluster pulled itself down and disappeared into the fur leaving just the ruby crest showing the alien lifted its mug and drank blind the woman took my wrist and pulled me over to the bar what do we do now she hissed in my ear i shrugged sounds like the emergencys over but we cant just let it go can we you dont really think weve given up war do you but if we knew these damn aliens were waiting to make movies of us maybe we would shouldnt we call the newspapers or at least the secret service i dont think so somebody has to know think it through i said one particular qarasht company may be defunct but those cameras are still there all over the world and so are the mobile units some alien receiving company is going to own them what if they offer say iran or the soviet union onetenth of one percent of the gross profits on a war movie she paled i pushed my mug into her hands and she gulped hard at it shakily she asked why didnt the qarasht think of that maybe they dont think enough like men maybe if we just leave it alone they never will but we sure dont want any human entrepreneurs making suggestions let it drop lady let it drop the real thing if the irs could see me now flying a lightsail craft singlehanded two million miles out from a bluishwhite dwarf star fiddling frantically with the shrouds guided less by the instruments than by the thrust against my web hammock and the ripples in the tremendous nearweightless mirror sail glancing into the sun without blinking then at the stars without being nightblind dipping near the sun without being fried all due to the quickadjusting goggles and tempcontrolled skintight pressure suit the chirpsithra had given me this entire trip was deductible of course the draco tavern had made me a good deal of money over the years but i never could have paid for an interstellar voyage otherwise as the owner of the draco tavern earths only multispecies bar i was quite legitimately touring the stars to find new products for my alien customers would internal revenue object to my actually enjoying myself i couldnt make myself care the trip out on the chirpsithra liner that alone was something id remember the rest of my life this too if i lived best not to distract myself with memories hroyd system was clustered tightly around its small hot sun space was thick with asteroids and planets and other sailing ships every so often some massive piece of space junk bombed the sun or a storm would bubble up from beneath the photosphere and my boat would surge under the pressure of the flare i had to fiddle constantly with the shrouds the pointer was aimed at black space where was that damned spaceport huge and massive it had seemed too big to lose when i spun out my frail silver sail and launched how long ago the clock told me twenty hours though it didnt feel that long the spaceport was coinshaped spun for varying gravities maybe i was trying to see it edgeon i tilted the sail to lose some velocity the fat sun expanded my mind felt the heat if my suit failed it would fail all at once and i wouldnt have long to curse my recklessness oreven chirpsithrasupplied equipment wouldnt help me if i fell into the sun i looked outward in time to see a silver coin pass over me good enough tilt the sail forward pick up some speed pull my orbit outward slow down dont move the sail too fast or itll fold up wait a bit then tilt the sail to spill the light drop a bit wait again watch a black coin slide across the sun tilt to slow tilt again to catch up it was another two hours before i could pull into the spaceports shadow fold the sail and let a tractor beam pull me in my legs were shaky as i descended the escalator to level there was earth gravity on minus a few percent and also a multispecies restaurant bar i was too tired to wonder about the domed boxes i saw on some of the tables i wobbled over to a table turned on the privacy bubble and tapped tee tee hatch nex ool carefully that code was my life a wrong character could broil me freeze me flatten me or have me drinking liquid methane or breathing prussic acid an earthlike environment formed around me i peeled off my equipment and sank into a web sighing with relief i still ached everywhere what i really needed was sleep but it had been glorious a warbling whistle caused me to look up my translator said sir or madam what can i bring you the bartender was a small spindly hroydan and his environment suit glowed at dull red heat i said something alcoholic alcohol what is your physiological type tee tee hatch nex ool ah may i recommend something a liqueur opal fire considering the probable distance to the nearest ginandtonic fine what proof is it i heard his translator skip a word and amplified what percent ethyl alcohol thirtyfour with no other metabolic poisons about seventy proof over water ice please he brought a clear glass bottle the fluid within did indeed glitter like an opal its beauty was the first thing i noticed then the taste slightly tart with an overtone that cant be described in any human language a crackling aftertaste and a fire spreading through my nervous system i said thats wonderful what about side effects there are additives to compensate thiamin and the like you will feel no ugly aftereffects the hroydan assured me theyd love it on earth mmm whats it cost quite cheap twentynine chirp notes per flagon transport costs would be up to the chirpsithra but im sure chignthil interstellar would sell specs for manufacture this could pay for my whole trip i jotted the names chirp characters for opal fire and chignthil interstellar the stuff was still dancing through my nervous system i drank again so it could dance on my taste buds too to hell with sleep i was ready for another new experience these boxesi see them on all the tables what are they fullsensory entertainment devices cost is six chirp notes for use he tapped keys and a list appeared titles i assumed in alien script if you cant read this there is voice translation i dithered tempting dangerous but a couple of these might be worth taking back some of my customers cant use anything i stock they pay only cover charges how versatile is it your customers seem to have a lot of different sense organs hey would this thing actually give me alien senses the bartender signalled negative the device acts on your central nervous system i assume you have one there at the top ah good it feeds you a story skeleton but your own imagination puts you in context and fills in the background details you live a programmed story but largely in terms familiar to you mental damage is almost unheard of will i know its only an entertainment you might know from the advertisements shall i show you the hroydan raised the metal dome on a manyjointed arm and poised it over my head i felt the heat emanating from him perhaps you would like to walk through an active volcano he tapped two buttons with a black metal claw and everything changed the vollek merchant pulled the helmet away from my head he had small delicatelooking arms and a stance like a tyrannosaur torso horizontal swung from the hips a feathery down covered him signalling his origin as a flightless bird how did you like it give me a minute i looked about me afternoon sunlight spilled across the tables illuminating alien shapes the draco tavern was filling up it was time i got back to tending bar it had been nearly empty when i agreed to try this stunt i said that business at the end we end all of the programs that way when we sell to level four civilizations it prevents disorientation good idea whatever the reason i didnt feel at all confused still it was a hell of an experience i couldnt tell it from the real thing the advertisement would have alerted an experienced user youre actually manufacturing these things on earth guatemala has agreed to license us the climate is so nice there and so i can lower the price per unit to three thousand dollars each sell me two i said itd be a few years before they paid for themselves maybe someday i really would have enough money to ride the chirpsithra liners if i didnt get hooked myself on these fullsensory machines now about opal fire i cant believe its really that good i travel for chignthil interstellar too i have sample bottles lets try it limits i never would have heard them if the sound system hadnt gone on the fritz and if it hadnt been one of those frantically busy nights maybe i could have done something about it but one of the big chirpsithra passenger ships was due to leave mount ford spaceport in two days the chirpsithra trading empire occupies most of the galaxy and sol system is nowhere near its heart a horde of passengers had come early in fear of being marooned the draco tavern was jammed i was fishing under the counter when the noises started i jumped two voices alternated a monotonal twittering and a bonevibrating sound like a tremendous door endlessly opening on rusty hinges the draco tavern used to make the tower of babel sound like a monolog in the years before i got this sound system worked out picture it thirty or forty creatures of a dozen species including human all talking at once at every pitch and volume and all of their translating widgets bellowing too some species like the srivinthish dont talk with sound but they also dont notice the continual skreeking from their spiracles others sing they call it singing and they say its a religious rite so how can i stop them selective damping is the key and a staff of technicians to keep the system in order i can afford it i charge high anyway for the variety of stuff i have to keep for anything that might wander in but sometimes the damping system fails i found what i neededa doublewalled cannister id never needed before holding stuff id been calling green kryptoniteand delivered glowing green pebbles to four aliens in globular environment tanks they were at four different tables sharing conversation with four other species id never seen a rosyfln before rippling in the murky fluid within the transparent globe the dorsal fin was triangular rosecolored fragile as gossamer and ran from nose to tail of a body that looked like a flattened slug out among the tables there was nearsilence except within the bubbles of sound that surrounded each table it wasnt a total breakdown then but when i went back behind the bar the noise was still there i tried to ignore it i certainly wasnt going to try to fix the sound system not with fiftyodd customers and ten distinct species demanding my attention i set out consomme and vodka for four glig and thimblesized flasks of chilled fluid with an ammonia base for a dozen chrome yellow bugs each the size of a fifth of haig pinch and the dialog continued high twittering against grating metallic bass what got on my nerves was the way the sounds seemed always on the verge of making sense finally i just switched on the translator it might be less irritating if i heard it in english i heard noticed how often they speak of limits limits i dont understand you lightspeed limit theoretical strengths of metals of crystals of alloys smallest and largest masses at which an unseen body may be a neutron star maximum time and cost to complete a research project surfacetovolume relationship for maximum size of a creature of given design but every sapient race learns these things we find limits of course but with humans the limits are what they seek first so they were talking about the natives about us aliens often do their insights might be fascinating but it gets boring fast i let it buzz in my ear while i fished out another dozen flasks of ammonia mixture and set them on gails tray along with two stingers she went oft to deliver them to the little yellow bugs now parked in a horseshoe pattern on the rim of their table talking animatedly to two human sociologists it is a way of thinking one of the voices said they set enormously complex limits on each other whole professions called judge and lawyer devote their lives to determining which human has violated which limit where another profession alters the limits arbitrarily it does not sound entertaining but all are forced to play the game you must have noticed the limits they find in the universe and the limits they set on each other bear the same name law i had established that the twitterer was the one doing most of the talking fine now who were they two voices belonging to two radically different species the interstellar community knows all of these limits in different forms do we know them all goedels principle sets a limit to the perfectability of mathematical systems what species would have sought such a thing mine would not nor mine i suppose still humans push their limits it is their first approach to any problem when they learn where the limits lie they in missing information until the limit breaks when they break a limit they look for the limit behind that i wonder i thought i had them spotted only one of the tables for two was occupied by a chirpsithra and a startledlooking woman my suspects were a cluster of three one of the rosyfins and two compact squarish customers wearing garish designs on their exoskeletal shells the shelled creatures had been smoking tobacco cigars under exhaust hoods one seemed to be asleep the other waved stubby arms as it talked i heard i have a thought my savage ancestors used to die when they reached a certain age when we could no longer breed evolution was finished with us there is a biological selfdestruct built into us it is the same with humans but my own people never die unless killed we fission our memories go far far back though we differ in this the result is the same at some point in the dim past we learned that we could postpone our deaths we never developed a civilization until individuals could live long enough to attain wisdom the fundamental limit was lifted from our shells before we set out to expand into the world and then the universe is this not true with most of the spacetraveling peoples the pfarth species choose death only when they grow bored chirpsithra were longlived before they reached the stars and the gligstith optok went even further with their fascination with hereditytailoring does it surprise you that inteffigent beings strive to extend their lives surprise no but humans still face a limit on their lifespans the death limit has immense influence on their poetry they may think differently from the rest of us in other ways they may find truths we would not even seek an untranslated metalonmetal scraping laughter you speculate irresponsibly has their unique approach taught them anything we know not how can i know i have only been on this world three local years their libraries are large their retrieval systems poor but there is goedels principle and heisenbergs uncertainty principle is a limit to what one can discover at the quantum level pause we must see if another species has duplicated that one meanwhile perhaps i should speak to another visitor incomprehension query do you remember that i spoke of a certain gligstith optok merchant i remember you know their skill with waterworld biology this one comes to earth with a technique for maintaining and restoring the earlymaturity state in humans the treatment is complex but with enough customers the cost would drop or so the merchant says i must persuade it not to make the offer affirmative removing the deathlimit would drastically affect human psychology one of the shelled beings was getting up the voices chopped off as i rounded the bar and headed for my chosen table with no clear idea what i would say i stepped into the bubble of sound around two shelled beings and a rosyfin and said forgive the interruption sapients you have joined a wake said the tanks translator widget the shelled being said my mate had chosen death he wanted one last smoke in company it bent and lifted its dead companion in its arms and headed for the door the rosyfin was leaving too rolling his spherical fishbowl toward the door i realised that its own voice hadnt penetrated the murky fluid around it no chittering no boneshivering bass i had the wrong table i looked around and there were still no other candidates yet somebody here had casually condemned mankindmeto age and die now what i might have been hearing several voices they all sound alike coming from a new species and some aliens never interrupt each other the little yellow bugs but they were with humans shells my voices had mentioned shells but too many aliens have exoskeletons okay a chirpsithra would have spoken by now theyre garrulous scratch any table that includes a chirp or a rosyfin or those srivinthish id have heard the skreek of their breathing or the huge grey being who seemed to be singing that left half a dozen tables and i couldnt interrupt that many could they have left while i was distracted i hotfooted it back to the bar and listened and heard nothing and my spinning brain could find only limits about the author larry niven was born on april in los angeles california in he entered the california institute of technology
