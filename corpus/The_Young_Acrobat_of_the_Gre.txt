the young acrobat of the great north american circus the young acrobat chapter i kit watson there was great excitement in smyrna especially among the boys barlows great american circus in its triumphal progress from state to state was close at hand and immense yellow posters announcing its arrival were liberally displayed on fences and barns while smaller bills were put up in the post office the hotel and the principal stores and distributed from house to house it was the largest circus that had ever visited smyrna at least a dozen elephants marched with ponderous steps in its preliminary procession while clowns acrobats giants dwarfs fat women cannibals and hairy savages from thibet and madagascar were among the strange wonders which were to be seen at each performance for the small sum of fifty cents children half price for weeks the young people had been looking forward to the advent of this marvelous aggregation of curiosities and the country papers from farther east had given glowing accounts of the great show which was emphatically pronounced greater and more gorgeous than in any previous year but it may be as well to reproduce in part the description given in the posters barlows great north american circus now in its triumphal march across the continent will give two grand performances at smyrna on the afternoon and evening of may th never in all its history has this unparalleled show embraced a greater variety of attractions or included a larger number of world famous acrobats clowns bare back riders rope walkers trapeze artists and star performers in addition to a colossal menagerie comprising elephants tigers lions leopards and other wild animals in great variety all this and far more including a hundred daring acts can be seen for the trifling sum of fifty cents children half price come one come all two boys paused to read this notice pasted with illustrative pictures of elephants and circus performers on the high board fence near stoddards grocery store they were dan clark and christopher watson called kit for short shall you go to the circus dan asked kit i would like to but you know kit i have no money to spare dont let that interfere said kit kindly here is half a dollar that will take you in youre a tiptop fellow kit but i dont think i ought to take it i dont know when i shall be able to return it who asked you to return it i meant it as a gift youre a true friend kit said dan earnestly i dont know as i ought to take it but i will anyhow you know i only get my board and a dollar a week from farmer clifford and that i give to my mother i wish you had a better place dan so do i but perhaps it is as well as i can do at my age all boys are not born to good luck as you are am i born to good luck i dont know isnt your uncle stephen the richest man in smyrna i suppose he is but that doesnt make me rich isnt he your guardian yes but it doesnt follow because there is a guardian there is a fortune i hope there is i am going to tell you something in confidence dan uncle stephen has lately been dropping a good many hints about the necessity of being economical and that i may have my own way to make in the world what do you think it means have you been extravagant not that i am aware of i have been at an expensive boarding school with my cousin ralph and i have dressed well and had a fair amount of spending money have you spent any more than ralph no not so much for i will tell you in confidence that he has been playing pool and cards for money of course without the knowledge of the principal i know also that this last term besides spending his pocket money he ran up bills which his father had to pay to the amount of fifty dollars or more how did your uncle like it i dont know ralph and his father had a private interview but he got the money i believe his mother took his part why dont you ask your uncle just how you stand i have thought of it if i am to inherit a fortune i should like to know it if i have my own way to make i want to know that also so that i can begin to prepare for it would you feel bad if you found out that you were a poor boy like me for instance i suppose i should just at first but i should try to make the best of it in the end well i hope you wont have occasion to buckle down to hard work when do you go back to school the next term begins next monday and it is now wednesday you will be able to see the circus at any rate it is to arrive tonight suppose we go round to the lot tomorrow morning we can see them putting up the tents all right ill meet you at nine oclock they were about to separate when another boy of about the same age and size came up its time for dinner kit he said motherll be angry if you are late very well ill go home with you good morning dan good morning kit good morning ralph ralph mumbled out morning but did not deign to look at dan i wonder you associate with that boy kit he said why inquired kit rather defiantly because hes only a farm laborer does that hurt him i dont care to associate with such a low class daniel webster worked on a farm when he was a boy dan clark isnt a webster we dont know what he will turn out to be i dont consider him fit for me to associate with said ralph it may be different in your case why should it be different in my case asked kit suspiciously oh no offense at all but your circumstances and social position are likely to be different from mine are they thats just what i should like to find out my father says so and as you are under his guardianship he ought to know yes he ought to know but he has never told me he has told me but i am not at liberty to say anything said ralph looking mysterious i think i ought to be the first to be told said kit not unreasonably you will be told soon there is one thing i can tell you however you are not to go back to boarding school on monday kit paused in the street and gazed at his companion in surprise are you going back he asked yes im going to keep on till i am ready for college and what is to be done with me ralph shrugged his shoulders i am not at liberty to tell you he answered i shall ask my uncle this very day just as you please kit walked on in silence his mind was busy with thoughts of the change in his prospects he did not know what was coming but he was anxious it was likely to be a turning point in his life and he was apprehensive that the information soon to be imparted to him would not be of an agreeable nature chapter ii introduces three curiosities stephen watson uncle of kit and father of ralph was a man of middle age it was difficult to trace any resemblance between him and his nephew the latter had an open face with a bright attractive expression mr watson was dark and sallow of spare habit and there was a cunning look in his eyes beneath which a roman nose jutted out like a promontory he looked like the incarnation of cold selfishness and his real character did not belie his looks five years before kit watsons father had died he resembled kit in appearance and was very popular in smyrna his brother wound up the estate and had since been living in luxury but whether the property was his or his nephews kit was unable to tell he had asked the question occasionally but his uncle showed a distaste for the subject and gave evasive replies what kit had just heard made him anxious and he resolved to attack his uncle once more after dinner therefore he began uncle stephen ralph tells me i am not going back to school on monday ralph speaks correctly mr watson replied in a measured voice but why am i not to go i will explain before the time comes can you not tell me now i am anxious to know you must curb your curiosity you will know in good time kit regarded his uncle in silence he wished to know what had caused this remarkable change but it seemed useless to ask any more questions the next morning he and dan clark according to agreement met in front of stoddards store i had hard work to get away said dan let us go right over to the circus grounds these were located about a third of a mile from the hotel in a large twentyacre pasture the lot as it was called was a scene of activity a band of canvas men were busily engaged in putting up the big tent several elephants were standing round and the cages of animals had already been put in place inside the rising tent on a bench outside sat a curious group comprising achilles henderson the great scotch giant who was set down on the bills as eight feet three inches in height and was really about seven feet and a half major conrad the dwarf who was about the size of an average child of three years and madame celestina morella the queen of fat women who was credited on the bills with a weight of five hundred and eighty seven pounds she was certainly massive but probably fell short a hundred and fifty pounds of these elephantine proportions kit and dan paused to look at this singular trio i wonder how much pay they get said dan turning to kit i saw in some paper that the fat woman gets fifty dollars a week thats pretty good pay for being fat kit would you be willing to be as fat for that money i think not said dan though its a good deal more than i get now they were standing near the bench on which the three were seated achilles who looked goodnatured as most big men are addressed the boys well boys are you coming to see the show yes answered both i used to like to myself when i was a boy i didnt expect then i should ever travel with one were you very large as a boy asked dan with curiosity when i was twelve years old i was six feet high and people generally thought then that i was eighteen i thought perhaps i shouldnt grow any more but i kept on when i was sixteen i was seven feet tall and by twenty i had reached my present height are you eight feet three inches tall mr henderson is that what the bills say yes then it must be so he said with a smile how long have you been traveling with the circus five years how do you like it its a good deal easier than working on a farm especially in vermont where i was born and bred but they call you the scotch giant it sounds well doesnt it my father was born in scotland but my mother was a vermont yankee you know americans are more willing to pay for a foreign curiosity than for one home born thats why my great friend here emphasizing the word great calls herself madame celestina morella the fat lady smiled people think i am french or italian she said but i never was out of the united states in my life where were you born madame morella in the western part of new york state i know what you are going to ask me was i always fat no when i was sixteen i only weighed one hundred and twenty then i had a fit of sickness and nearly died after recovering i began to gain flesh till i became a monster as you see as she said this she laughed and her fat sides shook with merriment evidently she did not let her size weigh upon her mind i suppose your real name isnt celestina morella said kit my real name is betsey hatch that is what they called me in my girlhood but i should hardly know who was meant if i was called so now have you been long in the show business about seven years do you like it i didnt at first but now ive got used to moving about now when the spring opens i have the regular circus fever but i have my troubles what are they asked kit seeing that the fat woman liked to talk well i find it very difficult to secure at the hotels a bed large enough and strong enough to hold me i suppose you wont be surprised to hear that not much at akron ohio where the hotel was full i was put in a cot bed though i protested against it as soon as i got in the whole thing collapsed and i was landed on the floor she laughed heartily at the remembrance i remember that very well said the giant for i slept in the room below half an hour after getting into bed i heard a fearful noise in the room above and thought at first the hotel had been struck by lightning and a piercing shriek that echoed through the house led me to fear that my esteemed italian friend was a victim but my mind was soon relieved when i learned the truth i suppose major you never broke down a bed said the giant turning to the dwarf no answered the major in a shrill piping voice i never lie awake thinking of that i believe you served in the civil war major yes i was in the infantry it was a stale joke but all four laughed at it how much do you weigh major kit ventured to ask twentyone pounds and a half answered the dwarf i have with me some of my photographs if you would like to buy and the little man produced half a dozen cards from his tiny pocket how much are they ten cents ill take one said kit and he produced the necessary coin if you go into the tent you can see some of the performers rehearsing suggested achilles let us go in dan the two boys reached the portals and went into the big tent chapter iii kit astonishes two acrobats the circus tent was nearly ready for the regular performance kit and dan regarded the sawdust arena with the interest which it always inspires in boys of sixteen already it was invested with fascination for them two acrobats who performed what is called the brothers act were rehearsing they were placarded as the vincenti brothers though one was a french canadian and the other an irishman and there was no relationship between them at the time the boys entered one had climbed upon the others shoulders and was standing erect with folded arms this was of course easy but the next act was more difficult by a quick movement he lowered his head and grasping the uplifted hands of the lower acrobat raised his feet and poised himself aloft with his feet up in the air sustained by the muscular arms of his associate that must take strength kit said dan so it does no one but a circus man could do it i suppose i can do it said kit quietly dan regarded him with undisguised astonishment you are joking he said no i am not where did you learn to do such a thing asked dan incredulous though he knew kit to be a boy of truth i will tell you in the town where i attended boarding school there is a large gymnasium under the superintendence of a man who traveled for years with a circus he used to give lessons to the boys but most contented themselves with a few common exercises i suppose i should also but there was an english boy in the school very supple and muscular who was proud of his strength and ambitious to make himself a thorough gymnast he persuaded me to take lessons in the most difficult acrobatic feats with him as two had to work together did you pay the professor extra to instruct you asked dan he charged nothing he was only too glad to teach us all he knew it seems he was at one time connected with barnums circus and prepared performers for the arena he told us it made him think of his old circus days to teach us at the close of last term we gave him five dollars apiece as an acknowledgment of his services he assured us then that we were competent to perform in any circus could you really do what the vincenti brothers are doing yes and more i wish i could see you do it the boys were seated near the sawdust arena and the last part of their conversation had been heard by the acrobats it was taken as an illustration of boyish braggadocio and as circus men are always ready for practical jokes particularly at the expense of greenhorns they resolved that there was a good chance for a little fun one tipped the wink to the other and turning to kit said whats that youre saying kid how does he know your name said dan mistaking kid the circus name for boy for his friends nickname he said kid not kit answered our hero do you think you can do our act continued the acrobat i think i can replied kit this elicited a broad grin from the acrobat look here kid he said do you know how long it took me to learn the business i dont know but i should like to know three years no doubt you can do a great deal more than i oh no certainly not said the acrobat ironically i see you dont believe me said kit ill tell you what you remind me of kid there was a fellow came to our circus last summer and wanted to get an engagement as rider he said hed been a cowboy out in new mexico and had been employed to break horses so we gave the fellow a trial we brought out a wild mustang and told him to show what he could do the mustang let him get on as was his custom but after he was fairly on he gave a jump and mr cowboy measured his length on the sawdust kit and dan both smiled at this story i am not a cowboy and dont profess to ride bucking mustangs he said though my friend dan may id rather be excused put in dan ill tell you what kid if youll go through the performance youve just seen ill give you five dollars the fellow expected kit would make some hasty excuse but he was mistaken our hero rose from his seat removed his coat and vest and bounded into the arena i am ready he said but i am not strong enough to be the under man ill do the other all right go ahead the speaker put himself in position kit gave a spring and in an instant was upon his shoulders there was an exclamation of surprise from the second acrobat christopher he exclaimed the boys got something in him after all now what shall i do asked kit as with folded arms he stood on the acrobats shoulders keep your place while i walk round the arena kit maintained his position while the acrobat ran round the circle increasing his pace on purpose to dislodge his young associate but kit was too well used to this act to be embarrassed he held himself erect and never swerved for an instant pretty good kid said the acrobat now reverse yourself and stand on my hands with your feet in the air kit made the change skillfully and to the equal surprise of dan and the other acrobat both of whom applauded without stint can you do anything else asked alonzo vincenti yes kit went through a variety of other feats and then descending from his elevated perch was about to resume his coat and vest when the circus performer asked him can you tumble kits answer was to roll over the arena in a succession of somersaults and hand springs well im beat said the acrobat youre the smartest kid i ever met in my travels are you sure youre not a professional quite sure answered kit smiling you never traveled with a show then kit shook his head where on earth did you pick up all these acts i took lessons of professor donaldson you did well that explains it i say kid you ought to join a circus youd command a fine salary would i how much could i get asked kit with interest ten or twelve dollars a week and all expenses paid thats pretty good pay for a kid isnt it its more than i ever earned yet answered kit with a smile i shouldnt wonder if mr barlow would give you that now if you ever make up your mind to join a show come round and see him thank you said kit soon after the boys left the circus lot and went home would you really join a circus kit asked dan it isnt the life i would choose answered kit seriously but i may have to find some way of earning a living and that very soon i thought your father left you a fortune so did i but i hear that i am to be taken from boarding school and possibly set to work ralph has given me a hint of it i shall soon know as my uncle intimates that he has a communication to make me i hope it isnt as bad as you think kit i hope so too but i can tell you better tomorrow we will meet tonight at the show chapter iv a scene not down on the bills just before supper kit was asked to an interview with his uncle you wish to speak to me uncle stephen he said yes i have decided not to postpone the explanation for which you asked yesterday i shall be glad to hear it sir ever since your fathers death i have supported you not because i was morally or legally bound to do so but because you were my nephew but didnt my father leave any property asked kit in amazement he was supposed to have done so this house and grounds are surely worth a good deal of money so they are answered stephen watson dryly but unfortunately they did not belong to your father this is certainly a mistake exclaimed kit indignantly wait till i have finished these stood in your fathers name but there was a mortgage of two thousand dollars held by the smyrna savings bank surely the place is worth far more than two thousand dollars curb your impatience and you will soon understand me the place is worth far more than two thousand dollars i consider it worth ten thousand then i dont see your father left large debts which of course had to be paid i was therefore obliged to sell the estate in order to realize the necessary funds for how much did you sell the place for nine thousand dollars i regarded that as a good price considering that it was paid in cash or the equivalent to whom did you sell i bought it in myself i was not willing that the place which my brother had loved so well should pass into the hands of strangers may i ask who was my fathers principal creditor asked kit ahem i was answered stephen watson in a tone of slight embarrassment you exclaimed kit in fresh surprise yes your father owed me twelve thousand dollars borrowed at various times how could he have been obliged to borrow so much asked kit he always seemed comfortably situated i never once heard him complain of being pressed for money very likely he was very reticent about his affairs i would explain but the matter is rather a delicate one i think i am entitled to know all about it uncle stephen said kit firmly be it so perhaps you are right let me tell you in the briefest terms then that in his later years your father speculated in wall street not heavily for he had not the means but heavily for one of his property of course he lost almost every one does who ventures into the street his first losses instead of deterring him from further speculation led him on to rasher ventures it was then that he came to me for money didnt you urge him to give up speculating asked kit yes but my words availed little perhaps you will think i ought to have refused him loans but he assured me in the strongest terms that unless he obtained money from some source he would be ruined and i yielded i might have been weak it was weak for i stood a chance of losing all having merely his notes of hand to show for the money i lent but it is hard to refuse a brother i think i should do the same again kit was silent his uncles words were warm and indicated strong sympathy for kits father but his tone was cold and there seemed a lack of earnestness kit could not repress a feeling of incredulity there was another obstacle to his accepting with full credence the tale which his uncle told him he had always understood from his father that his uncle was a poor and struggling man how could he have in his possession the sum of twelve thousand dollars to lend his brother this question was certainly difficult to answer he paused then refraining from discussing the subject said why have you not told me this before uncle stephen would it have made you any happier returned stephen watson no till you had acquired a fair education i thought it better to keep the unpleasant truth from you it would only have annoyed you to feel that you owed everything to my generosity and were in fact a child of charity kits face flushed deeply as he heard this expression from his uncles lips do you mean that my father left absolutely nothing he asked yes absolutely nothing well no not quite that i think there was a balance of a little over a hundred dollars left after paying all debts that is hardly worth counting yes that is hardly worth counting said kit in a dull mechanical tone still i determined to educate you and give you equal advantages with my own son i have done so up to the present moment i wish i could continue to do so but ralph is getting more expensive as he grows older and you also and i cannot afford to keep you both at school you will therefore stop studying and i shall secure you some work if things are as you say i cannot complain of this kit said in a dull spiritless tone but it comes upon me like a thunderbolt no doubt no doubt i knew it would be a shock and i have postponed telling you as long as possible i suppose i ought to thank you have you anything more to say to me now no then sir i will leave you i will ask further particulars some other day he takes it hard muttered stephen watson eyeing the retreating form of his nephew thoughtfully i wonder if he will suspect that there is anything wrong even if he does he is only a boy and can prove nothing what makes you so glum kit asked dan clark when they met at seven oclock as agreed to go together to the show not much dan only i have learned that i am a pauper but the estate the house and the grounds said dan bewildered belong to my uncle who says so he says so but i dont want to say any more about it now let us start for the circus and i will try to forget my pauper position for one evening at least before they reached the lot they heard the circus band discoursing lively music they were in a crowd for all smyrna men women and children were bound for the show it was a grand gala night in the city where there are many amusements the circus draws well but in the country everybody goes outside the great tent were the side shows in one of them kit found his friends of the morning the giant the dwarf and the fat lady with other curiosities hereafter to be mentioned just inside the tent in what might be called the ante chamber was the collection of animals the elephants were accorded more freedom than the rest but the lion tiger and leopard were shut up in cages the lion seemed particularly restless he was pacing his narrow quarters lashing his tail and from time to time emitting deep growls betokening irritation and anger how would you like to go into the cage asked dan i dont care for an interview with his majesty responded kit a stranger was standing near the cage dont go too near boys he said that lion is particularly fierce he nearly killed a man last season in pennsylvania how was that the man ventured too near the cage the lion stretched out his claws and fastened them in the mans shoulder lacerating it fearfully before he could be released he came near dying of blood poisoning kit and dan sheered off the lion looked wicked enough to kill a dozen men at eight oclock the performance commenced first there was a procession of elephants and horses the latter carrying the bareback riders and other members of the circus with the curiosities and freaks then came two bareback riders who jumped through hoops and over banners and performed somersaults to the wondering delight of the boys then came tumblers and in preparation for another scene a gaudily dressed clown entered the ring suddenly there was heard a deep baying sound which struck terror into every heart it was the lion but seemed close at hand in an instant a dark catlike form rushing down the aisle sprang into the ring the great numidian lion had broken from his cage and the life of every one in the audience was in peril ladies shrieked strong men grew pale and all wildly looked about for some way of escape striking down the clown and standing with one foot on the prostrate form the lions cruel eyes wandered slowly over the vast assemblage only ten feet from him in front seats sat kit and dan kit rose in his seat pale and excited but with a resolute fire in his eyes he had thought of a way to vanquish the lion chapter v how kit vanquished the lion the danger was imminent under the canvas there were at least two thousand spectators smyrna had less than five thousand inhabitants but from towns around there were numerous excursion parties which helped to swell the number present had these people foreseen the terrible scene not down on the bills they would have remained at home and locked the doors of their houses but danger is seldom anticipated and peril generally finds us unprepared dan clark saw kit about to leave his seat where are you going he cried i am going into the arena what are you out of your head asked dan and he took hold of kit to detain him but the boy tore himself from the grasp of his friend and with blanched brow for he knew full well the risk he ran he sprang over the parapet and in an instant he stood in the sawdust circle facing the angry monarch of the wilds whose presence had struck terror into the hearts of two thousand members of a superior race the sudden movement of kit created a sensation only less than the appearance of the lion the residents of smyrna all knew him but they could not understand the cause of his apparent foolhardiness come back come away for your life exclaimed dozens of kits friends and acquaintances who is that boy is he one of the circus men asked strangers who were present you will be killed kit come back implored dan clark appalled at the danger of his friend kit heard but did not heed the various calls he knew what he was about and he did not mean to be killed but there seemed the greatest danger of it he was six feet from the angry beast who lashed his tail with renewed wrath when he saw his new and puny foe kit knew however that the lions method of attack is to spring upon his victims and that he needs a space of from twelve to fifteen feet to do it he himself being but six feet distant was within the necessary space the lion must increase the distance between them in order to accomplish its purpose now it happened that mr watson had in his kitchen an elderly woman who had for years been addicted to the obnoxious habit of snuff taking a habit i am glad to be able to say which is far less prevalent now than in former days just before kit had started for the circus ellen who was a scotch woman said master kit if you are going near the store will you buy me a quarter of a pound of snuff certainly ellen answered kit who was always obliging the snuff he had in his pocket at the time of the lions appearance in the ring and it was the thought of this unusual but formidable weapon that gave him courage if he had merely had a pistol or revolver in his pocket he would not have ventured for he knew that a wound would only make the lion fiercer and more dangerous the lion stood stock still for a moment apparently he was amazed at the daring of the boy who had rushed into his presence his fierce eyes began to roll wickedly and he uttered one of those deep hoarse growls such as are wont to strike fear alike into animals and men he glared at kit very much as a cat surveys a puny mouse whom she purposes to make her victim it was a few brief seconds but to the audience who were spellbound and scarcely dared to breathe it seemed as many minutes that the boy and lion stood confronting each other without moving indeed kit stood as if fascinated before the mighty beast and a thrill passed through his frame as he realized the terrible danger into which he had impulsively rushed but he knew full well that his peril was each instant growing greater he could not retreat now for the furious beast would improve the chance to spring upon him and rend him to pieces with curious deliberation he drew from his pocket a paper parcel while the lion as if stirred by curiosity eyed him attentively he opened it carefully and then without an instants delay he flung a handful of the snuff which it contained full in the eyes of the terrible animal no sooner had he done so than he gave a spring and in a flash was over the parapet and back in his seat it was not a moment too soon the lion was blinded by the snuff which caused him intense pain he released the terrified clown who lost no time in escaping from the arena while the vanquished beast rolled around on the sawdust in his agony sending forth meanwhile the most terrible roars by this time the circus management had recovered from its momentary panic the trainer and half a dozen animal men those whose duty it was to take care of the animals rushed into the circle and soon obtained the mastery of the lion whose pain had subdued his fury and who was now moaning piteously then through the crowded tent there ran a thrill of admiration for the boy who had delivered them all from a terrible danger one man an enthusiastic western visitor sprang to his feet and waving his hat exclaimed three cheers for the brave boy who has shown more courage than all the rest of us put together hip hip hurrah the call was responded to with enthusiasm men and even women rose in their seats and joined in the cheering but some of the friends of kit amended the suggestion by crying hurrah for kit watson hurrah for kit watson cried the western man hes the pluckiest kid i ever saw yet kit had not been frightened before but he felt undeniably nervous when he saw the eyes of two thousand people fixed upon him he blushed and seemed disposed to screen himself from observation but at this moment a tall portly man advanced from the front of the tent and came up to where kit was sitting my boy he said do me the favor to follow me i am mr barlow it was indeed the proprietor of the circus he had come in person to greet the boy who had averted such a tragedy mechanically kit followed mr barlow who led him again into the arena then the manager cleared his throat and said ladies and gentlemen i have nothing to show you here tonight that is better worth your attention than the young man whose heroic act you have just witnessed and profited by i introduce to you the boy hero kit watson speech speech exclaimed the spectators after a liberal meed of applause kit stood erect and spoke modestly i dont pretend to be a hero he said i was as much frightened as anybody but i thought of the snuff in my pocket and i recalled to mind a story of a man who subdued a lunatic by means of it so on the impulse of the moment i jumped into the ring i am very much obliged to you for your cheers and i wish i was as brave as you seem to think i wont take up any more of your time for i know you want the show to go on kit retired amid a burst of applause and resumed his seat the entertainment of the evening now proceeded greatly to the satisfaction of the crowded ranks of spectators but from time to time glances were cast towards the seat which kit occupied kit whispered dan i am proud of you i didnt think you had it in you dont say any more dan or i shall become so vain you cant endure me look there are our friends the acrobats chapter vi kits poor prospects there was one of the spectators who did not admire kits heroic conduct nor join in the applause which was so liberally showered upon him this was ralph watson who sat on the opposite side of the tent with his chum james schuyler a boy who had recently come to smyrna from the city of new york ralph had been very pale when the lion first made his appearance in the arena and trembled with fear and no one had felt greater relief when the danger was past but being naturally of a jealous disposition he was very much annoyed by the sudden popularity won by kit isnt that your cousin asked james schuyler yes answered ralph shortly what a brave boy he is ralph shrugged his shoulders i dont see much bravery about it he said it isnt as if the lion was a wild one in his native forest this one was tame he didnt look very tame to me rejoined james who though rather snobbish was willing to admit the danger they had all incurred the people didnt think so either hear them cheer your cousin it will make him terribly conceited he will actually think hes a hero i wouldnt have given much for any of our lives if he hadnt jumped into the ring and blinded the lion meanwhile kit was enjoying the performance and thinking very little of how his action would be regarded by ralph for whom he had no very cordial feeling though they had been from the necessity of the case close companions for many years on their return home kit and ralph reached the gate together it seems youre a great hero all at once said ralph with a sneer kit understood the sneer but did not choose to notice it thank you for the compliment he responded quietly o i didnt mean to flatter you you are puffed up enough are you sorry i jumped into the ring ralph asked kit goodnaturedly i dont believe there was any real danger then i must congratulate you upon your courage all the rest of us were frightened and even mr barlow admitted that there was danger the lion was half tame it isnt as if he were wild he looked wild enough to me when i faced him in the ring i confess that my knees began to tremble and i wished myself at home youd better set up as a lion tamer said ralph thank you i think i should prefer some other business where my life would be safer you are likely to have your wish then what do you mean asked kit quickly detecting a significance in ralphs tone i mean that father intends to have you learn a trade has he told you so yes doesnt he propose to consult me why should he you are only a boy and cant judge what is best for yourself still i am likely to be more interested than any one else in the way i am to earn my living what trade are you going to learn what trade am i going to learn repeated ralph with the assumption of insulted dignity none at all i shall be a merchant or a professional man and why should not i be the same asked kit because youre a poor boy didnt my father tell you this afternoon that you had no money coming to you yes but that neednt prevent me from becoming a merchant or studying a profession so you think you cant expect my father to pay for sending you to college or support you while you are qualifying yourself to be a merchant i dont know yet what i am entitled to expect you will soon know how soon tomorrow theres a blacksmith in the next town aaron bickford who has agreed to take you as an apprentice so its all settled is it kit asked full of indignation yes if mr bickford likes your appearance hes coming to smyrna on business tomorrow and will call here youre to live at his house indeed i am very much obliged for the information oh you neednt get grouty about it ive no doubt youll have enough to eat so i am to be a blacksmith and you a merchant or lawyer i think i shall decide to be a lawyer said ralph complacently that will make quite a difference in our social positions of course but i will help you all i can if you have a shop of your own i will have my horses shod at your place does your father think i am particularly well fitted to be a blacksmith he thinks you will get along very well in the business if you are industrious a poor boy cant choose he must take the best he can get kit did not sleep very much that night he was full of anger and indignation with his uncle why should his future be so different from his cousins at school he had distinguished himself more in his studies and he did not see why he was not as well fitted to become a merchant or a lawyer as ralph they cant make me a blacksmith without my consent was his final thought as he closed his eyes and went to sleep kit was up early the next morning as breakfast was not ready he strolled over to the hotel which was only five minutes walk from his uncles house the circus tent had vanished late at night after the evening performance was over the canvas men had busied themselves in taking them down and packing them for transportation to a town ten miles distant on the railroad where they were to give two exhibitions the next day the showy chariots the lions tigers elephants and camels with all the performers were gone but mr barlow the owner of the circus had remained at the smyrna hotel all night preferring to journey comfortably the next morning he was sitting on the piazza when kit passed though he had never seen kit but once his business made him observant of faces and he recognized him immediately aha he said this is the young hero of last evening is it not kit smiled i am the boy who jumped into the ring he said so i thought i hope you slept well after the excitement a sudden thought came to kit mr barlow looked like a kind hearted man and he had already shown that he was well disposed toward him i slept very poorly he said was it the thought of the danger you had been in no sir i learned that my uncle without consulting me had arranged to apprentice me to a blacksmith mr barlow looked surprised but you look like a boy of independent means he said puzzled i have always supposed that this was the case said kit but my uncle told me yesterday to my surprise that i was dependent upon him and had no expectations you dont want to be a blacksmith no sir i consider any kind of work honorable but that would not suit me you would succeed well in my business said the showman but i am very careful how i recommend it to boys it isnt a good school for them they are exposed to many temptations in it but if a boy has a strong will and good principles he may avoid all the evils connected with it kit had not thought of it before but now the question suggested itself why should i not join the circus i should like it better than being a blacksmith how much do you pay acrobats he asked are you an acrobat asked mr barlow kit told the story of his practicing with the vincenti brothers good said mr barlow if they indorse you it is sufficient if you decide to join my company i will give you to begin with ten dollars a week and your expenses thank you sir said kit dazzled by the offer where will you be on saturday at grafton on saturday and milltown on monday if i decide to join you i will do so at one or the other of those places here the railroad omnibus came up and mr barlow entered it for he was to leave by the next train chapter vii aaron bickford the blacksmith kit returned to breakfast in good spirits he saw a way out of his difficulties though he had no false pride he felt that a blacksmiths life would be distasteful to him he was fond of study and had looked forward to a college course now this was out of the question it seemed that he was as poor as his friend dan clark with his own way to make in the world when he left school at the beginning of the vacation he supposed that he would inherit a competence it was certainly a great change in his prospects but now he did not feel dispirited he thought upon the whole he would enjoy traveling with the circus his duties would be light and the pay liberal before he returned to breakfast ralph had come downstairs and had a few words with his father i think you are going to have trouble with kit father he commenced what makes you think so and what about asked mr watson i told him last evening about your plan of apprenticing him to mr bickford you did wrong i did not propose to mention the matter to him till mr bickfords arrival what did he say he turned up his nose at the idea he thinks he ought to become a merchant or a professional man like me he is too proud to be a blacksmith then he must put his pride in his pocket it will be all i can do to pay the expenses of your education i cant provide for two boys when kit is off your hands wont you increase my allowance father asked ralph insinuatingly suppose we postpone that matter replied mr watson in a tone of voice that was not encouraging i have lost some money lately and i cant do anything more for you just at present ralph looked disappointed but did not venture to press the subject where have you been kit he asked as he saw his cousin entering the gate and coming up the path to the front door i have been taking a walk answered kit cheerfully its a good idea to rise early why because you will probably be required to do so in your new place what new place at the blacksmiths kit smiled to ralphs surprise he did not appear to be annoyed i see you are getting reconciled to the idea last evening you seemed to dislike it your father has not said anything about it to me he will very soon wont you come round and see me occasionally ralph asked kit with a curious smile yes i may call on saturday i should like to see how you look kit smiled again he thought it extremely doubtful whether ralph would see him at the blacksmiths forge half an hour after breakfast while ralph and kit were in the stable the sound of wheels was heard and a stout broadshouldered man with a bronzed complexion drove up in a farm wagon throwing his reins over the horses neck he descended from the wagon and turned in at the gate mr watson who had been sitting at the front window opened the door for him glad to see you mr bickford he said is the boy ready asked the blacksmith i can take him right over with me this morning come into the house i will send for him mr bickford noticed the handsome appearance of the hall and the front room the door of which was partly open and said if the boys been used to livin here he must be kind of high strung i cant give him no such home as this of course not mr bickford he cant expect it hes a poor boy and will have to make his own way in the world beggars cant be choosers you know a servant was sent to the stable to summon kit ralph who thought he should enjoy the scene accompanied him kit regarded the blacksmith with some curiosity this is mr aaron bickford of oakford kit began his uncle i hope you are well mr bickford said kit politely the blacksmith gazed at kit with earnest scrutiny humph said he are you strong and muscular pretty fair answered kit with a smile kit said his uncle clearing his throat in your circumstances i have thought it desirable that you should learn a trade and have spoken to mr bickford about taking you as an apprentice in what business asked kit im a blacksmith said mr bickford taking it upon himself to reply and its a good healthy business as any youd want to follow i have no doubt of it said kit quietly but i dont think i should like it all the same uncle stephen how does it happen that you have selected such a business for me i heard that mr bickford needed an apprentice and i have arranged matters with him to take you and teach you his trade yes put in mr bickford ive agreed to give you your board and a dollar a week the first year thats more than i got when i was prentice my old master only paid me fifty cents a week kit turned to his uncle do you think my education has fitted me for a blacksmiths trade he asked it wont interfere replied mr watson a little uneasily wouldnt it have been well to consult me in the matter it seems to me i am rather interested oh i supposed you would object as you had been looking forward to being a gentleman but i cant afford to keep you in idleness any longer and so have arranged matters with mr bickford suppose i object to going with him said kit calmly then i shall overrule your objections and compel you to do what i think is for your good kits eye flashed with transient anger but as he had no idea of acceding to his uncles order he did not allow himself to become unduly excited indeed he had a plan which made temporary submission a matter of policy whats the boys name asked aaron bickford i am generally called kit my right name is christopher then kit youd better be getting your traps together for i cant stop long away from the shop i have arranged to have you go back with mr bickford today said stephen watson thats rather short notice isnt it kit rejoined the sooner the matter is arranged the better answered his uncle very well said kit with unexpected submission ill go and pack up my clothes mr watson looked relieved he had expected to have more trouble with his nephew in twenty minutes kit reappeared with his school valise he had packed up a supply of shirts socks handkerchiefs and underclothing i am all ready he said then well be going said the blacksmith rising with alacrity kit took his place on the seat beside mr bickford goodby uncle he said it may be some time before we meet again what does the boy mean asked stephen watson turning to ralph with a puzzled look i dont know hes been acting queer all the morning so kit rode away with aaron bickford but he had not the slightest intention of becoming blacksmith instead of blacksmiths forges visions of a circus ring and acrobatic feats were dancing before his mind chapter viii kits ride to oakford oakford was six miles away the blacksmiths horse was seventeen years old and did not make very good speed kit was unusually busy thinking he had taken a decisive step he had in fact made up his mind to enter upon a new life he had not objected to going away with the blacksmith because it gave him an excuse for packing up his clothes and leaving the house quietly it may be objected that he had deceived mr bickford this was true and the thought of it troubled him but he hardly knew how to explain matters not much conversation took place till they were within a mile of oakford aaron bickford had filled his pipe at the beginning of the journey and he had smoked steadily ever since at last he removed his pipe from his mouth and put it in his pocket were you ever in oakford he asked yes answered kit i know the place very well how do you think youll like livin there i dont think i shall like it mr bickford looked surprised ill keep you at work so stiddy you wont mind where you are he remarked dryly not if i know it kit said to himself he knew mr bickford by reputation he was a closefisted miserly man who was not likely to be a very desirable employer for he expected every one who worked for him to labor as hard as himself moreover he and his wife lived in a very stingy manner and few of the luxuries of the season appeared on their table the fact that complaints upon this score had been made by some of kits predecessors in his employ led mr bickford to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether kit was particular about his food are you particlar about your vittles he asked abruptly i have been accustomed to good food answered kit you cant expect to live as you have at your uncles continued the blacksmith me and my wife have enough to eat but we think it best to eat plain food some of my help have had stuck up notions and expected first class hotel fare but they didnt get it at my house i believe you said kit mr bickford eyed him sharply not being sure but this might be a sarcastic observation but kits face was straight and betrayed nothing youll live as well as i do myself he proceeded after a pause i dont pamper my appetite by no means kit was quite ready to believe this also but did not say so what time did you get up at your uncles asked the blacksmith we have breakfast a little before eight i get up in time for breakfast you do hey ejaculated the blacksmith scornfully waal i declare you must be tuckered out gettin up so airly o no i stand it very well mr bickford said kit amused do you know what time i get up asked mr bickford with a touch of indignation in his tone i would like to know answered kit meekly waal i get up at five oclock what do you say to that hey i think it is very early i suppose you couldnt get up so early as that i might if there was any need of it i reckon there will be need of it if youre goin to work for me kit cleared his throat he felt that the time had come for an explanation mr bickford he said i owe you an apology what said bickford regarding his young companion in surprise i have deceived you i dont know what youre talkin about i dont think i did right to come with you to day i cant make out what youre talkin about your uncle has engaged to let you work for me but i havent engaged to work for you mr bickford hey and the blacksmith eyed our hero in undisguised amazement i may as well say that i dont intend to work for you you dont mean to work for me repeated bickford slowly just so i have no intention of becoming a blacksmith is the boy crazy ejaculated aaron bickford no mr bickford i have full command of my senses you will have to look out for another apprentice then why did you agree to come with me that is what i have to apologize for i wanted to get away from my uncles house quietly and i thought it the best way to pretend to agree to his plan aaron bickford was not a sweet tempered man he had a pretty strong will of his own and was called not without reason obstinate he began to feel angry well boy have you got through with what you had to say he asked i believe so for the present then i guess its about time for me to say something very well sir youll find me a tough customer to deal with young man then perhaps it is just as well that i do not propose to work for you but you are goin to work for me said the blacksmith nodding his head whether i want to or not interrogated kit placidly yes whether you want to or not willy nilly as the lawyers say i think mr bickford you will find that it takes two to make a bargain so it does and theres two thats made this bargain your uncle and me mr bickford was not always strictly grammatical in his language as the reader will observe i dont admit my uncles right to make arrangements for me without my consent you know moren he does i reckon no but this matter concerns me more than it does him maybe you expect to live without workin no if it is true as my uncle says that i have no money i shall have to make my living but i prefer to choose my own way of doing it youre a queer boy bein a blacksmith is too much work for you i reckon at any rate it isnt the kind of work i care to undertake whats all this rigmarole comin to here we are most at my house if you aint goin to work for me what are you goin to do i should like to pass the night at your house mr bickford after breakfast i will pay you for your accommodations and go where you must excuse my telling you that i have formed some plans but i do not care to have my uncle know them are you going to work for anybody asked the blacksmith whose curiosity was aroused yes i have a place secured is it on a farm no youre mighty mysterious it seems to me now youve had your say ive got something to tell you very well mr bickford you say youre not goin to work for me yes sir then i say you are goin to work for me ive got your uncles authority to set you to work and im goin to do it kit heard this calmly suppose we postpone the discussion of the matter he said is that your house aaron bickfords answer was to drive into the yard of a cottage on the side opposite was a blacksmiths forge thats where youre goin to work he said grimly pointing to the forge chapter ix kit makes a new acquaintance grafton where barlows circus was billed to appear on saturday was only six miles farther on oakford was about half way so that in accompanying the blacksmith to his home kit had accomplished about half the necessary journey now that he had undeceived the blacksmith as to his intention of staying he felt at ease in his mind it was his plan to remain over night in the house and pursue his journey early the next day are these all the cloes you brought with you asked bickford surveying kits neat and rather expensive suit with disapproval yes am i not well enough dressed for a blacksmith asked kit with a smile youre a plaguy sight too well dressed returned bickford you want a good rough suit for the forge is a dirty place i thought i told you i did not intend to work for you mr bickford thats what you said but i dont take no stock in it your uncle has bound you out to me and that settles it if he has bound me out where are the papers mr bickford asked kit keenly this question was a poser the blacksmith supposed that kit might be ignorant that papers were required but he found himself mistaken there aint no papers but that dont make no difference he said he says youre to work for me and im goin to hold you to it kit did not reply for he saw no advantage in discussion youll get a dollar a week and your board and you cant do better i reckon dinner is about ready now kit felt ready for the dinner for the mornings ride had sharpened his appetite so when five minutes later he was summoned to the table he willingly accepted the invitation this is my new prentice mrs bickford said the blacksmith by way of introduction to a spare red headed woman who was bustling about the kitchen where the table was spread mrs bickford eyed kit critically hes one of the kid glove kind by his looks she said you dont expect to get much work out of him do you i reckon i will or know the reason why responded bickford significantly set right down and ill dish up the victuals said mrs bickford we dont stand on no ceremony here whats your name young man people call me kit sounds like a young cat its rediculous to give a boy such a name first thing you know ill be calling you kitty i hope i dont look like a cat said kit laughing you aint got no fur on your cheeks yet said the blacksmith laughing heartily at his own witticism what have you got for dinner mother its a sort of pickedup dinner answered mrs bickford theres some pork and beans warmed up some slapjacks from breakfast and some fried sassidges why thats a dinner for a king said the blacksmith rubbing his hands he took his seat and put on a plate for kit specimens of the delicacies mentioned above in spite of his appetite kit partook sparingly supplementing his meal with bread which being from the bakers shop was of good quality he congratulated himself that he was not to board permanently at mr bickfords table when dinner was over the blacksmith in a genial mood said to kit you neednt begin to work till tomorrow you can tramp round the village if you want to kit was glad of the delay as early the next morning he expected to bid farewell to oakford and thus would avoid a conflict he had been in oakford before and knew his way about he went out of the yard and walked about in a leisurely way it was early in june and the country was at its best the birds were singing the fields were green with verdure and kits spirits rose he felt that it would be delightful to travel about the country as he would do if he joined barlows circus he overtook a boy somewhat larger than himself a stout strong country boy attired in a rough coarse working suit he was about to pass him when the country boy called out hallo you were you speaking to me asked kit turning and looking back yes didnt i see you riding into town with aaron bickford yes are you going to work for him that is what he expects answered kit diplomatically he hesitated about confiding his plans to a stranger then i pity you why i used to work for him did you yes i stood it as long as i could then you didnt like it i guess not what was the trouble everything hes a stingy old hunks to begin with i went to work for a dollar a week and board if the board had been decent it would have been something but id as soon board at the poorhouse i have taken dinner there said kit smiling did you like it i have dined better in fact i have seldom dined worse what did the old woman give you kit enumerated the articles composing the bill of fare thats better than usual said the new acquaintance i suppose the dollar a week is all right said kit good enough if you can get it its about as easy to get blood out of a stone as money out of old bickford generally i had to wait ten days after the time before i could get the money how is the work hard and plenty of it its work early and work late and if there isnt work at the forge youve got to help the old woman by drawing water and doing chores you dont live in oakford do you no i came from smyrna i thought not bickford cant get a boy to work for him here what made you come couldnt you get a place at home i didnt try well you havent done much in coming here i begin to think so kit responded with a smile hasnt the circus been in your town yes i wanted to go but i guess ill manage to see it in grafton it shows there tomorrow are you going asked kit with interest yes i shall walk ill start early and spend the day there we may meet there you dont expect to go do you bickford wont let you off kit smiled i dont think mr bickford will have much to say about it he said are you going to hook jack asked his new acquaintance i didnt mean to tell you but i will i have made up my mind not to work for mr bickford at all then why did you come here because my uncle saw fit to arrange with him what are you going to do then i am offered work with the circus you are exclaimed the country boy opening wide his eyes in astonishment what are you going to do im going to be an acrobat whats that kit explained as well as he could what are they going to pay you ten dollars a week and my expenses answered kit proudly jehu ejaculated the other boy why thats good wages for a man do you think theyd hire me too if you think you can do what they require you can ask them why cant i do it as well as you because i have been practicing for a long time at a gymnasium what is your name bill morris then bill dont say a word to any one about my plans suppose we go to grafton together all right before the boys parted they made an agreement to meet at five oclock the next morning to set out on their walk to grafton chapter x kits first night at the blacksmiths at nine oclock the blacksmith giving a deep yawn said youd better be getting to bed young feller youll have to be up bright and airly in the morning kit was already feeling sleepy and made no objection though it was yet early he had found it hard work to get through the evening as he could find nothing to read except a weekly paper three months old and a copy of pilgrims progress in truth neither mr bickford nor his wife were of a literary turn and did not even manage to keep up with the news of the day i am ready said kit mother show him to his room added the blacksmith tomorrow ill give him a lesson at the forge perhaps you will said kit to himself but i think it doubtful kits room was a small back one on the second floor the front apartment was occupied by mr and mrs bickford and there was one of the same size which was used as a spare chamber kits room was supplied with a cot bed and was furnished in the plainest manner one thing he missed he saw no washstand where am i to wash in the morning he asked you can wash in the tin basin in the kitchen answered mrs bickford theres a bar of soap down there and a roller towel so i guess you wont have to go dirty kit shuddered at the suggestion he had seen bars of yellow soap in the grocery at home and didnt think he should enjoy its use nor did he fancy using the same towel with the blacksmith and his wife he had seen the roller towel hanging beside the sink and judged from its appearance that it had already been used nearly a week i have been accustomed to wash in my own room he ventured to say youve been used to a great many things that you wont find here replied mrs bickford grimly kit thought it extremely likely if you cant do as the rest of us do you can get along without washing continued the lady i will try and manage answered kit bearing in mind that he expected to leave the bickford mansion forever the next morning that new boy of yours is kind of uppish remarked mrs bickford when she returned to the sitting room whats the matter now he wants to wash in his own room hes too fine a gentleman to wash in the kitchen what did you tell him mrs bickford repeated her remark good for you mother well take down his pride a little is he goin to work in them fine cloes he brought with him he didnt bring any others hell spile em and not have anything to wear to meetin havent we got a pair of overalls in the house one that the last boy used yes ill get em right away theyll be good for him to wear before kit got into bed the door of his chamber was unceremoniously opened and mrs bickford walked in carrying a faded pair of overalls you can put these on in the mornin she said theyll keep your cloes clean they may be a mite long for you but you can turn up the legs at the bottom she left the room without waiting for an answer kit surveyed the overalls with amusement i wonder how i should look in them he said to himself he drew them over his trousers and regarded his figure as well as he could in the little seven by nine glass that hung on the wall there is kit the young blacksmith he said with a smile on the whole i dont think it improves my appearance ill take them off and leave them for the next boy what did the boy say mother asked mr bickford upon his wifes return he just took em he didnt say anything i spose hes never worn overalls before said the blacksmith what do you think he told me on the way over i dont know he said he wasnt goin to work for me at all he didnt like the blacksmiths trade well of all things i just told him he hadnt no choice in the matter that me and his uncle had arranged matters and that i should hold him to the contract im afraid hell be dainty about his vittles he didnt eat much dinner wait till he gets to work mother i guess hell have appetite enough i mean he shall earn his board at any rate i hope we wont have no trouble with him aaron you neednt be afraid mother somehow aaron you never did manage to keep boys very long said mrs bickford dubiously because their folks were weak and allowed em to have their own way itll be different with this boy what makes you think so because his uncle is anxious to get rid of him he told me the boy till lately had imagined he was goin to have property hes supported him out of charity dressin him like a gentleman sendin him to school and spendin a pile of money on him now he thinks it about time to quit and have the boy learn a trade of course the boyll complain and try to beg off but it wont be no use stephen watson wont make no account of what he says he keeps a horse himself and has promised to have him shod at my shop well it may be for the best i hope so aaron bickford felt a good deal of confidence in himself he understood very well that kit was averse to working in his shop but he meant to make him do it id like to see the boy i cant master he said to himself complacently years hence when the boy has a forge of his own hell thank me for perseverin with him theres money to be made in the business why when i began i wasnt worth a hundred dollars and i owed for my anvil now i own this house and shop and ive got a tidy sum in the bank this was true but it must be added that the result was largely due to the pinching economy which both he and his wife had practiced when mr bickford woke up the next morning it was halfpast five oclock strange how i came to oversleep he said i guess i must have been more tuckered out than i supposed well the boys had a longer nap than i meant he should however its only for one mornin mr bickford did not linger over his toilet five minutes was rather an overstatement of the time he went to kits chamber and opening the door went in as unceremoniously as his wife had done the night before a surprise awaited him there was no one in the bed what has the boy got up aready he asked himself in a bewildered way hes better at gettin up than i expected looking about him he discovered on a chair by the bedside the overalls and upon them a note and a silver dollar whats all that mean he asked himself looking closer he saw that the note was directed to him beginning to suspect that something was wrong he opened it this was what the note contained mr bickford i leave you a dollar to pay for my food and lodging i do not care to become a blacksmith good by kit watson ill have him back exclaimed aaron bickford an angry look appearing on his face he aint goin to get the best of me mr bickford harnessed up his horse and started after the fugitive but in what direction should he drive he was not long at fault he met a milkman who had seen two boys starting out on the grafton road and so informed him i guess theyre bound for the circus he said like as not returned the blacksmith but he had a long chase of it it was not until he was within half a mile of the circus tents that he descried the two boys trudging along kit with his valise in his hand hearing the sound of wheels the boys looked back and in some dismay recognized their pursuer the blacksmith stood up in his wagon and pointing his long whip at kit cried out stop where you are kit watson or ill give you the worst thrashing you ever had chapter xi kit falls into the hands of the enemy if aaron bickford expected to frighten kit by his threat he was destined to find himself badly mistaken kit was startled at first not having anticipated that the blacksmith would get upon his track so soon but he was a boy of spirit and had no thought of surrender mr bickford halted his horse and kit faced him didnt you find my note he asked yes i did then you know that i dont care to work for you whats that got to do with it your uncle and me have settled that you shall then youll have to unsettle it i have a right to choose my own occupation and i dont intend to become a blacksmith even if i did i should choose some one else as my teacher none of your impudence young man youll have a long account to settle with me i warn you of that i had but one account to settle for my board and lodging and ive attended to that good morning mr bickford kit turned and began to continue his journey hallo stop i tell you shouted the blacksmith have you got any more to say if so ill listen what more i have to say i shall say with a horsewhip retorted bickford grimly preparing to descend from his wagon come william we must run for it said kit are you good at running try me was the laconic reply by the time aaron bickford was out of his wagon the boys had increased the distance between them by several rods oho so thats your game is it said the blacksmith if i dont overhaul them my name isnt aaron bickford kit was a good runner quite as good as his pursuer but he had one serious disadvantage his valise was heavy and materially affected his speed he had carried it several miles and though he had shifted it from one hand to the other both arms were now tired let me take it kit said his companion who was now on intimate terms with him itll be just as heavy for you as for me never mind he isnt after me well if you dont mind carrying it a little while the advantage of the change was soon apparent kit increased his speed and william whose arms were not tired was not materially retarded by his burden if i had no valise i would climb a tree said kit while running i dont believe mr bickford is good at climbing we havent got far to go to reach the circus tents returned william but though the boys held out well aaron bickford gradually gained upon them many years at the anvil had given him plenty of wind and endurance besides he was entirely fresh not having taken a long walk already as the boys had done youd better give up he cried out in the tone of one who was sure of victory it takes more than a boy like you to get the best of aaron bickford it did indeed seem as if the boys must surrender within a few rods bickford would be even with them kit came to a sudden determination jump over the fence he cried there was a rail fence skirting one side of the road no sooner said than done both boys clambered over the fence and with that barrier between them faced the angry blacksmith well ive got you he cried panting have you i dont see it answered kit you might as well give up fust as last suppose we discuss matters a little mr bickford said kit calmly what right have you to pursue me what right your uncles given me the charge of you that is something he had no right to do why not aint he your guardian no who is then i have no guardian but myself thats a likely story i cant listen to no such foolish talk aaron bickford felt that it was time to move upon the enemys entrenchments and putting one leg on the lower rail he proceeded to climb over the fence but the boys had anticipated this move and were prepared for it by the time the blacksmith was inside the field the boys who were considerably lighter and more active had crossed to the reverse side here we are again mr bickford said william morris the blacksmith frowned dont you be impudent bill morris he said i havent anything to do with you but i shant let you sass me what have i said thats out of the way asked william oh youre mighty innocent you are youre aidin and abettin kit watson to escape from me his lawful master i have no master mr bickford said kit proudly well thats what they used to call em when i was a boy boys werent so pert and impudent in them days meanwhile the blacksmith was recrossing the fence kit and william took the opportunity to run and by the time mr bickford was again on the roadside they were several rods away this naturally exasperated the blacksmith who felt mortified at his failure to overtake the youngsters a new idea occurred to him you bill do you want to earn a dime he asked how inquired william just help me catch that boy kit and ill give you ten cents i dont care to earn money that way mr bickford responded william scornfully good for you william exclaimed kit you wont earn ten cents any easier persisted bickford i wouldnt do such a mean thing for a dollar nor five dollars replied william kits a friend of mine and im going to stand by him the blacksmith was made angry by this persistent refusal then again he was faint and uncomfortable from having missed his breakfast which seemed likely to be indefinitely postponed ill lick you bill morris as well as kit when i catch you he said probably you will when you catch me retorted william in an aggravating tone run faster kit the boys ran but again they were impeded by the heavy valise and slowly but surely the blacksmith was gaining upon them kit who was again carrying the burden began to show signs of distress and dropped behind his companion i cant hold out much longer bill he said puffing laboriously aaron bickford heard these words and they impelled him to extra exertion at last he caught up and grasped kit by the collar ive got ye at last he cried triumphantly chapter xii mr bickfords defeat aaron bickford was a strong man by his work at the forge he had strengthened his muscles till they were like iron so was kit a strong boy but it would be absurd to represent him as a match for the sturdy blacksmith ive got ye at last repeated bickford tightening his grasp of kits coat collar let go my collar cried kit not struggling for he knew that it would be useless ill let go your collar when ive got ye in the wagon answered the blacksmith and not till then you bill bring along his valise ill take ye home in the wagon though it would be only right if i let ye walk mr bickford said kit you have no right to touch me you have no authority over me i aint hey well well argy that matter when we get home and he commenced dragging kit in the direction of the wagon it certainly seemed as if kits plans were destined if not for defeat to postponement unconditional surrender was his only choice against the superior strength of aaron bickford it was certainly very vexatious but help was nearer than he anticipated they were now within sight of the circus tents and kit to his joy descried the giant achilles henderson taking a morning walk and already within hearing distance mr henderson he called out eagerly who is that youre calling asked the blacksmith sharply achilles heard and instantly recognized the boy who had talked with him at smyrna it took but a few strides to bring him to the spot where kit was held in captivity what does this mean he asked this man is dragging me away without authority answered kit who is he asked the giant he is a blacksmith and claims me as an apprentice but i never agreed to work for him thats a lie said the blacksmith hes my runaway apprentice i would believe the boy sooner than you said achilles not favorably impressed by the blacksmiths bull dog look it doesnt make any difference what you believe said bickford rudely and he began to pull kit in the direction of the wagon let go that boys collar cried achilles sternly i wont retorted the blacksmith i advise you to mind your own business achilles henderson like most big men was good natured but he was roused by the others insolence he carried war into the enemys camp by seizing the blacksmith and shaking him till he was compelled to release his grasp what do you mean by this outrage demanded bickford furiously its only a gentle hint said achilles smiling now my friend ive got a piece of advice to give you if that is your wagon back there youd better get into it as soon as convenient the sooner the better and get out of my way or ill give you a stronger hint the blacksmith was too indignant to be prudent what confess himself vanquished and go home without the boy the idea was intolerable to him im goin to take the boy he said angrily and darting forward he essayed to seize kit by the collar again oho you need a stronger hint said achilles with this he grasped the blacksmith about the middle and tossed him over the fence into the adjoining field as easily as if he were a cat aaron bickford did not know what had happened to him he lay motionless for a few seconds and then picked himself up with some difficulty and confronted the giant with mingled fear and anger ill have the law of ye for this he shouted achilles laughed its as you like he said ive got my witnesses here pointing to the two boys mr bickford got over the fence and sullenly turned in the direction of his deserted wagon youll hear from me again all of you he shouted shaking his fist dont trouble yourself to write said the giant jocosely we can worry along without a letter the blacksmith was too full of wrath for utterance he kept on his way muttering to himself and shaking his fist at intervals now whats all this about asked achilles whats the matter with our amiable friend kit explained so you dont want to be a blacksmith where are you going if i may inquire im going to join the circus answered kit in what capacity as a lion tamer no i shouldnt fancy that business i am to be an acrobat an acrobat but are you qualified asked achilles somewhat surprised he had not heard of kits practice with the vincenti brothers on the day of his first visit to the circus i am pretty well qualified already answered kit i saw mr barlow yesterday morning and he promised me an engagement at ten dollars a week good said achilles heartily i am pleased to hear it i took a liking to you the other day and im glad youre going to join us but do you think it wise to choose such a life you have chosen it said kit yes but what could i do a man of my size i must earn more than a common man my board and clothes both cost more what do you think i paid for this suit i have on i couldnt tell sir sixty dollars the tailor only charges thirty dollars to a man of ordinary size but i am so absurdly large that i have to pay double price why dont you buy your suits ready made asked kit smiling achilles laughed heartily at the idea show me a place where i can get ready made clothes to fit me he answered and i will gladly accept your suggestion that may be a little difficult i admit why you have no idea how inconvenient i find it to be so large i cant find a bed to suit me in any hotel if i go to the theater i cant crowd myself into an ordinary seat i have to have all kinds of clothing inside and outside made to order my hats and shoes must also be made expressly for me i suppose you get very well paid suggested kit seventyfive dollars a week sounds pretty large and would be if my expenses were not so great you wouldnt be a giant for that money would you i am not so ambitious replied kit smiling but there was a moment when i wished myself of your size when was that when the blacksmith grasped me by the collar you dont have to work very hard said william morris my boy it is pretty hard work to be stared at by a crowd of people i get tired of it often but i see no other way of making a living you would make a pretty good blacksmith i couldnt earn more than a man of average strength and that wouldnt be enough as i have explained were your parents very tall asked kit my father was six feet in height but my mother was a small woman i dont know what put it into me to grow so big but here we are at the lot will you come in when can i see mr barlow asked kit anxiously he is at the hotel he wont be round till halfpast nine have you two boys had breakfast no answered kit im nearly famished come round to the circus tent you are to be one of us and will board there i guess we can provide for your friend too never was invitation more gladly accepted both kit and william felt as if they had not broken their fast for a week chapter xiii breakfast in the circus tent achilles entered the circus inclosure the lot as it is generally called and made his way to a small tent situated not far from the one devoted to the performances an attendant was carrying in a plate of hot steak and potatoes from the cook tent near by is breakfast ready asked achilles yes any time you want it is anybody inside only mademoiselle louise well i want three breakfasts for myself and my two young friends here i didnt know you had sons said mike the attendant regarding kit and william with some curiosity i havent one of these young men is an acrobat who will be one of us the other is his friend bring along the grub as quick as possible we are all hungry all right sir running the length of the tent which was about twenty feet by ten was a long table surrounded by benches the giant took his seat and placed the boys one on each side of him just opposite sat a woman of twentyfive or thereabouts who was already eating breakfast good morning mlle louise said the giant good morning mr henderson responded the lady who are your young companions i dont know their names but this one placing his hand on kits shoulder has been engaged by mr barlow as an acrobat indeed he looks young i am sixteen volunteered kit what circus have you traveled with before this season asked mlle louise i have never traveled with any madam but you are an acrobat i have had my practice in a gymnasium how came mr barlow to engage you at smyrna i practiced a little with the vincenti brothers at smyrna why thats where the lion dashed into the arena yes do you know the boy who had the courage to face him kit blushed i am the boy he said you dont mean it exclaimed the lady vivaciously why youre a hero i must shake hands with you and she reached across the table and gave kit a hearty grasp of the hand is that so interposed achilles why i didnt know you were the boy i was not present at the time and only heard of it afterwards mlle louise is right you are a brave fellow i am much obliged to you both for your favorable opinion said kit modestly but i didnt realize my danger till afterwards oh heavens i can see him now that wicked beast exclaimed the lady i was nearly scared out of my senses as for poor dupont he was nearer death than i ever want to be till my time comes was dupont the clown asked kit yes the lion held him down with his foot upon the poor clowns back and but for your brave act he would have torn the poor fellow to pieces mr henderson you missed the most thrilling act of the evening so i begin to think by the way boys i ought to have introduced this lady she is the famous aerial artist whom you saw the other evening in her wonderful feats upon the trapeze yes said mlle louise complacently i think i have a pretty good act i get plenty of applause eh mr henderson thats true i think i should leave the circus if i had to appear in your act i never could summon up courage the lady laughed monsieur achilles she said i wouldnt advise you to emulate me i dont believe you could find a rope strong enough to support you and if you should fall i pity the audience you have convinced me i shall give up all thoughts of it said the giant with mock gravity it would suit better our young friend here who is an acrobat did you ever practice on a trapeze asked mlle louise turning to kit yes often answered kit but never at a great height would it frighten you to find yourself so high up in the air i dont think so i have a cool head you must practice i will give you a few hints myself if you are cool and courageous as i judge you will soon learn by the way what is your name kit watson itll be something else when you begin work do all performers have assumed names generally here i am mademoiselle louise lefroy but it isnt a bit like my real name before this the boys had been served with breakfast the steak was rather tough and the coffee not of the best quality but kit and william thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it about the best breakfast they had ever eaten mlle louise continued to converse with them and was very gracious are you too an acrobat she asked william william became so confused that he swallowed some coffee the wrong way and came near choking no maam he answered bashfully but id like to go round with the show youll be better off at home if youve got one said the giant you are not a performer you are too small for a property man and not strong enough for a razorback whats a razorback asked william in amazement achilles smiled its a boy or man who helps load and unload the circus cars he answered it is heavy work and you would be thrown among a low lot of people canvasmen and such our young friend here on the other hand will have a good sleeping berth eat at the first table and be well provided for generally william looked disappointed he had never thought particularly about traveling with a circus till now but his meeting with kit had given him a circus fever at ten oclock mr barlow came to the grounds and achilles volunteered to go with kit to speak with him about his engagement chapter xiv some circus people mr barlow recognized kit instantly so you have kept your promise my young friend he said well have you come to join us yes sir if your offer holds good my offers always hold good i never go back on my word kit was glad to hear this for he would have been placed in an embarrassing position if like some men mr barlow had forgotten an offer made on the impulse of the moment have you any directions to give sir you may report to my manager mr bryant first however it may be well for you to see the vincenti brothers and arrange for a joint act when do you wish me to appear sir whenever you are ready you may take a week to rehearse if necessary your pay will commence at once thank you mr barlow you are very kind and considerate mr barlow smiled and waving his hand passed on he was very popular with all who were in his employ and had a high reputation for kindness and strict integrity id like to work for him said william morris who had listened to the conversation between kit and the circus proprietor i should like to have you along with me replied kit but from what mr henderson says there is no good opening it was not till eleven oclock that kit met his future partners the vincenti brothers good said alonzo in a tone of satisfaction we must get up a joint act i suppose you havent got a suit of tights no i never expected to need one i have an extra one which i think will fit you though i am ten years older than you we are about the same size kit had occasion to remark that circus performers are short as a rule many of them do not exceed five feet four inches in height but generally they are compactly built with well developed muscles and possess unusual strength and agility the circus suit was brought out it proved to be an excellent fit william morris eyed kit with admiration you look like a regular circus chap kit he exclaimed i wish i was in your shoes wait till you see whether i am a success william replied kit now if you are ready we will have a little practice said alonzo vincenti may i look on asked william oh yes we dont generally admit spectators but you are a friend of the boy they all entered the tent and for an hour kit was kept hard at work in the act devised by the vincenti brothers he stood on the shoulders of the second who in his turn stood on the shoulders of the first various changes were gone through in all of which kit proved himself an adept and won high compliments from his new associates can you tumble asked antonio kit smiled i was afraid i should when i first got on your shoulders he answered that was what i meant something like this and he whirled across the arena rolling over and over on hands and feet in the manner of a cart wheel kit imitated antonio rather slowly and awkwardly at first but rapidly showed improvement youll soon learn said antonio now let me show you something else this something else was a succession of somersaults made in the most rapid manner kit tried this also slowly at first as before but proving a rapid learner in the course of three or four days you will be able to do it in public said alonzo when do you advise me to make my first appearance asked kit tonight in our first act but shall i be ready youll do we may as well make a beginning i wish i could see you kit said william cant you i was going to the afternoon performance it would make me too late home if i stayed in the evening wont there be some people over from oakford that you can ride back with i didnt think of that yes john woods told me that his father was coming and would bring him along i could ride home with them good then youd better stay perhaps id better go over and buy a ticket but to williams satisfaction he was given free admission as a friend of kit not only that but he was invited to take dinner and supper at the circus table in fact he was treated with distinguished consideration kit he said i was in luck to meet you and it was lucky for me that i met you i shouldnt like to have met aaron bickford single handed i wish old bickford would come to the circus tonight wouldnt he be surprised to see you performing in tights i think it would rather take him by surprise said kit smiling kit and william occupied seats at the afternoon performance as spectators it having been arranged that kits dйbut should be made in the evening our hero regarded the different acts with unusual interest and his heart beat a little quicker when he heard the applause elicited by the performances of the vincenti brothers for he had already begun to consider himself one of them when the performance was over and the audience was dispersing kit felt a hand laid upon his shoulder he turned and his glance rested upon a man of about forty with a grave serious expression he was puzzled for it was not a face that he remembered to have ever seen before you dont know me said the stranger no sir and yet you have done me a very great service i didnt know it sir the greatest service that any one person can do to another you have saved my life then a light dawned upon kits mind and he remembered what achilles henderson had said to him in the morning is your name dupont he asked yes i am joe dupont the clown whom you saved from a horrible death i tell you when nero stood there in the ring with his paw on my breast i gave myself up for lost i expected to be torn to pieces it was an awful moment and the clown shuddered at the picture which his imagination conjured up yes sir i wouldnt see such another moment for all the money barlow is worth i wonder my hair didnt turn white excuse me mr dupont but i find it hard to think you are joe dupont the clown said kit why because you look so grave and sedate joe dupont smiled i only make a fool of myself in the ring he said outside you might take me for a merchant or minister indeed i am a ministers son you a ministers son ejaculated kit yes you wouldnt think it would you i was rather a wild lad as ministers sons often are my poor father tried hard to give me an education but my mind wasnt on books or school exercises and at sixteen i cut and run did you join a circus then not at once i tried hard to earn my living in different ways finally i struck a circus and got an engagement as a razorback when i got older i began to notice and imitate the clowns and finally i made up my mind to become one myself do you like the business i have to like it no i am disgusted with myself often and often you can judge from one thing i have a little daughter katy now eight years of age she has never seen me in the ring and never will i could never hold up my head in her presence if she had once seen me playing the fool before an audience all this surprised kit he had been disposed to think that what clowns were before the public they were in private life also now he saw his mistake you contribute to the public amusement mr dupont said kit true but what sort of a life record is it suppose in after years katy is asked who was your father and is obliged to answer joe dupont the clown but i ought not to grumble but for you i should have died a terrible death and katy would be fatherless so i have much to be thankful for after all kit listened to the clown not without surprise he could hardly realize that this was the comical man whose grotesque actions and sayings had convulsed the spectators only an hour before when he came to think of it he felt that he would rather be an acrobat than a clown chapter xv mr bickford goes to the circus when aaron bickford balked of his prey was compelled to get into his wagon and start for home he felt uncommonly cross to begin with he was half famished having harnessed up and set out on what turned out to be a wild goose chase without breaking his fast yet he could have borne this with comparative equanimity if he had effected the purpose which he had in view the capture of his expected apprentice but he had been signally defeated indeed he had been humiliated in presence of kit and william morris by being unceremoniously picked up and tossed over the fence as william was an oakford boy he foresaw that his discomfiture would soon be known to all his fellow townsmen and that public ridicule would be his portion there seemed no way to avoid this unless by begging william to keep silent and this he could not bring himself to do even if the request was likely to be granted wheres the boy asked his wife as after unharnessing his horse he went into the house i dont know where he is answered bickford in a surly tone didnt you find him yes i found him wouldnt he come back he didnt id have made him if i were you perhaps you would and then perhaps you wouldnt perhaps you couldnt you dont mean to say aaron bickford that you let a whippersnapper like that defy you what could i do against a man eight feet high goodness mr bickford have you been drinking ejaculated his wife no i havent been drinking do you mean to tell me that boy is eight feet high no i dont mean to tell you the boy is eight feet high but i wont answer any more foolish questions till you give me something to eat i am fairly faint with hunger sit down then and i hope after youve gratified your appetite youll be a little less mysterious mrs bickford was privately of opinion that her husband had stopped at some drinking place otherwise why should he prate of men eight feet tall aaron bickford ate almost ravenously though the food set before him was not calculated to gratify the taste of an epicure but all things are acceptable to an empty stomach when he seemed to be satisfied his wife began anew who is it that is eight feet high she asked the giant at the circus what did you have to do with him not much but he had something to do with me answered bickford grimly how is that i overhauled the boy and was dragging him back to the wagon when this fellow hove in sight it seems he knew the young rascal and took his part he seized me as easily as you would take up a cat and flung me over the fence i wish id been there exclaimed mrs bickford angrily what could you have done you would have been flung over too said her husband contemptuously i would have got a good grip of his hair and i guess that would have made him let go youd have to stand on a ladder then so the boy got away of course he did and where did he go i expect he went to the circus along with william morris was that boy with him yes they were pretty well matched what can they do at the circus i dont know perhaps their longlegged friend will give them a ticket to the show aaron suppose we go to the circus what for you may get hold of the boy and bring him back the giant wont be with him all the time id like to get the boy back said bickford in a wavering tone id give him a lesson and so would i i guess between us we could subdue him but of course he must be got back first ill think of it sarah later in the day mr bickford told his wife he would go to the circus but he tried to evade taking her in order to save the expense of another ticket to this however she would not agree the upshot was that after supper the old horse was harnessed up and the amiable pair bent on vengeance started for grafton chapter xvi mr bickford at the circus mr bickfords chief object in going to the circus was to regain possession of kit his runaway apprentice as he chose to consider him but besides this he really had a curiosity to see the show and thought this would afford him a good excuse for doing so the same remark will apply to mrs bickford whose curiosity had been excited the year previous by seeing a circus procession the blacksmith and his wife were not prejudiced against amusements like many others but were too frugal to attend them now that they could combine business with pleasure they threw to the winds all hesitation do you think youll get the boy father asked mrs bickford as they jolted over the road to grafton ill make a try for it sarah hes a good strong boy and hell make a capital blacksmith did you notice his broad shoulders he looks like hed have a hearty appetite said the careful spouse we wont pamper him sarah replied bickford smiling grimly he wont get no such victuals as he did at home plain food and plenty of it thats the way to bring up boys perhaps he wont be at the circus suggested mrs bickford id be surprised if he wasnt boys have a natural hankering for the circus i had when i was a boy did you ever go aaron no i didnt have the money do you know how much they charge fifty cents i believe its an awful sight of money to pay for amusement if it lasts two hours that makes twentyfive cents an hour so it does sarah thats as much as i can earn by hard work in that time i dont know as its right to fling away so much money i wouldnt do it if it wasnt for gettin the boy back hell be worth a good deal to me if i do hes a good deal stronger than bill morris of course that makes a difference i dont care so much for the circus though i should like to see the man stand up on a horse and jump through hoops i wonder if the horse jumps through too i dont know but well soon know all that is to be known the boy wont expect to see us i reckon concluded the blacksmith with a chuckle at length they reached the circus grounds all was bustle and excitement in the neighborhood of the lot i declare aaron it looks like fourth of july said mrs bickford so it does it beats all what a crowd there is they bought tickets and entered the inclosure in a small tent near the entrance were the curiosities they were about to walk in when a young man curtly asked for tickets we bought tickets at the gate here they are all right but you need separate tickets here i declare thats a swindle said mrs bickford i thought we could see the whole show on these we only charge ten cents extra for this its a shame shall we go in aaron i guess we will i want to see that ere fat woman id like to see the dwarf and the woman with hair five feet long a circus is dreadful expensive but bein as were here we might as well see the whole thing twenty cents was paid at the door and the economical pair grown suddenly so extravagant walked in the first object on which the blacksmiths eyes rested kindled him with indignation and recalled mortifying memories it was achilles henderson the giant who on his side recognized aaron bickford good evening my friend he said with a smile i believe we have met before do you know him asked mrs bickford in surprise aarons brow contracted as he answered its the ruffian that threw me over the fence this morning i see you remember me said achilles goodnaturedly i ought to remember you retorted the blacksmith come dont bear malice it was only a little joke i dont like such jokes well well ill give you satisfaction ill let you throw me over the fence any time you want to and i wont make a particle of resistance somehow this proposal did not strike the blacksmith as satisfactory he asked abruptly wheres the boy there were two boys i mean the stout broadshouldered boy i dont know just where he is at present do you know why ive come here this evening to see the show i expect ive come to get that boy ive no doubt hes somewhere about here oho thought the giant i must put my young friend on his guard if youll help me ill do as much for you some time so you are going to carry him back with you went on achilles desirous of learning the extent of kits danger yes i am you say he is your apprentice of course he is and youve got the papers to show for it i dont need no papers ive got his uncles consent i think my friend youre not familiar with the law thought achilles kit wont go with you tonight but it was nearly time for the performance mr and mrs bickford left the smaller tent and entering the big one took their seats they watched the performance with great wonder and enjoyment till the entrance of kit and the vincenti brothers they did not immediately discover him but when he stood on the shoulders of alonzo vincenti who in turn stood on the shoulders of antonio and the threestoried acrobat walked round the ring mrs bickford recognized kit and pointing with her parasol to the young acrobat as she half raised herself from her seat she exclaimed in a shrill voice look aaron theres your boy all rigged out in circus clothes well that beats all ejaculated the blacksmith gazing with wide open mouth at kit just then kit reversing his attitude raised his feet in the air and was borne round the ring amid the plaudits of the spectators how do you think he does it asked mrs bickford in astonishment i give it up said the blacksmith hes a smart critter do you think they pay him i reckon he gets two or three dollars a week but he haint no business to hire out to the circus folks hes going back with us tonight and ill turn him out a blacksmith in two years when kit had finished his act he went to the dressing room and changed his clothes i wonder whether the old fellow is after me he thought what could have put it into his head that i was here as he emerged from the dressing room he met mr barlow the proprietor of the circus who advanced towards him and shook his hand cordially bravo my young friend he said you did yourself great credit are you sure you have never performed in a circus before quite sure sir you went through your act like an old professional you did as well as either of the other two thank you sir i am glad you are satisfied i ought to be i regard you as a decided acquisition to my show keep on doing your best and i can assure you that your efforts will be appreciated how much did i agree to pay you ten dollars a week sir that isnt enough i raise your salary at once to twentyfive kit was dazzled by his good fortune what twentyfive dollars a week and traveling expenses for a boy of sixteen it seemed marvelous i am afraid i am dreaming mr barlow he said i cant believe that i am really to receive so handsome a salary you will realize it tonight when you collect your first weeks pay but this wont be a full week sir never mind you shall receive full pay do you think i forget your heroic act at smyrna thank you sir i hope nothing will prevent my continuing in your employ what should prevent asked mr barlow quickly have you had an offer from another show no sir i am not well known enough for that but i saw a man in the audience who would probably like to get me away who is it a blacksmith from oakford i dont understand what have you to do with a blacksmith kit explained briefly when do you think he will try to recover possession of you asked the circus proprietor just after the show is over has he any papers not one then he has no claim on you if he makes any trouble let me know i will mr barlow chapter xvii kits stratagem kit when dressed sought the part of the house where he knew that william morris was seated how did i do will he asked splendidly answered the boy enthusiastically i felt proud of you i think i have a right to be satisfied myself i have had my pay raised you dont mean to say you are to get more than ten dollars said his friend opening his eyes in amazement i am raised to twentyfive you dont mean to say you are to get twentyfive dollars a week kit yes i do and your board and my board and traveling expenses added kit with a smile i wish i were in your shoes kit said william think of me with only one dollar a week would you be willing to go through my acts for the money i am going to receive william shook his head i couldnt do it kit he replied it always makes me dizzy when i have my head down i dont believe i could ever do anything in a circus well william i wont forget you if i save money as i am sure to do ill see if i cant do something for you by and by by the way did you see mr and mrs bickford no you dont mean to say they are here look over there william followed the direction of kits finger and he easily discovered the blacksmith and his wife by gracious youre right he said its the first money ive known old bickford to pay for any amusement for years they came after me william you wont go back with them not much i dont care to give up twentyfive dollars a week for the privilege of learning the trade of a blacksmith suppose they try to carry you off that gives me an idea with your help ill try to play a trick on them itll be capital fun go ahead and tell me what it is kit im with you my plan is that you should ride home with mr bickford said kit i dont understand said william looking puzzled ill tell you my idea bickford has come here with the intention of taking me back with him to oakford but you dont mean to go of course not but when the show is over i shall put myself in his way and after a little objection agree to go i will ask for five minutes to get ready in that time i will change hats with you and as it is dark you can easily pass yourself off for me capital exclaimed william laughing wont the old man look foolish when he finds out who is with him dont let him know till you arrive or he would force you to leave the carriage and walk home alone and a six mile walk is no joke all right kit i understand and i think i can carry out your idea i havent much love for the old man or his wife either and i am glad of a chance to get even with them the performance continued till ten oclock the blacksmith and his wife enjoyed it beyond their anticipations amusements of any kind were new to them and their pleasure was like that of children i begin to think sarah we shall get our moneys worth said aaron cautiously as the entertainment neared its end this is a great show so it is aaron i dont begrudge the money myself though fifty cents is a pretty high price to pay then besides youll have a chance to carry the boy home thats so sarah just as soon as the show is over foller me and well try to find him at length the last act was ended and the crowd of spectators began pouring from the tent mr bickford hurriedly emerged from the audience and began to look around for kit he had but little trouble in finding him for the boy purposely put himself in his way aaron bickford strode up to him well ive caught you at last he said putting his hand on the boys shoulder what do you want of me mr bickford said kit what do i want of you well i want you to go home with me of course wont you let me stay with the circus a week asked kit in a subdued tone no i wont ive got the wagon here and im goin to take you back with me tonight if you really think my uncle wishes it perhaps i had better go said kit in what appeared to be a wavering tone mr bickford was quite elated he feared he should have trouble in persuading kit to accompany him he would not have been surprised if the boy had disappeared and given him trouble to find him and his unexpected submissiveness was an agreeable surprise well boy its time to be goin oakfords six miles off and we wont get home before midnight unless we start right off ill go and get my things mr bickford where is your horse and wagon out by the entrance its hitched to a tree all right you go and unhitch the horse and ill be right along but suppose you give me the slip youd better go along now ill bring him with me mr bickford said the giant im sorry he isnt going to stay with us and ill see him off achilles henderson spoke in so straightforward a manner that mr bickford was deceived very well he said ill go along with mrs bickford dont keep me waitin for its gettin late the blacksmith and his wife took up their march to the place where their team had been hitched they found it safe and untied the horse were goin to have a dark ride home mother he said yes aaron but youve done a good evenings work thats so sarah i expected id have more trouble with the boy theres nothing like being firm aaron when he saw you were in earnest he gave up i mean to keep a tight rein on him sarah hes a boy that likes to have his own way if i aint greatly mistaken we must break his will the horse was unhitched and still kit had not arrived mr bickford began to fear that he had been tricked after all when two figures contrasting strongly with each other appeared one was the giant in his ample height and the other was a boy there they are aaron said mrs bickford who was the first to descry the oddly assorted pair where is the boy to sit asked achilles in the back seat mother and i will sit in front all right there you are said mr henderson lifting the boy in his arms as easily as if he were a kitten and putting him on the rear seat goodby kit he said im sorry youre going to leave us perhaps mr bickford will let you off if we show anywhere near here the boy will be at work and cant be let off said the blacksmith stiffly but it is time we were off goodby then kit goodby said the supposed kit in a low tone for he feared that the difference in his voice would be recognized but mr bickford had no suspicions he was anxious to get started for he and his wife were always in bed by this time ordinarily so the team started and achilles henderson suppressing a laugh strode away to the circus cars which were already being prepared for a midnight journey to the next place it may be explained here that the circus of today generally owns its own cars which are used for the conveyance of all connected with it their luggage the tents the animals and all the paraphernalia of the show as soon as the show is ended the canvas men set to work to take down and fold up the tents all the freight is conveyed to the cars and the razorbacks already referred to set about loading them the performers ticketmen and candy butchers seek their berths in the sleeping cars and are often in the land of dreams before the train starts while mr bickford was driving in the darkness to oakford with the supposed kit on the back seat the real kit was in his berth in the circus cars preparing for a refreshing nights rest chapter xviii mr bickfords mortifying discovery mr bickford was in excellent spirits he had enjoyed the evening and although he had been compelled to disburse a dollar for two circus tickets a sum which to him seemed large he was disposed to acknowledge that he had received his moneys worth besides and this seemed to him the greatest triumph of all he had recovered his runaway apprentice or thought he had he inwardly resolved that kit should smart for his past insubordination though he had not yet decided in what way he would get even with him the unexpected submissiveness shown by kit elated him and confirmed him in the idea he had long entertained that he could manage boys a good deal better than the average of men talk about hard cases he said one day to his wife id like to see the boy that can get the start of aaron bickford hell have to get up unusually airly in the mornin mr bickford felt a little like crowing over his captive and turned his head partly round to survey the boy on the back seat fortunately for william the darkness was so great that there was small chance of his detecting the imposture i reckon you didnt expect to be ridin back to oakford along of me this evenin he observed no sir muttered william in a voice scarcely audible ho ho you feel kind of grouty eh said the blacksmith well i aint much surprised you thought you could have your own way with aaron bickford but youre beginnin to see your mistake i reckon yes sir replied the supposed kit in a meek voice ho ho thats the way boys ginerally come out when they try to buck agin their elders not but you might have succeeded with some men but you didnt know the man you had to deal with this time there was a sort of gurgle for william was trying hard not to laugh as he was picturing to himself the rage and mortification of mr bickford when he discovered the deceit that had been practiced upon him but the blacksmith misunderstood the sound and thought kit was sobbing you neednt take on he said magnanimously it aint so bad as it might be youll be a good deal better off learnin a good trade than trampin round the country with the circus i hope thisll be a lesson to you youd better not try to run away agin for it wont be no use you wont always have that longlegged giant to help you if id done right i should have had him took up for sault and battery he neednt think because hes eight feet high more or less that he can defy the laws of the land i reckon he got a little skeered of what he done or he wouldnt have acted so different this evening william did not reply to this he was rather in hopes mr bickford would stop addressing him for he did not like to run the risk of answering as it might open the eyes of the blacksmith to the fact that he had the wrong boy in the wagon the distance to oakford steadily diminished though mr bickfords horse was a slow one at length it had dwindled to half a mile now i dont care if he does find out who i am thought william it aint but a little way home now and i shouldnt mind walking still his own house was rather beyond mr bickfords and it was just as well to ride the whole way if he could escape detection so long where did you learn them circus performances christopher suddenly asked the blacksmith turning once more in his seat by this time they were within a few rods of the blacksmiths yard and william became bold now that he had nothing to lose by it my name isnt christopher he answered in his usual tone your name isnt christopher thats what your uncle told me i think you are mistaken said william quietly whats got into the boy is he goin to deny his own name what is your name then my name is william morris was the distinct response what exclaimed the blacksmith in amazement i think you ought to know me mr bickford i worked for you some time you know take off your hat and let me look at your face said aaron bickford sternly william laughed as he complied with the request it was now rather lighter and the blacksmith peering into his face saw that it was indeed true that the boy on the back seat was not kit watson at all but his exapprentice william morris its bill morris by the living jingo he exclaimed what do you say to that sarah youre a master hand at managing boys aaron said his wife sarcastically how came you in the wagon bill morris demanded bickford not caring to answer his wife the giant put me in answered william where is that boy christopher watson i expect he is travelin with the show mr bickford who put you up to this mean trick demanded the blacksmith wrathfully kit watson ive got an account to settle with you william morris i spose you think youve done something pretty smart i think he has aaron said mrs bickford who seemed to take a malicious pleasure in opening her husbands wounds afresh mrs bickford it isnt very creditable in you to triumph over your husband just after hes been spendin fifty cents for your amusement goodness knows mr bickford you dont often take me to shows i guess what you spend that way wont ruin you while the married pair were indulging in their little recriminations william had managed to slip out of the wagon in the rear and he was now a rod away good night mr bickford he shouted im much obliged to you for bringing me home its saved me a long walk the blacksmiths reply was one that i do not care to record he was thoroughly angry and disgusted if it hadnt been so late he would have got out and tried to inflict punishment on william with his whip but the boy was too far away by this time to make this possible chapter xix stephen watson visits oakford on monday as mr bickford was about his work a carriage drove into the yard containing stephen watson and ralph good morning mr bickford said stephen watson ive called over to inquire about kit i hope he is doing his duty by you the blacksmith looked at mr watson with embarrassment and did not immediately reply mr watson repeated his question kit isnt with me answered bickford at length isnt with you repeated stephen watson in surprise where is he hes run away run away ejaculated kits uncle what is the meaning of that he said he didnt want to be a blacksmith and that you had no authority to make him but where has he gone have you any idea he has gone off with barlows circus but what object can he have in going off with a circus asked mr watson no less bewildered theyve hired him to perform are you sure of this i ought to be answered the blacksmith grimly my wife and i saw him jumpin round last evenin in the circus tent over at grafton but i dont see what he a green hand can do ralph can you throw any light on this mystery ralph explained that kit had practiced acrobatic feats extensively at the gymnasium connected with the school did he ever talk of going off with a circus asked mr watson never though he enjoyed the exercise i went after him and tried to get him back said mr bickford but he gave me the slip hes done a very foolish and crazy thing he cant get more than three or four dollars a week from the circus and in the fall hell be out of a job just as you say sir hed have a good payin trade if he stayed with me what do you think it is best to do about it mr watson i shall do nothing if the boy chooses to make a fool of himself he may try it next fall and possibly before hell be coming back in rags and beg me to take him back i hope you wont take him back said ralph who was jealous of kit i shall not consider myself bound to do so but if he consents to obey me and learn a trade of mr bickford i will fit him up and enable him to do so out of charity and because he is my nephew then you dont mean to do anything about it sir asked aaron bickford considerably disappointed for he longed to get kit into his power once more no i will leave the boy to himself ralph as our business seems to be over we will turn about and go home mr watson drove out of the blacksmiths yard well ralph he said as they were on their way home i am very much annoyed at what your cousin has done but i dont see that i am to blame of course youre not pa returned ralph promptly still the public may misjudge me it will be very awkward to answer questions about kit i really dont know what to say say hes run away and joined the circus we might as well tell the truth i dont know but it will be best i will add that though it grieves me i think it advisable as he is so old not to interfere with him but let him see the error of his way for himself i will say also that when he chooses to come back i will make suitable arrangements for him i guess that will do i will say the same i dont mind saying to you that i shall feel it quite a relief to be rid of the expense of maintaining him for he has cost me a great deal of money you are my son and of course i expect to take care of you and bring you up as a gentleman but he has no claim upon me except that of relationship i wont say that to others however you are quite right pa as he is poor and has his own living to make it isnt best to send him to a highpriced school and give him too much money to spend it will be seen that there was a striking resemblance between the views of father and son both of whom were intensely selfish mean and unscrupulous stephen watson foresaw that there would be a difficulty in making outside friends of the family understand why kit had left home he deliberately resolved to misrepresent him and the opportunity came sooner than he anticipated on the afternoon of the day of his call upon the blacksmith there was a ring at the bell and a middleaged stranger was ushered into the parlor i suppose you dont remember me he said to stephen watson i cant say i do replied stephen eying him i knew your brother better than i did you i am harry miller who used to go to school with you both in the old red schoolhouse on the hill i remember your name but i should not have remembered you i dont wonder time changes us all i am sorry to hear that your poor brother is dead yes answered stephen heaving a sigh proper to the occasion which was intended to signify his grief at the loss he was cut down like the grass of the field it is the common lot his wife died earlier did she not yes but there was a son yes how old is the boy just turned sixteen may i see him i should like to see the son of my old deskmate ah sighed stephen i wish he were here to meet you but surely he is not dead no he is not dead but he is a source of anxiety to me and why asked the visitor with concern has he turned out badly why i dont know that i can exactly say that he has turned out badly what is the matter with him then he is wayward and instead of being willing to devote himself to his school studies like my son ralph he has formed an extraordinary taste for the circus indeed but where is he he is traveling with barlows circus in what capacity as an acrobat henry miller laughed i remember he said that his father was fond of athletic sports you never were no i was a quiet boy that you were and uncommonly sly thought miller but he did not consider it polite to say so is the boy by the way what is his name christopher he is generally called kit well is kit a good gymnast i believe he is when did he join the circus only yesterday in fact it is painful for me to say so he ran away from a good home to associate with mountebanks and what are you going to do about it he is so headstrong that i have thought it best to give him his own way and let him see for himself how foolish he has been of course he has a home to return to whenever he sees fit that may be the best way i should like to see the young rascal i would follow up the circus and do so only i am unfortunately called to california on business i am part owner of a gold mine out there i trust you have been prospered in your worldly affairs yes i have every reason to be thankful i suppose i am worth two hundred thousand dollars stephen watson whose god was money almost turned green with jealousy at the same time he asked himself how he could take advantage of his old schoolmates good luck i wish he would take a fancy to my ralph he thought so he called in ralph and introduced him to the rich stranger hes a good boy my ralph he said sober and correct in all his habits and fond of study ralph was rather surprised to hear this panegyric but presently his father explained to him in private the object he had in view then ralph made himself as agreeable as he could but he failed to please mr miller he is too much like his father he said to himself when he terminated his call he received a very cordial invitation to come again on his return from california if kit has returned i certainly will come he replied an answer which pleased neither ralph nor his father chapter xx a chat with a candy butcher kit had a berth assigned him in one of the circus cars his nearest neighbor was harry thorne a young man of twentyfour who filled the position of candy butcher as this term may sound strange to my readers i will explain that it is applied to the venders of candy lemonade peanuts and other articles such as are patronized by those who come to see the show it is really a very profitable business as will be explained in the course of the story harry thorne was social and ready to give kit any information about the circus how long is it since you joined a circus asked kit after getting acquainted i was younger than you answered thorne why did you join what gave you the idea a spirit of adventure i think besides there was a large family of us i am the oldest and it was necessary for me to do something thats a queer name candy butcher it seems so to you but i am used to it did you become a candy butcher at once not till i was eighteen before that i ran errands and made myself generally useful i thought of being an acrobat like you but i was too stout and not active enough i shouldnt think there would be much money made in your business said kit that shows you dont know much about circus matters last fall i ran in with seven hundred dollars saved besides paying all my expenses during the six months i was out you ought to be pretty well off now if you have been a candy butcher for five or six years i havent a cent and am owing two hundred dollars in philadelphia how is that you dont often find a circus man that saves money its easy come easy go but i send money home every season three or four hundred dollars at least if i do well thats a good thing any way but if i were in your place i would put away some money every season i could do it but its hard to make up my mind i cant see how you can make such sums it puzzles me we are paid a fixed salary say twentyfive dollars a month and commission on sales i was always pretty lucky in selling and my income has sometimes been very large but i dont make much in large places it is in the smaller towns that the money is made when a country beau brings his girl to the circus he dont mind expense he makes up his mind to spend several dollars in having a good time so he buys lemonade peanuts apples and everything that he or his girl fancies in the city where there are plenty of places where such things can be bought we dont sell much in new york or philadelphia i make very little more than my salary what is there most profit on asked kit well i should say lemonade youve heard of circus lemonade is there anything peculiar about it yes something peculiarly weak a goodsized lemon will make half a dozen glasses and perhaps more but there is something cheaper still and that is citric acid i remember one hot day in an ohio town the thermometer stood at degrees and there wasnt a drop of spring or well water to be had for we had cornered it all who were thirsty had to drink lemonade and it took a good many glasses to quench thirst i made a harvest that day and so did the other candy butchers if we could have a whole summer of such days i could retire on a small fortune in october do you like the circus business sometimes i get tired of it but when the spring opens i generally have the circus fever what do you do in the winter it is seldom i get anything to do i am an expense and that is why i find myself in debt when the new season opens last winter i was more lucky a young fellow an old circus acquaintance of mine has a store in the country and he offered to supply me with a stock of goods to sell on commission in country villages near by in that way i filled up about three months making my expenses but doing nothing more however that was a great thing for me and i start this season only two hundred dollars in debt as i think i told you a few minutes ago is it the same way with performers no they have a better chance next winter if you try you can probably make an engagement to perform at some dime museum or variety hall in new york or elsewhere i once got the position of ticket seller for a part of the winter i dont think i should like to perform in a dime museum said kit whats the odds if you are well paid for it i dont intend to make my present business a permanent one thats different what will you do next fall i may go to school harry thorne whistled that will be a novelty he said i havent been to school since i was twelve years old wouldnt you like to go now no im too old are you much of a scholar im a pretty good latin scholar and know something of greek ill bet there isnt another acrobat in the country that can say that what salary do you get if you dont mind telling twentyfive dollars a week youre in luck how came barlow to give you so much i think he took a liking to me perhaps he wanted to pay me for facing the lion at smyrna were you the boy who did that i thought your face looked familiar youve got pluck kit i hope so but im not sure whether it is i or the snuff that is entitled to the most credit anyhow it took some courage even if you did have the snuff with you do you know what is to be our route this season i think we are going west as far as st louis taking all the larger towns and cities on our way we are to show a week in chicago but i dont care so much for the cities as the country towns the onenight places does mr barlow go with us not steadily he drops in on us here and there theres one thing i can say for him he wont have any man in his employ drink or gamble we have to bind ourselves to total abstinence while we are in his employ that is till the end of the season gambling is the great vice of circus men it is more prevalent even than drinking dont the men do it on the sly they run a risk if they do at the first offense they are fined at the second or third they are bounced that doesnt trouble me any i neither drink nor gamble good for you say when are you two fellows goin to stop talkin was heard from a neighboring berth you dont give a fellow a chance to sleep kit and his new friend took the hint and addressed themselves to slumber chapter xxi kit meets a schoolmate kit slept profoundly being very tired he was taken by surprise when the next morning he was shaken into a state of wakefulness and opening his eyes met those of his neighbor harry thorne is it morning he asked in a sleepy tone i should say it was it is a quarter after nine and the parade starts at ten the parade yes we give a morning parade in every place we visit if you are not on hand to take part in it you will be fined five dollars ill be up in a jiffy said kit springing out of his berth but theres time enough isnt there yes but not too much you will want to get some breakfast by the way are you used to driving oh yes i have done a good deal of it answered kit i thought so as you are a country boy how would you like to drive a span of horses attached to one of the small chariots kit was extremely fond of a horse and he answered promptly ill do it there are two the other is driven by charlie davis once a performer but now a ticket man he is a little older than you all right i dont see how i came to sleep so late you and charlie are good matches once he went to bed saturday night and did not wake up till monday morning that beats my record kit was dressed in less than ten minutes where shall i get breakfast he asked the regular breakfast is over and you will have to buy some there is a restaurant just opposite the lot you might get in with one of the cooks and get something in the cook tent no ill go to the restaurant tomorrow ill be on hand at the regular breakfast the restaurant was a small one with no pretensions to style but kit was hungry and not particular at the same table there was a dark complexioned boy of about his own size who had just begun to dispatch a beefsteak he looked up as kit seated himself youre the new acrobat are you not asked the other yes are you charlie davis yes how do you know me harry thorne was speaking of you i see youre one of the late birds as well as i i generally have to buy my breakfast outside how do you like circus life i havent tried it well enough to tell this is only my second day i went into it at fourteen ive been an acrobat too but i have a weak ankle and have gone into the ticket department are you going to remain in the circus permanently no im trying to wean myself from it a friend has promised to set me up in business whenever i get ready to retire if i kept on i would be no better off at forty than i am now yet circus people make a good deal of money i hear right you are my boy but they dont keep it they get spoiled for anything else and soon or later they are left out in the cold ive had a good deal of fun out of it for i like traveling but im going to give it up i took it up because i had nothing else to do but i shant stay in it long ill tell you about it some day i hear you drive one of the pony chariots yes i am to drive the other good dont let them run away with you my boy ill try not to said kit smiling is there any danger not much theyre trained are you fond of horses i like nothing better so it is with me ill wait till you are through breakfast and then well go over together half an hour later kit sat on the box of a chariot drawn by two beautiful ponies the circus line had been formed and the parade began behind him was a circus wagon or rather a cage on wheels through the gratings of which could be seen a tiger crafty and cruel looking in front was an elephant with two or three performers on his back kit was dressed in street costume his circus dress not being required in another part of the procession was charlie davis driving a corresponding wagon kit felt a peculiar exhilaration as he drove his ponies and reflected upon the strangeness of his position as compared with his previous experiences he had from time to time watched circus processions but not in his wildest and most improbable dreams had it ever occurred to him to imagine that he would ever himself take part in one as he looked down from his perch he saw the streets lined with the usual curious crowd of spectators among whom boys were largely represented i suppose some of them are envying me he thought to himself with a smile suppose there was some one who recognized me no sooner had the thought come into his mind than he heard his own name called in a voice indicating amazement kit watson by all thats wonderful were the words that fell on his ears looking to the right his glance fell upon jack dormer a schoolmate who had been attending the same academy with him for a year past kit colored feeling a little embarrassed how are you jack he said how came you in this circus procession kit i cant tell you now come round to the lot after the parade is over and ill tell you all about it jack availed himself of the invitation and presented himself at the circus grounds what does it all mean kit he asked have you really and truly joined the circus come round this afternoon and youll see me perform i am one of the vincenti brothers acrobats but what put it in your head thats what i want to know i thought i would like it better than being a blacksmith but who ever dreamed of your being a blacksmith my uncle did ill tell you all about it kit told his story jack dormer listened with sympathetic interest do they pay you well he asked i get twentyfive dollars a week and all expenses can you get me a job asked jack quite overcome by the magnificence of the salary as an acrobat jack asked kit laughing for jack had the reputation of being one of the clumsiest boys in school well no i dont suppose i could do much in that way but isnt there something i could do take my advice jack and give it up youve got a good home and there is no need of your going into any such business even if you were qualified dont you like it i cant tell yet of course it is exciting but those who have been in it a good while advise against it i may not stay in it more than one season shall i tell the fellows at school where you are no i would rather you wouldnt does your cousin ralph come back to school yes we could spare him a good deal better than you i am not fond of ralph myself but the world is wide enough for us both kit saw his schoolmate again after the afternoon performance and received many compliments i couldnt believe it was you he said you acted as if you were an old hand at the business chapter xxii new acquaintances sunday was of course a day of rest for the circus employees most of them observed it by lying in bed unusually late kit however rose in good season and found himself first at breakfast when the proper time arrived he walked to the village and selecting the first church he came to entered he had always been in the habit of attending church and felt that there was no good reason why he should give up the practice now that he was away from home he stood in the lobby waiting for the sexton to appear when a finelooking man of middle age entered the church with a young girl of fourteen at his side he glanced at kit with interest and after a moments pause walked up to him are you a stranger here he asked yes sir answered kit i shall be glad to have you accept a seat in my pew thank you sir said kit politely i was waiting for the sexton intending to ask him for a seat i have plenty of room in my pew having only my daughter with me are you staying long in the town only as long as the circus does answered kit the gentleman looked surprised are you connected with the circus he asked quickly yes sir by this time the young girl was examining kit with interest and attention is it possible you are a performer yes sir i wouldnt have dreamed it you look like a young gentleman i hope i am sir pardon me i meant no offense but you dont at all answer my idea of a circus performer i have only been two days with the circus said kit and that may account for my not having a circus look it is time to take our seats i will speak with you afterwards first however let me introduce my daughter evelyn grant i am glad to make your acquaintance miss evelyn said kit removing his hat my name is christopher watson evelyn offered her hand with a smile i had no idea circus young men were so polite she said there was no chance for any further conversation as they had entered the church mr grants pew was in a prominent position he drew back to let the two young people enter they seated themselves at the lower end of the pew and mr grant took his seat at the head kit noticed that several persons in neighboring pews regarded him with apparent curiosity kit enjoyed the services which were of an interesting character he had expected to feel like a stranger but thanks to the kindness of mr grant he felt quite as much at home as when he sat in his uncles pew at smyrna when the services were over they filed slowly out of church a new surprise was in store for kit if you have no engagement we shall be glad to have you dine with us master watson said mr grant you will come wont you said evelyn with a smile you are very kind said kit in grateful surprise nothing could be more agreeable to me just then a gentleman approached mr grant and said i am glad to see you looking so well mr mayor is your father the mayor of the city asked kit yes he was elected last december i am very fortunate to be invited to dinner by the mayor and by the mayors daughter dont forget that you may be sure i appreciate that too how funny it seems to me to be walking with a circus performer what do you do you dont stand upon a horses back and jump through hoops do you no i cant do that but what do you do i am an acrobat kit explained to her what he did it must be very hard oh no i learned to do it in a gymnasium before i ever dreamed of being connected with a circus where was the gymnasium attached to dr codmans academy why i had a cousin who attended there said evelyn in surprise what was his name edward moore i know him very well he is a nice fellow at this moment kit in looking around was surprised to see the familiar face and figure of mr barlow the circus proprietor who had evidently like himself been attending the service recognition was mutual i am glad to see you here watson said mr barlow offering his hand i always attend church myself when i have an opportunity but i am afraid few in my employ follow my example i always feel more confidence in any young man who seems to enjoy a church service mr barlow was a man whose name was widely known and kit saw that mr grant looked as if he would like to be introduced mr barlow he said allow me to introduce a new friend mr grant the mayor of the town i am pleased to make your acquaintance mr mayor said the showman offering his hand the pleasure is mutual sir said the mayor i need not say that your name has long been familiar to me i am glad you have taken one of my young men under your wing he is a recent acquisition but i have reason to think well of him he is to dine with us today i shall be glad to extend an invitation to you also mr barlow you are very kind and but for a previous engagement i would accept with pleasure i shall be glad to see you at my show tomorrow with complimentary tickets what a nice old gentleman mr barlow is said evelyn in a low voice i have found him an excellent friend he wont allow any of us to drink or gamble while we are in his employ i hope you wouldnt want to do either mr watson i have no disposition to do so but miss evelyn i want to ask you a favor what is it if it isnt anything very great i may grant it dont call me mr watson what shall i call you then my friends call me kit thats a nice name yes ill call you kit it will be seen that the two young people were getting on famously do you live far away miss evelyn about a quarter of a mile from here in turning the corner of a street kit met his friend harry thorne walking with charlie davis both regarded kit with surprise kit seems to be getting on said charlie do you know who he is walking with no do you with the daughter of the mayor how do you know the gentleman in front was pointed out to me as the mayor i shouldnt wonder if he were going to dine there when kit returned to the circus tents about four oclock in the afternoon he met with some goodnatured raillery which he took in good part he felt that he had passed the day in a much more satisfactory manner than if like the great majority of his companions he had risen late and lounged about the circus grounds beguiling the time with smoking and story telling chapter xxiii kits daring act kits acts thus far had been confined to the ring but now a new one was expected from him early in the performance a series of flying leaps from a springboard in which all the acrobats took part was introduced from a point thirty feet back the performer ran swiftly till he reached the springboard from which a leap was made accompanied by a somersault carrying him over a considerable space in advance it was the custom to place first one elephant then a second and finally a third in front of the springboard there was only one man who could leap over three elephants the two vincenti brothers took part regularly but kit being a new hand had thus far been excused but one of the regular performers being temporarily unwell it was considered desirable that his place should be supplied do you think you can do it asked alonzo vincenti somewhat doubtfully yes answered kit confidently it will be sufficient if you jump over one elephant continued his associate then you can drop out i can do better than that said kit i dont know about that my brother can only jump over two you jump over three elephants yes but i am the only one who can do it it takes a good spring to clear even two it wont do to lose your head can i have a chance to rehearse yes i will speak about it then i will appear this evening but if you fail you are likely to hurt yourself i know that that is why i would rather make the first trial in the evening the lights and the crowd will excite and help me kit was not foolhardy in his undertaking for he had already had some practice in similar feats with his old teacher besides he was ambitious in school his ambition had shown itself in his attempt to eclipse his schoolfellows in scholarship in the gymnasium he had ranked first and now that he had joined the circus he didnt like to be assigned to a place in the rear let me take the opportunity here to advise my young readers not to imitate kit in essaying dangerous parts be bold but not too bold is a very good motto during the forenoon kit found an opportunity to practice in the empty tent in order to settle the question whether he had lost any of his oldtime skill the result was satisfactory and renewed his confidence i can do better before a tent full of spectators than when practicing by myself he decided the evening came standing near the ticket seller half an hour before the show began kit heard his name called turning quickly he saw his friends of the previous day mayor grant and his daughter evelyn good evening my boy said the mayor cordially we have come to see what you can do then i hope i shall do myself credit said kit shaking hands with the mayor and his daughter have you engaged seats not yet then let me select them for you with pleasure i am glad to have a friend at court kit selected seats as near as possible to the ring where he was to perform these are splendid seats said evelyn how soon do you appear in a few minutes i shall have to leave you now but i will be back after my first act what a nice boy he is papa said evelyn yes it is a pity he is attached to a circus why isnt it a respectable business yes but there are many temptations connected with it and most circus performers never rise any higher evelyn was not inclined to discuss the question though there is no doubt that she took a more favorable view of the circus profession than her father the procession had just begun to move round the inner ring of the circus including the elephants the riders the clowns and performers of all kinds kit appeared as in the public procession driving a span of ponies this was the introduction then the various parts of the programme succeeded soon kit performed his act in the ring he had a new act tonight standing on the shoulders of one of the vincenti brothers he turned a somersault and landed on the shoulders of the other standing six to eight feet away i dont see how he does it papa said evelyn he must be very smart i see you are determined to make a hero of this young man evelyn dont you admire him yourself papa admire is rather a strong word daughter i will admit however that i like him and hope he will soon change his business after the act was over kit came round and received congratulations evelyn repeated what her father said i agree with you sir said kit i havent selected this as my life business but shall keep my engagement till the end of the season how on the whole do you like your new associates i dont need to be told that they are very different from those to whom you are accustomed they are very kind to me and generous to each other when there is need they will divide their last dollar with a friend they often come to their last dollar dont they yes they cant keep money they are always in debt when the new season opens no matter how much they brought home with them at the end of the last are there no exceptions yes a few i have heard of one circus manager who commenced as a candy butcher and now is proprietor of a very fairsized show of course he had to save up money or he would never have succeeded so well kit had to cut short his visit for the new act already referred to was near at hand in the list of leapers kit came last first of all there was a simple somersault from the springboard this was easy just after kit came the clown who though really a clever acrobat stopped short when he came to the board and merely jumped up and down to the amusement of the young spectators he cant jump no moren i can said one small boy contemptuously i shouldnt think theyd let him try said another both boys were surprised when in the next trial where the task was to jump over an elephant the despised clown made a good spring and landed fairly on his feet i guess he was afraid before said the first boy no he only pretended for fun do you see that boy i wonder if he can jump over the elephant the question was soon answered kit took his turn and sprang with apparent ease over the great beast next another elephant was driven in alongside of the first again the leapers advanced to try their skill but two held back not feeling competent for the task the clown once more made a feint of jumping but only jumped up and retired apparently filled with confusion evelyn gazed in intense excitement it must be awfully hard to jump like that papa she said i dont think i shall ever try it evelyn another elephant was driven alongside the other two making three in all the other contestants retired for only alonzo had succeeded hitherto in executing this difficult feat he expected to be the only one now but noticed with surprise that kit seemed ready to follow him you dont mean to try it kit he said in amazement why not you will fail and if you do you may hurt yourself seriously i shall not fail said kit confidently alonzo looked anxious but there was no time to expostulate he ran swiftly to the board made a vigorous spring and landed handsomely on the bedding which had been provided beyond he had scarcely stepped aside when to the astonishment of the other acrobats kit gathered himself up ran to the springboard and exerting himself to the utmost made his leap and landed a foot ahead of alonzo then the tent rang with applause and there were many exclamations of astonishment not only among the spectators but also among the circus performers kits face flushed with pleasure and bowing his acknowledgments he withdrew he is certainly a wonderful boy said the mayor chapter xxiv kit receives a letter kit received compliments enough to spoil him if he had not been strongminded and levelheaded boy among others mr barlow who had been present and witnessed his daring act took the opportunity to congratulate him you seem to be born for a circus performer my young friend he said you have come to the front at once thank you sir said kit i am glad that i succeeded but such success as that does not satisfy my ambition you mean perhaps that you want to jump over four perhaps five elephants suggested the manager kit smiled no he answered i dont think i shall venture beyond three but i dont expect to remain in the circus more than this season that is almost a pity when you are so well qualified to excel in it mr barlow said kit seriously if i were a great manager like you i would not mind but i dont care to go through life as a circus performer i dont know but you are right my boy in fact i know you are i shouldnt care to be a performer myself i dont think you would excel in that line said kit with a glance at the portly form of the wellknown showman you wouldnt advise me to try jumping over elephants i infer said mr barlow with an amused smile no sir i will take your advice my boy though your share of worldly experience isnt great you are certainly correct in that i shall relieve the fears of mrs barlow at once by telling her that i have decided not to enter the ring kit also received the congratulations of the mayor and evelyn but the former added though your act was a daring one i was almost sorry to see it why sir i feared it would confirm you in your love of your present business no sir there is no danger replied kit i have a fair education already and prefer to qualify myself for something different i am glad to hear you say so you are undoubtedly right i must say goodby now said kit for we get off at midnight shall you not return this way no sir we are to go west i hear i hope when the season is over you will make us a visit come and stay a week said the mayor hospitably do come said evelyn earnestly how can i thank you for your kindness to a stranger said kit gratefully i shall certainly avail myself of your hospitality there are not many who would take such notice of a circus boy you are something more than a circus boy said the mayor or i might not have been so drawn to you goodby then and if you ever need a friend dont forget that you are at liberty to call upon me it was a source of regret to kit that he was obliged to part with friends whom in so short a time he had come to value so highly he resolved that he would accept the mayors offer at the close of the season he would need a friend and adviser and he felt confident that mayor grants counsel would be wise and judicious kit was already asleep in his bunk when the circus train started for the next place on the route when he woke up he was in the town of colebrook here a surprise was in store for him in the shape of a letter from his uncle when he saw the familiar handwriting and the postmark smyrna he broke the seal with a feeling of curiosity he did not expect to derive either pleasure or satisfaction from the perusal we will look over his shoulder while he is reading the letter nephew christopher i cannot express to you my surprise and disappointment when i rode over to oakford to see you and learned from mr bickford that you had run away from his house and joined the circus there must be something low and depraved in your tastes that you should thus abandon the prospect of earning a respectable livelihood and go tramping through the country with a circus what do you think your father would say if he could come to life and become aware of the course you have so rashly taken i should be justified in forcibly removing you from your present associations and returning you to your worthy employer mr aaron bickford and perhaps it is my duty to do so but i think it wiser for you to realize for yourself the folly of your course you have deliberately deserted a good home and a kind guardian and become a tramp if i may so express myself i cannot imagine my son ralph doing such a thing he is i hope too dutiful and too sensible to throw away the advantages which fortune has secured him to become a mountebank it is very embarrassing to me to answer questions about you there are some who will be unjust enough i doubt not to blame me for your wild course but i shall be sustained by the consciousness of my entire innocence in the matter at great expense i have maintained you and paid the cost of your education giving you privileges and advantages equal to those i have given my own boy i have done so cheerfully because you were my nephew and i am sorry you have made me so poor a return but i shall look for my reward to my own conscience and hope you may yet see the folly and wickedness of your course i have only to add that when that time comes you are welcome to return to my roof and protection and i will intercede with your excellent employer mr bickford to take you back and teach you his trade whereby you may be enabled to earn a more respectable living than you are doing at present ralph joins with me in this wish your uncle stephen watson kits lip curled when he read this hypocritical letter and was tempted to despise his uncle more now than ever he lost no time in sending this reply uncle stephen i have received your letter and can only express my surprise at the view you take of your treatment of me whether my father really left me as destitute as you claim i am not in a position to say if you have really gone to personal expense in maintaining and educating me up to this point i shall when i am able reimburse you to the last cent but i cannot forgive you for your trying to force a boy reared and educated as i have been to learn the trade of a blacksmith you say that i have enjoyed advantages similar to those of your son ralph i wish to ask whether you would dream of apprenticing him to any such business you speak of my low associations and call me a mountebank in the town i have just left i was the guest of the mayor and have promised to spend a week at his house on a visit when the circus season is over though you have done your best to lower me socially i am confident that i shall be able to win a good place by my own unaided exertions i have no intention in continuing as a circus performer though i am very liberally paid it is too soon for me to decide upon my future course but you may tell mr bickford he need not wait for me to resume my place in his shop i do not know when i shall see you or ralph again but you need have no fear that i shall appeal to your generosity your nephew christopher watson stephen watson read this letter with surprise and chagrin he was sorry to hear that kit was doing so well and alarmed at his implied doubt whether he had really been left destitute by his father that boy is going to give me trouble he muttered chapter xxv the attack on the circus tent four weeks passed in which kit continued to acquit himself to the satisfaction of the manager his youth and pleasant face added to his uncommon skill made him a favorite with the public and being a boy with a love of adventure he enjoyed thoroughly the constant variety of circus life and travel all circus existence is not sunshine however there are communities which are always dreaded by circus managers on account of the rough and lawless element which dominates them early one morning barlows circus arrived at the mining town of coalville as we will call it in pennsylvania an afternoon performance was given and passed off smoothly but in the evening a gang of about twenty miners made their appearance bent on mischief mr clark the manager sought mr barlow i think we shall have trouble this evening mr barlow he said guard against it then what indications have you seen a gang of twenty miners have just entered the lot they look ugly have the canvas men on guard and summon the razorbacks if necessary dont provoke a conflict but be ready for one mr clark hastily made his arrangements as quietly as possible near the ticket seller lounged a body of men strong and muscular these were the canvas men some of them looked as reckless and dangerous as the miners from whom a disturbance was feared these canvas men whose duty it is to set up and take down the tents are for the most part a rough set they are paid from fifteen to twenty dollars a month and board their accommodations are very poor but as good perhaps as they are accustomed to they are not averse to a scrimmage and obeyed with alacrity the directions of mr clark the body of miners marched in procession to the ticket seller and then halted one serving as spokesman give us twenty tickets boss said the leader where is your money asked the ticket seller cautiously never you mind were on the free list aint we boys yes we are was the chorus from his followers there are no deadheads admitted to the show said the ticket agent firmly youll be a deadhead yourself if you aint careful young feller was the retort keep back men there are others waiting for a chance to buy tickets let em wait just hand over them tickets or well run over you the fellow looked so dangerous that the ticket seller saw there was no time to parley he raised the wellknown circus cry which is called out in times of danger like a summons to arms hey rube instantly the canvas men and razorbacks rushed to the rescue and made an impetuous attack on the disorderly crowd of miners they too were aching for a fight and there was a wild scene of battle in which as in the ancient days the opposing forces fought hand to hand the canvas men were strong but so were the miners their muscles were toughened by daily toil and it looked as if the outsiders might win kit was not of course called upon to take part in the contest but he was unwillingly involved one of the miners detached himself from the main body and creeping stealthily to the big tent whipped out a large knife and was on the point of cutting one of the ropes his intention being to sever one after another till the big tent collapsed kit saw his design and rushing forward seized his arm hold on there he cried what are you about let me alone and mind your own business returned the miner in a hoarse deep voice but kit saw that it was a critical moment and that great mischief might be done he looked about him for help for he was far from able to cope with his brawny antagonist still he clung to the arm of the intruder and succeeded in delaying his purpose let go or ill cut you said the miner savagely then kit in desperation raised the cry hey rube but it hardly seemed likely to bring the needed assistance for all the fighting men were engaged in the battle near the ticket seller that wont do no good young bantam said the ruffian as he aimed a blow at our hero kits career would in all probability have been cut short but for the timely arrival of achilles henderson the giant had heard the boys warning cry and being near at hand rushed to his aid his arrival was most opportune he seized the miner in his powerful grasp and the ruffian strong and muscular as he was was like a child in his clutch his knife fell from his hand as he was shaken like a reed by the giant secure the knife kit cried achilles kit needed no second bidding he stooped swiftly and took up the weapon but achilles was needed in another direction the contest between the miners and the canvas men still raged fiercely near the ticket stand it looked as if the intruders would conquer from the ranks of the defenders rose a wild and desperate cry hey rube achilles heard it come kit he said we are wanted he hurled the miner in his grasp to the ground with such force that the man lay senseless then he rushed with all the speed which his long limbs enabled him to attain to the scene of the conflict here again he was none too soon the leader of the miners who had been the first spokesman and aggressor was armed with a powerful club with which he was preparing to deal the ticket seller a terrible and possibly fatal blow when achilles rushed into the mкlйe like a hurricane he snatched the club from the hands of the ruffian and dealt about unsparingly the ringleader was the first to fall next achilles attacked the rest of the brutal gang till half a dozen men with broken heads lay upon the ground the attacking force were completely demoralized and in dismay fled from the field the ticket seller breathed a sigh of relief i thought i was done for mr henderson he said when the giant returned flushed with his exertions you are equal to half a dozen men i havent had so much exercise in a long time said achilles panting kit where is the knife that scalawag was going to cut the rope with here it is mr henderson i will keep it in remembrance of this little adventure perhaps i had better go and look after the original owner he met the ruffian limping like one disabled his look was sullen and menacing give me my knife he growled i couldnt think of it my man said achilles blandly evidently you are not old enough to be trusted with a knife id like to thrash you growled the miner again ive no doubt of it my friend your intentions are good but cant be carried out and now i have a word to say he continued sternly just get out of the lot as fast as your legs can carry you or ill serve you worse than i did before the ruffian looked toward the ticket stand he saw several of his friends limping away like himself looking like whipped curs and he saw that there was no choice for him but to obey with a muttered oath and a sullen scowl he left the grounds kit said the giant it wont do for me to exercise like this every day i shall need a second supper you are certainly entitled to one mr henderson replied our hero chapter xxvi kit is made a prisoner it had been a day of exciting adventure but so far as kit was concerned the end was not yet he performed as usual but as his second act was over at quarter past nine he thought being fatigued that he would not wait until the close but go at once to the circus car in which he had a berth and go to bed he crossed the lot and emerged into the street it was moderately dark there being no moon and only the light of a few stars to relieve the gloom kit had not taken a dozen steps from the lot when two stout men approached him both evidently miners thats the kid that prevented my cutting the rope he heard one say is he i saw him with the giant i mean to settle his hash for him said the first kit saw that he was in danger and turned to run back to his friends but it was too late the first speaker laid a strong arm upon his shoulder and his boyish strength was not able to overcome it dont be in such a hurry kid said his captor let me go cried kit you belong to the circus dont you yes what do you do i am an acrobat whats that i leap and turn somersaults and so on yes i know do you remember me i might if it were lighter the man lit a match and held it close to his face do you know me now yes who am i you are the man who tried to cut the ropes of the tent right you are i would have succeeded but for you i suppose you would did you call that giant to pitch into me no i didnt know he was near he treated me like a brute said the man wrathfully my limbs are aching now from the fall he gave me kit did not answer id like to give him a broken head as he gave some of my friends where is he i suppose he is somewhere in the lot ill go and call him if you want me to thats too thin now ive got you i wont let you off so easy what do you intend to do asked kit becoming alarmed to give you a lesson kit did not ask what kind of a lesson was meant but he feared it included bodily injury then at least if never before he wished himself back at his uncles house in smyrna uncongenial as it was otherwise the first speaker spoke in a low voice to the second kit did not hear the words but judged what they were from what followed the two men placed him beside them and he was sternly ordered to move on they kept the road for perhaps half a mile then turned off into a narrow lane which appeared to ascend a hill finally they stopped in front of a dark cabin of one story which seemed to be unoccupied the outer door was fastened by a bolt one of the men drew out a bolt and threw open the door a dark interior was revealed one of the men lit a match throwing a fitful light upon an empty room at one end of the apartment was a ring fixed in a beam and in the corner was a stout rope that will do said the first speaker he took the rope secured one end of it to the ring and then tied kit firmly with the balance it was long enough to allow of his lying down now said the first man grimly i reckon the kid will be safe here till tomorrow they prepared to leave the cabin are you going to leave me here asked kit in dismay yes what good will it do you youll see tomorrow kit had ten dollars in his pocket and he thought of offering it in return for his freedom but it occurred to him fortunately that his captors would deprive him of it as it was quite within their power to do and not compensate him in any way he understood by this time the character of the men into whose hands he had fallen and he thought it prudent to remain silent as the first captor stood with the door open while just on the point of leaving he said grimly how do you like it kid not at all answered kit if you beg my pardon for what you did i might let you go kit did not believe this and he had no intention of humiliating himself for nothing i only did my duty he said i have nothing to ask pardon for you may change your mind tomorrow another ominous reference to tomorrow evidently he was only deferring his vengeance and intended to wreak it on his young prisoner the next day it was not a comforting thought nor was it calculated to sooth kit weary as he was to sleep the door was closed and kit heard the sliding of the bolt on the outside he was a prisoner securely enough and with small chance of rescue now though kit is my hero i do not mean to represent him as above human weakness and i wont pretend that he didnt feel anxious and disturbed his prospects seemed very dark he could not hope for mercy from the brutal men who had captured him as they could not get hold of the giant they would undoubtedly seek to make him expiate the offenses of achilles henderson as well as his own if only mr henderson knew where i was he said to himself i should soon be free but there seemed little hope of this he had not told any one that he intended to retire to the circus cars earlier than usual the chances were that he would not be missed till the circus company had reached the next town on their route ten miles away then there would be no clew to his whereabouts and even if there were he might be killed before any help could come to him so far as he had been able to observe the miners were a portion of them at least a lawless set of men who were not likely to be influenced by considerations of pity or ordinary humanity kit had been very religiously brought up during his fathers life at least and he had not lost his faith in an overruling providence so in this great peril it was natural for him to pray to god for deliverance from danger when his prayer was concluded he felt easier and in spite of his disagreeable surroundings he managed to fall asleep meanwhile the circus performance terminated and preparations were commenced for the journey to the next town the canvas men swarmed around the tents and swiftly took them down and conveyed them to the freight cars where they assisted the razorbacks to pack them in small compass harry thorne who had his berth next to kit turned in rather late he looked into kits bed and to his surprise found it unoccupied what can have become of the boy he asked himself he went outside and espying achilles henderson he said have you seen anything of kit watson isnt he in his berth asked mr henderson surprised no inquiry developed the fact that kit had not been seen by any one since the conclusion of his act i am afraid the boy has come to harm said achilles this is a rough place and there are plenty of tough characters about as our experience this afternoon showed what shall we do the cars will soon be starting and we must leave him behind if he doesnt show up before that time i will stay behind and hunt him up he is too good a boy to be left to his fate chapter xxvii a miners cabin kits principal captor was known as dick hayden he was an englishman and a leader in every kind of mischief if there was any disturbance between the miners and their employers he was generally found to be at the bottom of it a naturally quarrelsome disposition was intensified by intemperance in the attack upon the circus tents he found himself in his element his ignominious defeat made him ugly and revengeful his wife was dead but he had one child janet a girl of thirteen who cooked for him and took care of his cabin the poor girl had a hard time of it but she endeavored so far as possible to avoid trouble with her brutal parent it was near ten oclock when hayden came home after locking kit in the deserted cabin he had gone away without supper but late as it was janet had something hot ready for him on the stove well janet child have you my supper ready he said not unpleasantly for his victory over kit and the meditated revenge of the next day had put him in good humor yes father its on the stove and ready to dish up lay the table then for im main tired and hungry the little girl quickly spread the cloth and dick hayden ate like a voracious animal when supper was over he sat back in his chair and lit a pipe a comfortable supper made him loquacious well janet you dont ask where ive been was it to the circus father yes how did you like the show i didnt see it he growled a frown gathering upon his brow and why not father because we had a fight to get in free and got the worst of it they must be main strong then those circus men strong repeated hayden scornfully well mayhap they are but wed have bested them but for the giant the giant is it the big man i saw in the parade yes hes as strong as three men he flung me down as easily as id throw a boy then he must have been strong for youre a powerful man father there isnt a man as works in the minell compare with me lass said hayden proudly but all the same im no match for a monster tell me about it father said janet with natural curiosity dick hayden went on to describe the fight around the ticket stand and how he had slipped away intending to cut the ropes of the tent and let it down on the heads of the spectators gathered inside id have done it too he added but for a kid i thought just now you said it was the giant and i stick to it lass but this boy saw what i was doing and brought the giant to the spot i could do nothing after that he threw me down so that for a few minutes i was stunned and how did the fight come out at the ticket stand father our men had almost overpowered the circus men when the giant rushed into the midst and seizing a club from bob stubbs laid about him till half a dozen of our strongest men lay on the ground with broken heads what puzzled janet was that her father should have come home in such good humor after so disastrous a defeat it was contrary to her experience of him she would naturally have expected that he would be surly and quarrelsome the mystery was soon made clear but weve got even with them chuckled hayden directly after how is that father we caught the kid you have yes he was goin to the circus cars to turn in when stubbs and i caught him you you didnt kill him father asked janet in alarm no not yet where is he do you mind the deserted cabin on knob hill yes father hes locked up in that tied hand and foot how long do you mean to keep him there asked janet anxiously till tomorrow and then dick paused ominously well and then hell be lucky if he gets off with a whole skin growled her father but for him id have brought down the tent about the ears of the people that sat inside and wed have had a fine revenge on the showmen you dont mean to kill the boy do you father what is it to you lass youd best mind your own business youve got nothing to do with it how does the boy look was it the one that drove the first chariot father like enough lass did you see him yes i saw the parade everybody was out in the streets then and you took particlar notice of the boy thats like a lass chuckled hayden but it was his duty father to stand by the show seein he belongs to it i dont trouble myself about that he brought that monster on me and im sore yet with the fall he gave me ill take it out of the kid but it seems to me father it would be better to lay for the giant what folly is that lass id be main glad to give the giant a dose of what he gave me but hell leave town tonight and i aint big enough to tackle him even if i had the chance so ill revenge myself on his friend the boy the kid may be his son for aught i know and what will you do for him father asked janet pertinaciously you wont kill him well i wont go so far as that for ive no mind to put my neck in a noose but ill flog him within an inch of his life ill teach him to mind his own business for the future janet knew her fathers strength and brutality and she shuddered at the idea of the boy being exposed to it she knew very well it would be of no use to make a protest she would only get herself into trouble yet she couldnt reconcile herself to the thought of poor kit being cruelly punished she asked herself what she could do to prevent it there was one thing in favor of a rescue she knew where kit was confined if it were not so late she would steal out and going to the cabin relieve him from captivity but it was too late and too dark for that besides she could not leave her fathers cabin without observation i will wait till tomorrow morning she said to herself it so chanced that on account of some slight repairs the mine in which her father was employed was shut down for a few days this was favorable for he would lie in bed till eight oclock at least and there would be a chance to get out without observation the next morning about five oclock janet rose from her bed hastily dressed herself and crept to the door of her fathers chamber he was sound asleep and breathing heavily there was small chance of his awakening before seven oclock janet took a little meat and bread in a tin pail for she thought the captive might be in need of breakfast and then putting a sharp knife in her pocket to cut the ropes that bound him she left the house and took her way over the hill to the deserted cabin which served as kits prison chapter xxviii kit rescued by a girl kit had succeeded in getting a little sleep during the night but his position was necessarily constrained and he was but very slightly refreshed moreover he was a prey to anxiety for he did not know what fate awaited him on the succeeding day at four oclock in the morning a little light found its way into the cabin through a small window at the rear the other windows were boarded up kit appreciating the desirability of escaping before a visit should be made him by his captors tried hard to work himself out of his bonds but only succeeded in confining himself more closely than before what will they do to me he asked himself anxiously he had heard from some of the circus men accounts of the roughness and brutality of the miners or at least of a certain class of them for some were quiet and peaceable men and he knew that there was no extreme of which they were not capable life is sweet and to a boy of sixteen in good health and strength it is especially dear suppose he should lose his life in this region probably none of his friends would ever learn what had become of him and his uncle and cousin would not scruple to spread rumors to his discredit it was certainly tantalizing that he should be tied hand and foot utterly unable to help himself more and more light crept in at the window and there was every indication of its being a glorious day but this prospect brought no pleasure to poor kit before this time the circus people must have found out my absence he thought will they take the trouble to look for me kit was on good terms with his comrades indeed he was popular with them all as a bright boy is apt to be and he did not like to think that no effort would be made to find him still as he could not help owning to himself they had no clew that was likely to lead to success he had given no one notice where he was going and his capture was not likely to have been observed by any one while he was indulging in these sorrowful reflections his attention was drawn to a noise at the window they cant have come back so early he said to himself in surprise he twisted himself round to catch a glimpse if possible of the early visitor and to his delight he caught a partial view of janets dress suppose she should prove a deliverer he said to himself with beating heart the visitor whoever it was was evidently trying to peer into the cabin kit was so placed in a corner as to be almost out of sight in the dark interior he felt that he must attract attention hallo there he cried in a loud clear voice hes there thought janet just as father said let me out cried kit eagerly draw out the bolt and open the door will she do it or will she be frightened away he asked himself with his heart filled with suspense he did not have long to wait for an answer and a favorable one he heard the bolt withdrawn then the door was opened and the girls face appeared janet hayden was small not especially pretty and rather oldfashioned in looks but to poor kit she seemed like an angel are you the circus boy she asked timidly yes i am tied here have you got a knife to cut this rope yes i brought one with me then you knew i was here kit asked in surprise yes it was my father that locked you up here my father and another man will you cut the rope and let me go then yes that is what i came for the little maid went up to the captive bent over and with considerable sawing for the knife she had with her was a dull case knife succeeded in severing the rope and kit was able to rise and stand upon his feet it was a perfect luxury to feel himself once more free and unshackled im very much obliged to you he said gratefully you cant imagine how stiff i am i should think you would be said janet sympathetically when did your father tell you that i was here after he got home last night it was after he had eaten his supper and where is he now at home and asleep does he get up early asked kit in some anxiety yes when he is at work but the mine is shut down for a few days so he lies abed longer did he say anything about coming here today yes he meant to come he and the other man and i was afraid he would do you some harm he would have done so i am sure said kit shuddering i dont see how such a rough father should have so good a daughter janet blushed and seemed pleased with the compliment i think i take after my mother she said is your mother alive no she died two years ago answered janet sorrowfully she was scotch and that is why i am called by a scotch name what is your name if you dont mind telling me janet i am janet hayden i shall always remember it for you have done me a great service what is your name asked janet feeling less timid than at first kit watson that is a funny name kit i mean my right name is christopher but my friends call me kit can you direct me to the next town groveton where the circus shows today yes if you will come outside i will point out which way it is kit emerged from the cabin nothing loath and janet pointed in a westerly direction you go over the hill she said and you will come to a road you will know it for near the stile there is a red house thank you how far is it to the next town eight miles i believe that would be a long walk do you think i could get any one to take me over in a wagon i think the man who lives in the red house mr stover would take you over if you pay him i shall be glad to pay him and kit paused for he felt rather delicate about offering any money to janet though he knew she had rendered him most valuable service will you let me offer you a little present he took a five dollar bill from his pocket and offered it to janet what is that she asked it is a five dollar bill you must be rich she said for this seemed to her a great deal of money oh no but will you take it no answered janet shrinking back i didnt come here for money i am sure you didnt but i should like to give you something no i would rather not besides if father knew i had money he would suspect something and beat me like the brute that he is thought kit but i must go at once for he may wake up and miss me goodby goodby said kit he had no time to say more for the child was already hurrying down the hill chapter xxix janet meets the giant janet took her way homewards hurrying with quick feet lest her father should wake up before she arrived but she had taken so early a start that she found him still sleeping soundly she instantly began to make preparations for breakfast by the time it was on the table her father woke up and yawned with his waking there came the thought of his young circus captive and the vengeance he intended to wreak upon him this pleasant idea roused him completely and he dressed himself briskly is breakfast ready janet he asked yes father what time is it seven oclock answered janet looking at the clock over the mantel i am expecting bob stubbs here this morning have you got enough for him i think so father replied janet she did not speak with alacrity for mr stubbs was no favorite of hers at that moment a step was heard at the door and the gentleman spoken of made his appearance youre late dick said stubbs rubbing his bristling chin yes i got tired out yesterday when the mines shut down i like to take my time have you had breakfast bob yees answered stubbs hesitating as he glanced at the neatly spread table with the eggs and bacon on the center dish never mind you can eat some more put a chair for him janet this lass of yours is growing pretty said stubbs with a glance of admiration theres a compliment for you lass said the father janet however did not appear to appreciate it and continued to look grave wonder how the kids getting along said bob stubbs with his mouth full of bacon i reckon hes hungry said dick hayden in a voice of satisfaction have you left him without anything to eat father asked janet yes the poor fellow will be starved and serves him right too there aint no call to pity him why wont you take him some breakfast if youre going round there i will put some up in a tin pail what do you say to that bob hey said hayden its natural for the gal to pity him hes a nice lookin chap enough hes nicer looking than he will be when we get through with him eh bob thats so dick as janet listened to this conversation her heart revolted against the brutality conveyed by the words she felt dissatisfied to think that her own father was such a man she could not well feel an affection for him remembering how ill he had treated her gentle mother who as she knew would be living today had she been wedded to a better husband the two men did not linger long at the table they were accustomed to swallow their food rapidly in order to get to the scene of their daily labor on time so in twenty minutes they rose from the table and putting on their hats left the cabin as they departed janet breathed a sigh of relief and congratulated herself that she had released the poor boy and so saved him from the brutal treatment he was likely to receive at the hands of the two miners he will have had plenty of time to get away before father and mr stubbs reach the cabin she said to herself janet washed the dishes and then having an errand at the store put on her hat and left the cabin she did not trouble herself to lock the door for there was nothing in the place likely to excite the cupidity of any dishonest person janet had accomplished a part of the distance when she saw approaching her a figure that at once attracted her earnest attention the reason will be readily understood when i say that it was achilles henderson the circus giant mr henderson had been exploring the neighborhood in the hope of finding some trace of kit but thus far had been unsuccessful he was very much perplexed having absolutely no clew and was thinking of starting for groveton where the circus was billed to appear that evening he was walking in an undecided way and never thought of noticing the little girl who stood staring at him indeed he was so used to being stared at that he took it as a matter of course and did not think of giving the curious gazer a second glance but his attention was called by a low half frightened voice mr giant well little girl what do you want he asked are you looking for anybody asked janet first glancing carefully around to make sure that she was not likely to be overheard yes answered achilles quickly i am looking for a boy a circus boy yes do you know where he is come nearer i dont want anybody to hear what i say all right my little maid is the boy alive and well yes he was two hours ago where is he i dont know where he is now achilles looked disappointed tell me all you know he said my father and bob stubbs took him last night and shut him up in a lonely cabin on the hill where is the cabin he isnt there now i let him out good for you little girl youre a trump youre a great deal better than your father do you know where the boy went i will tell you where i told him to go where is your father now is he at work no the mine is shut down how did you know that the boy was in the cabin i heard father tell where he was last night when he was at supper so i got up very early and stole out to release him for i was afraid father might kill him he said he meant to punish him for what you did he said he would rather get at you hes quite welcome to if he wants to answered achilles grimly on the whole i wouldnt advise him to tackle me he thought you had gone on with the circus i should have done so if i hadnt missed kit yes he told me his name was kit was he tied yes i took a knife with me and cut the ropes the poor fellow must have passed an uncomfortable night yes he said so he must have been very glad to see you yes he was i am only afraid of one thing what is that father and the other man left the house more than half an hour ago to go to the cabin when they find him gone they will be very angry like as not and i think they will try to find him very true i wish i knew where he was they wouldnt dare to attack him in my company no mr giant you must be very strong i think i would be a match for them achilles questioned janet minutely as to the advice she had given kit i might follow the boy he said to himself at a guess but theres only half a chance of my hitting right where is the cabin he asked suddenly janet pointed in the proper direction i know what ill do he said with sudden decision ill follow your father and the other man all the danger to kit is likely to come from them if i can get track of them i can make sure that no mischief will be done achilles henderson then stepped over a fence which an ordinary man would have had to climb and made his way to the deserted cabin chapter xxx dick hayden finds the bird flown half an hour previously dick hayden and his congenial friend bob stubbs reached the cabin they had much pleasant and jocose conversation on the way touching their young captive and how he had probably passed the night they had personal injuries to avenge and though achilles was responsible for them they proposed to wreak vengeance on the boy whom a luckless fate had thrown into their hands my shoulders are sore yet said hayden over the fall that big brute gave me and my head hasnt got over the crack i got when he laid me flat with his club responded stubbs well weve got a friend of his thats one comfort im going to take it out of the kids hide you dont mean to do for him said stubbs cautiously i dont mean to kill him if thats what you mean stubbs i have too much regard for my neck but i mean to give him a sound flogging you aint afraid be you catch bob stubbs afraid of anything except the hangmans rope i dont mind telling you that i have reasons to be afraid of that why youve never been hung have you no but an uncle of mine was strung up in england what for he got into trouble with a fellow workman and stabbed him he was in bad luck why didnt he cut it and come to america he tried it but the bobbies caught him in the steerage of an ocean steamer and then it was all up with him well i hope his nephew will come to a better end but here we are at the cabin there was nothing in the outward appearance of the hut to indicate that the bird was flown janet bolted the door after releasing the prisoner and no one could judge that it had been opened all is safe said bob stubbs of course it is why shouldnt it be no reason but some of his friends might have found him all his friends are at groveton then they had no idea what we did with him they must have found out that he was gone they couldnt find him so that would do him no good stubbs was about to draw the bolt but hayden stayed his hand wait a minute bob he said ill look in at the window and see what he is doing dick hayden went around to the rear of the building and flattened his face against the pane in the effort to see the corner where the captive had been tied he could not see very distinctly but what he did see startled him he could perceive no one could the boy have loosened the rope he asked himself hurriedly even in that case as the window was nailed so that it could not be opened and the door was bolted there seemed no way of escape his eyes eagerly explored other portions of the cabin but he could not catch a glimpse of kit he rushed round to the front and in an excitement which stubbs could not understand pulled the bolt back with a jerk whats the matter dick asked stubbs staring dick hayden did not answer but threw open the door he strode in and peeped here and there the boys gone he said hoarsely to stubbs who followed close behind gone echoed stubbs in blank amazement how did he get away thats the question responded dick growling well im flabbergasted theres witchery here dick hayden bent over and picked up the pieces of rope which lay in the corner where the prisoner had been placed he examined the ends and said briefly turning to stubbs theyve been cut so they have dick who in natur could have done it perhaps the kid did it himself might have had a knife in his pocket dont be a fool stubbs supposin hed done it how was he goin to get out thats what beats me somebody must have let him out do you think its his circus friends no theyre all in groveton somebody must have been passin and heard the boy holler and let him out what are you goin to do about it dick goin to sit down and take a smoke it may give me an idea it will be noticed that of these two dick hayden as the bolder and stronger spirit was the leader and bob stubbs the subservient follower stubbs was no less brutal when occasion served but he was not self reliant he wanted some one to lead the way and he was willing to follow the two men sat down beside the cabin and lit their pipes nothing was said for a time dick seemed disinclined to conversation and stubbs was always disposed to be silent when enjoying a smoke the smoke continued for twenty minutes or more finally dick withdrew the pipe from his mouth well dick what do you think about it what shall we do inquired his friend i am going to foller the kid but you dont know where hes gone replied stubbs no but i may strike his track are you with me of course i am then listen to me the one that let the boy out knows the neighborhood the boy would naturally want to go to groveton and likely he would be directed to stover if the kid had any money he would ask stover to drive him over or else he would foot it youre right dick thats what hed do said stubbs admiring his companions penetration then we must go over to stovers all right im with you im a poor man bob but id give a ten dollar bill to have that kid in my power once more i dont doubt it dick i hate to have it said that a kid like that got the advantage of dick hayden so would i bob if i get hold of him ill give him a lesson that he wont soon forget and serve him right too the two men rose and took their way across the fields following exactly the same path which our hero had traveled earlier in the morning they walked with brisk steps having a definite purpose in view dick hayden was intensely anxious to recapture kit whose escape had balked him of his vengeance and mortified him exceedingly as he expressed it he could not bear to think that a boy of sixteen had got the advantage of him at length they reached the red house already referred to and saw ham stover the owner in the yard you are up betimes dick said stover whats in the wind have you seen aught of a boy of sixteen passin this way asked dick anxiously a likely lookin lad well dressed yes he was round here an hour ago and took breakfast in the house this was true the slight refreshment janet had brought him having proved insufficient to completely stay the cravings of kits appetite after his night in the cabin where is he now what do you want of him never you mind ill tell you bimeby where is he he wanted me to harness up and take him to groveton dick hayden and stubbs exchanged glances it was evident that they had struck kits trail well did you do it no i couldnt spare the time besides i wanted the horse to go to the village im going to harness up now what did the boy do he walked how long since did he start about half an hour or thereabouts dick hayden made a rapid calculation we may overtake him if we walk fast he said without stopping to enlighten the curiosity of mr stover the two men set out rapidly on the groveton road chapter xxxi in the enemys hands mr stover was considerably surprised when twenty minutes later looking up from his work in the yard he saw a man of colossal size crossing the street he hadnt attended the circus and had not therefore heard of the giant who was one of its principal features who in creation can that be stover asked himself achilles henderson turned into the yard and accosted the farmer good morning friend he said can you tell me if a boy of about sixteen has passed here this morning that boy again thought the bewildered farmer yes he answered please describe him mr stover did so the very one said achilles now how long since was he here he took breakfast with my family and started off nigh on to an hour ago in what direction did he go this question was also answered thank you friend said the giant you have done me a favor then wont you do me one said stover who is this boy that so many people are askin for he is a young acrobat connected with barlows circus but what do you mean by so many people asking about him there was two men here twenty minutes ago that seemed very anxious to find him achilles henderson heard this with apprehension he could guess who they were and what he heard alarmed him for kits safety who are they he inquired hastily dick hayden and bob stubbs are they miners yes did you tell them where the boy went sartin why not because they mean to do the boy a mischief they may even kill him what in creation should they do that for mr stover i must follow them at once have you a team yes but i calculated to use it i must have it and i want you to go with me you may charge what you please remember a boys life may depend on it then you shall have it said the farmer and ill go with you i took a likin to the boy he was a gentleman if ever i saw one and my women folks was mightily taken with him dick hayden and bob stubbs are rough kind of men and i wouldnt trust any one i set store by in their hands but why harness your horse and ill answer your questions on the way mr stover how do you know my name asked stover with sudden thought i was told by some one as i came along the farmer lost no time in harnessing his horse achilles henderson lending a hand the horse seemed rather alarmed never having seen a giant before but soon got over his fright the two men then jumped into the wagon and set out in search of kit meanwhile our hero had taken his way leisurely along the road he didnt anticipate being followed at any rate so soon and felt under no particular apprehension he had walked about three miles when a broad branching elm tree tempted him to rest by its shade he threw himself down on the grass and indulged in self congratulations upon his escape from his captors but his congratulation proved to be premature after a while he raised his eyes and looked carelessly back in the direction from which he had come what he saw startled him the two miners hayden and stubbs had lost no time on the way they were bent on capturing kit in order to revenge themselves upon him reaching a little eminence in the road dick hayden caught sight of his intended victim sitting under the tree his eyes gleamed with a wicked light theres the kid stubbs he said stir your stumps old man and well collar him the two miners started on a run and when kit caught sight of them they were already within a few rods the young acrobat saw that his only safety if indeed there was any chance at all was in flight he started to his feet and being fleet of limb gave them a good chase but in the end the superior strength and endurance of the men conquered flushed and panting kit was compelled to stop hayden grasped him by the collar with a look of wicked satisfaction so ive got you my fine chap have i yes so it seems said kit his heart sinking sit down ive got a few questions to ask there was a broad flat stone by the roadside he seated kit upon it with a forcible push and the two men ranged themselves one on each side of him what time did you leave the cabin boy i dont know what time it was it must have been two hours since perhaps more did any one let you out yes who was it i dont know the persons name was it a man kit began to feel that he must be cautious he knew that she was the daughter of the man who was questioning him and that she would be in danger of rough treatment if her father should find out that she had thwarted him i cannot tell you he answered though he well knew that the answer was likely to get him into trouble you cant tell why not dont you know whether it was a man or not yes i know you mean that you wont tell me then said hayden in a menacing tone i mean that i dont care to do it i might get the person into trouble you would that you may bet your life i can tackle any man round here and id get even with that man if i swung for it that is why i dont care to tell you said kit how can you tell that the man knew you put me there didnt you tell him no it was a man then said hayden turning to stubbs look here young feller if you tell me who it was you may get off better yourself i would rather not answered kit pale but firm suit yourself kid but you may as well know that youll be half killed before we get through with you get up as he spoke hayden jerked kit to his feet and began to drag him toward the rail fence take down the rails stubbs he said whats your game dick im going to give the kid a drubbing that he wont be likely to forget but i cant do it in the road for some one may come along im with you dick at the lower end of the field which they had now entered was a strip of woods which promised seclusion and freedom from interruption poor kit as he was dragged forward by his relentless captor found his spirits sinking to zero will no one deliver me from this brutal man he exclaimed inwardly he felt that his life was in peril chapter xxxii kits danger the men reached the edge of the woods and halted id like to hang him growled dick hayden with a malignant look it wouldnt do dick said stubbs wed get into trouble if we were found out murder will most always come out said stubbs uneasily he was a shade less brutal and far less daring than his companion it can be imagined with what feelings kit heard this colloquy he had no confidence in the humanity of his captors and considered them dick hayden in particular as capable of anything he did not dare to remonstrate lest in a spirit of perversity the two men might proceed to extremities kit was not long in doubt as to the intentions of his captors take off your coat boy said hayden harshly kit looked into the face of his persecutor and decided that it would be prudent to obey otherwise he would have forcibly resisted he removed his coat and held it over his arm lay down the coat and take off your vest was the next order this also kit felt compelled to do dick hayden produced from the capacious side pocket of his coat a cord which he proceeded to test by pulling it was evidently very strong stubbs tie him to yonder sapling said dick stubbs proceeded nothing loth to obey the directions of his leader kit was tied with his back exposed dick hayden watched the preparations with evident enjoyment this is the moment i have been longing for he said from his other pocket he drew a cowhide which he passed through the fingers of his left hand while with cruel eyes he surveyed the shrinking form of his victim meanwhile where was achilles henderson he and stover bowled as rapidly over the road as the speed of a fourteen year old horse would permit he looked eagerly before him in the hope of catching a glimpse either of kit or of the miners when they started they were far behind but at last they reached a point on the road where they could see kit and his two captors making their way across the fields there they are said stover who was the first to see them and theyve got the boy with them ejaculated achilles where are they going do you think over to them woods its likely replied stover what for im afraid they mean to do the boy harm not if i can prevent it said achilles with a stern look about the mouth theyre goin to give him a floggin i think theyll get the same dose in larger measure i can tell them that mr stover isnt there any way i can reach the woods by a short cut so that they wont see me yes there is a path in that field there there is a fringe of trees separatin it from the field where they are walkin then stop your horse and ill jump out mr stover did so with alacrity he disliked both dick hayden and bob stubbs whom he had reason to suspect of carrying off a dozen of his chickens the previous season he had not dared to charge them with it knowing the mens ugly disposition and being certain that they would revenge themselves upon him do you want me along mr giant he asked no im more than a match for them both shouldnt wonder if you were chuckled stover he kept his place in the wagon and laughed quietly to himself id like to see the scrimmage he said to himself with this object in view he drove forward so that from the wagon seat he could command a view of the scene of conflict theyre tying the boy to a tree he said i reckon the giantll be in time and im glad ont that boys a real gentleman wonder what hes done to rile dick hayden and bob stubbs hed have a mighty small show if the giant hadnt come up dicks a strong man but hell be like a child in the hands of an eightfooter meanwhile achilles henderson was getting over the ground at the rate of ten miles an hour or more his long strides gave him a great advantage over an ordinary runner if they lay a hand on that boy i pity em he said to himself it was fortunate for kit that dick hayden like a cat who plays with a mouse paused to gloat over the evident alarm and uneasiness of his victim even after all was ready for the punishment which he proposed to inflict well boy what have you to say now he demanded drawing the cowhide through his short stubby fingers i have nothing to say that will move you from your purpose i am afraid replied poor kit i guess youre about right there kid chuckled hayden are you ready to apologize to me for what you done over to the circus i dont think there is anything to apologize for there isnt isnt there didnt you bring that longlegged ruffian on to me i was only doing my duty said kit manfully oho so thats the way you look at it do you yes sir no doubt youd like it if that tall brute were here now said hayden tauntingly yes murmured kit i wish my good friend achilles were here so thats his name is it well i wouldnt mind if he were here stubbs i think you and i could do for him eh i dont know said stubbs dubiously well i do hes only one man while we are two and strong at that oho thought achilles who was now within hearing so my friend the miner is getting valorous well he will probably have a chance to test his strength by this time hayden had got through with his taunts and was ready to enjoy his vengeance your time has come boy he said fiercely stand back stubbs bob stubbs stepped back and dick hayden raised the cruel cowhide in his muscular grasp it would have inflicted a terrible blow had it fallen on the young acrobat but something unexpected happened the instrument of torture was torn from his hands and a deep voice which he knew only too well uttered these words for shame you brute would you kill the boy panic stricken the brutal miner turned and found himself confronting achilles henderson a fierce cry of rage and disappointment burst from his lips where did you come from he stammered from heaven i think murmured poor kit with devout gratitude to that overruling providence which had sent him such a helper in his utmost need chapter xxxiii dick hayden meets with retribution dick hayden and bob stubbs large and strong men as they were looked puny compared with the giant who towered beside them his face kindling with righteous indignation what are you going to do to the boy he demanded sternly i was going to flog him answered hayden in a surly tone and you were helping him went on achilles turning to stubbs no sir answered stubbs eagerly for big as he was he was a coward i didnt want dick to do it you coward exclaimed hayden contemptuously youre as deep in it as i am is that true kit asked achilles he isnt as bad as the other said kit that man hayden thought of killing me but his friend protested against it it shall be remembered to his credit why did you wish to flog the boy he asked of hayden on account of what happened at the circus the boy didnt touch you he brought you on me then i was the one to punish i couldnt get at you here i am at your service dick harden measured the giant with a vindictive eye but there was something in the sight of the mighty thews and sinews of the huge man that quelled his warlike ardor it wouldnt be a fair contest he said sullenly there are two of you as you said just before i came no there are not interposed stubbs hastily i haint any grudge against you mr giant you are willing to help me yes then untie that boy stubbs unloosed the cord that bound kit to the tree while achilles henderson watched hayden narrowly for he had no mind to let him go free are you that mans slave asked hayden i am willing to oblige him said stubbs meekly kit straightened up on being released and breathed a sigh of relief come along stubbs said hayden with an ugly look at kit and his protector our business is through not quite said achilles quietly as he laid his broad hand with a detaining grasp on the shoulder of the ruffian i am not through with you what do you want asked dick hayden with assumed bravado but with an uneasy look on his lowering face i am going to give you a lesson i gave you one at the circus ground but you need another touch me if you dare said hayden defiantly for answer achilles hurled him to the ground with less effort than hayden would have needed to serve kit in the same way then with the cowhide uplifted he struck the prostrate wretch three sharp blows that made him howl with rage and pain stubbs looked on with pale face thinking that his turn might come next hit him stubbs kill him screamed dick hayden would you stand by and see me murdered i cant help you said stubbs what can i do having administered justice to the chief ruffian achilles turned to stubbs now he said what have you to say for yourself why shouldnt i serve you in the same way spare me whined stubbs panic stricken i am the boys friend it was hayden who wanted to hurt him my friend i put very little confidence in what you say still i dont think you are as bad as this brute here i will spare you on one condition what is it indeed i will do anything you ask then take this cowhide and give your companion a taste of its quality stubbs looked alarmed dont ask me to do that he said me and dick are pals just as i supposed in that case you require a dose of the same medicine and achilles made a threatening demonstration with the rawhide dont do it cried stubbs affrighted then will you do as i say yes yes will you lay it on well yes answered stubbs who forced to choose between his own skin and haydens was influenced by a regard for his own person dick hayden listened to this conference with lowering brow he did not think stubbs would dare to hit him but he was destined to find himself unpleasantly surprised stubbs took the hide from the hands of the giant and anxious to conciliate his powerful antagonist laid it with emphasis on hayden already smarting from his former castigation ill kill you for that bob stubbs he yelled almost frothing at the mouth with rage i had to do it dick said stubbs apologetically you heard what he said i dont care what he said to spare your own miserable carcass you struck your friend but i am your friend no longer ill have it out of you come kit you are revenged said the giant now let us hurry on to the circus theres a team in the road below i think i can make a bargain with mr stover to carry us all the way they found mr stover waiting for them well he said how did you make out suppose you look back and see stover did look and to his amazement he saw dick hayden and bob stubbs rolling on the ground each holding the other in a fierce embrace hayden had attacked stubbs and though the latter tried hard to avoid a combat he was forced into it then finding himself pushed he fought as well as he could fortune favored him for dick hayden tripped and in so doing sprained his ankle he fell with a groan and stubbs glad to escape left him in haste and made the best of his way home it was not until several hours afterwards that hayden was found by another party and carried home where he was confined for a fortnight this was fortunate for kit and the giant for he had intended to make a formal complaint before a justice of the peace which might have resulted in the arrest and detention of one or both but his sprained ankle gave him so much pain that it drove all other thoughts out of his head for the time being mr stover was induced by an unusually liberal offer to convey the two friends to the next town where they found their circus friends wondering what had become of them kit was none the worse for his experience though it had been far from pleasant and performed that afternoon and evening with his usual spirit and success he told achilles how he had been rescued by janet hayden and the latter said with emphasis the girls a trump she has probably saved your life that brute her father wouldnt shrink from any violence no matter how great you ought to make her some acknowledgment kit i wouldnt dare to answered the young acrobat if her father should find out what she did for me i am afraid her life would not be safe chapter xxxiv some important information two or three days later the circus was billed to show at glendale a manufacturing village in western pennsylvania the name attracted the attention of kit for this was the place where his uncle had lived for many years previous to the death of kits father he naturally desired to learn something of his uncles reputation among the villagers who from his long residence among them must remember him well the circus had arrived during the night as a general thing kit was not in a hurry to get up but as he was to stay but a day in glendale he rose early with the intention of improving his time breakfast in the circus tent was not ready till nine oclock for circus men of every description get up late except the razorbacks who are compelled to be about very early to unload the freight cars and the canvas men who put up the tents so kit went to the hotel and registering his name called for breakfast after he had eaten it he strolled into the office hoping to meet some one of whom he could make inquiries respecting his uncle this was made unexpectedly easy a man of about his uncles age had been examining the list of arrivals he looked at kit inquisitively i beg your pardon young man he said but are you christopher watson yes sir answered kit politely did you ever have any relatives living in this place yes sir my uncle stephen watson used to live here i thought so i once saw your father he came here to visit your uncle you look like him kit was gratified for he cherished a warm affection for his dead father and was glad to have it said that he resembled him are you going to stay here long asked the villager no sir i am here only for the day on business i presume yes sir answered kit smiling i am here with barlows circus the other looked amazed you dont mean to say that you are connected with the circus he exclaimed yes sir in what capacity i am an acrobat i dont understand it at all why should your fathers son need to travel with a circus because i have my living to earn and that pays me better than any other employment i can get but your father was a rich man i always heard i supposed so myself till a short time since my uncle informed me that i was penniless and must learn a trade but where did the money go then how does your uncle make a living he has my fathers old place and appears to have enough to support himself and ralph sit down here young man there is something strange about this i want to ask you a few questions you are the man i want to see said kit i think myself there is some mystery and i would like to ask some questions about my uncle stephen from some one who knew him here i suppose you knew him no one knew him better many is the time he has come to me for a loan he didnt always pay back the money and i dare say he owes me still in the neighborhood of fifty dollars was he poor then he was in very limited circumstances he pretended to be in the insurance business and had a small office in the building near the hotel but if he made four hundred dollars a year in that way it was more than any one supposed then said kit puzzled how could he have lent my father ten thousand dollars he lend you father ten thousand dollars or anybody else ten thousand dollars why that is perfectly ridiculous who says he did he says so himself to whom did he tell that fish story he told me that is the way he explained his taking possession of the property that was only one loan he said he lent father money at various times and had to take the estate in payment kits auditor gave a loud whistle the mans a deeper and shrewder rascal than i had any idea of he said he is swindling you in the most barefaced manner i am not very much surprised to hear it said kit i was not satisfied that he was telling the truth if you are correct then he has wrongfully appropriated my fathers money there is not a doubt of it did he drive you from home about the same he attempted to apprentice me to a blacksmith while his own son ralph he means to send to college and have him study law i remember ralph well though he was a small boy when he left this village he was very unpopular among those of his own age he was always up to some mean act of mischief he got my boy into trouble once in school by charging him with something he had himself done he hasnt changed much then said kit we both attended the same boarding school but nobody liked ralph was he much of a scholar no he dragged along in the lower half of the class were you two good friends we didnt quarrel but we kept apart so his father wants to make a lawyer of him yes i have had a letter from smyrna in which i hear that my uncle has just bought ralph a bicycle valued at a hundred and twentyfive dollars money seems to be more plenty with him now than it used to be in his glendale days by the way would you like to see the place where your uncle used to live yes sir if you dont mind showing me i will do so with pleasure put on your hat and we will go at once they walked about a third of a mile till they reached the outskirts of the village this is the home of the foreign population said kits guide and there is the house which was occupied for at least ten years by your uncle kit eyed the building with interest it was a plain looking cottage containing but four rooms which stood badly in need of paint there was about an acre of land rocky and sterile attached to it this is the residence of the man who lent your father ten thousand dollars said his guide in an ironical tone not much of a palace is it it cant be worth over a thousand dollars your uncle sold it for seven hundred and eighty dollars but he didnt get that sum in money for it was mortgaged for six hundred you said my father came here once it was to visit your uncle while he was here he stood security at the tailors for new suits for your uncle and cousin and must have given your uncle some cash besides for he appeared to be in funds for some time afterwards so you see the loan or rather gift was on the other side i dont see how my uncle dared to misrepresent matters in that way nor i for he could easily be convicted of fraudulent statements i am very much obliged to you mr pierce mr pierce for your information i hope you will make some use of it i certainly shall said kit his good humored face showing unwonted resolution whenever you do my testimony will be at your service and there are plenty others who will corroborate my statements of your uncles financial condition when here the fact is my young friend your uncle has engaged in a most shameless plot against you kit was deeply impressed by this conversation he was resolved when the time came to assert his rights and lay claim to his dead fathers property chapter xxxv on the trapeze kit was on pleasant relations with his fellow performers indeed he was a general favorite owing to his obliging disposition and pleasant manners he took an interest in their acts as well as his own and in particular had cultivated an intimacy with louise lefroy the trapeze performer he had practiced on the trapeze in the gymnasium and had acquired additional skill under the tuition of mlle lefroy some time you will make an engagement as a trapeze performer christopher said the lady to him one day no answered kit shaking his head you wouldnt be afraid no i think i would make a very respectable performer but i dont mean to travel with the circus after this season unless i am obliged to why should you be obliged to because i have my living to earn it is a pity said mlle lefroy you seem cut out for a circus performer do you like it mlle lefroy the lady looked thoughtful i have to like it she said besides there is an excitement about it and i crave excitement but wouldnt you rather have a home of your own listen i had a home of my own but my husband was intemperate and in fits of intoxication would illtreat me and my boy then you have a boy said kit surprised yes and i support him at a boarding school out of my professional earnings which are large i am going to ask you another question but you may not like to answer it speak plainly your husband is living is he not yes does he know that you are a circus performer no and i would not have him know for worlds would he feel sensitive about it mlle lefroy laughed bitterly you dont know him or you would not ask that question she said he would want to appropriate my salary that is why i do not care to have him know how i am earning the living which he ought to provide for me i sympathize with you said kit gently then you dont think any the worse of me because i am a trapeze performer why should i am i not a circus performer also yes but it is different with you being a man you would not like to think of your mother or sister in my position no i would not yet i can imagine circumstances that would justify it from this time kit was disposed to look with different eyes upon mlle lefroy he did not think of her as a daring actor but rather as an injured wife and devoted mother who every day risked her life for the sake of one who was dear to her did you never fear that your husband might be present when you are performing asked kit it is my constant dread answered mlle lefroy when i come out in my costume and look over the sea of heads i am always afraid i shall see his face but you never have yet never yet i do not think if i should see that man i could go through my part it requires nerve as you know and my nerves would be so shaken that my life would be in peril if you ever hear of my meeting with an accident you may guess the probable cause then if ever you recognize your husband among the spectators it would be prudent to omit your performance that is what i propose to do kit little imagined how soon the contingency which his friend feared would arrive two evenings later harry thorne brought him a little note he opened it and read as follows come and see me at once louise lefroy kit ascertained where mlle lefroy was to be found and obeyed the summons immediately he found the lady in great agitation are you not well he asked well in health but not in mind she answered has anything happened yes what i dreaded has come to pass have you seen your husband asked kit quickly yes i was taking a walk and saw him on the opposite side of the street did he see you no but i ascertained that he is staying at the hotel now he is likely to follow the crowd and attend the circus tonight that is probable then you will not appear i should not dare to but it will be a great disappointment to the management the trapeze act is always a popular one especially in a country town like this now i am going to ask a favor of you kits face flushed with excitement he foresaw what it would be what is it he asked i want you to appear in my place this evening do you think i am competent you cannot do my act but you can do enough to satisfy the public but my dear friend i dont want to subject you to any risk if you are at all nervous or afraid dont attempt it i am not afraid said kit confidently i will appear in the evening the tent was full very few knew of the change in the programme mr barlow had consented to the substitution with some reluctance for he feared that kit might be undertaking something beyond his power to perform even the vincenti brothers kits associates were surprised when the manager came forward and said ladies and gentlemen mlle lefroy is indisposed and will be unable to perform her act this evening unwilling to disappoint the public we have substituted one of our youngest and most daring performers who will appear in her place when kit came out his young face glowing with excitement and made his bow the crowd of spectators greeted him with enthusiastic applause his fellow actors joined in the ovation they feared he had overrated his ability but were ready to applaud his pluck now was the time if any for kit to grow nervous and show stage fright but he felt none the sight of the eager faces around him only stimulated him he caught the rope which hung down from the trapeze and quickly climbing up poised himself on his elevated perch he did not allow himself to look down but strove to shut out the sight of the hundreds of upturned faces and proceeded to perform his act as coolly as if he were in a gymnasium only six feet from the ground instead of thirty it is not to be supposed that kit who was a comparative novice could equal mlle louise lefroy who had been cultivating her specialty for ten years he went through several feats however hanging from the trapeze with his head down then quickly recovering himself and swinging by his hands the public was disposed to be pleased and when the act was finished gave him a round of applause later in the evening a small man with a very dark complexion and keen black eyes approached him as he was standing near the lions cage is this luigi vincenti he asked this was kits circus name he passed for a brother of alonzo and antonio vincenti yes sir answered kit i saw your trapeze act this evening he went on it was very good thank you sir you know perhaps that i am not a trapeze performer i only appeared in place of mlle lefroy who is indisposed so i understand but you do very well for a boy my name is signor oponto i am at the head of a large circus in havana my visit to the united states is partly to secure additional talent how long are you engaged to mr barlow for no definite time i suppose i shall remain till the end of the season you have no engagements beyond no sir this is my first season with any circus then i will make you an offer i dont want to take you from mr barlow but when the season is over i shall be ready to arrange for your appearance in havana under my personal management though kit was modest he was human he did feel flattered to find himself rated so high it even occurred to him that he might like to be considered a star in circus circles to be the admiration of circus audiences and to be regarded with wondering awe by boys of his own age throughout the country but kit was also a sensible boy after all this preлminence was only of a physical character a great acrobat or trapeze artist has no recognized place in society and his ambition is of a low character while these reflections were presenting themselves to his mind signor oponto stood by in silence waiting for his answer he thought that kits hesitation was due to pecuniary considerations what salary does mr barlow pay you he asked in a businesslike tone twentyfive dollars a week i will give you fifty and engage you for a year he regarded kit intently to see how this proposal struck him you are very liberal signor oponto kit began but the manager interrupted him i will also pay your board he added and of course defray your expenses to havana is that satisfactory it would be very much so but for one thing what is that i doubt whether i shall remain in the business after this season why not dont you like it yes very well but i prefer to follow some profession of a literary character i am nearly prepared for college and i may decide to continue my studies but even your college students devote most of their time to base ball and rowing i hear not quite so bad as that answered kit with a smile you dont refuse definitely i hope no it may be that i may feel obliged to remain in the business in that case i will give you the preference that is all i can expect here is my card whenever you are ready write to me and your communication will receive instant attention thank you sir the next day mlle lefroy resumed her work the danger of meeting her husband having passed she expressed her gratitude to kit for serving as her substitute and wished to make him a present of ten dollars but he refused to accept it i was glad of the chance to see what i could do on the trapeze he said i never expect to follow it up but i have already received an offer of an engagement in that line so i heard and you dont care to accept it no i do not mean to be a circus performer permanently you are right it leads to nothing and before middle life you are liable to find yourself unfitted for it chapter xxxvi close of the circus days and weeks flew swiftly by september gave place to october and the circus season neared its close already the performers were casting about for employment during the long dull winter that must elapse before the next season what are your plans kit asked antonio vincenti who in private called his young associate by his real name i dont know yet antonio i may go to school have you saved money enough to keep you through the winter yes i have four hundred dollars in the wagon this is the expression made use of to indicate in the hands of the treasurer youve done better than my brother or i we must work during the winter have you any chance yet yes we can go to work in a dime museum in philadelphia for a month and afterwards we will go to chicago where we were last winter i could get a chance for you too thank you but i dont care to work in that way at present if i went anywhere i would go to havana where i am offered a profitable engagement has mr barlow said anything to you about next season yes but i shall make no engagement in advance something may happen which will keep me at home oh youll be coming round in the spring youll have the circus fever like all the rest of us kit smiled and shook his head i havent been in the business long enough to get so much attached to it as you are he said but at any rate i shall come round to see my old friends the last circus performance was given in albany and the winter quarters were to be at a town twenty miles distant kit went through his acts with his usual success and when he took off his circus costume it was with a feeling that it might be the last time he would wear it the breaking up was not to take place till the next day and he was preparing to spend the night in some albany hotel he had taken off his tights as has been said and put on his street dress when a tall man with a frank good humored expression stepped up to him are you christopher watson he asked yes answered kit in surprise for he had no recollection of having met the stranger before of course you dont know me but i was a schoolfellow and intimate friend of your father then said kit cordially i must take you by the hand all my fathers friends are my friends the face of the stranger lighted up thats the way to talk he said i see you are like your father shake hands again but how did you know i was with barlows circus asked kit puzzled your uncle told me have you seen him lately asked kit quickly no i saw him about three months ago at smyrna what did he tell you about me he said you were a wayward lad and preferred traveling with a circus to following an honest business i am afraid you have got a wrong idea of me then bless you i knew your uncle before you were born he is not at all like your father one was as open as the day the other was cunning selfish and foxy i see you understand my uncle stephen as well as i do i ought to were you surprised to hear that i was traveling with a circus well i was but your uncle told me one thing that surprised me more he said that your father left nothing that surprised me too but i have got some light on the subject and i feel in need of a friend and adviser then if youll take henry miller for want of a better i dont believe youll regret it i shall be glad to accept your kind offer mr miller now that you mention your name i remember it very well my father often spoke of you did he so said the stranger evidently much gratified i am glad to hear it of all my school companions your father was the one i liked best and now before we go any further i want to tell you two things first i should have hunted you up sooner but business called me to california where i have considerable property next having learned that you were left destitute i decided to do something for the son of my old friend so i took a hundred shares of stock in a new mine which had just been put on the market when i reached frisco and i said to myself that is for kit watson well it was a lucky investment the shares cost me five dollars apiece and just before i left california i sold them for fifty dollars apiece what do you say to that is it possible mining shares rise in value so fast asked kit in amazement well sometimes they do and sometimes they dont often its the other way and i dont advise you or anybody else that knows nothing about it to speculate in mining shares it is a risky thing and you are more apt to lose than to win however this turned out o k and you are worth five thousand dollars today my boy i dont know how to thank you mr miller said kit i cant seem to realize it you neednt thank me at all i did it for your fathers sake but now that i know you i am glad to do it for your own when we get to new york i advise you to salt it down in government bonds or in some other good reliable stock i shall be glad to follow your advice mr miller then ill invest all but five hundred dollars for you may want to use that what sort of a season have you had ive saved up four hundred dollars said kit proudly you dont say so you must have got pretty good pay twentyfive dollars a week your uncle said you probably got two or three dollars a week he probably thought so he has no idea i have been so well paid i chose to keep it from him you said you wanted to ask my advice about something yes sir why not come round to the delavan and take a room i am staying there and i will tell the clerk to pick you out a room next to mine i will do so i intended to stay at some hotel to night this is the last night of the circus tomorrow we close up and separate i shall draw my money and bid goodby to my circus friends i am glad of that we will keep together i have neither chick nor child kit and if youll accept me as your guardian ill do the best i can for you but perhaps you prefer to go back to your uncle kit shook his head i should never do that he said especially after what i have learned during my trip let it keep till tomorrow for we are both tired now get ready and well go to the delavan kit was assigned a nice room next to mr miller where he passed a comfortable night the next day he revealed to his new friend the discoveries he had made in his uncles old home in pennsylvania his uncles poverty up to the time of his brothers death and the evident falseness of his claim to have lent him large sums of money in payment of which he had coolly appropriated his entire estate his late friend listened to this story in amazement i knew stephen watson to be unprincipled he said but i didnt think him as bad as that he has swindled you shamefully just my idea mr miller while he has carefully feathered his own nest this wrong must be righted it was my intention to find some good lawyer and ask his advice well do it kit but first of all ill go with you to this town in pennsylvania and obtain the necessary testimony sworn to before a justice then well find a good lawyer and move on the enemys works i will be guided by your advice entirely mr miller it will be a satisfaction to me to get even with your uncle to swindle his own nephew in this barefaced manner well bring him up with a short turn kit the next day kit and his new friend left albany chapter xxxvii kit comes home one morning james schuyler kits old acquaintance at smyrna received a letter from kit in which he said our circus season is ended but i am detained a few days by important business i will tell you about it when we meet if you see my uncle tell him that i expect to reach smyrna somewhere about the twentyfifth of october i wonder what kits important business can be thought james i hope it is something of advantage to him james happened to meet stephen watson an hour later mr watson he said i had a letter from kit this morning indeed he says that his circus season is over and he is out of employment said watson his lip curling i suppose so he expects to reach smyrna somewhere about the twentyfifth of the month stephen watson smiled but said nothing no doubt he will find it very convenient to stay at home through the winter he reflected well he must think i am a fool to take back a boy who has defied my authority it was saturday and ralph was home from boardingschool ralph said his father i bring you good news what is it pa your cousin will be home from the circus towards the last of next week who told you did he write you he wrote to james schuyler who told me i suppose he expects you will give him a home through the winter you may rest easy ralph he wont have his own way with me i can assure you what shall you do pa i shall see bickford about taking him back i have occasion to go over there on monday to have the horse shod and i can speak to him about it ralph laughed that will bring down his pride he said i suppose he will beg off he will find me firm as a rock what i decide upon i generally carry through good for you pa i was afraid you would weaken you dont know me my son i have been patient and bided my time your cousin presumed to set up his will against mine he has got along thus far because he has made a living by traveling with a circus now the circus season is at an end and he is glad enough to come back to me on monday stephen watson rode over to oakford and made it in his way to call on aaron bickford have you got a boy mr bickford he asked i had one but he left me last saturday he didnt suit me this was the blacksmiths interpretation of it the truth was the boy became disgusted with the treatment he received and the fare provided at his employers table and left him without ceremony how would you like to take back my nephew has he come back asked the blacksmith pricking up his ears not yet but i expect him back toward the end of next week has he left the circus the circus has left him that is it has closed for the season he has sent word to a boy in smyrna that he will be back in a few days he gave me a great deal of trouble mr watson just so and i thought you might like to get even with him said stephen watson looking significantly at the blacksmith it would do me good to give him a flogging said aaron bickford i shant interfere replied watson the boy has acted badly and he deserves punishment yes ill take him back said the blacksmith i guess hell stay this time he added grimly i think he will have to there wont be any circus to give him employment he is a good strong boy and he can make a good blacksmith if he has a mind to you must make him have a mind to said stephen watson when the horse was shod he got into the carriage and drove away after this interview mr bickford seemed in unusually good spirits so much so that his wife inquired have you had any good luck aaron what makes you ask because you look unusually chipper i was hopin somebody had died and left you a fortune well not exactly wife but ive heard something that makes me feel good whats that stephen watson of smyrna was over here this morning well he says that boy kit is coming home in a few days what if he is hes goin to bring him over here and apprentice him to me again i should think once would be enough considerin how he treated you he aint goin to serve me so again you may bet on that im goin to have my way this time aint you afraid hell run away again not much the circus has shut up and hell have to stay with me or starve his uncle tells me i can punish him when i think he deserves it i hope you wont be disappointed mr bickford but that boys rather hard to handle i know it but im the one that can handle him you thought so before the evening we went to the show i know so this time chapter xxxviii conclusion several days passed on thursday afternoon kit arrived in smyrna accompanied by his generous california friend henry miller they put up at the hotel and after dinner kit walked over to the house occupied by his uncle mr watson saw him from the window and hastening to the door opened it himself good afternoon uncle stephen said kit so youre back said his uncle curtly yes did you expect me james schuyler told me you were coming yes i wrote him that he might inform you that was a good thought of yours i have made arrangements for you what arrangements i shall take you over to oakford on saturday and place you with aaron bickford to learn the blacksmiths trade this time id advise you not to run away kit didnt exhibit any dismay when his uncle informed him of the plan he had arranged for him i will talk this over with you uncle stephen he said with your permission i will go into the house you can stay here till saturday then you will go with me to oakford kit followed his uncle into the house i have something important to say to you uncle stephen he went on sit down and i will tell you what i have discovered within the last few months stephen watson anxiously awaited kits communication can he have found out he asked himself but no it is impossible i will give you five minutes to tell me your astonishing discovery he said with an attempt at his usual sneer i may need a longer time but i will be as quick as i can among the places where our circus exhibited was glendale pennsylvania remembering that you once lived there i made inquiries about you in the village i saw the house where you lived for many years judge of my surprise when i learned that you were always in extreme poverty then i recalled your story of having lent my father ten thousand dollars in payment of which you took the bulk of his property i mentioned it and found that it was pronounced preposterous i discovered that on the other hand you were frequently the recipient of money gifts from my poor father in return for this you have attempted to rob his son the note which you presented against the estate was undoubtedly a forgery but even had it been genuine the property of which you took possession must have amounted to at least twenty thousand dollars stephen watson had not interrupted kit by a word he was panic stricken and absolutely did not know what to say he finally succeeded in answering hoarsely this is an outrageous falsehood christopher watson it is an ingenious scheme to rob me of what rightfully belongs to me you must be a fool to think i am going to be frightened by a boys wild fiction leave my house i would have allowed you to stay till saturday but this is too much if you come here again i will horsewhip you but even when he was making this threat his face was pallid and his glance uneasy at this moment the bell rang kit himself answered the call and returned with his friend henry miller why it is mr miller said stephen watson who had not forgotten that miller was very wealthy when did you return from california kit have you told your uncle asked henry miller ignoring this greeting yes and he orders me to leave the house hark you stephen watson said henry miller sternly you are in a bad box for over a week kit and i have been looking up matters and we are prepared to prove that you have outrageously defrauded him out of his fathers estate we have enlisted a first class lawyer in the case and now we come to you to know whether you will surrender or fight mr miller this is very strange are you in the plot too dont talk of any plots stephen watson your fraud is so transparent that i wonder you dare to hope it would succeed you probably presumed upon kits being a boy of an unsuspicious nature but he has found a friend who was his fathers friend before him and who is determined that he shall be righted i defy you exclaimed stephen watson recklessly for he saw that submission would be ruin and leave him penniless wait a minute ill give you another chance do you know what we are prepared to prove well i will tell you we can prove that you are not only a swindler but a forger and our success will consign you to a prison cell you deserve it no doubt but you shall have a chance what terms do you offer asked stephen watson overwhelmed by the conviction that what miller said was true surrender unconditionally restore to kit his own property and but it will leave me penniless groaned stephen watson just as i supposed in kits behalf i will promise that you shall not starve you once kept a small grocery store and understand the trade we will set you up in that business wherever you choose and will give you besides a small income say three hundred dollars a year so that you may be able to live modestly but ralph my poor boy what will become of him i will pay the expenses of his education said kit and when he leaves school i will make him an allowance so that he can enter a store and qualify himself to earn his own living he wont be able to live as he has lived but he shall not suffer it is more than either of you deserve said henry miller i was not in favor of treating you so generously but kit whom you have defrauded insisted upon it you ought to thank him on your knees stephen watson did not speak he looked the picture of misery do you agree to this asked mr miller i must replied watson sullenly it made a great sensation in smyrna when kit took his proper place as the true master of his dead fathers estate stephen watson left town suddenly and ralph followed him no sorrow was felt for his reverse of fortune for he had made no friends in the town he and ralph settled down in a small western city and started a grocery store from time to time kit receives abject letters pleading for more money and sometimes he sends it but always against the advice of henry miller who says rightly that stephen watson already fares better than he deserves ralph is turning out badly his pride received a severe shock when his cousin was raised above him and he has formed bad habits which in time will wreck him physically unless he turns over a new leaf it is hardly necessary to say that kit decided not to learn the blacksmiths trade his old employer aaron bickford has tried hard to get into his good graces and secure his trade but kit employs another man for whom he has a greater respect kit has made more than one visit to the worthy mayor grant from whom he received so much kindness when a young acrobat and a marked partiality for evelyn the mayors pretty daughter may some day lead to a nearer connection between the families good like bad fortune seldom comes singly and besides recovering his own property kit finds himself the favorite and presumed heir of henry miller the wealthy californian who has taken up his home with our hero last summer they took a trip to california and kit was charmed with the wonderful yosemite valley and the geysers he has decided to become a lawyer though he will be in a position to live without employment of any kind a few months after his return kit read in the paper of the killing of dick hayden the miner in a drunken brawl at coalville he at once took steps to seek out the daughter janet who had rendered him such signal service when he was captured by the ruffians and brought her to smyrna where he provided a happy home for her in a family of his acquaintance nor has kit forgotten his circus friends last year when barlows circus returned from its wanderings he invited those whom he knew best the giant his two brother acrobats and mlle lefroy to pass a week as his guests for the sake of old times and experiences he is always ready to help poor professionals and has been a friend in need to many he knows that with all their weaknesses they are generous to a fault and ready to divide their last dollar with a needy comrade there are some who think kit shows a strange taste in keeping up acquaintance with his old associates but like his friend charlie davis who has also retired from the circus he will always have a kindly feeling for those with whom he traveled when a young acrobat the end
