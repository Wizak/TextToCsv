a scent of sarsaparilla a scent of sarsaparilla ray bradbury mr william finch stood quietly in the dark and blowing attic all morning and afternoon for three days for three days in late november he stood alone feeling the soft white flakes of time falling out of the infinite cold steel sky silently softly feathering the roof and powdering the eaves he stood eyes shut the attic wallowed in seas of wind in the long sunless days creaked every bone and shook down ancient dusts from its beams and warped timbers and lathings it was a mass of sighs and torments that ached all about him where he stood sniffing its elegant dry perfumes and feeling of its ancient heritages ah ah listening downstairs his wife cora could not hear him walk or shift or twitch she imagined she could only hear him breathe slowly out and in like a dusty bellows alone up there in the attic high in the windy house ridiculous she muttered when he hurried down for lunch the third afternoon he smiled at the bleak walls the chipped plates the scratched silverware and even at his wife whats all the excitement she demanded good spirits is all wonderful spirits he laughed he seemed almost hysterical with joy he was seething in a great warm ferment which obviously he had trouble concealing his wife frowned whats that smell smell smell smell sarsaparilla she sniffed suspiciously thats what it is oh it couldnt be his hysterical happiness stopped as quickly as if shed switched him off he seemed stunned ill at ease and suddenly very careful where did you go this morning she asked you know i was cleaning the attic mooning over a lot of trash i didnt hear a sound thought maybe you werent in the attic at all whats that she pointed well now how did those get there he asked the world he peered down at the pair of black springmetal bicycle clips that bound his thin pants cuffs to his bony ankles found them in the attic he answered himself remember when we got out on the gravel road in the early morning on our tandem bike cora forty years ago everything fresh and new if you dont finish that attic today ill come up and toss everything out myself oh no he cried i have everything the way i want it she looked at him coldly cora he said eating his lunch relaxing beginning to enthuse again you know what attics are theyre time machines in which old dimwitted men like me can travel back forty years to a time when it was summer all year round and children raided ice wagons remember how it tasted you held the ice in your handkerchief it was like sucking the flavor of linen and snow at the same time cora fidgeted its not impossible he thought half closing his eyes trying to see it and build it consider an attic its very atmosphere is time it deals in other years the cocoons and chrysalises of another age all the bureau drawers are little coffins where a thousand yesterdays lie in state oh the attics a dark friendly place full of time and if you stand in the very center of it straight and tall squinting your eyes and thinking and thinking and smelling the past and putting out your hands to feel of long ago why it he stopped realizing he had spoken some of this aloud cora was eating rapidly well wouldnt it be interesting he asked the part in her hair if time travel could occur and what more logical proper place for it to happen than in an attic like ours eh its not always summer back in the old days she said its just your crazy memory you remember all the good things and forget the bad it wasnt always summer figuratively speaking cora it was wasnt what i mean is this he said whispering excitedly bending forward to see the image he was tracing on the blank diningroom wall if you rode your unicycle carefully between the years balancing hands out careful careful if you rode from year to year spent a week in a day in a month or a fortnight somewhere else you could stay with summer the rest of your life unicycle you know one of those tall chromium onewheeled bikes singleseater the performers ride in vaudeville shows juggling balance true balance it takes not to fall off to keep the bright objects flying in the air beautiful up and up a light a flash a sparkle a bomb of brilliant colors red yellow blue green white gold all the junes and julys and augusts that ever were in the air about you at once hardly touching your bands flying suspended and you simling among them balance cora balance blah she said blah blah and added blah he climbed the long cold stairs to the attic shivering there were nights in winter when he woke with porcelain in his bones with cool chimes blowing in his ears with frost piercing his nerves in a raw illumination like whitecold fireworks exploding and showering down in flaming snows upon a silent land deep in his subconscious he was cold cold cold and it would take a score of endless summers with their green torches and bronze suns to thaw him free of his wintry sheath he was a great tasteless chunk of brittle ice a snowman put to bed each night full of confetti dreams tumbles of crystal and flurry and there lay winter outside forever a great leaden wine press smashing down its colorless lid of sky squashing them all like so many grapes mashing color and sense and being from everyone save the children who fled on skis and toboggans down mirrored hills which reflected the crushing iron shield that hung lower above town each day and every eternal night mr finch lifted the attic trap door but here here a dust of summer sprang up about him the attic dust simmered with heat left over from other seasons quietly he shut the trap door down he began to smile the attic was quiet as a thundercloud before a storm on occasion cora finch heard her husband murmuring murmuring high up there at five in the afternoon singing my isle of golden dreams mr finch flipped a crisp new straw hat in the kitchen door boo did you sleep all afternoon snapped his wife i called up at you four times and no answer sleep he considered this and laughed then put his hand quickly over his mouth well i guess i did suddenly she saw him my god she cried whered you get that coat he wore a red candystriped coat a high white choking collar and ice cream pants you could smell the straw hat like a handful of fresh hay fanned in the air found em in an old trunk she sniffed dont smell of moth balls looks brandnew oh no he said hastily he looked stiff and uncomfortable as she eyed his costume this isnt a summerstock company she said cant a fellow have a little fun thats all youve ever had she slammed the oven door while ive stayed home and knitted lord knows youve been down at the store helping ladies elbows in and out doors he refused to be bothered cora he looked deep into the crackling straw hat wouldnt it be nice to take a sunday walk the way we used to do with your silk parasol and your long dress whishing along and sit on those wirelegged chairs at the soda parlor and smell the drugstore the way they used to smell why dont drugstores smell that way any more and order two sarsaparillas for us cora and then ride out in our ford to hannahans pier for a box supper and listen to the brass band how about it suppers ready take that dreadful uniform off if you could make a wish and take a ride on those oaklaned country roads like they had before cars started rushing would you do it he insisted watching her those old roads were dirty we came home looking like africans anyway she picked up a sugar jar and shook it this morning i had forty dollars here now its gone dont tell me you ordered those clothes from a costume house theyre brandnew they didnt come from any trunk im he said she raved for half an hour but he could not bring himself to say anything the november wind shook the house and as she talked the snows of winter began to fall again in the cold steel sky answer me she cried are you crazy spending our money that way on clothes you cant wear the attic he started to say she walked off and sat in the living room the snow was falling fast now and it was a cold dark november evening she heard him climb up the stepladder slowly into the attic into that dusty place of other years into that black place of costumes and props and time into a world separate from this world below he closed the trap door down the flashlight snapped on was company enough yes here was all of time compressed in a japanese paper flower at the touch of memory everything would unfold into the clear water of the mind in beautiful blooms in spring breezes larger than life each of the bureau drawers slid forth might contain aunts and cousins and grandmamas ermined in dust yes time was here you could feel it breathing an atmospheric instead of a mechanical clock now the house below was as remote as another day in the past he half shut his eyes and looked and looked on every side of the waiting attic here in prismed chandelier were rainbows and mornings and noons as bright as new rivers flowing endlessly back through time his flashlight caught and flickered them alive the rainbows leapt up to curve the shadows back with colors with colors like plums and strawberries and concord grapes with colors like cut lemons and the sky where the clouds drew off after storming and the blue was there and the dust of the attic was incense burning and all of time burning and all you need do was peer into the flames it was indeed a great machine of time this attic he knew he felt he was sure and if you touched prisms here doorknobs there plucked tassels chimed crystals swirled dust punched trunk hasps and gusted the vox humana of the old hearth bellows until it puffed the soot of a thousand ancient fires into your eyes if indeed you played this instrument this warm machine of parts if you fondled all of its bits and pieces its levers and changers and movers then then then he thrust out his hands to orchestrate to conduct to flourish there was music in his head in his mouth shut tight and he played the great machine the thunderously silent organ bass tenor soprano low high and at last at last a chord that shuddered him so that he had to shut his eyes about nine oclock that night she heard him calling cora she went upstairs his head peered down at her from above smiling at her he waved his hat goodby cora what do you mean she cried ive thought it over for three days and im saying goodby come down out of there you fool i drew five hundred dollars from the bank yesterday ive been thinking about this and then when it happened well cora he shoved his eager hand down for the last time will you come along with me in the attic hand down that stepladder william finch ill climb up there and run you out of that filthy place im going to hannahans pier for a bowl of clam chowder he said and im requesting the brass band to play moonlight bay oh come on cora he mo tioned his extended hand she simply stared at his gentle questioning face goodby he said he waved gently gently then his face was gone the straw hat was gone william she screamed the attic was dark and silent shrieking she ran and got a chair and used it to groan her way up into the musty darkness she flourished a flashlight william william the dark spaces were empty a winter wind shook the house then she saw the far west attic window ajar she fumbled over to it she hesitated held her breath then slowly she opened it the ladder was placed outside the window leading down onto a porch roof she pulled back from the window outside the opened frame the apple trees shone bright green it was twilight of a summer day in july faintly she heard explosions firecrackers going off she heard laughter and distant voices rockets burst in the warm air softly red white and blue fading she slammed the window and stood reeling william wintry november light glowed up through the trap in the attic floor behind her bent to it she saw the snow whispering against the cold clear panes down in that november world where she would spend the next thirty years she did not go near the window again she sat alone in the black attic smelling the one smell that did not seem to fade it lingered like a sigh of satisfaction on the air she took a deep long breath the old the familiar the unforgettable scent of drugstore sarsaparilla
