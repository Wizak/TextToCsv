cradle by arthur c clarke gentry lee the emerald water smashes against the dark volcanic cliffs fine white spray hovers over the harsh rock creating a misty veil that glimmers in the fading light in the distance two yellow suns set simultaneously separated by about forty degrees as they disappear together below the horizon across the blueblack sky on the opposite side of the isthmus that slopes gently downward from the volcanic cliffs to another ocean a pair of full moons rise as the two suns vanish their twin moonlight although much weaker than the shine of the disappearing suns is still strong enough to create dancing moon shadows on the ocean beneath the rocky overhang as the dual moons rise on the eastern side of the isthmus light begins to glow on the horizon beside them about twenty degrees to the south at first the glow looks like the light of a distant city but with each passing moment it brightens until it spreads across the sky at length an awesome third moon its first chord coming over the horizon when the twin moons are maybe ten degrees into their arc begins to rise calm descends on both oceans for a few seconds as if the world beneath the giant orb has paused to give homage to the spectacular sight this great yellow moon its face clearly scarred by craters appears to be surveying its dominion as it slowly rises in the sky and bathes the emerald oceans in a mysterious reflected light it is a hundred times the size of the smaller twin moons and its wide swath through the sky is greater in size than that cut minutes before by the pair of setting suns below the cliffs in the shadow of the newest moon a long sinuous object arcs its way out of the water rising nearly twenty feet above the surface the slender apparition twists itself toward the cliffs and thrusts itself forward as the piercing sound of a trumpet a solo blast reverberates against the rocks and carries across the isthmus a moment later another sound is heard a muted echo or possibly a reply from the other sea the creature swims gracefully into the moonlight its long lithe neck a cobalt blue above a gray body mostly submerged in the ocean now the bluenecked serpent extends itself upward again and leans toward the land its face revealed in the expanding moonlight the facial features are convoluted and complex with rows of orifices of unknown purpose at the peak of its extension the creature contorts its face and a medley of sounds is heard the trumpet blast is now accompanied by an oboe and an organ after a short pause a muted response quieter but with the same rich complexity of sound comes back across the isthmus the serpent swims north along the shore behind it in the moonlight half a dozen other swirling necks rise from the ocean these creatures are a little smaller the hues of their cobalt necks not quite so vivid this ensemble turns as one on cue and blasts six trumpet calls to the east again a pause precedes the expected response the sound of several smaller trumpets from across the land immediately the six new creatures and their distant friends begin a complex interleaved musical pattern slowly building in intensity until the overture reaches an inevitable crescendo and then abruptly abates after a few moments more the oceans on both sides of the isthmus become alive with teeming serpents of all sizes hundreds even thousands of serpents covering the water for as far as the eye can see begin languorously extending their necks twisting as if looking around and joining in the singing the serpents of the eastern sea are slightly smaller than their western cousins the necks of the eastern serpents are pale blue instead of cobalt these pale blue serpents are also joined by a nursery of tiny creatures the palest of blue markings on their necks whose singing is highpitched and a trifle erratic and sounds like piccolos interspersed with crystal bells the waters of the emerald oceans begin to surge forward in tidal frenzy now rapidly moving up the rocky cliffs on the western side and quickly submerging great chunks of land on the sloping side that runs to the eastern ocean the concerted pull of all the moons produces a tide that will eventually cover the isthmus completely uniting the two oceans as the waters draw ever closer together the music from the thousand singing serpents swells to magnificence flooding the entire area with a sound of mesmerizing beauty it is also a plaintive sound of longing and anticipation the universal cry of longsuppressed desire on the verge of being satisfied the great longnecked serpents of canthor conclude their annual mating symphony as the two oceans become one and the inhabitants of each ocean seek out their lifelong mates in the united waters there are five nights out of each canthorean year when the tidal forces act together to submerge the isthmus and permit the sexual mixing of the serpents five nights of love play and frolicking of renewal and promise before the requisite return to the separate oceans and a year of waiting for the great tide to come again for the little ones the new serpents placed into gestation by the last annual gathering and hatched by their mothers in the eastern ocean the great tide is a time of excitement and sadness they must now separate from their playmates leave their infancy behind half must depart from their mothers as well and go to swim among the cobalt blue adults that they have never met this half having lived their lives among their mothers friends exclusively will swim above and across the isthmus on the fifth night alongside their fathers once into the western ocean their pale blue necks will begin to deepen in color as they begin the transition through puberty into adulthood and next year their tiny voices will have matured just enough that each of them may detect some arousing and positive response to his call during the mating symphony thousands of years pass on the planet canthor the forces of change conspire against the beautiful bluenecked serpents first a major ice age comes to the world locking up more of the planets water in perennial polar caps and lowering the seas the number of days that the great tide submerges the isthmus is reduced to four then three and finally only two the elaborate mating ritual of the serpents worked out over hundreds of generations works best for a fivenight courtship for the several hundred years that only two nights are available for mating the number of serpent offspring produced each year drops precipitously the total number of canthorean serpents becomes dangerously small at length the radiative output of the dual suns increases slightly again and canthor emerges from its ice age the sea level rises and the number of days for mating returns eventually to five the serpent symphony which had added a saddened counterpoint during the trying years of reduced mating nights again becomes charged with joy for several generations the number of serpents increases but then the lovely creatures encounter another foe evolving elsewhere on canthor for almost a million years has been another intelligent species a fierce squat creature with an insatiable appetite for control the ice age stimulated the rapid evolution of these trolls by enforcing a strict survival of the fittest that naturally selected those individuals with the most resources and in a sense purified the troll gene pool the troll species that emerges from the thousands of years of ice domination on canthor is sharper and more capable of dealing with the rest of its environment it has become a tool maker and has learned how to use the riches of the planet for its benefit no other living creatures on canthor can match the cleverness of the trolls or threaten their existence so the trolls proliferate around the planet dominating it completely with their rapaciousness the bluenecked serpents have had no natural enemies on canthor for hundreds of millennia therefore they have not retained the aggression and territoriality necessary to survive when threatened their diet has always consisted primarily of plants and animals that fill the canthorean oceans the seas provide a virtual cornucopia of food so it does not make much of an impression upon the serpents when the trolls begin to farm the oceans for their own food to the trolls however whose greed for territory knows no bounds the serpents represent at least a rival for the plenty of the oceans and possibly because of their size and intelligence even a survival threat it is again the time of the great tide and the male longnecked serpents have completed their ocean migration on time swarming as usual just opposite the great volcanic cliffs there are only a few hundred male serpents now down markedly from the halcyon years when they were so numerous they stretched as far as the eye could see the giant full moon rises as it has for thousands of years following the twin smaller moons into the sky and the overture announces the coming mating symphony but as the tide rolls in to submerge the isthmus the serpents sense that something is wrong a growing cacophony creeps into the mystical mating song anxiety spreads by sound across both sides of the land separating the serpents when the tide finally surges over the top of the volcanic rocks the point in the original mating symphony for the magnificent final crescendo the sound of the serpents pleading wail fills the canthorean night the trolls have erected a huge barrier down the spine of the isthmus carefully calculated to be just tall enough to preclude passage to the largest of the serpents this oppressive barrier allows the lovely bluenecked creatures if they strain to sense one another at close range but not to touch the nights of the great tide are extremely painful to watch from both sides the serpents hurl themselves repeatedly and ineffectually at the wall trying desperately to make contact with their mates but it is all in vain the barrier holds the serpents are unable to mate both sexes return eventually to their respective oceans deeply saddened and profoundly aware of the implications of the barrier for their future some of the serpents batter themselves nearly senseless as they try to break down the wall these wounded ones on both sides of the isthmus remain behind to recover while the rest of the species resuming the annual migration as if the normal mating had indeed taken place slowly and sadly swim away each sex heading for a separate reach of canthor it is two nights after the great tide has stopped submerging the land between the oceans two older male serpents their necks still bruised from the repeated bootless hammerings against the hated barrier are swimming slowly together in the moonlight a strange light in the sky comes swiftly upon them from above it hovers over the serpents seeming to spotlight them as they crane their necks to see what is happening in a moment the graceful necks keel forward and slap down upon the moonlit ocean from out of the light above them comes an object a basket of some kind that descends to the water the two serpents are scooped up lifted silently out of the sea into the air reeled in by some unknown fisherman in the sky above them the same scene repeats a dozen times first in the western ocean with the wounded serpents whose necks are cobalt blue then in the eastern ocean with their pale blue counterparts it is as if a great roundup is taking place removing all the exhausted serpents who had been unable to take their place with the rest of the species in the annual migration far above canthor a gigantic cylindrical spaceship awaits the return of its robot minions twenty miles on a side this traveling planet opens itself to a fleet of returning vehicles the size of large airplanes that bring back the quarry from canthor the cylinder rotates slowly as canthor and its giant moon shine in the background a solo laggard vehicle returns a door opens to receive it in the back of the larger craft and for a while there is no more activity at length the cylinder tips over on its side and fires several small rockets it is out of sight in seconds departing canthor for other worlds the snow falls steadily on the huge man trudging silently through the forest clad in skins carrying a heavy load on his back and a large spear in one hand he turns his hairy unkempt face toward the others behind him his family and grunts at them to hurry there are five altogether an infant carried by the woman and two teenage children the teenagers are wearing skins like their parents and have large bundles slung across their backs the teenage boy is also carrying a spear at close distance all of them look very weary almost exhausted they break free from the forest for a moment and enter a meadow that surrounds a frozen pond the snow continues to fall adding to the three inches that already cover the ground the father motions to his family to stop and approaches the pond gingerly as the others huddle together against the cold the man takes a crude tool from his bundle and after brushing the snow off the surface of the pond in a small area begins to cut the ice almost an hour passes finally he succeeds utters a grunt of happiness and bends down to drink the water he pulls out a skin fills it and brings the water to his wife and children the teenage daughter smiles at her father a smile of love and admiration as he offers her the water her face is tired etched with the lines of sun and wind and cold she reaches up to take the skin suddenly her face contorts with fear she screams and her father turns just in time to protect himself from a snarling wolf midair in an attack he strikes the wolf full force with his powerful arm knocking it away from its target and then stumbles toward his spear on the ground beside the pond he grabs the spear and turns around quickly prepared to defend his family three wolves have attacked them his son has deftly impaled one of the wolves through the midriff with his spear but now a second wolf has pinioned the boy defenseless in the snow before he has been able to withdraw his weapon and strike again in a frenzy the father jumps forward and thrusts his spear into the wolf attacking his son but it is too late the hungry wolf had already found the boys throat severing the jugular vein with one quick snap of his powerful jaws whirling around the caveman moves against the last of the wolves his wife lies bleeding in the snow and his infant child is unprotected screaming in its wrappings some twenty feet from the mother the last wolf wary of the huge man feints an attack against the father and then leaps for the baby before the man can respond the wolf has grabbed the baby by its clothes and headed off for the forest the young girl was spared physical injury in the attack but was devastated by the near instant death of her brother and the disappearance of her tiny sister she holds her dead brothers hand and sobs uncontrollably the father stuffs virgin snow in the wifes wounds and then lifts her upon his back along with the heavy bundles he grunts a couple of times to his daughter and she finally reluctantly picks herself up and starts gathering what remains of the familys things into another bundle as night falls the three surviving members of the family are approaching some caves at the edge of the forest the father is near exhaustion from the weight of his wife and the familys meager belongings he sits down to rest for a moment his daughter stumbles down beside him placing her head in his lap she cries silently and her father tenderly wipes away her tears a bright light suddenly shines down on them from above and an instant later all three are unconscious a tethered metallic basket about fifteen feet long and five feet wide descends in the eerie snowy light and comes to rest softly on the ground beside the three humans the sides of the basket drop and metal belts extend themselves outward wrapping around each of the people they are pulled into the basket the sides of the basket are closed and the strange object then ascends into the snowy night seconds later the spotlight disappears and life returns to normal in the prehistoric forest above the earth the giant cylinder sits quietly waiting for its messengers to return the planet below is nearly cloudless and the great blue stretches of ocean tremble like jewels in the reflected sunlight near the evening terminator the low sun angles show a vast expanse of ice extending down from the north pole covering almost all of a large continent to the west across a great ocean and an all white northern island the midday sun shines on another large continent it is also mostly covered by ice here the ice extends southward across two thirds of the land mass and only disappears completely as the continent begins to taper and the southern sea is reached the hunting shuttles sent out from the great cylinder return to their base and unload their prey the father injured mother and teenage daughter are inside the small shuttle craft along with fifty to sixty other humans obviously selected from disparate points around the world none of the humans is moving after the shuttle safely docks with the mother ship all the prehistoric humans are moved in a large van to a receiving station here they are admitted and catalogued and then taken inside a vast module that recreates the environment of earth far above the earth the last of the drone scouts returns to the giant cylinder there is a momentary pause as if some unknown checklist were being verified and then the cylindrical space vehicle disappears thursday they were there on the beach at sunrise sometime during the night seven whales had run aground at deer key five miles east of key west the powerful leviathans of the deep ten to fifteen feet long looked helpless as they lay floundering on the sand another half dozen members of this misguided pod of false killer whales were swimming in circles in the shallow lagoon just off the beach obviously lost and confused by seven oclock on the clear march morning whale experts from key west had arrived and were already beginning to coordinate what would later become a concerted effort by local fishermen and boating enthusiasts to push the beached animals back into the lagoon once the whales were off the beach the next task would be to coax the entire pod into the gulf of mexico there was little or no chance that the animals would survive unless they could be returned to open water carol dawson was the first reporter to arrive she parked her sporty new korean station wagon on the shoulder of the road just off the beach and jumped out to analyze the situation the beach and lagoon at deer key formed a cove that was shaped like a half moon an imaginary cord connecting the two points of land at the ends of the cove would extend almost half a mile across the water outside the cord was the gulf of mexico the seven whales had penetrated the cove in the center and were beached at the point farthest from the open sea they were about thirty feet apart and maybe twentyfive feet up on the sand the rest of the whales were trapped in the shallows no more than a hundred feet offshore carol walked around to the back of her station wagon before pulling out a large photographic case she stopped to adjust the strings on her pants inside the case was a collection of cameras both still and video she selected three of the cameras popped a couple of m ms from an old package into her mouth and approached the beach as she walked across the sand toward the people and the beached whales carol stopped occasionally to photograph the scene carol first approached a man wearing a uniform from the south florida marine research center he was facing the ocean and talking to two naval officers from the marine patrol section of the us naval air station in key west a dozen or so local volunteers were in close orbit around the speakers keeping their distance but listening intently to the discussion carol walked up to the man from the research center and took him by the arm good morning jeff she said he turned to look at her after a moment a vague smile of recognition crossed his face carol dawson miami herald she said quickly we met one night at moi i was with dale michaels sure i remember you he said how could i forget a gorgeous face like yours after a moment he continued but what are you doing here as far as i know nobody in the world knew these whales were here until an hour ago and miami is over a hundred miles away carol laughed her eyes politely acknowledging and thanking jeff for the compliment she still didnt like it but had grudgingly grown to accept the fact that people men especially remembered her for her looks i was already in key west on another story dale called me this morning as soon as he heard about the whales can i interrupt you for just a minute and get some expert comments for the record of course as she was speaking carol reached down and picked up a video camera one of the newest models a sony about the size of a small notebook and began interviewing dr jeff marsden the leading authority on whales in the florida keys the interview was standard stuff of course and carol could have herself supplied all the answers but ms dawson was a good reporter and knew the value of an expert in situations like this dr marsden explained that marine biologists still did not understand the reasons for whale beachings although their increased frequency in the late eighties and early nineties had provided ample opportunities for research according to him most experts blamed the beachings on infestations of parasites in the individual whales leading each of the unfortunate pods the prevailing theory suggests that these parasites confuse the intricate navigation systems telling the whales where to go in other words the lead whale somehow thinks his migration path is onto the beach and across the land the others follow because of the rigorous hierarchy in the pod ive heard some people say dr marsden that the increase in whale beachings is due to us and our pollution would you care to comment on the accusation that our wastes as well as our acoustic and electronic pollution have undermined the sensitive biosystems that the whales use to navigate carol used the zoom on her tiny video camera to record the furrowing of jeff marsdens brow he was clearly not expecting such a leading question from her this early in the morning after thinking for a moment he answered there have been several attempts to explain why there are so many more beachings now than were recorded in the past most researchers come to the inescapable conclusion that something in the whales environment has changed in the last halfcentury it is not too farfetched to imagine that we may well have been responsible for the changes carol knew she had the right quotes for a perfect short piece for television she then quickly and professionally wrapped up the interview thanked dr marsden and walked over to the onlookers in a minute she had plenty of volunteers to take her out into the lagoon so that she could take some closeup photographs of the confused whales within five minutes not only had carol finished several discs of still photographs but she also had rigged up her video camera with a stabilizing tripod on one of the little boats and done a video clip of herself explaining the beachings before leaving the beach at deer key carol dawson opened up the back of her station wagon it served her well as a portable photo laboratory she first rewound and checked the video tape that she had taken listening particularly to hear if the splashing of the whales could be heard behind her while she was in the boat then she popped the discs from the still cameras into readers to see if she liked all the photographs they were good she smiled to herself closed the back of the station wagon and drove back to key west carol finished the redundant transfer of the videotape through the modem to joey hernandez in miami and then called another number she was sitting in one of the private cubicles inside the large new communications room at the key west marriott the screen in front of carol indicated that the connection for her new number had been made but there was not yet any picture she heard a womans voice say good morning dr michaels office good morning bernice its carol im on video the monitor cleared up in a second and a pleasant middleaged woman appeared oh hi carol ill tell dale youre on the line carol smiled as she watched bernice swivel her chair and roll over to a panel of buttons on her left bernice was almost surrounded by her desk in front of her were a couple of keyboards connected to two large screens a variety of disc drives and what looked like a phone embedded in another monitor apparently there had been no room for the communications panel right next to the phone so bernice had to roll three to four feet in her chair to signal to dr dale michaels that he had a call that it was on video that it was carol and that it was coming from key west dr dale as he was known by everyone except carol liked to have plenty of information before he answered the phone both to bernices left and right were perpendicular extensions to the desk upon which were arrayed stacks of floppy discs of different sizes interleaved with groups of magazines and manila folders containing hard copy printout from the computers bernice pushed a button on the panel but nothing happened she looked apologetically at carol on the screen above the phone im sorry carol bernice was a little flustered maybe i didnt do it right dr dale had a new system installed this week again and im not certain one of the two large monitors flashed a message oh good bernice continued now smiling i did it right hell be with you in a minute he has someone in there with him and will finish quickly so he can see you and speak with you i hope you dont mind if i put you on hold carol nodded and bernices image faded away from the screen on the monitor carol now watched the beginning of a short tutorial documentary on oyster farming the piece was beautifully filmed underwater using the most advanced photographic equipment the narration featured the mellifluous voice of dr dale and the video pointed out the connection between the inventions at moi and the rapid rise of sea farming of all kinds but carol had to laugh playing quietly behind the narration and increasing in volume during periods of narrative silence was pachelbels canon it was dales favorite piece of mood music but it seemed strange to her to listen to the lilting strings as the cameras moved in for closeups of growing oysters the oyster story was abruptly discontinued in medias res and the screen dissolved to the interior of a large executive office dale michaels was sitting on a couch across the room from his modem desk looking at one of three video monitors that could be seen in the room good morning again carol he said enthusiastically so how did it go and where are you i didnt know that they had videos in the marriott rooms yet dr michaels was tall and slim blond his hair was slightly curly and receding just a trace at the temples he flashed a ready smile that was too quick almost practiced but his green eyes were warm and open im down in the comm room here at the hotel carol answered i just sent the whale beaching story off to the herald on disc jesus dale i felt so sorry for those poor animals how can they be so smart and still get their directions so fouled up we dont know carol dale replied but remember that our definition of intelligence and the whales definition are almost certainly completely different besides its not that surprising that they trust their internal navigation system even when it leads them to disaster can you imagine a situation in which you would essentially disregard information that your eyes were giving you its the same thing were talking here about a malfunction in their primary sensor carol was quiet for a moment i guess i can see what youre saying she said finally but it hurt to see them so helpless oh well anyway i got the story on video too incidentally the new integrated video technology is superb the marriott here just installed a new higher data rate modem for video and i was able to transfer the entire eightminute piece to joey hernandez at channel in only two minutes he loved it he does the noon news you know catch it if you can and tell me what you think carol paused just a beat and by the way dale thanks again for the tip just glad to help dale was beaming he loved it when he could help carol with her career he had been pursuing her singlemindedly in his left brain scientific way for almost a year and a half but he had been unable to convince her that a permanent relationship would be mutually beneficial or at least he thought that was the problem i think this whale thing could be a great cover carol was saying you know i was worried about attracting too much attention with your telescope and the treasure hunter bit just doesnt fit if someone down here recognizes me but i think i can use a whale followup story as the pretense what do you think sounds reasonable to me dale answered incidentally there have been a couple of other whale irregularities reported as well this morning a partial pod beaching up at sanibel and a supposed attack on a fishing boat north of marathon the owner was vietnamese and highly excitable of course its almost unheard of that false killers attack anything related to humans but maybe you can use the whole thing somehow carol saw that he was already up from the couch and walking around his office dr dale michaels had so much energy it was almost impossible for him to sit still or relax he was just a few months away from his fortieth birthday but he still had the zest and enthusiasm of a teenager just try not to let anyone from the navy know that you have the telescope he continued they called again this morning and asked for a third set of equipment i told them the third telescope was loaned out and being used for research whatever it is that theyre looking for must be very important he turned and looked at the camera and very secret this guy lieutenant todd reminded me again this morning as soon as i made a normal scientific inquiry that it was navy business and he couldnt tell me anything about it carol made some notes on a small spiral pad you know dale she began again i thought this story had tremendous potential as soon as you mentioned it to me yesterday everything indicates that something unusual and secret is going on with the navy i myself was amused by the amateur way that todd stonewalled me on the phone yesterday and then demanded to know who had given me his name i told him that a source in the pentagon had suggested that there was some highpriority activity at the naval air station in key west and that he todd was associated with it he seemed to buy it and im convinced that the bozo navy public affairs guy here knows nothing at all about anything that might be happening carol yawned and quickly put her hand over her mouth well its too late to go back to bed i guess ill exercise and then go find that boat we talked about i feel as if im looking for a needle in a haystack but your guess could be right anyway ill start with the map you gave me and if they really have lost a cruise missile somewhere down here and are trying to cover it up it would certainly be a great scoop for me talk to you later dale waved goodbye and hung up carol left the communications area and walked out to the end of the hotel she had an oceanfront room on the first floor the herald wouldnt pay for that kind of luxury but she had decided to splurge anyway this time and pamper herself as she was changing into her skintight workout swimsuit she mused to herself about her conversation with dale nobody would ever know she thought that dale and i are lovers or at least sex partners its all so businesslike as if were teammates or something no darlings or dears she paused for a moment and then completed her thought did i make it that way she wondered it was almost nine oclock and the resort was in the process of waking up when carol walked out of her room and onto the hotel grounds on the beach the staff had just arrived and were setting out the chaises and umbrellas on the sand for the early risers carol walked over to the young man in charge and informed him that she was going for a long exercise swim twice at hotels previously she had forgotten to tell the guardians of the beach that she was going to swim a half mile away from the shore both times she had been rescued much to her dismay and had created an untoward scene as carol worked into the rhythm of her freestyle stroke she began to feel the release of tension the loosening of the knots that bound her most of the time although she told most other people that she exercised regularly to stay fit the real reason carol spent at least fortyfive minutes each morning running swimming or walking briskly was that she needed the exercise to deal with her fastpaced life only after hard exercise could she really feel calm and at peace with her world it was normal for carol to let her mind drift idly from subject to subject while she was swimming long distances this morning she remembered swimming long ago in the cold waters of the pacific ocean near laguna beach in california carol had been eight years old at the time and had gone to a birthday party given by a friend jessica was her name whom carol had met at soccer camp during the summer jessica was rich her house had cost more than a million dollars and jessica had more toys and dolls than carol could possibly imagine hmm carol was thinking as she recalled jessicas party and the clowns and the ponies that was when i still believed in fairy tales that was before the separation and divorce her watch alarm sounded breaking her reverie and carol turned around in the water and headed back to shore as she did so she saw something strange out of the corner of her eye no more than twenty yards from her a great whale broke the water sending chills down her spine and adrenaline rushing into her system the whale disappeared underwater and despite the fact that carol treaded water for a couple of minutes and scanned the horizon she never saw him again at length carol began swimming back toward shore her heart rate had started to return to normal after the bizarre encounter and now she was thinking about her lifelong fascination with whales she remembered having a toy whale from sea world in san diego when she was seven what was his name shammy shamu something like that then carol remembered an earlier experience one she had not thought about for twentyfive years carol was five or six and sitting in her room ready for bed as requested and her father came into the room carrying a picture book they sat together on the bed and leaned against the wallpaper with yellow flowers while he read to her she loved it when he put his arm around her and turned the pages in her lap she felt protected and comfortable he read to her a story about a whale that seemed human and a man named captain ahab the pictures were frightening one in particular showed a boat being tossed about by a giant whale with a harpoon stuck in his back when her father tucked her in that night he seemed to linger in the room showering her with tender hugs and kisses she saw tears in his eyes and asked him if anything was wrong her father just shook his head and told her that he loved her so much sometimes it made him cry carol was so deep in this vivid memory that she wasnt paying attention to where she was swimming she had drifted west with the current and could now barely see the hotel it took her a few minutes to orient herself and head back in the right direction lieutenant richard todd waited impatiently while the data processing assistant made the last corrections on the master sheets come on come on the meeting is supposed to start in five minutes and we have a couple more changes to make the poor girl was clearly hassled by the navy officer hanging over her shoulder while she worked at the design monitor she corrected a couple of spelling errors on one sheet and pushed the return key on the screen in front of her appeared a computer linedrawn map of south florida and the keys with a light pen she tried to follow lieutenant todds instructions and highlight the specific areas described by him there he said finally thats good that finishes the group now hit the hard copy repro button whats the initial key brok good on the top secret data base all right todays password matisse lieutenant she answered standing up to walk around the machine and pick up a single collated hard copy of his presentation todd had a blank look on his face he was a french painter the girl said sarcastically matisse in case youre wondering todd signed out for his copy of the material and then scribbled the spelling of matisse on a sheet of scratch paper he awkwardly thanked the girl in a minimal way and left the room heading out of the building and across the street the conference center for the us naval air station in key west was next door it was a brandnew building of modem design one of the few edifices on the base to break the architectural monotone that could best be described as white stucco world war ii lieutenant todd worked in one of the nondescript white buildings as head of special projects for the site todd and his group were essentially troubleshooters for the command crackerjack systems engineers who were moved from project to project depending upon where they were needed todd himself was twentyeight an annapolis graduate in aerospace engineering a gungho navy bachelor who had grown up in littleton a suburb of denver in colorado todd was ambitious and in a hurry he felt as if he were out of the mainstream down here in key west and longed for a chance to move to somewhere he could really prove his mettle a weapons design center for example or even the pentagon the sign on the door in the conference center read top secret broken arrow lieutenant todd checked his watch one minute remained before the time for the meeting he entered an alphanumeric code into the door lock and walked into the back of a midsized conference room with three large screens in the front his group of five younger officers and a couple of members of the senior staff had already arrived they were standing around the coffee and donuts that were on a table at the left commander vernon winters was sitting alone at the center of a long table that ran across the room and virtually bisected it he was facing the screens with his back to the entrance all right all right winters said first looking around the room and then at the digital time printout in the upper left corner of the front wall lets get started are you ready lieutenant todd the other officers sat down at the table at the last minute another senior staff officer entered the room and took a seat in one of the chairs at the back todd walked around the table to the front of the room to a podium with a builtin keyboard underneath a small monitor and eyed commander winters yes sir he answered he activated the computer system in the podium todd indicated that he wanted access to the top secret data base he then entered a complicated keyed input that was the first pan of a password system the interactive monitor in the podium next requested the password of the day todds first attempt was unsuccessful for he hadnt remembered the correct spelling he began to search his pockets for the piece of scrap paper the only other keyboard in the room was in the center of the long table where winters was sitting while lieutenant todd fumbled around at the podium the commander smiled entered the password and then added some code of his own the center screen came alive in vivid color and showed a stylized woman in a yellow dress sitting at a piano while two young boys played checkers behind her a sense of red flooded forth from the picture it was a reproduction of one of matisses paintings from his late years in nice and was magnificently projected at the front of the room lieutenant todd looked startled a couple of the senior officers laughed winters smiled engagingly there are some fairly amazing things that can be done with the resolution power of a kbyk image and a nearly infinite data base there was an awkward silence and then winters continued i guess its hopeless to keep trying to expand the education of you young officers on this base go on continue ive put you already into the top secret data base and any new input will override the picture todd composed himself this man winters is certainly a queer duck he thought the admiral who was the commanding officer of the key west base had assigned the commander last night to lead this important panther missile investigation winters had an impressive background in missiles and in systems engineering but whoever heard of starting such a critical meeting by calling a painting up on the screen todd now entered brok and after counting the people the number nine in a few seconds a machine in the back corner of the room had copies of the presentation collated and stapled for the use of the participants todd called his first image to the center screen with another touch of the keyboard yesterday morning he began a demonstration test for the new panther missile was conducted over the north atlantic the missile was fired at from an airplane at eighty thousand feet off the coast of labrador it was aimed at a target near the bahamas one of our old aircraft carriers after flying a normal ballistic trajectory into the region where the ship was located the panther was supposed to activate its terminal guidance that uses the advanced pattern recognition system or aprs the missile should then have found the aircraft carrier and using the reaction control jets as its primary control authority made whatever vernier corrections were necessary to impact the old carrier on the main deck todd pushed a key on the podium and a line drawing map of the american east coast including the area from labrador through cuba appeared on the left screen the missile was a final test version he continued in the exact configuration of the production flight vehicle except for the command test set and the warhead this was to be the longest test flight yet conducted and was designed to demonstrate thoroughly the new version of the software that was recently installed in the aprs so of course the missile was not armed the lieutenant picked up a light pen from the podium and marked on the small monitor in front of him his markings were immediately translated to the larger screen behind him so that everyone could easily follow his discussion on the screen you all can see the predicted versus actual overflight path of the bird yesterday here roughly ten miles east of cape canaveral on what appeared to be a nominal flight the sequencer turned on the cameras after a couple of hundred calibration images sort of a selftest of the aprs the terminal guidance algorithms were activated as scheduled as far as we can tell from the realtime telemetry nothing strange had occurred until this time the right screen now showed a detailed map of south florida and the keys that included the target in the bahamas the maps on the two flanking screens remained in view during the rest of his presentation but lieutenant todd constantly changed the word charts in the middle to keep up with the discussion the a priori location of the target which was where the cameras should first have looked for the aircraft carrier was here at eleuthera in the bahamas the search algorithm should have fanned out in a circle from there and if it had operated properly found the target in about fifteen seconds this should have been the impact trajectory however todd continued dramatically based on the telemetry data that we have analyzed to date it appears that the missile veered sharply westward toward the coast of florida soon after the terminal guidance system was activated we have only been able to reconstruct its path up to this point where it was about three miles west of miami beach at an altitude of ten thousand feet after that the telemetry becomes intermittent and erratic but we do know that all the terminal guidance engines were on at the time we lost complete data projecting the total control authority for the missile the area highlighted here covering the everglades the keys and even as far south as cuba represents where the bird might have landed lieutenant todd paused for a second and commander winters who had been writing down major points in a small notebook during the presentation immediately jumped in and started taking charge of the meeting a couple of questions lieutenant before we proceed winters began in a businesslike manner with an obvious overtone of authority first why was the missile not destroyed soon after it veered off course were not exactly certain commander the command test set and the small ordnance had been installed of course specifically for that purpose the change in the motion of the vehicle was so sudden and so unexpected that we reacted a little slowly at the beginning by the time we sent the command its possible that we were out of range all we know is that we never saw an explosion of any kind we can only assume well come back to this operational error later winters interrupted him again todd blanched at the word error and fidgeted behind the podium where would the impact point have been according to the guidance constants active at the time of the last complete telemetry packet and how long is it going to take us to extract additional information from the intermittent data lieutenant todd noted to himself that the commander was sharp winters had obviously been associated with anomaly investigations before todd then explained that if the active guidance constants had not changed again the continued firing of the terminal engines would have brought the missile to an impact point about twenty miles south of key west however todd added the constants were allowed by the software to change every five seconds and they had changed in two of the last five internal data updates so its unlikely they stayed the same as they were when our complete telemetry terminated unfortunately although all the constants even the future predicted ones that are being calculated by the aprsare stored in the onboard computer because of bandwidth limitations we only transmit the active constants with the realtime telemetry we are now going through the dropout data manually to see if we can find out anything more about the constants one of the other staff officers asked a question about the probability of the missile actually having reached cuba lieutenant todd answered very low and then activated an electronic overlay that placed a dotted and blinking trajectory on the right screen inset map the blinking dots followed a path that started just off coral gables south of the city of miami and then continued across a portion of south florida into the gulf of mexico across the keys and finally into the ocean again it is along this line that we intend to concentrate our search unless the bird suddenly changed its mind its general heading would have been consistent with a perceived target located anywhere along this path and since we have no reports of any land impact near a populated area we assume that the missile landed in the everglades or the ocean lieutenant todd had consulted briefly with winters the previous evening on the agenda for the meeting it had been scheduled to last only an hour but the number of questions caused it to stretch to an hour and a half todd was thorough and precise in his presentation but was obviously dismayed by winters continued probing into the possibility of human error the lieutenant freely admitted that they had blown the procedure to destroy the missile when it went awry but defended his men by citing the unusual circumstances and the nearly perfect previous record enjoyed by the panther missile he also explained that they were going to equip their search vessels with the best possible instrumentation and begin searching the outlined areas in earnest the next day winters asked many questions about the possible cause of the missiles strange behavior todd told him that he and his staff were convinced that it was a software problem that some new or updated algorithm in the version of the software had somehow scrambled both the initialization sequence and the optically stored target parameters winters accepted their opinion eventually but not until he ordered them to prepare a top down failure modes analysis that would list every possible hardware software or operational error that could lead to the kind of problem observed toward the end of the meeting winters reiterated the secrecy of the activity and pointed out that the broken arrow project was to remain completely unknown to the press commander todd broke in while winters was explaining the press policy the lieutenant had begun the meeting with confidence but was feeling increasingly unsettled sir i had a call late yesterday afternoon from a reporter a carolyn or kathy dawson i think from the miami herald she told me that she had heard of some special activity down here and that i was supposedly connected with it she claimed her source was someone in the pentagon winters shook his head shit lieutenant why didnt you say something before this cant you imagine what will happen if the word gets out that one of our missiles wandered over miami he paused what did you tell her i didnt tell her anything but i think she is still suspicious she called the public affairs office after she talked to me winters gave an order that the existence of the broken arrow investigation was to be kept classified and that any and all inquiries about it were to be referred to him he then called for the next status meeting at on the following day friday by which time the commander expected to see the results of the analysis of the intermittent telemetry a more complete logic breakdown of the failure modes and a list of recent open items with the software lieutenant richard todd left the meeting aware that this assignment was going to have a significant impact on his career it was clear to the lieutenant that his personal competence was already being questioned by this commander winters todd intended to respond to the challenge in a positive way first he called a small postmortem meeting of the junior officers in his group he told them that their collective ass was on the line then he defined a series of action items that would keep all of them up working for most of the night it was imperative to todd that he be properly prepared for the next meeting key west was proud of its new marina completed in just after the explosion in cruises had brought an influx of new visitors to the old city the marina was thoroughly modem scattered around the jetties on high towers were automatic cameras that constantly surveyed the marina these cameras and the rest of the electronic surveillance systems were just one facet of an elaborate security setup that protected the slips when the boat owners were absent another of the new features of the hemmingway marina was a centralized navigation control center here using a virtually automatic traffic control system a single controller was able to pass instructions to all the vessels in the harbor and provide for efficient handling of the burgeoning water traffic the marina was built on key west bight on what had been a decaying part of the waterfront it had slips for almost four hundred boats and its completion changed the nature of the citys commerce young professionals wanting to be near their boats at the marina quickly purchased and upgraded all the wonderful nineteenthcentury houses that lined caroline and eaton streets on what was known as the pelican path smart shops toney restaurants even little theaters crowded into the area around the marina to create an atmosphere of bustle and excitement there was even a new japanese hotel the miyako gardens which was famous for its magnificent collection of tropical birds that played in the waterfalls and ferns of its atrium just before noon carol dawson walked into the marina headquarters and approached the circular information desk in the middle of the large room she was wearing a sharp silk blouse light purple in color and a pair of long white cotton slacks that covered the tops of her white tennis shoes two petite ruby and gold bracelets were wrapped around her right wrist and a huge amethyst set in a gold basket at the end of a neck chain dangled perfectly at the vertex of the v in her open blouse she looked stunning like a wellheeled tourist about to rent a boat for the afternoon the young girl behind the information desk was in her early twenties she was blonde fairly attractive in the cleancut american style originally typified by cheryl tiegs she watched carol with just a tinge of competitive jealously as the journalist moved purposefully across the room can i help you she said with feigned cheer as carol reached the desk i would like to charter a boat for the rest of the day carol began i want to go out to do a little diving and a little swimming and maybe see some of the interesting shipwrecks around here she planned to say nothing about the whales until she had picked the boat well youve come to the right place the girl responded she turned to the computer on her left and prepared to use the keyboard my name is julianne and one of my jobs here is to help tourists find the boats that are just right for their recreational needs carol noted that julianne sounded as if she had memorized the little speech did you have any particular price in mind although most of the boats here at hemingway are private vessels we still do have all sorts of boats for charter and most of them meet your requirements assuming of course that theyre still available carol shook her head and in a few minutes she was handed a computer listing that included nine boats here are the boats that are possible the girl said as i told you theres quite a range in price carols eyes scanned down the list the biggest and most expensive boat was the ambrosia a fiftyfourfooter that chartered for eight hundred dollars a day or five hundred for a half day the list included a couple of intermediate entries as well as two small boats twentysixfooters that rented for half the price of the ambrosia id like to talk to the captain of the ambrosia first carol said after a moments hesitation where do i go do you know captain homer julianne replied a strange smile starting to form at the corner of her mouth homer ashford she said again slowly as if the name should be recognized carols mind began going through a memory search routine the name was familiar where had she heard it a long time ago in a news program carol had not quite retrieved the memory when the girl continued ill let them know that youre coming below the desk counter on the right was a huge bank of relay switches several hundred in all apparently connected to a speaker system julianne flipped one of the switches and turned to carol it should only be a minute she said vat is it julianne a booming feminine voice inquired within about twenty seconds the voice was foreign german judging from the way the first word was pronounced and the voice was also impatient theres a woman here greta a miss carol dawson from miami and she wants to come down to talk to captain homer about chartering the yacht for the afternoon after a moments silence greta was heard again ya okay send her down julianne motioned for carol to walk halfway around the circular desk to where a familiar keyboard was sitting in a small well on the counter carol had been through this process many times since the uis was first introduced in using the keyboard she entered her name and her social security number carol wondered which verification question it would be this time her birthplace her mothers maiden name her fathers birth date it was always random selected from the twenty personal facts that were immutable and belonged to each individual to impersonate someone now really took an effort miss carol dawson oakwood gardens apt miami beach carol nodded her head blonde julianne obviously enjoyed her role of checking out the prospective clients what was your birth date carol was asked december carol responded juliannes face registered that carol had given the correct answer but carol could see something else in her face something competitive and even supercilious almost a hahadehaha im lots younger than you are and now i know it usually carol didnt pay attention to such trivia but for some reason this morning she was uncomfortable about the fact that she was now thirty she started to indicate her annoyance to smug little julianne but thought better of it and held her tongue julianne gave her instructions walk out that door over there at the far right and walk straight until you come to jetty number then turn left and insert this card in the gate lock slip p as in peter is where the ambrosia is berthed its a long walk way down at the end of the jetty but you cant miss the yacht its one of the largest and most beautiful boats at hemingway julianne was right it was quite a hike to the end of jetty number carol dawson probably passed a total of thirty boats of all sizes on both sides of the jetty before she reached the ambrosia by the time carol could discern the bold blue identifying letters on the front of the cabin she had started to sweat from the heat and humidity of late morning captain homer ashford walked up the gangplank to meet her when she finally reached the ambrosia he was in his mid to late fifties an enormous man well over six feet tall and weighing close to two hundred and fifty pounds his hair was still thick but the original black color had now almost completely surrendered to the gray captain homers wild eyes had followed carols approach with undisguised lubricious delight carol recognized the look and her reaction was one of immediate disgust she started to turn around and go back to the marina headquarters but she stopped herself realizing that it was a long walk back and that she was already hot and tired captain homer apparently sensing her disapproval by the change in her gait changed his leer to an avuncular smile miss dawson i presume the captain said bowing slightly with fake gallantry welcome to the ambrosia captain homer ashford and his crew at your service carol reluctantly smiled this buffoon in the outrageous blue hawaiian shirt at least did not appear to take himself too seriously still slightly wary she took the proffered coke from his outstretched hand and followed him along the smaller side jetty beside the boat the two of them then descended onto the yacht it was huge we understand from julianne that you are interested in a charter for this afternoon we would love to take you out to one of our favorite spots dolphin key they were standing in front of the wheelhouse and the covered cabin area as they talked captain homer was clearly already into his sales pitch from somewhere nearby carol could hear the clang of metal it sounded like barbells dolphin key is a marvelous isolated island captain homer continued perfect for swimming and even nude sunbathing if you like that sort of thing theres also a sunken wreck from the eighteenth century not more than a couple of miles away if youre interested in doing some diving carol took another drink from her coke and looked at homer for an instant she quickly averted her eyes he was leering again his peculiar emphasis on the word nude had somehow changed carols mental picture of dolphin key from a quiet tropical paradise to a gathering place for debauchery and peeping toms carol recoiled from captain homers light touch as he guided her around the side of the yacht this man is a creep she thought i should have followed my first instincts and turned around the clang of metal grew louder as they walked past the entrance to the cabin and approached the front of the luxurious boat carols journalistic curiosity was piqued the sound seemed so out of place she hardly paid attention as captain homer pointed out all the outstanding features of the yacht when they finally had a clear view of the front deck of the ambrosia carol saw that the sound had indeed been barbells a blonde woman with her back toward them was working out with weights on the front deck the womans body was magnificent even breathtaking as she strained to finish her repetitive presses she lifted the barbells high over her head rivulets of sweat cascaded down the muscles that seemed to descend in ripples from her shoulders she was wearing a lowcut black leotard almost backless whose thin straps did not seem capable of holding up the rest of the outfit captain homer had stopped talking about the boat carol noticed that he was standing in rapt admiration apparently transfixed by the sensual beauty of the sweaty woman in the leotard this place is weird carol thought maybe thats why the girl asked me if i knew these people the woman put the weights back on the small rack and picked up a towel when she turned around carol could see that she was in her mid to late thirties pretty in an athletic sort of way her breasts were large and taut and clearly visible in the scant leotard but it was her eyes that were truly remarkable they were grayblue in color and they seemed to look right through you carol thought that the womans first piercing glance was hostile almost threatening greta said captain homer when she looked at him after her first glance at carol this is miss carol dawson she may be our charter for this afternoon greta did not smile or say anything she wiped the sweat off her brow took a couple of deep breaths and put the towel behind her neck and over her shoulders she squared herself off to face carol and captain homer then with her shoulders back and her hands on her hips she flexed her chest muscles with each flexure her abundant breasts seemed to stretch up toward her neck throughout this routine her incredibly clear eyes evaluated carol checking out her body and clothing in minute detail carol squirmed involuntarily well hello greta she said her usual aplomb strangely absent in this awkward moment nice to meet you jesus carol thought as greta just looked at carols outstretched hand for several seconds let me out of here i must be on a strange planet or having a nightmare greta sometimes likes to have fun with our customers captain homer said to carol but dont let it put you off was he irritated with greta carol thought she detected some unspoken communication between greta and captain homer for at length greta smiled but it was an artificial smile velcome to the ambrosia greta said mimicking captain homers first remarks to carol our pleasure avaits you greta lifted her arms over her head watching carol again and began to stretch come vit us to paradise greta said carol felt captain homers burly hand on her elbow turning her around she also thought she saw an angry glance from homer to greta the ambrosia is the finest charter vessel in key west he said guiding her back toward the stem and resuming his sales pitch it has every possible convenience and luxury giant screen cable television compact disc player with quad speakers automatic chef programmed with over a hundred gourmet dishes robot massage and nobody knows the keys like captain homer ive been diving and fishing these waters for fifty years they had stopped at the entrance to the cabin area in the middle of the yacht through the glass door carol could see stairs descending to another level would you like to come down and see the galley and the bedroom captain homer said without a trace of the earlier suggestiveness he was a clever chameleon there was no doubt about that carol revised her earlier judgment of him as a buffoon but what was this business with musclebound greta whoever she is carol wondered and just what is going on here why are they so strange no thank you captain ashford carol saw her opportunity to exit gracefully she handed him what was left of the unfinished coke ive seen enough its a magnificent yacht but i can tell its much too expensive for a single woman wanting to spend a relaxing afternoon but thanks a lot for your time and the brief tour she started to walk toward the gangplank to the jetty captain homers eyes narrowed but we havent even discussed price miss dawson im certain that for someone like you we could make a special deal carol could tell that he was not going to let her go without some additional discussion as she started to leave the yacht greta came up beside captain homer it vould give you sometink to write about for your paper greta said with a bizarre smile sometink unusual carol turned startled so you recognized me she said stating the obvious the strange pair grinned back at her why didnt you say something captain homer simply shrugged his huge shoulders we thought maybe you were traveling incognito or were looking for some special fun or maybe even were working on a story his voice trailed off carol smiled and shook her head then she waved goodbye mounted the gangplank and turned on the jetty toward the distant marina headquarters who are those people she asked herself again now im certain that i have seen them before but where twice carol looked over her shoulder to see if captain homer and greta were still watching her the second time when she was almost a hundred yards away they were no longer in sight she sighed with relief the experience had definitely unnerved her carol walked on slowly she pulled the computer listing that julianne had given her from a small purple beach bag before she could look at it she heard a telephone ring on her left and her eyes lifted naturally to follow the sound the telephone was ringing on a boat just in front of her a husky man in his early thirties was sitting in a folding chair on the same boat wearing only a red baseball cap a pair of swim trunks dark sunglasses and some thongs the man was intently watching a small television propped up on a flimsy tray of some kind he held a sandwich in one hand and a can of beer in the other there was no sign that the man in the red cap even heard the telephone carol moved closer a little curious a basketball game was in progress on the television on about the sixth ring of the phone the man gave a small cheer in the direction of the sixinch picture tube took a swig from his beer and abruptly jumped up to answer the call the telephone was underneath a canopy in the center of the boat on a wooden paneled wall behind the steering wheel and next to some builtin counters that appeared to contain the navigation and radio equipment for the boat the man fiddled with the steering wheel unconsciously during the brief conversation and never took his eyes off the television he hung up issued another short cheer and returned to his folding chair carol was now standing on the jetty just inches away from the front of the boat and no more than ten feet away from where the man was sitting but he was oblivious to her totally absorbed in his basketball game all right he shouted all at once reacting to something pleasing in the game he jumped up the sudden movement caused the boat to rock and the jerrybuilt tray underneath the television gave way the man reached out quickly and grabbed the tv before it hit the ground but in so doing he lost his balance and fell forward on his elbows shit he said to himself wincing from the pain he was lying on the deck his sunglasses cocked sideways on his head the game still continuing on the little set in his hands carol could not suppress her laughter now aware that he was not alone for the first time nick williams the owner and operator of the florida queen turned in the direction of the feminine laugh excuse me carol began in a friendly way i just happened to be walking by and i saw you fall she stopped nick was not amused what do you want nick fixed her with a truculent glare he stood up still holding the television and now trying as well to put the tray back together he didnt have enough hands to do everything at once you know carol said still smiling i could help you with that if it wouldnt injure your masculine pride uh oh nick thought in a flash another pushy assertive broad nick put the television down on the deck of the boat and began to reassemble the tray no thank you he said i can manage obviously ignoring carol he set the tv back on the tray returned to his folding chair and picked up his sandwich and beer carol was amused by what nick had clearly intended as a putdown she looked around the boat neatness was not one of the strengths of the proprietor little odds and ends including masks snorkels regulators towels and even old lunches from fastfood restaurants were scattered all over the front of the boat in one of the corners someone had obviously taken apart a piece of electronic equipment perhaps for repair and left the entire works a jumbled mess mounted on the top of the blue canopy were two signs each with a different type of print one giving the name of the boat and the other saying thank you for not smoking the boat looked out of character for the sleek modern marina and carol imagined the other boat owners reacting with disgust each day as they passed the florida queen on an impulse carol looked at the computer listing in her hand she almost laughed out loud when she saw the boat listing as one of the nine available for hire excuse me she began intending to start the discussion about chartering the boat for the afternoon nick heaved an exaggerated sigh and turned away from his televised basketball game the miffed look on his face was unmistakable it said what are you still here i thought wed finished our conversation now go away and let me enjoy the afternoon on my boat mischievous carol couldnt resist the opportunity to harass the arrogant mr williams whos playing she said cheerfully as if she had no idea that nick was trying to get rid of her harvard and tennessee he answered gruffly amazed that carol hadnt got the message whats the score she said quickly now enjoying the game she had just created nick turned around again his quizzical look acknowledging his exasperation its harvard he said sharply just before the end of the first half carol didnt move she simply smiled and returned his fierce stare without blinking and its the first round of the ncaa tournament and theyre playing in the southeast regional any more questions just one she said i would like to charter this boat for the afternoon are you nick williams he was taken by surprise whaat nick said at that minute tennessee tied the basketball game again distracting nick even further he watched the game for a couple of seconds and then tried to collect himself but i have had no calls from julianne anyone who wants to charter a boat here at hemingway has to sign in at the desk and i came down to look at another boat first i didnt like it so i stopped by here on the way back nick was watching the television again and carol was losing her patience with him at first he had been amusing at least i dont have to worry about his pawing me she thought the guy cant even concentrate on me enough to get his boat chartered look she added do you want a charter for this afternoon or not the first half of the basketball game ended all right i guess so nick said slowly thinking to himself only because i need the money he gestured to carol to descend onto the deck of the boat let me just call julianne and make sure youre legit you never know these days while nick confirmed carols identification with the marina headquarters a jaunty young black man in his early twenties came down the jetty and stopped just opposite the florida queen hey professor he said the moment nick was off the phone am i in the wrong place he motioned to carol you didnt tell me you were entertaining beauty style and class today wooee look at that jewelry and that silk blouse should i go now and come back to hear your stories later he winked at carol hes no good angel all his girlfriends eventually end up with me cut the crap jefferson nick reacted this woman is a potential customer and youre late as usual how do you expect me to run a charter dive boat when i dont have any idea when or if my crew is going to show up professor the newcomer jumped down on the boat and walked up to carol if i had known that you had something that looked like this down here i would have been here before dawn hello there young lady my name is troy jefferson i am the rest of the crew on this lunatic asylum of a boat carol had been slightly discombobulated by the arrival of troy and the quick repartee that followed but she adapted swiftly and regained her composure she took troys outstretched hand and smiled he immediately leaned up and almost brushed his cheek against hers ooueee troy pulled back grinning i just caught a whiff of oscar de la renta professor didnt i tell you this woman had class well angel he looked at carol in mock admiration i just cant tell you how much it means to me to finally meet up with someone like you on this tub usually we get old ladies i mean old ladies who want to enough jefferson nick interrupted him we have work to do its almost noon already and were still at least half an hour away from being ready to leave we dont even know what miss dawson wants to do carol is fine she said she paused for a moment assessing the two men in front of her might as well carol thought nobody is going to suspect anything if im with these two well i told the desk that i wanted to go out to do some swimming and diving but thats only partially true what i really want to do is go out here and look for whales nicks brow furrowed troy peered over carols shoulder at the map there have been numerous irregularities in the behavior of whales in this area lately including a major beaching at deer key this morning carol continued i want to see if i can find any pattern in their actions i may need to do some diving so one of you will have to accompany me i assume that at least one of you is a licensed diver and that your dive gear is onboard the two men regarded her with disbelieving stares carol felt on the defensive really im a reporter she said as an explanation i work for the miami herald i just did a story this morning on the deer key beaching troy turned to nick okay professor i guess we have a live charter here one who says she wants to look for whales in the gulf of mexico what do you say should we accept her money nick shrugged his shoulders indifferently and troy took it as assent all right angel troy said to carol well be ready in half an hour were both licensed divers if were really needed our gear is onboard and we can get more for you why dont you pay julianne at the desk and get your things together troy turned and walked over to the jumbled mess of electronics at the front of the boat he picked up one of the boxes with its housing partially removed and began toying with it nick pulled another beer out of the refrigerator and opened the builtin counters exposing racks of equipment carol did not move after about twenty seconds nick noticed that she was still there well he said in a tone of dismissal didnt you hear troy we wont be ready for half an hour he turned around and walked toward the back of the boat troy looked up from his repair work he was amused by the friction already developing between nick and carol is he always so pleasant carol said to troy nodding in nicks direction she was still smiling but her tone conveyed some irritation i have a few pieces of equipment that i want to bring onboard can you give me a hand with it thirty minutes later troy and carol returned to the florida queen troy was grinning and whistling zippitydodah as he pulled a cart down the jetty and came to a stop in front of the boat a partially filled footlocker was resting on the cart troy could hardly wait to see nicks face when he saw carols few pieces of equipment troy was excited by the turn of events he knew that this was no casual afternoon charter reporters even successful ones did not have everyday access to the kind of equipment that she was carrying already troy was certain that the whale story was just a cover but he wasnt going to say anything just yet he wanted to wait and see how things developed troy liked this confident young woman there was not a trace of superiority or prejudice in her manner and she had a good sense of humor after they had opened the back of her station wagon and she had showed him the footlocker full of equipment troy had demonstrated to carol that he was fairly sophisticated about electronics he had recognized immediately the moi insignia on dales ocean telescope and troy had even guessed the meaning of the moiipl acronym on the back of the large monitor and data storage system when he had looked at her for an explanation carol had just laughed and said so i need some help finding the whales what can i say carol and troy had loaded the gear on the cart and wheeled it through the parking lot she had been a little dismayed at first by troys recognition of the origin of the equipment and his friendly probing questions but as they talked carol developed a comfortable feeling about troy her intuitive sense told her that troy was an ally and could be counted on to be discreet with any important information carol had not however planned for a security check inside the hemingway marina headquarters one of the primary selling points of the slips at the new marina had been the almost unparalleled security system offered the boat owners every person who went in or out of the marina had to pass through computerized gates adjacent to the headquarters building a full listing of each individual entrance and exit including the time of passage through the gate was printed out each night and retained in the security office files as a precaution in case any suspicious or untoward events were reported materiel entering and leaving the marina was also routinely scrutinized by the security chief to prevent the theft of expensive navigation equipment and other electronics carol was only mildly irked when after she paid for the charter julianne asked her to fill out a sheet describing the contents of the closed footlocker but carol really objected when the summoned security chief a typical boston irish policeman who had retired in the key west area forced her to open the locker to verify the contents carols objections and troys attempts to help her were to no avail rules were rules because the cart would not fit through the door into the adjacent security office the footlocker was opened in the main clearing room of the marina headquarters a couple of curious passersby including one giant friendly woman about forty named ellen came over and watched while officer orourke carefully compared the contents of the locker with the list that carol had prepared carol was a little rattled as she and troy pulled the cart down the jetty toward the florida queen she had hoped to attract as little attention as possible and she was now angry with herself for not anticipating the security check nick meanwhile after performing a few routine preparations on the boat and opening another beer had become engrossed again in the basketball game his beloved harvard was now losing to tennessee he did not even hear troys whistling until his crewman and carol were just a few yards away jesus nick turned around i thought you had gotten lost his voice trailed off as he saw the cart and the footlocker what the fuck is that its miss dawsons equipment professor troy answered with a big grin he reached into the locker first picking up a cylinder with a clear glass face a large flashlightlooking object on a mounting bracket it was about two feet long and weighed about twelve pounds here for example is what she tells me is an ocean telescope we attach it to the bottom of the boat by this bracket and it takes pictures that are displayed on this here television monitor and also stored on this other device a recorder of some hold it nick interrupted troy imperiously nick walked up the gangplank and stared incredulously into the locker he shook his head and looked from troy to carol do i have this right we are supposed to set up all this shit just to go out into the gulf for one afternoon to look for whales he scowled at troy where is your head jefferson this stuff is heavy it will take time to set it up and it s already after noon and as for you sister nick continued turning to carol take your toys and your treasure map elsewhere we know what youre up to and we have more important things to do are you through carol shouted at nick as he walked back down the gangplank onto the florida queen he stopped and turned partially around look you asshole carol raged giving vent to the frustration and anger that had been building inside of her it is certainly your right to deny me the use of your boat but it is not your right to act like god almighty and treat me or anyone else like shit just because im a woman and you feel like pushing somebody around she stepped toward him nick backed up a step in the face of her continued offensive i told you that i want to look for whales and thats what i intend to do what you might think im doing is really of no significance to me as for the important things that you have to do you havent moved from that goddamn basketball game in the last hour except to get more beer if youll just stay out of the way troy and i can set all this gear in place in half an hour and besides carol slowed down just a bit starting to feel a little embarrassed about her outburst i have already paid for the charter and you know how hard it is to straighten out these computer credit card accounts oooeee professor troy grinned wickedly and winked at carol isnt she something else he stopped and became serious look nick we need the money both of us and i would be happy to help her we can take off some of the excess diving gear if its necessary to balance the weight nick walked back to the folding chair and the television he took another drink from his beer and did not turn around to look at carol and troy all right he said somewhat reluctantly get started but if were not ready to sail by one oclock its no deal the basketball players swam in front of his eyes harvard had tied the game again but this time he wasnt watching he was thinking about carols outburst i wonder if shes right i wonder if i do think that women are inferior or worse commander vernon winters was trembling when he hung up the phone he felt as if he had just seen a ghost he threw his apple core in the wastebasket and reached in his pocket for one of his pall malls without thinking he stood up and walked across the room to the large bay window that opened onto the grassy courtyard of the main administration building lunch hour had just finished at the us naval air station the crowds of young men and women heading either toward or away from the cafeteria had died out a solitary young ensign was sitting on the grass reading a book his back against a large tree commander winters lit his nonfilter cigarette and inhaled deeply he expelled the smoke with a rush and quickly took another breath hey indiana the voice had said two minutes before this is randy remember me as if he could ever forget that nasal baritone and then without waiting for an answer the voice had materialized into an earnest face on the video monitor admiral randolph hilliard was sitting behind his desk in a large pentagon office good he continued now we can see each other hilliard had paused for a moment and then leaned forward toward the camera i was glad to hear that duckett put you in charge of this panther business it could be nasty we must find out what happened quickly and with no publicity both the secretary and i are counting on you what had he said in response to the admiral commander winters couldnt remember but he assumed that it must have been all right and he did remember the last few words when admiral hilliard had said that he would call back for an update after the meeting on friday afternoon winters had not heard that voice for almost eight years but the recognition was instantaneous and the memories that flooded forth were just a few milliseconds behind the commander took another drag from his cigarette and turned away from the window he walked slowly across the room his eyes slid across but did not see the lovely soft print of the renoir painting deux jeunes filles au piano that was the most prominent object on his office wall it was his favorite painting his wife and son had given him the special large reproduction for his fortieth birthday usually several times a week he would stand in front of it and admire the beautiful composition but two graceful young girls working on their afternoon piano lessons were not the order for the day vernon winters sat back down at his desk and buried his face in his hands here if comes again he thought i cant hold it back now not after seeing randy and hearing that voice he looked around and then stubbed out the cigarette in the large ashtray on his desk for a few moments he played aimlessly with the two small framed photographs on his desk at length the commander put the photographs aside leaned back in his chair closed his eyes and succumbed to the powerful pull of his memory a curtain in his mind parted and he was transported to a clear warm night almost eight years before in early april of the first sound that he heard was the excited nasal voice of lieutenant randolph hilliard psst indiana wake up how can you be asleep its randy weve got to talk im so excited i could shit vernon winters had only fallen asleep himself about an hour before he unconsciously looked at his watch almost two oclock his friend stood next to his bunk grinning from ear to ear only three more hours and we attack finally were going to blast that arab lunatic and terrorist supporter to heaven with allah shit big buddy this is our moment this is what we worked our whole life for winters shook his head and began to come out of a deep sleep it took him a moment to remember that he was onboard the uss nimitz off the coast of libya the first action of his military career was about to occur look randy winters had said eventually shouldnt we be sleeping what if the libyans attack us tomorrow well have to be alert shit no said his friend and fellow officer helping him to sit up and handing him a cigarette those geeks will never attack someone who can fight theyre terrorists they only know how to fight unarmed people the only one of them that has any guts is that colonel gaddafi and hes nutty as a fruitcake after we blow him to kingdom come the battle will be over besides i have enough adrenaline flowing that i could stay awake for thirtysix hours with no sweat winters felt the nicotine coursing through his body it reawakened the eager anticipation that he had finally conquered when he had fallen asleep an hour earlier randy was talking a blue streak i cant believe how goddamn lucky we are for six years i have been wondering how an officer can stand out distinguish himself you know in peacetime now here we are some loonie plants a bomb in a club in berlin and we just happen to be on duty in the med talk about being in the right place at the right time shit think how many other midshipmen from our class would give their right nut to be here instead of us tomorrow we kill that crazy man and were on our way to captain maybe even admiral in five to eight years winters reacted negatively to his friends suggestion that one of the benefits of the strike against gaddafi would be an acceleration in their personal advancement but he said nothing he was already deep in his own private thoughts he too was excited and he didnt fully understand why the excitement was similar to the way he had felt before the state quarterfinals in basketball in high school but lieutenant winters couldnt help wondering how much the excitement would be leavened by fear if they were preparing to engage in a real battle for almost a week they had been getting ready for the strike it was normal navy business to go through the preparations for combat and then have them called off usually about a day ahead of the planned encounter but this time it had been different from the beginning hilliard and winters had quickly recognized that there was a seriousness in the senior officers that had never been there before none of the usual horsing around and nonsense had been tolerated in the tedious and boring checks of the planes the missiles and the guns the nimitz was preparing for war and then yesterday the normal time for such a drill to be called off the captain had gathered all the officers together and told them that he had received the order to attack at dawn winters heart had skipped a beat as the commanding officer had briefed them on the full scope of the american action against libya winters last assignment just after evening mess had been to go over the bombing targets with the pilots one more time two separate planes were being sent to bomb the residence where gaddafi was supposedly sleeping one of the two chosen pilots was outwardly ecstatic he realized that he had been given the prime target of the raid the other pilot lieutenant gibson from oregon was quiet but thorough in his preparations he kept looking at the map with winters and going over the libyan gun emplacements gibson also complained that his mouth was dry and drank several glasses of water shit indiana you know whats bothering me those flyboys will be in the battle and well be stuck here with no role unless the crazy arabs decide to attack how can we get into the fight wait i just had a thought lieutenant hilliard was still talking nonstop it was after three oclock and they had already gone over everything associated with the attack at least twice winters was feeling lifeless and enervated from lack of sleep but the astonishing hilliard continued to exude exuberance what a great idea randy continued talking to himself but we can do it you briefed the pilots tonight didnt you so you know whos going after what targets vernon nodded his head then thats it well tape a personal screw you to the side of the missile thats going to get gaddafi that way part of us will go into battle vernon did not have the energy to dissuade randy from his crazy plan as the time for the attack drew closer lieutenants winters and hilliard went into the hangar on the nimitz and found the airplane assigned to lieutenant gibson laughingly randy explained to the fresh ensign on watch what he and vernon were going to try to do it took them almost half an hour to locate the right plane and then identify the missile that would be the first to be launched against the gaddafi household the two lieutenants argued for almost ten minutes about the message they were going to write on the paper that would be taped on the missile winters wanted something deep almost philosophical like such is the just end to the tyranny of terrorism hilliard argued persuasively that winters concept was too obscure at length a tired lieutenant winters assented to the visceral communication written by his friend die motherfucker was the message the two lieutenants inscribed on the side of the missile winters returned to his bunk exhausted tired and still a little unsettled by the magnitude of the coming days events he pulled out his personal bible to read a few verses there was no comfort in the good book for the presbyterian from indiana he tried praying generic prayers at first and then more specific as had been his custom during critical moments in his life he asked for the lord to guard his wife and son and to be with him in this moment of travail and then quickly and without thinking lieutenant vernon winters asked god to rain down terror in the form of the missile with the taped message on colonel gaddafi and all his family eight years later sitting in his office at the us naval air station in key west commander winters would remember that prayer and cringe inside even then in just after he finished the prayer he had felt weird and disoriented almost as if he had somehow committed a blasphemy and displeased the lord a brief hour of sleep that followed was torturous full of dreams of hideous gargoyles and vampires he watched the planes leave the carrier the next morning at dawn in a dreamlike trance his mouth had a bitter metal taste when he mechanically shook gibsons hand and wished him luck for all those years winters had wished that he could have rescinded that prayer he was convinced that god had permitted that particular missile carried by gibson to take the life of gaddafis infant daughter just to teach winters a personal lesson on that day he thought as he sat in his office on a thursday in march i committed sacrilege and violated your trust i overstepped my bound and lost my privileged position in your sanctuary i have asked for forgiveness many times since then but it has not been forthcoming how much longer must i wait vernon allen winters was born on june the day that the north koreans invaded south korea he was reminded of the significance of his birthdate throughout his life by his father martin winters a man who was a hardworking deeply religious corn farmer in indiana at the time vernon was born when vernon was three years old and his sister linda was six the family moved off the farm and into the town of columbus a white middleclass town of thirty thousand or so in south central indiana vernons mother had felt isolated out on the farm particularly during the winter and wanted more company the winters farm provided a nice cash profit mr winters by now almost forty put most of the nest egg aside as security for a rainy day and became a banker martin winters was proud to be an american whenever mr winters would tell vernon about the day of his birth the story would inevitably center around the news of the start of the korean war and how it was explained to the nation by president harry truman i thought that day mr winters would say that it was surely no coincidence the good lord brought you to us that special day because of his purpose for you and i bet he meant for you to be a protector of this wonderful country we have created later banker winters would always see to it that the armynavy football game was one of the key events of the year and he would tell his friends particularly when it became obvious that young vernon was a good student that the boy is still trying to choose which of the academies to attend vernon was never asked the winters family lived a simple midwestern life mr winters was moderately successful eventually becoming the senior vicepresident of the largest bank in columbus the familys chief social activity was church they were presbyterians and spent almost all day sunday at the church mrs winters ran the sunday school mr winters was a deacon and voluntarily managed the church finances vernon and linda helped supervise the smaller children at sunday school and were responsible for the special bible displays on the bulletin boards in the kindergarten and primary school rooms during the week mrs winters sewed and watched soap operas and sometimes played bridge with friends she never worked outside the home her husband and her children were her job she was an attentive patient parent who deeply cared for her children and tirelessly chauffeured them to their many activities throughout their years of adolescence vernon played all sports in high school football and basketball because it was expected of him baseball because he loved it he was above average at all sports not outstanding at anything activities are important particularly sports banker winters often told him approvingly the academies look at much more than your grades the only significant decision that vernon had to make in the first eighteen years of his life was which of the service academies he preferred in his junior year at columbus high school vernon took the scholastic aptitude test and made such a high score that it was obvious he would be able to pick his own favorite he chose annapolis and was not questioned about the reasons if he had been he would have answered that he just liked the idea of himself in a navy uniform vernons teenage years were remarkably linear particularly considering that they occurred at a time of great social turmoil in the united states the winters family prayed together for hours after the kennedy assassination worried about local boys in the vietnam war remarked with concern when three prominent high school seniors refused to cut their hair and were expelled from school and attended a couple of churchsponsored meetings on the evils of marijuana but all these anxieties were outside the daily harmony of the winters family music by the beatles and the rolling stones did penetrate the controlled winters culture of course and even some of the protest songs sung by bob dylan and joan baez were played on vernons stereo but neither vernon nor his sister linda paid much serious attention to the lyrics it was an easy existence vernons closest friends were all from families like his mothers did not work fathers were bankers or lawyers or businessmen almost all were republicans and believed fervently in god country and the entire litany that ends in apple pie vernon was a good kid even an exceptional kid who first drew attention to himself by his performances in the annual church pageants at christmas and easter the pastor of their church was a great believer that reenactment of the birth and crucifixion of christ performed by the children of the town was a powerful way to reconfirm the faith of the local citizenry and reverend pendleton was correct the columbus presbyterian church pageants were one of the highlights of the local year when the church congregation and their friends saw their own children acting in the roles of joseph mary and even christ they became involved in the depicted events at an emotional level that was virtually impossible to achieve in any other way reverend pendleton had two casts for each pageant so that more children could participate but vernon was always the star when he was eleven years old vernon first portrayed christ in the easter pageant and it was mentioned in the religious column of the columbus newspaper that his tortured dragging of the cross had captured all of mans suffering he was joseph at christmas and jesus at easter for four years running before he became too old and therefore no longer eligible for the pageants the last two years when vernon was thirteen and fourteen the role of the virgin mary in the a cast was played by the pastors daughter betty vernon and betty were together quite often while rehearsing and both families were delighted all four parents made no secret of the fact that they would generously approve if assuming god wills it the vernonbetty friendship would eventually mature into something more permanent vernon loved the attention he received from the pageants although betty was touched deeply by the religious aspects of their performances vernons joy was standing by his proud parents after each performance and soaking up the praise in high school he gravitated naturally toward the small drama activity and was the lead in the school play every year his mother supported this over his fathers mild objections and because she also vicariously enjoyed the applause during the summer of just before he entered annapolis vernon worked in his uncles cornfields only a little more than a hundred miles away there were riots at the democratic convention in chicago but in columbus vernon spent his summer evenings with betty talking with chums and drinking root beer at the a w drivein mr and mrs winters played miniature golf or canasta with vernon and betty from time to time they were delighted and proud to have good clean kids who were not hippies or drug victims all in all vernons last summer in indiana was ordered constrained and very pleasant as expected he was a model student at annapolis he studied hard obeyed all the rules learned what his professors taught him and dreamed of being the commander of an aircraft carrier or a nuclear submarine he was not outgoing for the bigcity boys seemed way too sophisticated for him and he did not always feel comfortable when they talked about sex so casually he was a virgin and he was not ashamed of it he just didnt feel the need to broadcast it around the us naval academy he had a couple of dates a month nothing special just when the occasion called for it after a blind date early his junior year with joanna carr a cheerleader at the university of maryland he took her out several more times she was vivacious lovely fun and modem she drew out the best in vernon made him laugh and even relax she was his date for the weekend of the armynavy game in philadelphia vernon and joanna were joined for the weekend by another midshipman the closest acquaintance that vernon had at navy who was still not quite what one would call a friend duane eller and his date from columbia an extremely loud and pushy girl named edith vernon had never spent much time around a new york city girl and he found edith absolutely obnoxious edith was violently antinixon and antivietnam and seemed despite the fact that her date for the weekend was going to be a military officer antimilitary as well the original plan for the weekend had been decidedly proper even backward given that it was and casual intercourse was not unusual on college campuses vernon and duane were to share one motel room and the two girls were to share another over a pizza dinner the night before the game edith frequently insulted joanna and vernon both and duane did nothing to intercede seeing that edith was annoying joanna vernon suggested to joanna that it might be easier if the two of them shared a room instead of following the original game plan she readily agreed vernon had made no sexual moves on joanna on the four or five dates that they had had together he had been attentive had kissed her good night a couple of times and had held her hand most of the evening on their last date everything had always been extremely proper but there had never actually been any opportunity for intimacy so joanna really didnt know what to expect she liked this handsome hoosier midshipman and had thought a couple of times about the possibility of the involvement developing into something serious but vernon was not yet anyone super special for her just after they made the room change vernon very carefully apologized to joanna and told her that he would sleep in the car if she were offended the room was a typical holiday inn room with two double beds joanna laughed i know you didnt plan this she said if i need protection i can order you to your bed the first night they enjoyed watching television and drinking more beer in the room they both felt a little awkward at bedtime they shared a couple of almost passionate kisses laughed together and then went to separate beds the next evening after the postgame dance sponsored by the naval academy at a downtown philadelphia hotel joanna and vernon returned to their room at the holiday inn just before midnight they had already changed into their jeans and vernon was brushing his teeth when there was a knock on their door joanna opened the door and duane eller was standing there a gigantic shiteating grin on his face and his hand clenched around some small object this stuff is fuckin fantastic he said thrusting a joint into joannas hand youve just got to try it duane withdrew quickly with a wild smile joanna was a bright young woman but it did not occur to her that her date had never even seen a joint much less smoked one she herself had smoked marijuana maybe a dozen times over a fouryear period beginning in her junior year in high school she liked it if the situation and the company were right she avoided it when she couldnt have control of her environment but she had enjoyed the weekend with vernon and she thought this might be a perfect way to loosen him up a little under almost any circumstances vernon would have said no to any offer of marijuana not just because he was against all drugs but also because he would have been terrified that somehow he would be discovered and eventually thrown out of annapolis but here was his lovely date a mainstream american cheerleader from maryland and she had just lit a joint and offered it to him joanna quickly saw that he was a grass neophyte she showed him how to inhale and hold in the smoke how not to bogart the joint and eventually how to use a roach clip to finish it off vernon had expected to feel as if he were drunk he was astonished to find that he felt more alert much to his own surprise he began reciting ee cummings poems he had been studying in lit and then he and joanna began to laugh they laughed at everything at edith football the naval academy their parents even vietnam they laughed until they were almost crying an overpowering hunger attacked vernon and joanna they put on their jackets and walked out into the cold december air to find something to eat arm in arm they paraded down the suburban parkway finding a convenience store that was still open about a half mile from their motel they bought cokes and potato chips and fritos and much to vernons astonishment a package of ding dongs joanna opened the potato chips while they were still in the store she put one in vernons mouth and they mmmed while the checkout clerk laughed with them vernon could not believe the taste of the chips he ate the entire bag while they were walking back to their room when he was finished vernon burst spontaneously into song singing maxwells silver hammer by the beatles joanna joined in vigorously on the bang bang maxwells silver hammer came down upon his head she reached up with the side of her fist and playfully banged on the top of his head vernon felt jaunty liberated as if he had known joanna forever he put his arm around her and kissed her ostentatiously as they turned into the driveway leading to their motel they sat on the floor with all their munchies spread out in front of them vernon turned on the radio it was tuned to a classical station in the middle of a symphony vernon was mesmerized by the sound for the first time in his life vernon could actually hear the individual instruments of the orchestra in his head he visualized a stage and saw the musicians pulling their bows across the violins he was fascinated and excited vernon told joanna that all his senses were alive to joanna carr it seemed that vernon was finally opening up when he leaned over to kiss her she was more than willing they kissed sweetly but deeply several times while the symphony was playing during a momentary break for some more munchies joanna tuned the radio to a rock and roll station the music changed the pace in their necking driving jangling sounds increased the tempo and their kisses became more passionate in his ardor vernon pushed joanna down on the floor and they kissed over and over again as they lay side by side still fully clothed they became enthralled by the strength of their arousal the radio now started playing light my fire by the doors and vernon allen winters of columbus indiana thirdyear midshipman at the u s naval academy was no longer a virgin by the time the long song was over the time to hesitate is through no time to wallow in the mire try now you can only lose and our love become a funeral pyre come on baby light my fire come on baby light my fire vernon had never lost control of himself before in his entire life but when joanna stroked the outline of his swollen penis underneath his jeans it was as if a giant wall of steel and concrete suddenly gave way years later vernon would still marvel at the raw passion he showed for two maybe three minutes the combination of joannas insistent kisses the grass and the driving rhythms of the music pushed him over the edge he was an animal still on the floor of the motel room he pulled vigorously on joannas slacks several times nearly tearing them as he managed to free them from her hips her underpants half followed the slacks vernon grabbed them roughly and pulled them down the rest of the way while he was squirming out of his own jeans joanna tried in a quiet voice to slow vernon down to suggest that maybe the bed would be better or at least it would be more pleasant if they actually took off their shoes and socks and didnt make love with their pants around their ankles restricting their movement but vernon was gone years of restraint left him no ability to deal with his own surging desire he was possessed he crawled on top of joanna a look of frightening seriousness on his face for the first time she was scared and her sudden fear heightened her sexual excitement vernon struggled for a few seconds to find the right spot and then entered her abruptly and forcefully joanna felt him drive once twice and then shudder all over he was done in maybe ten seconds she intuitively knew that it had been his first time and the pleasure of that knowledge outweighed her bruised feelings about his lack of finesse and gentleness vernon said nothing and quickly fell asleep on the floor next to joanna she gamely went to the bed pulled the bedspread off cuddled into vernons arms on the floor and wrapped the spread around them she smiled to herself and drifted off to sleep still a little puzzled by this hoosier lying next to her but she knew that they were now special to each other how special joanna would never really know when vernon woke up in the middle of the night he felt an overpowering sense of guilt he could not believe that he had smoked dope and then virtually raped a girl he hardly knew he had lost control he had been unable to stop what he was doing and had clearly crossed the bounds of propriety he winced when he thought about what his parents would think about him if they could have seen what he had done then the guilt gave way to fear vernon imagined that joanna was pregnant that he had to leave annapolis and marry her that he had to explain all this to his parents and to the pendletons worse still he next imagined that at any minute the motel would be raided and the police would find the butt of the joint in the roach clip he would first be kicked out of the academy for drug abuse then find out that he had made a girl pregnant vernon winters was now really scared lying on the floor of a motel room on the outskirts of philadelphia at three oclock on a sunday morning he began to pray in earnest dear god vernon winters prayed asking for something specific for himself for the first time since he asked god to help him on the day that he took the sats let me get out of this without harm and i will become the most perfectly disciplined naval officer that you have ever seen i will dedicate my life to defending this country that honors you just please help me eventually vernon managed to fall asleep again but his sleep was fitful and disturbed by vivid dreams in one dream vernon was dressed in his midshipmans uniform but was on stage back at the columbus presbyterian church it was the easter pageant and he was again christ dragging the cross to calvary the sharp edge of the cross on his shoulder was cutting through his uniform shirt and vernon was aware of anxiety that he might not pass inspection he stumbled and fell the cross cut deeper through the uniform as he had feared and he could see some blood running down his arm crucify him vernon heard someone shout in the dream crucify him a group of people in the audience shouted together as vernon tried vainly to see through the klieg lights he woke up sweating for a couple of moments he was disoriented then again his emotions went the cycle from disgust to depression to fear as he played through the events of the night before joanna was tender and affectionate after she woke up but vernon was very distant he explained his attitude by saying he was worried about his coming exams a couple of times joanna started to talk about what had happened the night before but each time he rapidly changed the subject vernon suffered through brunch and the drive back to college park to joannas sorority house joanna tried to kiss him meaningfully when they parted but vernon did not reciprocate he was in a hurry to forget the entire weekend back in the privacy of his own room in annapolis he contritely bargained again with god to let him escape unscathed midshipman vernon winters was true to his word he not only never talked to joanna carr again he also gave up dating altogether during his final eighteen months at annapolis he worked very hard on his studies and attended chapel as he had promised god twice each week he graduated with honors and did his initial tour of duty on a large aircraft carrier two years later in june of after betty pendleton had completed college and obtained her teachers certificate vernon married her in the columbus presbyterian church where they had played joseph and mary a dozen years earlier they moved to norfolk virginia and vernon believed that the pattern of his life was set his life would be going out to sea for long stretches and then coming home for short stays with betty and any children they might have vernon regularly thanked god for keeping up his part of the bargain and he dedicated himself to being the finest officer in the us navy all of his fitness reports praised his dependability and thoroughness his commanding officers openly told him that he was admiral material until libya or more specifically until he returned home after the libyan action for the entire world changed for vernon allen winters during the few weeks after the american attack against gaddafi carol and troy were sitting in deck chairs at the front of the florida queen they were facing forward in the boat toward the ocean and the warm afternoon sun carol had removed her purple blouse to reveal the top of a onepiece blue bathing suit but she was still wearing her white cotton slacks troy was shirtless in a white surfing outfit that came quite a way down his beautiful black legs his body was lean and sinewy clearly fit but not overly muscled they were talking casually and animatedly laughing often in an easy way behind them underneath the canopy nick williams was reading a fans notes by fred exley every now and then he would look up at the other two for a few moments and then return to his book so why didnt you ever go to college carol was asking troy you clearly had the ability you would have made a fantastic engineer troy stood up took off his sunglasses and walked to the railing my brother jamie said the same thing he said slowly staring out at the quiet ocean but i was just too wild when i finally did graduate from high school i was hungry to know what the world was like so i took off i wandered all over the us and canada for a couple of years was that when you learned about electronics carol asked she checked her watch to see what time it was that was later much later said troy remembering those two years of wandering i didnt learn anything except how to survive on my wits plus what it was like to be a black boy in a white mans world he looked at carol there was no noticeable reaction i must have had a hundred different jobs he continued looking back at the ocean i was a cook a copyboy a bartender a construction worker i even taught swimming lessons in a private club i was a bellman in a resort hotel a greenskeeper for a country club troy laughed and turned again to see if carol was paying attention but i guess youre not interested in all this sure i am carol said its fascinating to me im trying to imagine what you looked like in a hotel uniform and if chief nick is right we still have another ten minutes to pass until we reach where were going she dropped her voice at least you talk the professor is not exactly social being a black bellhop at a southern mississippi resort hotel was an amazing learning experience troy began a smile spreading across his face troy loved to tell stories about his life it always placed him center stage imagine angel im eighteen years old and i luck into a job at the grand old gulfport inn right on the beach room and board plus tips im on top of the world at least until the chief bellman an impossible little man named fish takes me out to the barracks where all the bellhops and kitchen staff live and introduces me to everybody as the new nigger bellhop from bits of discussion i can tell that the hotel is in some kind of trouble because of possible racial discrimination and hiring me is part of their response my room in the barracks was right behind the twelfth green on the golf course a small bunk bed a dresser built into the wall a desk or table with a portable lamp a sink to brush my teeth and wash my face thats where i lived for six weeks down at the other end of the building was the great community bathroom that everyone left whenever i showed up in my high school in miami virtually the entire student body was cuban or black or both so i knew almost nothing about white people from books and television i had this fantasy image of whites as handsome competent educated and rich ha my fantasy quickly vanished you would not have believed the crew that worked in that hotel the head bellman fish smoked dope every night with his sixteenyearold son danny and dreamed of the day he would find a million dollars left in somebodys room his only other goal in life was to continue screwing the chefs wife marie in the supply closet every morning until he died one of the other bellmen was a poor lonely soul whose real name was saint john because his brilliant parents thought that saint was a given name he had only six teeth wore thick glasses and had a giant tumor underneath his left eye saint john knew that he was ugly and he worried all the time about losing his job because of his personal appearance so fish exploited him unmercifully by giving him all the shittiest assignments and forcing him to pay kickbacks with a portion of his tips the other bellmen also ridiculed saint john at every opportunity and made him the butt of their practical jokes one night i was sitting quietly in my room reading a book when there was a soft knock on the door when i answered it saint john was standing there he looked confused and distracted he was holding a small game box in one hand and a sixpack of beer in the other i waited a few moments and then asked him what he wanted he looked nervously in both directions and then asked me if i knew how to play chess when i told him yes and added that i would enjoy a game saint john grinned from ear to ear and mumbled something about being glad that he had taken a chance i invited him in and we played and talked and drank beer for almost two hours he was one of nine children from a poor rural mississippi family while we were playing saint john casually let slip that he had been a little reluctant to ask me to play because fish and miller had told him that niggers were too dumb to play chess saint john and i became friends at least sort of for the few more weeks that i stayed there we were united by the deepest of bonds we were both outsiders in that strange social structure created by the employees of the gulfport inn it was from saint john that i learned about the many misconceptions that southern whites have about blacks troy laughed you know one night saint john actually followed me to the bathroom to verify with his own eyes that i was not significantly larger than he was troy returned to his deck chair and looked at carol she was smiling it was hard not to enjoy troys stories he told them with such enthusiasm and selfinvolved charm under the canopy nick also had put his book aside and was listening to the conversation then there was this giant farrell early twenties who looked like elvis presley he supplied liquor to the guests at cut rates operated an escort service on call and took excess hotel goods to sell at his sisters market he rented part of my room to store some of the liquor what a character after big convention breakfasts farrell would pour the leftover orange juice in the pitchers into bottles and keep it for resale one morning the hotel manager found a case of the juice temporarily sitting in a room off the lobby and demanded to know what was going on farrell grabbed me and took me out front he told me that he wanted to make a deal if i would acknowledge that i had taken the juice farrell would pay me twenty dollars he explained that if i confessed nothing would happen to me because niggers were expected to steal but if he farrell were caught he would lose his job nick came out from under the canopy i hate to break this up he said a little sarcastic edge in his voice but according to our computer navigator we are now at the south edge of the region on the map he handed the map back to carol thanks professor troy laughed i believe you saved carol from being talked to death he walked over to where all the monitoring equipment had been set up on the footlocker next to the canopy he turned on the power supply hey angel you want to tell me now how this all works dale michaels ocean telescope was programmed to take three virtually simultaneous pictures at each fixed setting the first of the pictures was a normal visible image the second was the same field of view photographed at infrared wavelengths and the third was a composite sonar image of the same frame the sonar subsystem did not produce crisp pictures only outlines of objects however it probed to greater depths than either the visible or infrared elements of the telescope and could be used even when the water underneath the boat was murky affixed to the bottom of almost any boat the compact telescope could be driven thirty degrees back and forth about the vertical by a small internal motor the observation schedule for the telescope was usually defined by a preprogrammed protocol the details of this sequence as well as the critical optical parameters for the telescope were all stored in the system microprocessor however everything in the software could be changed in realtime by manual input if the operator desired data from the telescope was carried to the rest of the electronic equipment on the boat by means of very thin fiber optics these cables were bracketed along the edge of the boat about ten percent of the pictures reconstructed from this data were then displayed on the boats monitor in realtime but all the data taken by the telescope was automatically recorded in the one hundred gigabit memory unit that adjoined the monitor another set of fiber optics connected the same memory unit with the boats central navigation system and the servomotor actuators controlling the telescopes these circuits were pulsed every ten milliseconds so that the orientation of the telescope and the boats location at the time of each telescope image could be stored together in the permanent file next to the monitor on top of the footlocker but on the other side from the memory unit was the system control panel dr dale michaels and moi were famous throughout the world for the cleverness of their inventions however these ingenious creations were not so easy to operate dale had tried to give carol a crash course on the workings of the system the night before she had driven down to key west from miami it had been almost useless eventually frustrated dale had simply programmed into the microprocessor an easy sequence that mosaicked the area under the boat in regular patterns he then set the optical gains at normal default values and instructed carol not to change anything all you have to do dr michaels had said as he had carefully loaded the system control panel into the station wagon is push this go button then cover the panel to make certain that nobody inadvertently hits the wrong command so carol certainly could not explain to troy how anything worked she walked over beside him on the boat put her arm on his shoulder and grinned sheepishly i hate to disappoint you my inquisitive friend but i dont know any more about how this thing works than i told you when we were setting up all the equipment to operate it all we have to do is turn on the power supply which you have already done and then push this button she pushed the go button on the panel a picture of the clear ocean about fifty feet underneath the boat appeared immediately on the color monitor the picture was amazingly sharp the threesome watched in wonder as a hammerhead shark swam through a school of small gray fish swallowing hundreds of them in his awesome rush as i understand it carol continued as both men stayed glued in fascination to the monitor the telescope system then does the rest following a planned set of observations stored in its software obviously we see what it sees here on this monitor at least we see the visual image the simultaneous infrared and sonar pictures are stored on the recorder my friend at moi tried to explain how i could change between the visual and infrared and sonar images but it wasnt simple youd think it would be as easy as pushing an i for infrared or an s for sonar nope you have to input as many as a dozen commands just to change which output signal is fed into the monitor troy was impressed not just by the ocean telescope system but also by the way carol a woman admittedly not educated in engineering or electronics had clearly grasped the essentials of it the infrared part of the telescope must measure thermal radiation he said slowly if i remember my high school physics correctly but how would underwater thermal variations tell you anything about whales at this point nick williams shook his head and turned away from the screen he recognized that he was hopelessly out of his intellectual element with all these engineering terms and he was more than a little embarrassed to admit his total ignorance in front of carol and troy nick also didnt believe for an instant that carol had brought all this electronic wizardry on board to find whales that had strayed from their migration route he walked over to the small refrigerator and pulled out another beer and what were going to do for the next two hours if i understand it correctly is ride around in the boat while you look for whales on that screen nicks derisive comment carried with it an unmistakable challenge it intruded upon the warm and friendly rapport that had been created between carol and troy she allowed herself to become irritated again by nicks attitude and fired back her own verbal fusillade that was the plan mister williams as i told you when we left key west but troy tells me that youre something of a treasure hunter or at least were some years ago and since you seem to have convinced yourself that treasure is really what im after perhaps youd like to sit here next to me and look at the same pictures to make sure i dont miss any whales or treasure as the case may be nick and carol glared at each other for a few moments then troy stepped between them look professor and you too angel i dont pretend to understand why you two insist on pissing each other off but its a pain in the ass for me cant you just cool it for a while after all troy added looking first at nick and then at carol if you two go for a dive youre partners your lives may depend on one another so knock it off carol shrugged her shoulders and nodded okay by me she said but seeing no immediate response from nick she couldnt resist another shot provided that mr williams recognizes his responsibility as a padi member and stays sober enough to dive nicks eyes flashed angrily then he walked over to the deck railing and dramatically poured his new beer into the ocean dont worry about me sweetheart he said forcing a smile i can take care of myself you just worry about what you do the ocean telescope microprocessor contained a special alarm subroutine that sounded a noise like a telephone ring whenever the programmed alarm conditions were triggered at carols request dale michaels had personally adapted the normal alarming algorithm just before she left for key west so that it would react to either a large creature moving across the field of view or a stationary unknown object of significant size after he had finished the logic design for the small change and sent it to his software department for top priority coding and testing dale had smiled to himself he was amused by his complicity with carol this piece of technological subterfuge would certainly convince carols companions whoever they might be that she was earnest in her search for whales at the same time the alarm would also sound if what carol was really seeking supposedly an errant navy missile currently under development appeared on the ocean floor underneath the boat the basic structure for both alarm algorithms was easy to understand to identify a moving animal it was sufficient to overlay two or three images taken less than a second apart and then compare the data using the knowledge that most of the scene should be unchanged significant miscompares would suggest the presence of a large moving creature to identify foreign objects in the field of view the alarm algorithm took advantage of the tremendous storage capacity of the memory unit in the telescope data processing system the near simultaneous infrared and visual images were fed into the memory unit and then crudely analyzed against a data set that contained chains of pattern recognition parameters over both wavelength regions these pattern parameters had been developed through years of careful research and had been recently expanded by moi to include virtually everything normal that might be seen on the ocean floor around the florida keys any large object that didnt correlate in realtime with this existing data base would be flagged and the alarm would sound the alarms made it unnecessary to sit patiently in front of the screen and study the thousands of frames of data as they were received on the boat even troy a confessed knowledge junkie whose interest in everything was almost insatiable grew tired of staring at the monitor after about ten minutes particularly when the boat entered into deeper water and very little could be seen in the visual images a couple of solitary sharks triggered alarms and created momentary excitement about twenty minutes after the telescope was activated but a long period void of any discoveries followed as the afternoon waned nick became more and more impatient i dont know why i allowed myself to be talked into this wild goose chase he grumbled to nobody in particular we could have been preparing the boat for the weekend charter carol ignored nicks comment and studied the map one more time they had traversed from south to north the region she and dale had defined and were now moving slowly east along the northern periphery dale had constructed the search area based upon his own inferences from the questions asked him by the navy he probably could have pinned down the area of interest with greater certainty with a few more questions of his own but he hadnt wanted to arouse any suspicions carol knew that the search was a little like finding a needle in a haystack but she had thought it would he worthwhile because of the potential payoff if she could somehow find and photograph a secret navy missile that had crashed near a populated area what a scoop that would be but now she too was growing a little impatient and it was hard for her to revive her earlier excitement after the long afternoon in the sun they would have to head back to key west soon to ensure arrival by nightfall oh well she thought to herself with resignation at least i gave it a shot and as my father used to say nothing ventured nothing gained she was standing all the way at the prow of the boat when suddenly alarms started coming from the memory unit next to the monitor one ring then two followed by a brief silence a third ring then sounded and was rapidly joined by a fourth carol rushed excitedly toward the monitor stop the boat she shouted imperiously at nick but she was too late by the time she reached the monitor the alarms had stopped and she could not see anything on the screen turn around turn around a frustrated carol hollered immediately not noticing that nick was again glaring at her aye aye capitan nick said jerking on the wheel with such force that carol lost her balance the monitor and other electronic equipment started to slide off their flimsy mountings on the top of the footlocker they were rescued at the last minute by troy the florida queen veered sharply in the water despite the quietness of the ocean a small wave came over the railing on the low side of the deck catching carol from the knees down the bottom of her cotton slacks were left clinging to her calves her white tennis shoes and socks were drenched nick made no effort to hide his amusement carol was about to joust with him again when the renewed ringing of the alarms diverted her attention regaining her squishy footing as the boat leveled off she saw in the monitor that they were above a coral reef and deep beneath the boat barely discernible on the screen were three whales of the same kind that she had seen on the beach that morning at deer key they were swimming together in what appeared to be an aimless pattern but there was more the special alarm message code indicated that there was also a foreign object in or near to the same field of view as the desultory whales carol could not contain her excitement she clapped her hands anchor please she shouted and then she laughed she saw that troy had already thrown the anchor overboard a few minutes later carol was hurriedly putting on her buoyancy vest in the aft portion of the boat behind the canopy her mask and her flippers had already been adjusted and were beside her on the deck troy was helping her by holding up the air bottle that was built into the back of the bulky vest dont worry about nick troy said he may be grumpy today for some reason maybe because harvard lost the basketball game but hes a fabulous diver and he has the reputation of being the best dive teacher in the keys he grinned after all he taught me a couple of months ago and were not even supposed to be able to swim carol smiled and shook her head at troy dont you ever stop joking she said she slid her free arm through the second opening and the vest fell into place by the way she continued softly for an expert diver your friend certainly uses antiquated equipment at this moment she regretted her decision to leave her customized diving vest in the station wagon she always used it when she dove with dale and it had all the latest advances such as abc and a perfect pocket for her underwater camera but after all the brouhaha when she came through the marina headquarters with her footlocker of electronic equipment carol had decided not to attract further attention by bringing in a stateoftheart diving vest nick thinks the new vests make it too easy for the diver he wants them to have to adjust their buoyancy manually so that they are more conscious of how far down they are troy looked carol over youre pretty light this belt may be enough by itself do you normally use any weights carol shook her head and pulled the belt around her waist nick came around the canopy carrying his mask and flippers he had already put on his diving vest with air bottle and his weighted belt those whales of yours are still in the same spot down there he said ive never seen whales hang around like that he handed her a piece of chewing tobacco she rubbed the tobacco on the inside of her mask while nick walked around behind her he looked at her air gauge and checked both her regulator and the secondary mouthpiece that he might have to use to share her air in the event of an emergency nick talked to carol while he was making her final equipment checks this is your charter he began in what sounded like a friendly tone so we can go almost anywhere you want while we are down there the dive will not be too difficult since its only fortyfive feet or so to the floor however nick moved around in front of carol and looked directly in her eyes i want one thing thoroughly understood this is my boat and i am responsible for the safety of the people on it including you whether you like it or not before we dive i want to make certain that you will follow my lead under the water carol recognized that nick was trying to be diplomatic it even flashed through her mind that he looked sort of cute standing there in front of her in his diving gear she decided to be gracious agreed she said but one thing before we descend remember that im a reporter i will have a camera with me and may want you to move from time to time so dont get angry if i motion you out of the way nick smiled okay he said ill try to remember carol put on her flippers and mask then she picked up her underwater camera by the strap and threw it over her neck and shoulder troy helped her tighten the strap in the back nick was sitting on the side of the boat at a break in the railing right next to a crude ladder that troy had just dropped overboard ive checked the water already nick said and theres quite a current up here lets go down the anchor rope until we reach the ocean floor then you can pick the direction from there nick rolled backward off the boat in a moment he surfaced treading water carol returned his thumbsup sign and sat down herself on the side of the boat troy helped her make one last comfort adjustment to her vest good luck angel troy said i hope you find what youre looking for and be careful carol put the regulator in her mouth took a breath and then repeated nicks backward roll maneuver the ocean water felt cool against her sunbaked back in a few seconds she joined nick over at the anchor rope and the two of them repeated the thumbs up sign nick led the way down he went hand over hand cautiously never completely releasing the rope carol followed carefully she could feel the strong current that nick had mentioned it pulled at her trying to take her away from the rope but she managed to hold on every six to eight feet in the descent nick stopped to equalize the pressure in his ears and looked up to see both that carol was following and that she was all right then he continued his descent there was nothing much to see until they reached the reef beneath them the telescope pictures had been so sharp that they had been misleading the reef with its riot of color and its surfeit of plant and animal life had seemed to be right underneath them because of the automatic focusing action of the optical system but thirtyfive feet is a long way down any normal threestory building could have been sitting on the ocean floor underneath the florida queen and it would not have touched her hull when they finally reached the top of the reef where the anchor was implanted carol realized she had made a mistake she did not recognize her surroundings and therefore did not know which direction to take to find the whales she reproached herself briefly for not having spent a few more moments studying the monitor to make sure that she knew where all the landmarks were oh well carol then thought its too late for that now ill just pick a direction and go besides i dont have any idea where the alarm object is anyway visibility in the water was fair to good maybe fifty to sixty feet in all directions carol adjusted her buoyancy slightly and then pointed to a gap between two reef structures both of which were covered with kelp sea anemones and the ubiquitous coral nick nodded his head tucking her arms to her side to streamline her movement carol kicked up and down with her flippers and swam toward the gap behind her nick watched carol swim with appreciation and admiration she moved through the water as gracefully as the school of yellow and black angelfish beside her nick had not interrogated carol very much about her diving experience and had not known exactly what to expect he had suspected from her ease and familiarity with the equipment that she was a seasoned diver but he had not prepared himself for an underwater peer except for greta nick had not encountered a woman before who was as comfortable under the water as he was nick absolutely loved the peace and serenity of the rich and vibrant world beneath the ocean surface the only sound he ever heard down there was his own breathing all around him the coral reefs teemed with life of unimaginable beauty and complexity there underneath him now was a grouper taking a bath by sitting at the bottom of a natural hole and letting dozens of tiny cleaner fish eat away all the accumulated parasites a moment earlier nicks downward excursion toward the ocean floor had scared up a manta ray hidden in the sand this large ray called a devilfish by the cognoscenti had undulated out of its hiding place at the last moment and just missed nick with its powerful and dangerous tail nick williams felt at home down in this watery world at the bottom of the gulf of mexico it was his recreation and his refuge whenever he was distressed or disturbed by events on the surface he knew that he could dive and find relaxation and escape except on this particular dive he was aware of an ineffable emotion a beginning perhaps a longing that was barely defined possibly mixed up with a memory of years ago he was following a beautiful mermaid as she swam along the reef and the sight stirred him i have acted like a schoolboy he thought and a bore or worse and why because she is pretty no because she is so alive so much more alive than i am carol and nick made two different excursions each time starting from the anchor rope without finding the whales or anything else unusual when they returned to the anchor after the second unsuccessful foray nick pointed at his watch they had been under the water for almost half an hour already carol wagged her head up and down and then held up her index finger indicating that she would try one more direction they found the whales right after they crossed over a big upward bulge in the reef that came within fifteen feet of the surface nick saw them first and pointed down the three whales were about twenty feet below them and maybe thirty yards ahead they were still swimming slowly more or less together in the same directionless near circular pattern that nick and carol had watched on the screen carol waved nick out of the way and pointed at her camera she then swam toward the whales taking pictures as she approached them while carefully monitoring her depth and equalizing the pressure in her ears nick swam down beside her he was certain the whales had seen the two of them but for some reason they had made no attempt to flee in all his years as a diver nick had only once seen a whale in the open ocean accept the nearby presence of a human and that had been a calfing mother in a pacific ocean lagoon off of baja california whose birth pangs were a more powerful force than her instinctive fear of humans here even when carol approached to within twenty feet or so the whales continued their indolent drift they appeared to be lost or maybe even drugged carol slowed her approach when the whales made no attempt to get away she took some more photographs closeup pictures of whales in their natural habitat were still uncommon so her trip had already been a journalistic success but she too was puzzled by their behavior why were they ignoring her presence and what were they doing hanging around this particular spot she remembered being surprised by the solitary whale during her morning swim and wondered again if somehow all these strange events were related nick was off to her right about twenty yards away he was pointing at something on the other side of the whales and gesturing for carol to come toward him she swam away from the great mammals and headed in nicks direction she saw immediately what had attracted his attention below the whales just above the ocean floor there was a large dark hole in the bottom of an imposing reef structure at first glance it appeared to be the entrance to an underground cave of some kind but carols sharp eyes noticed that the lipshaped fissure was extremely smooth and symmetric almost suggesting to her that it was an engineering construction of some kind she laughed at herself as she swam up beside nick the amazing underwater world and the bizarre behavior of these whales were playing tricks with her mind nick pointed down at the hole and then at himself indicating that he was going down to check it out more closely when he started to leave carol had a sudden impulse to reach for his foot and pull him back a moment later as she watched nick swim away a powerful fear of unknown origin swept over her she began to tremble as she struggled gamely with this strange emotion goose bumps appeared on her arms and legs and carol felt an overwhelming desire to get away to escape before something terrible happened an instant later she saw one of the whales move toward nick if carol had been on land she could have yelled but fifty feet deep in the ocean there was no way to warn someone from afar as nick drew near the opening unaware of any danger he was brushed to the side by one of the whales with such force that he bounced against the reef and then caromed off he fell down onto a small spot of sand on the ocean floor carol swam toward him quickly while keeping a careful eye on the whales nick had lost his regulator and did not seem to be making any attempt to replace it she drew up beside him and flashed the thumbsup sign there was no response nicks eyes were closed carol felt a surge of adrenaline as she reached for nicks regulator and thrust it into his mouth she beat against his mask with her fist after a few painfully long seconds nick opened his eyes carol tried thumbs up again nick shook his head as if he were clearing out the cobwebs smiled and then returned the okay signal he started to move but carol restrained him she indicated with gestures for him to sit still while she hurriedly looked him over from the force with which nick had hit the reef carol feared the worst even if his diving gear was all right certainly his skin would have been ripped and torn by the sharp coral and the impact but incredibly there did not appear to be significant damage to either nick or the equipment all she could find were a couple of small scrapes the three whales remained in the same area where they had been before looking up at them from below carol thought that they looked like sentinels guarding a particular piece of ocean territory back and forth they swam inscribing a total composite arc of maybe two hundred yards whatever it had been that had caused one of the whales to vary its swimming pattern and run into nick was certainly unclear but carol did not want to risk another encounter she motioned for nick to follow her and they swam about thirty yards away to a sandy trench between the reefs carol planned to return to the surface as soon as it was clear that nick was not seriously hurt but while carol was thoroughly surveying his body to make certain that she had not overlooked any serious lacerations in her hurried check nick discovered two parallel indentations in the sand below him he grabbed carols arm to show her what he had found the indentations were grooved like tank tracks and were about three inches deep they appeared to be fresh in one direction the tracks ran toward the reef fissure underneath the three whales in the other direction the parallel lines extended as far as nick and carol could see running along the sandy trench between the two major reefs in the area nick pointed up the trench and then swam away in that direction following the tracks with fascination he did not turn around to see if carol were following carol quickly backtracked as close to the fissure as she dared to take some pictures and to verify that the tracks did indeed emanate from the opening in the reef she thought she saw a network of similar indentations converging just in front of the fissure but she did not tarry long she didnt want to be separated from nick in this spooky place when she turned around he was just barely in sight but he had fortunately stopped when he realized that carol was not behind him nick made an apologetic gesture when she finally caught up with him at one point the parallel lines disappeared as the sandy trench turned to rock but nick and carol located the continuation of the same tracks some fifty yards farther along the trench eventually became so narrow that they were forced to swim six feet or so above it to keep from banging against the rocks and coral on either side soon thereafter the tracks and the trench made a left turn and disappeared under an overhang carol and nick stopped and floated in the water facing each other they carried on a conversation with hand gestures at length they decided that carol would go down first to see if anything was under the overhang since she wanted a closeup photograph of the disappearance of the tracks anyway carol swam carefully down to the floor of the trench skillfully avoiding contact with the edges of the reef on both sides where it disappeared under the overhang the trench was just wide enough for her to put one of her flippered feet down lengthwise the overhang was about eighteen inches above the floor but there was no way she could bend down and look underneath without scraping her face or hands against the reef carol gingerly slid her hand under the overhang in the last direction of the tracks nothing she would have to brace herself against the rocks and coral and stick her hand deeper into the area while carol was trying to move herself into a better position she momentarily lost her balance and felt the sting of coral on the back of her left thigh ouch she thought as she put her right hand back under the overhang thats one for me one physical reminder of an amazing day weird even bizarre whales tank tracks on the bottom of the ocean what is this carols hand closed around what felt like a metallic rod about an inch thick it was such a surprising touch she immediately withdrew her hand and a shudder raced down her spine her heart rate accelerated and she tried to breathe slowly to calm herself then she purposefully put her hand back and found the object again or was it another object this time she felt something metallic all right but it seemed to be wider and to have four tines like a fork carol slid her hand along the object and refound the rod portion from his vantage point above her nick could tell that carol had discovered something now it was his turn to be excited he swam down to her as she struggled unsuccessfully to retrieve the object they changed positions and nick reached under the projecting rock he first touched something that felt like a smooth sphere about the size of the palm of his hand nick could tell that the bottom of the sphere rested on the sand and that the rod attached to it was elevated by several inches nick steadied himself and jerked on the rod it moved a little he moved his grip sideways on the rod and heaved again several more pulls and the object was out from under the overhang for almost a minute nick and carol hovered over the goldmetallic object lying beneath them on the sand its surface was smooth to the eye as well as to the touch and altogether it was about eighteen inches long nothing but the polished reflecting surface could be seen suggesting that the object was indeed made from some kind of metal the long axis of the object was an inchthick rod that was at one end tapered and worked into a kind of a hook four inches back from the hook was the center of a small sphere symmetrically constructed around the rod whose radius was a little over two inches the larger sphere that nick had felt when he first put his hand under the overhang had a radius of four inches or so and it was right in the middle of the rod this sphere was also perfectly symmetric around the rod axis beyond the two spheres the object was unadorned until the rod broke into four smaller branches the tines that carol had felt at its other end carol carefully took photographs of the object as it lay exposed in front of the overhang before she was finished nick pointed at his watch they had been underwater almost an hour carol checked her air gauge and found that she was almost into the red she waved a sign at nick and he swam down to pick up the object it was extremely heavy weighing an astonishing twenty pounds or so in nicks estimation then it wasnt caught on anything when i was trying to pull it out nick thought its just that heavy the weight of the object only increased nicks excitement that had begun when he had first seen the gold color although he had never seen anything quite like this hook and fork with spheres he remembered that the heaviest pieces from the wreck of the santa rosa had all been made of gold and this piece was far heavier than anything he had ever touched jesus he thought to himself as he discarded some of the lead weights in his belt to make it easier for him to carry the object up to the boat if theres even ten pounds of pure gold here at current market value of a thousand dollars an ounce thats and this may just be the beginning wherever this thing came from there must be more all right williams this may be your lucky day carols thoughts raced at a mile a minute as she swam in tandem with nick toward the anchor rope she was busy trying to integrate everything she had seen in the last hour she was already convinced that everything was somehow associated with the errant navy missile the behavior of the whales the golden fork with the hook the tank tracks on the bottom of the ocean but at first carol had no clue about what the connections were during the swim back carol suddenly remembered reading some years before a story about russian submarine tracks being found on the ocean floor outside a swedish naval yard in her journalistic mind she began to concoct a wild but plausible scenario to explain everything that she had seen maybe the missile crashed near here and continued to send out data even when it was underwater she thought to herself its electronic signals somehow confused the whales and maybe those same signals were picked up by russian submarines and american her thoughts came to a temporary dead end for a moment so there are at least two choices carol thought again after swimming a few more strokes and watching nick approach the anchor rope with the golden object still firmly in his hand either ive found a russian plot to locate and steal an american missile or the tracks and goldenfork are somehow part of an american effort to find the missile without alerting the public it doesnt matter either way its a big story but i must take that golden thing to dale and moi to analyze both nick and carol were dangerously low on air by the time they reached the surface beside the florida queen they called troy to give them a hand with their prize from the deep carol and nick were exhausted when they finally crawled into the boat but they were also both on emotional highs thrilled with the discoveries of the afternoon everyone started talking at once troy had a story to tell too for he had seen something unusual on the monitor while nick and carol were following the tracks in the trench nick pulled some beer and sandwiches out of the refrigerator and carol tended her coral cuts the laughing trio sat down on the deck chairs together as the sun was setting they had much to share during the ninetyminute trip back to key west the camaraderie lasted most of the way back to the marina nick was no longer taciturn excited by what he believed was the initial find of a major sunken treasure he was positively a chatterbox at least twice he retold his version of the whale encounter nick was certain that the collision was accidental that the whale simply happened to be moving in that direction for some other reason and just paid no attention to the fact that nick was there impossible nick had scoffed when carol had initially suggested that the whale might have deliberately hit him because he was heading for the fissure in the reef whoever heard of whales guarding a spot in the ocean besides if your theorys right then why didnt the whale really smack me and finish me off youre asking me to accept that the whales were protecting an underground cave and then that they were warning me to stay away with that gentle push he laughed goodnaturedly let me ask you something miss dawson he said do you believe in elves and fairies from where i was watching carol replied it sure looked as if the whole thing was planned she did not pursue the subject further in fact after her initial outbursts carol did not talk very much about anything on the trip back to key west she too was excited and she was worried that if she talked too much she might inadvertently give away her thoughts about the possible connection between what they had seen and the lost navy missile so she didnt mention either her eerie fear just before the whale hit nick or the network of tracks she thought she saw converging just under the base of the fissure as far as nick was concerned the object they had retrieved was definitely part of a treasure it didnt bother him that it was hidden under an overhang at the end of some strange tracks he shrugged it off by suggesting that maybe somebody had found the sunken treasure several years earlier and then tried to hide a few of the better pieces nick was blind to all arguments and even facts that didnt support his treasure theory it was emotionally vital to nick for the gold fork thing to be the first piece of a great discovery and like many people nick was capable of suspending his normally sharp critical faculties when he had a vested emotional involvement in an issue when nick and carol finally quieted down enough to listen troy had a chance to tell his own story after you guys left the area underneath the boat i guess to follow your trench i became worried about you and started watching the screen more often now angel by this time those three whales had been swimming about in that same dumb pattern for over an hour so i wasnt checking them real close troy was up out of his deck chair walking back and forth in front of carol and nick it was a dark night low clouds had rolled in from the north to block the moon and obscure most of the stars the spotlight from the top of the canopy occasionally caught troys chiseled features as he moved in and out of the shadows because i wanted to find you guys i lifted the alarm suppression the way you showed me and was regularly serenaded by the dingdongding from the three whales now listen to this after a couple of minutes i heard a fourth alarm i looked down at the monitor expecting to see one of you and i saw another whale same species swimming underneath the other three and in the opposite direction within ten seconds the original whales turned breaking their long pattern and followed the new whale off the monitor to the left they never returned troy wound up the story with a dramatic inflection and nick laughed out loud jesus jefferson you do have a way of telling a story i suppose youre going to tell me now that these whales were stationed there and the new guy came along with different orders or something like that christ between you and carol youll have me believe that the whales are organized into covens of whatever nick stopped for a moment troy was disappointed that carol didnt say anything now nick continued dismissing troys story and getting to the subject he had been thinking about for almost an hour we have an important issue to discuss we have brought back something from the ocean that could conceivably be worth a lot of money if nobody else can prove conclusively that it is theirs then it will belong to the finders nick looked first at carol and then at troy even though im captain and owner of this boat and i carried the thing up from the ocean floor im prepared to offer that we split the proceeds in thirds does that sound fair enough to the two of you there was a moderately long silence before troy answered sure nick that sounds fine to me nick smiled and reached across to shake troys hand he then extended his hand to carol just a minute she said quietly looking directly at nick and not taking his hand since youve decided to start this conversation there are several more items that must be discussed its not simply a question of money for this object theres also the issue of possession who keeps the golden trident who determines when weve been offered a fair price what do we agree to say or not to say to others and what if other objects are found down there by one or more of us do we all share theres an entire agreement that must be worked out before we dock nick frowned now i understand why youve been so quiet these last few minutes youve been thinking about your share i misjudged you i thought you might decide not to create any more trouble who said anything about trouble carol interrupted him abruptly her voice rising slightly if you must know im not that interested in the damn money i will gladly take my onethird if any dollars are forthcoming from the trident there for i certainly deserve it but if any more such treasures are down there and you and troy can find them without me then be my guest i want something else both men were now listening intently first and foremost i want exclusive rights to this story and that means absolute secrecy about what we have found when and where we found it and anything else associated with it at least until were certain theres nothing more to learn second i want immediate possession of the object for fortyeight hours before anyone else knows that it exists after that you can have it to take to the authorities for evaluation uh oh carol thought to herself as she saw the searching looks she had elicited from nick and troy i overdid it they suspect something better back off just a bit of course she smiled disarmingly ive just given my initial position i expect that some negotiations may be necessary wow angel troy said with a laugh that was some speech for just a minute there i thought that maybe there was a whole other game going on here and you were the only one playing of course the professor and i will be delighted to discuss an agreement with you wont we nick nick nodded but he had also been alerted by the careful organization and unmistakable intensity of carols response it seemed out of proportion to the journalistic value of their find is she trying to make this some kind of a contest between us he thought to himself or am i missing something altogether they had worked out a compromise agreement by the time the florida queen reached the dock in key west nick would take the golden trident with him on friday morning there was an elderly woman in key west who was a compendium of treasure knowledge and she would be able to assess its value and to give its probable place and date of origin the woman would also be a witness to their find in case the trident were ever misplaced on friday afternoon the three of them would meet on the boat or in the marina parking lot at four oclock nick would give the object to carol and she would keep it over the weekend after she returned it to nick on monday morning he would be responsible for its care and eventual sale the three of them had joint ownership of the trident but carol waived any interest in future discoveries carol wrote the terms of the simple agreement on the back of a restaurant menu from her purse they all signed it and she promised to bring copies back the next day troy was quiet and subdued while he was loading all carols equipment back into the footlocker he lifted the locker onto the cart and then pulled the cart along the jetty carol walked beside him it was about nine oclock and very quiet at the marina the tall fluorescent lights created a strange reflection on the wooden jetties well angel troy said as carol and he approached the marina headquarters its been quite a day ive really enjoyed your company he stopped and turned to look at her her black hair had dried unevenly and looked a bit disheveled but her face was beautiful in the reflected light troy looked away out at the water and the boats you know its a shame sometimes the way life works you meet somebody by chance you strike up a friendship and then poof theyre gone its all so so transient carol came over beside him and stretched to kiss his cheek and you know i like you too she said lightening up the conversation with a grin and making certain that troy understood what kind of a friendship they could have but cheer up all is not lost youll see me tomorrow for a while and then maybe when i return the golden thing on monday she hooked her arm through his as they momentarily walked back down the jetty away from the loaded cart and who knows carol laughed im down in the keys from time to time we could have a drink together and you could tell me some more stories they could just barely make out the spotlight above the canopy on the florida queen some hundred yards in the distance i see your friend the professor is still at work hes not strong on goodbyes or any other area of manners as far as i can tell she turned switching locked arms and they walked back to the loaded cart they moved through the apparently deserted headquarters without speaking when the footlocker had been replaced in the station wagon carol gave troy a hug youre a good man troy jefferson she said i wish you well nick was almost ready to leave by the time troy returned to the boat he was packing a small exercise bag looks innocent enough doesnt it troy nobody will ever suspect that one of the great treasures of the ocean is in here he paused a moment and changed the subject you put her safely in her car good shes a strange one isnt she all feisty and aggressive but still pretty at the same time i wonder what makes her tick nick zipped up the bag and walked around to the side of the canopy just finish up with the diving gear tonight dont worry about the rest of the boat well fix it up tomorrow im going to go home and dream of riches speaking of riches professor troy said with a smile how about that hundreddollar loan i asked you for on tuesday you never answered me and just said well see nick walked deliberately over to troy and stood right in front of him he spoke very slowly i should have made my polonius speech to both of us when you asked me for a loan the first time but here we are now borrower and lender and i dont like it i will lend you a hundred dollars but mister troy jefferson this is positively the last time please dont ever ask me again these loans for your socalled inventions are making it hard for me to work with you troy was a little surprised by the unexpected harshness in nicks tone but he was also angered by the connotation of the last sentence are you suggesting troy said softly suppressing his temper that im not telling the truth that the money is not being spent on electronics or are you telling that you dont believe an uneducated black man could possibly invent anything worth having nick faced troy again spare me your righteous racial indignation this is not a question of prejudice or lies its money pure and simple my lending you money is fucking up our friendship troy started to speak but nick waved him off now its been a long day and a fascinating one at that ive said all i want to say on the subject of the loan and i consider the issue finished nick picked up his bag said good night and left the florida queen troy went behind the canopy to organize the diving gear about ten minutes later just as he was finishing he heard someone calling his name troy troy is that you an accented voice said troy leaned around the canopy and saw greta standing on the jetty under the fluorescent light even though there was now a slight chill in the air she was wearing her usual skimpy bikini that showed off her marvelous physique troy broke into a grand smile well well if it isnt superkraut how the hell are you i can see youre still taking care of that wondrous body greta managed the beginnings of a smile homer and ellen and i are having a small party tonight we noticed that you were working late and thought that maybe youd like to join us when youre done just might do that troy said nodding his head up and down just might do that oh god cant we stop now finally please let us its so quiet here now she was speaking to the stars and the sky the old mans head slumped forward in the wheelchair as he drew his last breath hannah jelkes knelt beside him to see if he was indeed gone and then after kissing him on the crown of the head she looked up again with a peaceful smile the curtain fell and rose again in a few seconds the cast assembled quickly on stage okay thats it for tonight good job the director a man in his early sixties gray hair thinning on the top approached the stage with a bounce great performance henrietta try to can that one for the opening tomorrow night just the right combination of strength and vulnerability melvin burton nimbly jumped up on the stage and you jessie if you make maxine any lustier theyll close us down he spun around with a flourish and laughed along with two other people at the front of the theater okay gang melvin turned back to address the cast now go home and get lots of rest it was better tonight looked good oh commander can you and tiffani stay around for a moment after you change i have a couple more pointers for you he jumped back down from the stage and walked back to the fourth row of the theater where his two associates were sitting one was a woman even older than melvin but with twinkling green eyes behind her granny glasses she was wearing a bright print dress full of spring colors the other person was a man about forty with a studious face and a warm open manner melvin fretted as he sat down beside them i worried when we picked night of the iquana that it might be too difficult for key west its not as well known as streetcar or glass menagerie and in some ways the characters are just as foreign as those in suddenly last summer but it looks almost okay if we can just fix the scenes between shannon and charlotte are you sorry now you added the prologue the woman asked amanda winchester was an institution in key west among other things she was the doyenne of the theatrical entrepreneurs in the revitalized city she owned two of the new theaters near the marina and had been responsible for the formation of at least three different local repertory groups she loved plays and theater people and melvin burton was her favorite director no im not amanda it clearly adds to the play to get some kind of initial feeling for how frustrating it would be to lead a group of baptist women on a tour of mexico in the summer and without the sex scene between charlotte and shannon in that small stuffy hotel room im not sure their affair is believable to the audience he paused a moment reflecting huston did the same thing with the movie right now that sex scene doesnt play at all the other man said in fact its almost comical the hugs they exchange are like the ones my brother gives his daughters patience marc melvin answered something has to be done or we should take the prologue out altogether amanda agreed marcs right the scene tonight was almost comical part of the problem is that charlotte looks like a child in that scene she paused a moment before continuing you know the girl has gorgeous long hair and we have it stacked on top of her head to look prim and proper clearly she wouldnt wear it down all day in the heat of a mexican summer but what if she took it down when she went to shannons room thats a great idea amanda as i have often said you would have made a fabulous director melvin looked at marc and they exchanged a warm smile then the director settled back in his seat and started thinking about what he was going to tell his two cast members in a few moments melvin burton was a happy man he lived with his roommate of fifteen years marc adler in a beach house on sugarloaf key about ten miles east of key west melvin had directed plays on broadway for almost a decade and had been associated with the theater in one capacity or another since the midfifties always careful with his money melvin had managed to save an impressive amount by worried about the impact of inflation on his savings melvin had sought advice from an accountant who was a friend of a close associate it was almost love at first sight marc was twentyeight at the time shy lonely unsure of himself in the maelstrom of new york city melvins savoir faire and theatrical panache opened marc up to aspects of life that he had never known as the stock market ratcheted upward in the mideighties melvin watched his net worth near a million dollars but other factors in his life were not so bullish the aids epidemic hit the theatrical community in new york with a vengeance and both melvin and marc lost many of their lifelong friends and melvins career seemed to have peaked he was no longer in demand as one of the premier directors one night on his way home from the theater marc was mugged by a group of teenagers they beat him up stole his watch and wallet and left him bleeding in the street as a saddened melvin ministered to his friends wounds he made a major decision they would leave new york he would sell his stocks and convert his fortune to fixed income investments they would buy a home where it was warm and safe where they could relax and read and swim together maybe they would do some community theater work if it was available but that was not the most important thing what was important was that they share melvins remaining years melvin ran into amanda winchester one day while he and marc were on vacation in key west they had worked together briefly on a project that had never panned out twenty years before amanda told him that she had just formed a local amateur repettory group to do two tennessee williams plays a year would he be interested in directing them melvin and marc moved to key west and started to build their house on sugarloaf key both of them thoroughly enjoyed their work with the key west players the actors were everyday people dedicated and earnest some had had a little acting experience but for the most part the secretaries housewives and retail clerks plus officers and enlisted men from the us naval air station were all novices with one thing in common each of them viewed his few days on the stage as his moment of glory and he wanted to make the best of it commander winters came out of the dressing room first he was wearing his uniform and looked a bit stiff and uncertain he sat down in one of the theater chairs next to amanda winchester i was really glad to see you back again said amanda taking his hand i thought your goober last fall was just right winters thanked her politely amanda changed the subject so how are things out at the base i read an article the other day in the miami herald about all the modern weapons the navy has these days pilotless submarines and vertical takeoff fighters and search and destroy torpedoes there seems to be no limit to our ability to build more powerful and dangerous toys for war are you involved with all that only in a limited way commander winters answered pleasantly then anticipating the discussion with the director he leaned forward so that he could see melvin and marc as well as amanda i apologize if i was a little flat tonight he began we have a couple of big problems out at the base and i may have been a bit distracted but ill be ready tomorrow oh no said melvin interrupting him thats not what i wanted to talk to you about its your first scene with tiffani ah here she comes lets go up on the stage tiffani thomas was almost seventeen years old and a junior at key west high school a navy brat all her life tiffani had gone to seven different schools in her eleven years since kindergarten her father was a noncommissioned officer who had been assigned to key west about three months before she had been recommended to melvin burton by the high school drama teacher when it became apparent that denise wright simply could not play the role of charlotte goodall she hasnt done anything for me yet except rehearse the teacher had said of tiffani but she learns her lines quickly and has a quality an intensity i guess that sets her apart from the others and shes clearly been in plays before i dont know if she can get ready in three weeks but shes my first choice by far tiffani probably would not have been called beautiful by her florida classmates her features were too much out of the ordinary to be be properly appreciated by most high school boys her assets were olive eyes quiet and brooding light freckles on a pale complexion long red eyelashes tinged with brown and a magnificent head of thick auburn hair her carriage was proper and erect not slumped like most teenagers so she probably seemed aloof to her peers striking amanda called her accurately when she first saw tiffani she was standing on the stage alone in her shortsleeved blouse and jeans as the two men approached her hair was pulled back in a ponytail the way her father liked it tiffani was very nervous she was worried about what mr burton was going to say to her she had overheard the buyer who was playing hannah jelkes say that melvin might do away with the part of charlotte altogether if the new girl cant hack it i have worked so hard for this part tiffani thought oh please please dont let it be bad news tiffani was looking down at her feet when melvin burton and commander winters joined her on the stage well now melvin began lets get straight to the point the first scene with you two in the hotel room is not working in fact its a disaster we must make some changes melvin saw that tiffani was not looking at him gently he put his hand under her chin and lifted it until her eyes met his you must look at me child for im trying to tell you some very important things he noticed that her eyes were brimming with water and his years of experience told him immediately what was wrong he leaned forward and whispered so that nobody else could hear i said we would make some changes not do away with the scene now get yourself together and listen up burton regained his directors voice and turned toward winters in this scene commander your character shannon and young miss goodall engage in foreplay that leads to intercourse later that night in the following scene they are discovered in flagrante delicto by the confused miss fellowes and that establishes the desperate situation causing shannon to run to maxine and fred at the costa verde but our scene does not work right now because nobody watching it will recognize what you two are doing as foreplay now i can change the movement to make it easier putting shannan already on the bed when he discovers charlotte behind the door would be one way and i can change charlottes clothing so that she looks less like a little girl but theres one thing that i cannot do melvin stopped and looked back and forth from tiffani to winters they were both staring blankly at him come here come here both of you melvin said gesturing impatiently with his right hand he dropped his voice again he took tiffanis hand with his left and commander winters with his right you two are lovers for one night in this play it is essential that the audience believe this or they will not understand completely why shannon is at the end of his rope like the iguana shannon is desperate because he was originally locked out of his church for giving in to the same lust they were both listening but melvins directors intuition told him he was still not reaching them he had another idea he took tiffanis hand and put it into the commanders closing his own hand over theirs for emphasis look at each other for a moment thats right he turned to winters shes a beautiful young woman isnt she commander their eyes were in contact and hes a handsome man isnt he tiffani i want you to imagine that you have an uncontrollable desire to touch him to kiss him to be naked with him tiffani blushed winters fidgeted melvin was fairly certain that he saw a spark albeit a fleeting one now tomorrow night he continued looking at tiffani and taking his hand off theirs i want you to capture that feeling when youre hiding in his room i want it to explode out of you when he notices that you are there and you commander he looked back at the middleaged naval officer you are torn between an overpowering passion to possess this young girl physically and the almost certain knowledge that it will be the final ruination of both your life and your soul you are hopelessly trapped remember you fear that god has already forsaken you for your past sins but despite that you finally relinquish yourself to your lust and commit another unpardonable sin tiffani and commander winters both realized at virtually the same time that their hands were still intertwined they looked at each other for a moment and then embarrassed awkwardly separated them melvin burton slipped between his players and put his arms around their shoulders so go on home now and think about what ive said and come back tomorrow and really break a leg vernon winters drove the pontiac into his driveway in suburban key west just before eleven oclock the house was quiet the only lights were in the garage and the kitchen as regular as the stars vernon thought hap to bed at ten betty to bed at tenthirty in his minds eye he saw his wife go into his sons bedroom as she did every night and fiddle momentarily with his sheets and coverlet did you say your prayers yes maam hap always answered then she would kiss him good night on the forehead turn out his light as she left the room and go into her bedroom within ten minutes she would have changed into her pajamas brushed her teeth and washed her face she would then kneel beside her bed her elbows on the top of the blanket and her hands clasped right in front of her face dear god she would say aloud and then she would pray until exactly tenthirty moving her lips silently with her eyes closed five minutes later she would be asleep vernon was aware of a vague disquiet as he walked through the living room toward the three bedrooms on the opposite side of the house from the garage there was something stirring in him something that he could not identify exactly but he assumed it was associated with either the nervousness of opening night or the sudden return of randy hilliard to his life he wanted to talk to someone he stopped at haps bedroom first commander winters walked in quietly in the dark and sat on the side of his sons bed hap was fast asleep lying on his side a tiny nightlight beside his bed illuminated his profile how like your mother you look winters thought and act you two are so close im almost a trespasser in my own home he put his hand gently against haps cheek the boy did not stir how can i make up for all the time i was gone winters gently nudged his son awake hap he said softly its your dad henry allen pendleton winters rubbed his eyes and then sat up quickly in bed yes sir he said is anything wrong is mom all right no his father answered and then laughed i mean yes moms all right nothings wrong i just wanted to talk hap looked at the clock beside his bed ummm well okay dad what do you want to talk about winters was quiet for a moment hap did you ever read the copy of the script that i got for you and your mother the one from my play no sir not much hap replied im sorry but i just couldnt get into it i think maybe its above my head he brightened but im looking forward to seeing you in it tomorrow night there was a long pause umm whats it about anyway winters stood up and looked out the open window beyond the screen he could hear the gentle susurration of the crickets its about a man who loses his place with god because he cant or wont control his actions its about winters turned his head around quicky and caught his son eyeing the clock a sharp emotional pain raced through him he waited until it had abated and then drew a breath well we can talk about it some other time son i just realized how late it is he walked to the door good night hap he said good night sir vernon winters walked past his wifes room to the third bedroom at the end of the hall he undressed slowly now even more aware than before of an unfulfilled longing he thought for a fleeting second about waking betty up to talk and maybe but he knew better thats not her style he said to himself never was even before when we slept together and after libya and the dreams and tears at night who could blame her for wanting her own bedroom he slipped into his bed in his undershorts the soothing melody of the crickets enveloped him and besides she has her god and i have my despair there is nothing left between us except hap we couple as strangers both fearing any discovery the communication room will close in five minutes the communication room will close in five minutes the disembodied recorded voice sounded tired carol dawson was weary herself she was talking to dale michaels on the videophone photographs were strewn all over the desk underneath the screen and the video camera all right carol was saying i guess i agree with you the only possible way for me to decipher this puzzle is to bring all the photos and the telescope recording unit back to miami she sighed and then yawned ill come up there first thing in the morning on the flight that arrives at seventhirty so that ipl can get an early shot at the recorded data but remember i must be back here in time to pick up the golden trident at four can the lab process all the data in a couple of hours thats not the hard part trying to analyze the data and piece together a coherent story in an hour or two will be the tough job dr dale was sitting on the couch in the living room of his spacious condominium in key biscayne in front of him on the coffee table was a magnificent jade chess board with green and white squares six carved chess pieces were still on the board the two opposing queens and four pawns two from each side dale michaels paused and looked meaningfully at the camera i know how important this is to you ive cancelled my eleven oclock meeting so i can help you thanks carol said automatically she felt a trickle of irritation why is it she thought while dale talked about one of his new projects at moi that men always demand gratitude for every little sacrifice if a woman changes her schedule to accommodate a man its expected but if a man revises his precious schedule its a big fucking deal dale droned on now he was enthusiastically telling her about a new institute effort to survey the underwater volcanoes around papua new guinea whew carol smiled to herself when she realized that dales selfcentered focus was bothering her i must really be beat i believe im on the verge of being bitchy hey carol interrupted him she stood up and started to pick up the scattered photographs sorry to bring a halt to this party but theyre closing the room and im exhausted ill see you in the morning arent you going to make a move dale replied pointing at the chess board no im not carol said showing just a trace of anger and i may not ever any reasonable player would have accepted the draw that i offered you last weekend and gone on to more important things your damn ego just cant deal with the idea that one game out of five i can battle you to a tie people have been known to make mistakes in the endgame dale answered avoiding altogether the emotional content in her remark but i know youre tired ill meet you at the airport and take you to breakfast okay good night carol hung up the videophone a little brusquely and packed all the photographs in her briefcase as soon as she had left the marina she had taken her camera and film straight to the darkroom at the key west independent where she had spent an hour developing and studying the prints the results were intriguing particularly a couple of the blowups in one of them she could clearly see four separate tracks converging to a spot just under the fissure in another photo the bodies of the three whales were caught in a pose that looked as if they were in the middle of a deep conversation carol walked through the spacious lobby in the marriott hotel the piano bar was almost deserted the lithe black pianist was playing an old karen carpenter song goodbye to love a handsome man in his late thirties or early forties was kissing a rashy young blonde in a nook off to the right carol bridled the bimbo must be all of twentythree she said to herself probably his secretary or something equally important as she wound her way down the long corridor toward her room carol thought about her conversation with dale he had told her that the navy had small robot vehicles some of them derived from original moi designs that could easily have made the tracks so it was virtually certain that the russians had similar vehicles he had dismissed the whales behavior as irrelevant but had thought that her failure to find out if anything else was under the overhang had been a serious mistake of course carol had realized when he had said it i should have spent another minute looking nuts i hope i didnt blow it in her minds eye she then had carefully revisited the entire scenario at the overhang to see if there were any clues that something else may have been hidden there the biggest surprise in the discussion with dale had come when carol in passing had praised the way the new alarm algorithm had worked dale suddenly had become very interested so the alert code definitely read he had said yes she had answered thats why i wasnt that astonished when we found the object no way he had said emphatically the trident could not have caused the alert code even if it was at the edge of the field of view of the telescope and that seems unlikely given how far you followed the trench its too small to trigger the foreign object alarm and how could it have been seen under the overhang anyway dale had paused for a few seconds you didnt look at any of the infrared images in realtime did you well we can process them tomorrow and see if we can figure out what triggered the alarm carol felt strangely defeated as she opened the door to her motel room its just fatigue she said to herself not wanting to admit that her conversation with dale had made her feel inadequate she put her briefcase on a chair and walked wearily to the bathroom to wash her face two minutes later she was asleep on the bed in her underclothes her slacks blouse shoes and socks were all stacked together in the corner she is a little girl again in her dream wearing the blueandyellow striped dress that her parents gave her for her seventh birthday carol is walking around with her father in the northridge mall on a busy saturday morning they pass a large candy store she lets go of his hand and runs into the store and stares through the glass case at all the chocolates carol points at some milk chocolate turtles when the big man behind the display case asks her what she wants in the dream carol cannot reach the counter and doesnt have any money where is your mother little girl the candy store man asks carol shakes her head and the man repeats the question she stands on her tiptoes and tells the man in a confidential whisper that her mother drinks too much but that her father always buys her candy the man smiles but he still wont give her the chocolates and where is your father little girl the candy store man now asks in the case carol can see the reflection of a kindly smiling man standing behind her framed between two piles of chocolates she wheels around expecting to see her father but the man behind her is not her father this mans face is grotesque disfigured frightened she turns back around to the chocolates the man in the store is now taking the candy away it is closing time carol starts to cry where is your father little girl where is your father the little girl in the dream is sobbing she is surrounded by big people all of them asking questions she puts her hands over her ears hes gone carol finally shouts hes gone he left us and went away and now im all alone cycle against the deep black background of scattered stars the filaments of the milky way galaxy seem like thin wisps of light added by a master artist here at the far edge of the outer shell near the beginning of what the colonists call the gap there is no suggestion of the teeming activity of the colony some twentyfour light millicycles away an awesome unbroken quiet is the background for the breathtaking beauty of a black sky studded with twinkling stars suddenly out of the void comes a small interstellar messenger robot it seeks and finally finds a dark spherical satellite about three miles in diameter that is easily overlooked in the great panorama of the celestial sky time passes a closeup reveals activity on the satellite soft artificial lights now illuminate portions of the surface automated vehicles are working on the periphery of the object apparently changing its shape external structures are dismantled and taken off to a temporary storage area in the distance at length the original satellite disappears altogether and what is left are two long parallel rails of metal alloy built in sections of about two hundred yards apiece from the spare parts of the now vanished satellite each rail is ten yards across and separated from its matched partner by about a hundred yards regular sorties to the storage area continue until the useful supplies of material are depleted and the tracks extend for a distance of almost ten miles then activity stops the rails from nowhere to nowhere in space stand as mute reminders of some major engineering activity suddenly abandoned or was it from just below a prominent binary pair the two brightest lights in the eastern sky a speck emerges the speck grows until it dominates the eastern quadrant of the sky a dozen no sixteen great interstellar cargo ships with bright flashing red lights lead a procession of robot vehicles into the region the ghostly rails to nowhere are surrounded by the new arrivals the first cargo ship opens and eight small shuttles emerge each one moving back down the line toward another of the great cargo containers the shuttles wait silently outside the huge ships while the entourage completes its arrival the final vehicle to arrive is a tiny space tug pulling a long slender object that looks like two folded japanese fans joined together end to end it is encased in a transparent and protective sheath of very thin material eight small darting vehicles dance like hummingbirds along its entire length as if they were somehow guiding it guarding it and checking out its health all at the same time the large cargo ships shaped like ancient blimps now open and reveal their contents most of them are carrying rail sections stacked in enormous piles the small shuttles unload the sections leaving them stacked and set them in groups stretching for miles in both directions from the existing rails when the rail sections are almost all unloaded four of the shuttles approach the side of one of the remaining giant cargo ships and wait for the bay doors to swing open from the inside of this cargo ship come eight machines that attack each of the four shuttles in pairs breaking them carefully into pieces and taking the parts back into the dark of the cargo bay a few moments later an elongated complex of articulating machinery emerges from this great ship once released from the confines of the cargo carrier it stretches itself into a long bench reaching almost a mile in length every hundred yards or so along the central platform of this bench a smaller set of coordinated components form into highly organized local groups this is the automated multipurpose construction system one of the technological treasures of the colonists the entire system moves into place at the end of the tracks and its many remote manipulators begin to pull rail sections from the various stacks its sophisticated local hands and fingers deftly put the new sections in place and attach them with atomic welds the speed is astonishing an entire mile of new track is finished within minutes and the great builder moves to another group of rail section piles the completed tracks extend for almost a hundred miles in space having finished with one task the construction system undergoes its next metamorphosis tearing itself into pieces starting from the two ends of the long bench the monolithic structure disappears and is reorganized into thousands of separate but similar components these little antlike contraptions attach themselves in groups to individual rail sections they measure carefully all the dimensions and check all the welds between adjacent sections then as if on cue the rails on the four ends of the track segments begin to bend and elevate lifted by the antlike components the rails twist upward upward bringing the rest of the track with them the two long parallel lines are eventually transformed into a giant double hoop over ten miles in radius that looks like an amusement park ferris wheel suspended in space with the completion of the double hoop the construction system again reconfigures itself some of the new elements of the system pick up the long slender object shaped like endtoend japanese fans they erect it near the hoop under the careful surveillance of its hummingbird protectors then the object is hoist into place as a northsouth spoke in the double hoop structure some of the hummingbirds produce unseen thin cables and anchor the spoke to the hoop structure at both ends the rest of the tiny mechanical speedsters create a web that winds around the center section and connects the great antenna with the eastwest axis of the hoops the antenna now connected to its supporting structure opens slowly at both the north and south pole positions on the hoop closer inspection reveals that the hummingbirds are actually pulling the delicate individual folds apart the folds spread out until the entire interior of the hoops is covered with a mixture of mesh ribbing and amazingly complex local arrays the initial deployment is complete the communication complex next goes through an elaborate selftest while its construction minions stand by in case any problems are encountered the tests are successful and the station is declared operational within hours the phalanx of robot emissaries from the inhabited universe picks up all the stray metal lying around and packs it into one of the large cargo ships then as swiftly as they came the robot vehicles disappear into the blackness around the station leaving the imposing hoop structure alone as a reminder of the presence of intelligence in the universe around the vast outer shell whose two hundred and fiftysix sections each contain more volume than the colony over one thousand similar upgrades have been made during cycle in an attempt to extend advanced communications capabilities to new locales this is the last upgrade of a very difficult group in a region near the gap this group was delayed several times because of an unacceptably high number of manufacturing deficiencies at the nearest major factory over two light millicycles away after several attempts to diagnose and repair the problems eventually the plant had to be closed and virtually rebuilt from scratch the total delay to the completion of the project was fourteen millicycles just about what the council of engineers had predicted in their worstcase analysis that accompanied the cycle proclamation as the big moment approaches all normal activity in the heart of the colony ceases in the last nanocycle there is no business activity no entertainment the spaceports are even empty at precisely after two hundred millicycles of debate and discussion by the council of leaders the governmental blueprint for the next era will be delivered and all intelligence in the colony will be listening the giant transmitter is activated on schedule and the cycle proclamation pours out at an information rate of a hundred trillion bits of information per picocycle the actual data rate from the powerful source is much higher but the information rate is reduced to accommodate requirements for both sophisticated encoding and error checks internal to the data with the coding only colony receivers equipped with special decryption algorithms can unscramble the message at any level and the internal consistency checks on each packet of data in the transmission reduce the probability of receiving an erroneous piece of information even at an enormous distance to practically zero following the organization and agenda for the proclamation established in the era of genius between cycles and the first microcycle of the transmission is a complete summary of the entire plan two hundred nanocycles of this summary are devoted to each of the five divisions governed by the council of leaders administration information communication transportation and exploration after a planned break of four hundred nanocycles to allow receiver adjustments along the path of the signal the transmission of the actual cycle proclamation begins on and on it goes it does not stop until twenty microcycles later four complete microcycles are used for indepth explanations of the major projects to be undertaken in each of the five disciplines of particular interest to the committee for the outer shell the group that governs the huge concentric region defining the most distant reach where the colonists claim jurisdiction is a plan from the division of exploration announcing the repatriation to the outer shell of almost a million species from zoo system the proclamation is relayed throughout the colony and the near reaches of the inner shell by means of giant communication stations along the developed transportation routes these stations actually information centers that store all colony messages in their extensive libraries for as long as a hundred cycles amplify and retransmit the signal to the next station in the pattern some ten light microcycles away the edge of the colony was expanded by the boundary decree in the cycle proclamation to include all points up to three light millicycles from the administrative center thus by the time the proclamation reaches the mammoth zoo complex a combination of three stars and nineteen planets just across the edge of the colony the message has been relayed through three hundred stations the committee of zookeepers eagerly awaits the proclamation to find out the response to their recommended expansion of the zoo complex they are surprised to find their proposal replaced by another repatriation plan once before in cycle they had proposed an expansion of the zoo to handle the explosion of successful progeny created by the breakthroughs in adaptive genetic engineering during cycles at that time also their request had been denied and the council of leaders had recommended repatriation to solve the population problem during cycles the population of the zoo complex was kept approximately constant by these regular transfers of common species back to their original homes but starting with cycle there was a rapid increase in interest in comparative biology it was triggered by the discovery of a fifth class of life form called type e by the council of biologists in section of the outer shell subsequent expeditions to the same area showed not only that the dominant life type throughout sections was type e but also that type a was surprisingly present as well in those sections this was the first time that natural evolution in any region had shown a predilection for any kind of life form other than the type a of the colonists and its developed hybrids the quest to understand these unusual creatures led to the endangered species expeditions in the outer shell in cycles and and the creation in cycle of several worlds specifically to study the new type e life forms many of these new species flourished in zoo system causing population and space problems again for the committee of zookeepers the space shortage was especially severe and it was exacerbated both by the need to segregate all the type e life forms and by their rapid reproduction therefore at the beginning of the planning process for this cycle the committee of zookeepers had proposed their small expansion of the zoo complex suggesting not only a fourth zoo system completely dedicated to type e life forms but also a vigorous campaign for completing the repatriation of all colony and inner shell species with aggression coefficients below the committee of zookeepers are stunned by the scale of the outer shell repatriation plan contained in the cycle proclamation in a lively technical discussion catalyzed by the unexpected proposal the dangers of returning the outer shell life forms to their original planets are vigorously reasserted the committee decides tentatively to take an unusual stepto submit a proclamation variance to the council of leaders in the draft variance the zookeepers point out that many genetic experiments have been conducted with the new type e forms that the evolutionary possibilities for the new species are therefore uncertain that the monitoring frequencies and test facilities in the outer shell are inadequate and that the aggression coefficients for many of the group are not yet accurately tabulated before they actually submit the variance however the committee of zookeepers realizes that someone must have pointed out all these factors in the original debates so why was the repatriation policy promulgated was this part of some new overarching design that downgrades the importance of zoological information altogether or is the policy strictly political and possibly connected with the message from power in keeping with the laws of the colony governing the dissemination and preservation of important historical information the official commentary of key councillevel organizations accompanies the transmission of the cycle proclamation of particular interest to those involved in the outer shell repatriation project are the following excerpts from the report of the council of engineers the earliest repatriation to the inner shell was done on almost an ad hoc basis simply transporting the life forms en masse to their original region or another of similar environment in a nearby sector this was accomplished by conducting a roundup of the tranquilized creatures at their zoo habitats loading them into huge cargo vessels maintaining internal conditions equivalent to the habitat and then dispersing them at their new home this process worked adequately for small transfers over short distances it was also cheap however it had many severe deficiencies that rendered it almost useless for sustained operations first and foremost the ontogenetic development of the creatures was completely interrupted by the repatriation procedure they were frightened by their removal disturbed by their necessarily reduced locus of movement during transit and once situated in their new locales bothered by even minute differences from their earlier homes their memories even if electronically cleansed retained an intense sense of that undermined their adjustment all these conditions taken together led to a marked phylogenetic increase in aggression coefficient across the board that did not significantly damp in some of the species for ten to fifteen generations from the point of view of spacecraft design both the size and distance of the proposed transfers precluded using mature specimens long before the biological and developmental problems were thoroughly understood when the cycle proclamation called for increased repatriation within the colony and the inner shell there was some panic at the council of engineers because it was thought that transportation vehicles on a near planetary scale might be required fortunately the committees on biological engineering and advanced robotics proposed that future transfers be accomplished using suspended zygotes together with new versions of the superintelligent robots serving as zoo monitors after a few early problems with the zygote technique it was more or less perfected at least for the types a and b life forms prevalent in the colony repatriation success ratios for the last ten cycles are very high even for the more difficult types c and d however such success ratios should not be expected in the implementation of the cycle proclamation not only are some of the target life forms the newest and least understood in the zoo complex but also they will be repatriated in many cases to a distant poorly documented biological environment where monitoring is as infrequent as every three or four hundred millicycles some of the more advanced type e forms have amazingly short life spans for lntelligence as little as five or six millicycles which means that fifty to a hundred generations may elapse between progress checks but all in all it is a magnificent challenge for engineering many transfer vehicles will fly well outside the standard transportation infrastructure and therefore must be able to forage raw materials on their own conditions at the target worlds may have changed so adaptability and the processing of new information will play a critical role in the design the electronic components will have more failures due to the long flight times meaning that extraordinary fault correction systems must be developed and tested and from the council of historians it is useful to begin our mostly negative comment on the outer shell repatriation plan by reminding all colonists that our council includes the longest continuously active intelligence pool of any council in the directory two of our groups have direct memories of the era of genius through many generations of biological refresh thus it is natural that our approach to any proposed project is to assess its merit in terms of its role in the overall evolution andor strategy of our society it is not our desire to dampen the youthful zeal that thrills at the acquisition of new knowledge or the prospect of great adventure rather we would like to place a sense of perspective on all colony endeavors and measure the future impact of any perceived changes in basic policy the proposed repatriation scheme is still another step in the dangerous folly of unbridled frontierism that began in our opinion with the boundary decree of cycle instead of discussing the details of the proposed plan without reference to its historical context we wish to delineate its dangers by including it in our broad indictment of the entire genus of adventures spawned by the boundary decree the justifications advanced for frontierism always sound good on the surface its proponents point out that societal change is produced by new information outside the ordinary sweep of events that frontierism is essentially aimed at producing this kind of new knowledge and that the resulting change in perspective that comes from a new view of the universe forces the proper and regular reassessment of our culture history is usually in general agreement with the advocates of frontierism and that is doubtless why this repatriation proposal and similar other previous exploration activities have been so enthusiastically supported however there are limitations to the benefits redounding from new information especially when frontier investigations reveal knowledge that is either inimical to the fundamental structure of the society or beyond the comprehension of the most learned groups in these cases the diffusion through the society of the new information is unsettling instead of being enriching and uplifting and actually undermines the security of the established institutions a perfect example of what happens when frontierism is embraced without constraint can be seen in the events of the last thirty cycles that led to the receipt of the message from power in the middle of cycle the boundary decree initiated the process by establishing in effect a new jurisdictional domain for the colonists the old central colony had no rigorous boundary significant development extended out to only two light millicycles distance from the administrative center the outermost permanently maintained station was at that time a mere ten light millicycles away the decree of cycle regularized the nearby universe creating four concentric worlds and expanding the central colony itself to a radius of three light millicycles three specific shells were also created with the outer shell defined to be the entire region between twelve and twentyfour light millicycles away from the administrative center this outer shell contained fifty thousand unexplored star systems in a volume a thousand times greater than that of the old central colony during the period between cycles and almost half of the major initiatives identified in the cyclical proclamations were involved in one way or another with the exploration of the outer shell men in cycle our new class of interstellar drones specifically designed to study and categorize the many worlds of the outer shell encountered a large quiescent spacecraft of unknown origin careful in situ investigations were unsuccsssful in their attempts to correlate the engineering components of the spaceship with any known technological base for a spacefaring species eschewing the caution suggested by many of the committees the council of leaders had the enigmatic spaceship towed back to one of the developed cities of the inner shell there it was placed on display and analyzed in detail the initial conclusion of the drones was validated the spacecraft had not come from anywhere inside the domain of the colony the council of engineers concluded that the technological capabillty of this builders was roughly equivalent to that of the colonists in the early era of genius but when had it been made and where did it come from and most importantly who had made it by deciding to bring the dead spaceship back to civilization the council of leaders basically guaranteed that the unsettling question of its origin would remain uppermost in the minds of the colonists this unbridled quest for any and all information again worked to destabilize the culture the entire society was rife with rumored explanations to the unanswered and disquieting questions raised by the spaceship the dominant opinion was that the craft had been a colonial prototype never put into production that had somehow been omitted from the official encyclopedia of space vehicles this opinion was consistent with the general tendency of the colonists to believe they were innately superior to all other life forms it might have been possible to let the doubts and fears about the unknown spacecraft diminish to nothing but the council of leaders resuscitated the collective anxieties by announcing in the cycle proclamation that the largest new project of the colony would be the design and eventual deployment of a new generation of receiver arrays in the outer shell the purpose of these arrays would be to intercept and decode any coherent radio messages that might be emanating from inside the gap it was a clear indication that the leadership believed the silent spaceship to be of extracolonial origin in cycles and wave after wave of disturbing information staggered the colony first there was the premature announcement that many extracolonial messages had been decoded this disclosure supported the widespread rumor of multiple powers in the galaxy some of them far more evolved than the colony this frightening concept lingered for half a cycle before the council of astronomers responding to these proliferating halftruths finally announced that all but a handful of the messages could be ascribed to a single power power whose center of activity appeared to be about two hundred light millicycles away shortly thereafter their next astonishing announcement unambiguously identified power transmissions coming from sources as far as one hundred and fifty light millicycles apart or more than three times the diameter across the entire colony jurisdiction between cycle and the receipt of the message the council of leaders ignored advice that the colony should carefully husband its resources while analyzing the impact of the discovery of the strange spaceship crash programs were instituted in advanced encryption it is true primarily to allay concerns that power might be monitoring all our transmissions this action was widely hailed as a step in the right direction however at the same time the exploration of the outer shell was intensified leading to the identification of the new type e life forms and the subsequent thinly disguised endangered species roundup all suggestions to retrench and slow down the exploration program were ignored in cycle in fact the zoo complex created several artificial planets just for the conduct of genetic capabilities experiments with the type e species then came the message from power so simple so straightforward so terrifying it was coded in our most advanced encryption algorithm it acknowledged our mutual awareness of one another and suggested opening up bilateral communications nothing else end of message it is not fear of hostility from power that motivates our objection to continued exploration in the outer shell on the contrary we as historians think the nascent concern about the possible aggressiveness of power is unfounded study after study has shown that there is a significant positive correlation between high aggression coefficient and inability to evolve into a society with a purview greater than a single solar system in fact the probability that a society as advanced as ours could have retained aggression and territoriality as constituents in its overall psychological makeup is vanishingly small nevertheless such monumental events as the receipt of the message from power call for reflection and synthesis not additional exploratory activities we should be using our resources to study and understand the entire range of impacts that the message will have on our society not squandering them on bold repatriation schemes it is a question of priorities and once again the advocates of frontierism exalting new information and technological development over the stability of the society are blind to the downside risks of their endeavors friday nick williams woke up at five oclock in the morning and could not go back to sleep his mind was too active racing over and over the events of the day before and the possible outcomes of the day ahead the same phenomenon had occurred often when he was in high school in virginia and then a few times later at harvard usually just before big swimming meets if he had too much excitement running through his system his brain would not turn off enough to let him sleep he lay in bed for almost another hour alternately trying to coax himself back to sleep and indulging his fantasy that what he had found the day before was just the first item in a vast cache of valuable treasure nick loved to fantasize it was always easy for him to see in his minds eye all the scenes in the novels that he loved so much to read now for a moment he imagined headlines in the miami herald announcing his discovery of a hoard of sunken gold off the coast of key west around six oclock nick gave up trying to sleep and climbed out of bed the little exercise bag was next to the dresser he pulled the golden trident out to look at it as he had done four or five times the night before what was this thing he asked himself it must have had some practical use for its too damn ugly to be ornamental he shook his head amanda will know if anyone can tell me where this thing came from she can nick walked across his bedroom to the sliding glass doors and opened the curtains it was almost sunrise beyond the small balcony outside he could see the beach and the ocean his condominium was on the third floor and had an unspoiled view of the quiet surf above the water a couple of brown pelicans soared in graceful formation waiting for a chance to descend into the water and catch some unsuspecting fish swimming too close to the surface nick watched a couple in their seventies walking slowly along the beach they were holding hands and talking quietly a couple of times the woman broke away to pick up a shell or two and put it in a small ziploc bag nick turned away from the door and grabbed the jeans that he had dropped on the floor the night before he pulled them on over his undershorts and walked into the living room carrying the bag with the trident he put the golden object carefully on the table where he could study it and then went back into the open kitchen to start the coffee maker and turn on the radio except for the books nicks living room was decorated just like hundreds of florida seaside condominiums the couch and easy chair were comfortable and bright cream in color with a couple of light green ferns in the pattern for decoration two small paintings of water birds standing on an empty beach adorned the otherwise empty walls light beige drapes that matched the carpet framed the long sliding glass doors that led to the balcony with the rattan patio furniture it was the books that gave the apartment some individuality along the wall opposite the couch between the living room and the bedroom was the large wood bookcase it stretched almost all the way from the sliding glass doors in front of the balcony to the bedroom door although the general appearance of the apartment was one of disarray the bookcase area was clearly well maintained altogether there must have been four or five hundred books on the four shelves of the long bookcase all paperbacks virtually all novels and all carefully filed according to category in front of each group of books scotchtaped to the outside of the bookshelf was a sheet of paper identifying the category nick had finished a fans notes on the boat on thursday and had already put it back in its proper place on the shelf right next to a dozen or more books by william faulkner he had then selected for his bedtime reading a nineteenthcentury french novel madame bovary by gustave flaubert nick had read the book once before during his sophomore year at harvard and had not thought that much about it however he had been recently surprised to find the book on several lists of the ten finest novels of all time ranking right up there with such masterpieces as crime and punishment by dostoevsky hmm perhaps i missed something the first time he had told himself the previous night before deciding to read it again but nick had not been able to focus on the magnificently detailed descriptions of life in provincial france a hundred and fifty years earlier as he had followed the story of the lovely emma bovary a woman for whom the stultifying sameness of her life was cause enough to have affairs that would eventually scandalize her village the excitement of nicks own life for once kept intruding he was unable to suspend himself in the novel his mind kept returning to the possibilities offered by the golden object in the exercise bag nick turned the object over and over in his hands while he drank his morning coffee then he had an idea he walked back to the second bedroom just opposite the kitchen and next to the laundry room and opened the closet door nick used most of this closet as a storage area in the corner of the closet were four huge cardboard boxes of junk that he had brought with him when he had bought the condominium seven years earlier he had never opened them even once in the intervening time but he did remember that in one of those boxes were a bunch of photographs of the objects they had brought up from the santa rosa maybe if i look at those pictures he thought to himself as he struggled to find the right container in the dimly lit closet i will see something that looks like that thing he finally located the correct box and dragged it out into the middle of the living room at one time its contents might have been well organized for there were manila folders with filing labels inside but almost all of the papers and photos and newspaper clippings had fallen out of their original places and were now scattered around the box in a loose jumble nick reached in and pulled out a clipping from the miami herald it was yellow from age and had been crammed down into one of the corners five people including nick were featured in a big photograph on the front page nick stopped for a moment and looked at the photo and the caption has it really been that long he wondered almost eight years since we found the santa rosa the caption identified the five individuals in the photograph as the crew of the neptune a dive and salvage boat that had found an old spanish ship named the santa rosa sunk in the gulf of mexico about fifteen miles north of the dry tortugas gold and silver objects worth more than two million dollars had been retrieved from the vessel and were piled in front of the happy smiling crew from left to right they were greta erhard jake lewis homer ashford ellen ashford and nick williams that was before they started eating nick thought to himself ellen ate because of greta because it gave her an excuse in her own mind for what was happening with homer and homer ate because he could afford it just like he does everything else for some people constraints are the only thing that saves them give them freedom and they go berserk nick dug deeper into the box looking for a set of twenty or so photographs that showed most of the large gold items they had retrieved from the santa rosa eventually he started finding some of the pictures in groups of four or five in different parts of what was now becoming a hopeless pile at the bottom of the box each time he would find some more photos he would pull them out look at them carefully and then shake his head to acknowledge that the golden trident did not look a thing like any of the objects from the santa rosa at the bottom of the box nick encountered a yellow manila folder with a rubber band wrapped carefully around it thinking at first that this folder might contain the rest of the pictures from the santa rosa nick pulled out the folder and opened it hastily an x picture of a beautiful woman in her early thirties slid out and fell on the living room floor it was followed by handwritten notes cards a few letters in envelopes and then about twenty sheets of bond paper covered with doublespaced typing nick sighed how was it possible that he hadnt recognized this folder the woman in the portrait had long black hair lightly frosted in the front she was wearing a dark red cotton blouse slightly open at the top to show a triple strand of pearls just under the neck in blue ink that contrasted with the red of the blouse someone with magnificent clearly artistic handwriting had written mon cher je taime monique across the lower right portion of the photograph nick bent down on his knees to pick up the scattered contents of the folder he looked at the portrait carefully his heart skipping a few beats as he remembered how beautiful she had been he started to sort the typed pages together at the top of one of the pages was written in all capital letters monique and then underneath it by nicholas c williams he started to read the wonder of life lies in its unpredictability each of our lives is irrevocably changed by the things we cannot have possibly forecast we walk out of the door every morning to go to work or to class or even to the grocery store and ninetynine times out of a hundred we return without anything having happened that we will remember even a month in the future on those days our lives are swept up in the banality of living in the basic humdrum cadence of everyday existence it is the other day the magic day for which we live on this magic day our character becomes defined our growth is accelerated our emotional transitions are made sometimes maybe once in a lifetime there will be a string of these magic days one after another so full of life and change and challenge that we are completely transformed by the experience and our souls become suffused with a boundless joy during that time we are often overcome by the simple and incredible miracle of just being alive this is the story of one such magic period it was spring break in fort lauderdale our swimming season had just finished at harvard and my uncle as a present for my twentyfirst birthday offered to let me use his condominium in florida for a couple of weeks so i could unwind from the twin rigors of studying and swimming practice nick had not looked at these pages for almost ten years as he read the first few paragraphs he remembered vividly the ecstasy in which they were written it was two nights before the party she was at some social function that night would be too late would come by first thing in the morning i couldnt sleep it was the first night in a week i had been away from her he stopped for a moment old emotions twisting around inside him making him feel dizzy and slightly nauseous he read the first paragraph again it was also before the pain before the incredible goddamn pain for almost thirty minutes music had been playing on the radio nick had heard it he knew it was there but he could not have identified any of the songs it had been background music now just at the moment when his memories of monique were the most poignant the miami classic rock and roll station wmim on your fm dial played cyndi laupers haunting hit time after time the music seemed to increase markedly in amplitude nick had to sit down and grab a breath until the song he had been able to deal with his memories of monique but somehow that song the one he had played on the cassette player in his car almost every night as he had made the drive from fort lauderdale to palm beach to see her carried with it all the youthful love joy fear and anger that had marked the entire affair nick was overwhelmed as he sat on the couch and listened to the song hot tears welled up in his eyes and then ran softly down his cheeks lying in my bed i hear the clock tick and think of you caught up in circles confusion is nothing new flashback warm nights almost left behind suitcase of memories time after time you say go slow i fall behind the second hand unwinds brenda leaned over and turned the volume down on the cassette player its me mr stubbs honest brenda goldfine dont you recognize me she was shouting at an old man in a blue uniform who was sitting on a stool in a small circular tower in the middle of the road and thats teresa silver in the back shes not feeling too well come on open the gate and let us through the security guard climbed down from his stool and slowly walked out in front of nicks old pontiac he wrote the license number down on a note pad and then came around to brendas window all right this time brenda but this is not according to the rules all visitors coming into windsor cove after ten oclock at night must be cleared ahead of time at length the guard raised the gate and nick moved his car forward again the guys really a pain in the ass brenda said to nick smacking her gum as she talked christ youd think he owned one of the places or something nick had heard about windsor cove or rather had read about it once when he was over at his uncles home in potomac maryland there had been a copy of town and country magazine on the table and he had read about the gracious life of windsor cove now as he drove past the estates in the most prestigious section of palm beach he was awed by the personal wealth displayed over there thats teresas house brenda pointed at a colonial house set back about a hundred yards from the road nick drove into the long semicircular driveway and eventually stopped in front of a walkway leading to the front of the house it was an imposing place two full floors six white columns over twenty feet high an opulent door whose top half was an arched stained glass window of a white heron in flight against a blue sky filled with fleecy clouds brenda looked in the back of the car where her friend was passed out look id better handle this ill go up and talk to mrs silver and explain what happened and everything otherwise you could be in deep shit sometimes she jumps to conclusions by the time brenda reached the front door to ring the bell it had already opened an attractive woman in a red silk blouse and a pair of chic black slacks was waiting nick guessed that she had probably been called by the security guard he couldnt tell much about the conversation but he could see that teresas mother was asking questions after a couple of minutes brenda and the woman came back to the car you didnt tell me she was still passed out nick heard a surprisingly husky voice say there was also some kind of accent european perhaps you know brenda this is absolutely the last time she can go anywhere with you you just cant control her im not even sure that you try the voice was angry but not strident nick opened his door and climbed out of the car this is the guy i was telling you about mrs silver brenda said without him teresa might still be lying on the beach mrs silver extended her hand nick took it feeling a little awkward he didnt know how to shake hands with a woman i understand that im in your debt young man mrs silver said graciously brenda tells me that you rescued teresa from all sorts of horrors the light from the street lamps played about her sculptured face her hand was soft sensual nick smelled just a trace of perfume something exotic her eyes were fixed on his unwavering inquisitive yes maam nick said clumsily i mean well she had had too much to drink and i thought the crowd of teenagers she was with were a little bit out of control he stopped she was still watching him measuring him he was becoming agitated and didnt understand why somebody had to help her and i just happened to be there he trailed off weakly mrs silver thanked him again and turned to brenda your mothers expecting you dear well stay out front until you get home flash your lights to let us know youre there brenda looked happy to be dismissed she scampered off into the night in the direction of the nearest house about a hundred yards away there was a momentary pause as they watched the sixteenyearold disappear into the night nick found himself stealing furtive looks at mrs silvers profile an inchoate awareness of what he was feeling made him more nervous jesus shes beautiful and young how could she be the girls mother he was wrestling with a jumble of thoughts as he saw the lights flicker in the distance good she said turning to nick with a smile brendas home now we can worry about teresa she stopped for a moment and laughed oh i almost forgot we havent been formally introduced im teresas mother monica silver im nick williams he said in response her dark eyes were fixed on him again in the reflected light the expression in her eyes seemed to vary one moment she was a pixie then a seductress then a very proper palm beach society woman or was nick imagining it he couldnt return her gaze anymore he felt his cheeks flush as he averted his eyes i had to carry her from the beach to the parking lot nick said abruptly as he went around to the back door of his car and opened it the teenager had been leaning against the door and nearly fell out she didnt stir he picked teresa up and threw her over his shoulder so its no problem for me to carry her for you now im used to it they walked quietly down the path toward the house monica silver leading by a few steps nick watched her walk in front of him she moved effortlessly like a dancer with almost perfect posture her dark hair was wrapped up at the back in a chignon it must be very long he thought to himself with delight imagining her hair flowing down her beautiful back it was a warm and humid palm beach evening nick was sweating by the time they reached the entrance could you do me one more favor nick mrs silver asked could you carry her up to her room my husbands not here and the help has all gone to bed and i doubt seriously if shes going to get herself together well enough to climb the stairs even with my help in the near future nick followed mrs silvers instructions and carried teresa through the atrium into the living room up the entry steps onto the platform up the left flight to the second floor and then into her bedroom it was huge in her room teresa had a kingsize bed with four posters a giant television an entire cabinet of movies for the vcr and a sound system that would have been a credit to any rock and roll band bruce springsteen posters and photos were all over the room nick laid teresa gently on her bed she murmured thank you indicating to him that at least she was semiconscious her mother bent over her and gave her a kiss nick left the two of them alone and went back down the stairs into the living room he could not believe that somebody really could live in a house like this why the living room alone was bigger than the house in falls church where he grew up he wandered around the room after he came down the stairs there were original paintings on the walls crystal glass chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and art objects and bricabrac both on the tables and in every nook and cranny it was all too much for him he was overwhelmed he felt a hand on his shoulder and involuntarily recoiled monica silver chided him goodness youre jumpy its only me he turned around to look at her was he imagining it or had she somehow combed her hair and put on fresh makeup in the few seconds they had been separated for the first time he saw her in the full light she was the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen his breath was taken away and he felt giddy outside he had not been able to see her skin clearly now he found himself staring at her bare arms following the elegant contours of her neck her skin had the smoothness of ivory it called to him to touch it watch yourself williams he heard a voice inside him say or you are going to be outrageous he tried to calm himself but it was useless he could not take his eyes off her she was saying something she had asked him a question he had not even heard it so dumbfounded was he by what was happening by where he was she was leading him somewhere in the house his imagination was running wild she took him into a small room with a table and told him to sit down its the least i can do she was saying to repay you for what you did for teresa i know you must be hungry and we still have some great food left over from the party tonight nick was in a breakfast nook just off the kitchen to his left a door led to the patio and then outside into the back yard the lights around the huge swimming pool were still on he could see manicured gardens with roses in bloom chaise longues colorful umbrellas white iron tables with twisted lacy legs he could not believe that it was all real he felt transported to another world a world that existed only in books and movies monica silver laid out some food on the table smoked salmon onions capers cream cheese two different kinds of bread plus a dish of some other kind of fish that nick did not recognize thats marinated herring she said with a smile noticing nicks quizzical expression she handed him a wine glass he took it and unconsciously looked her straight in the eyes he was transfixed he felt weak and powerless as if he were being drawn into her deep brown bewitching eyes into her world of richness and luxury and beauty his knees were weak his heart was racing he could feel his fingers tingling she poured some white wine in his glass and then in her own this is a brilliant burgundy clos des mouches she said touching her glass to his with a light tinkle lets make a toast she was radiant he was enthralled to happiness she said they talked for over three hours nick learned that monica silver had grown up in france that her father had been a small struggling fur merchant in paris and that she had met her husband aaron while helping her father at the shop she had been seventeen at the time of the whirlwind courtship mr silver had proposed just seven days after they had met and she had accepted immediately even though her husbandtobe was twenty years older she moved to montreal and married him before she was eighteen teresa was born nine months later nick told her that he was in his junior year at harvard majoring in english and french to get a good liberal arts education and prepare himself for either law school or graduate school as soon as she found out that he was in his third year of french she switched and spoke to him in her native language her name became monique he missed some of what she said but it didnt matter he understood the gist of it and her dramatic voice plus the sound of the foreign language only increased the power of the spell already cast by the wine and her beauty nick also tried to speak french from time to time whatever selfconsciousness he might have ordinarily felt was swept away by the magic of the setting and their growing rapport they laughed together easily at his mistakes she was gracious and charming when she corrected him always adding mais vous parlez francais tres bien in the early part of the evening later as their conversation became more personal monique changed to the more personal tu form in talking to him this established an additional intimacy between them that deepened in the wee hours of the morning monique talked about paris about the romance of the streets the bistros the museums the history nick visualized it all and felt transported with her to the city of lights she told about her dreams when she was growing up about walking in the sixteenth arrondissement among the wealthy and promising herself that someday he listened closely enraptured an almost beatific smile upon his face in the end monique had to tell him that it was time to go because she had an early tennis lesson in the morning it was after three oclock he apologized as they walked together to the door she laughed and said that it had been fun at the door she reached up and kissed him on the cheek his heart soared out of his body at the touch of her lips call me sometime she said with a playful smile as she closed the door behind him for over thirty hours nick thought of nothing but monique he talked to her in his mind during the day she was his lover in dreams at night he called her once twice three times each time talking to her answering machine the third time he left her his phone number and address and suggested that she try to get in touch with him when her schedule would permit by noon on the second day after his evening at the silvers palm beach mansion he started to calm down to realize that there was no sense in his continuing to worship the image of a woman he had met for a single evening especially a woman who was married to someone else in the late afternoon he went out on the beach to play volleyball with some of the other college students he had met during his first days in florida he had just served an ace when he thought he heard his name being called by a husky accented voice that was absolutely unmistakable he thought for a moment he was dreaming standing in the sand not ten yards away was monique she was wearing a bright red and white striped bikini and her long black hair hung down her back to just above her waist the volleyball game stopped his friends whistled he walked over to her his heart pounding in his temples and his breath struggling to find its way out of his constricted chest monique smiled and slid her arm through his she explained that she had brought teresa into lauderdale for a small high school party and since it was so hot they walked along the beach and talked as the sun set behind the condominiums they were oblivious to the young people all around them the gentle waves washed their feet with warm water as they walked monique insisted that they eat in nicks condo so they stopped for tuna fish tomatoes onions and mayonnaise to put on their sandwiches cold beer potato chips and sandwiches on a bare formica table was the dinner lovemaking was the dessert nick almost had an orgasm on their first kiss and his passion made him klutzy and funny in trying to remove her bikini monique slowed him down smiled softly neatly folded her bikini and his bathing suit and then came to join him on the bed after two kisses naked on the bed nick was seized by a paroxysm of lust he rolled roughly on top of monique and began gyrating with his hips at first a bit alarmed monique slowed him just a bit and guided him gently into her moniques body was nearly perfect nice full upright breasts slim waist rounded feminine ass taut muscled legs kept in shape with lots of exercise but it was her skin that magnificent ivory skin that sent nick into ecstasy it was so soft and easy to the touch her mouth seemed to fit his perfectly nick had been with two women before a highpriced call girl given to him as a christmas present after the harvard swimming team had discovered he was still a virgin at the end of his freshman year and jennifer barnes from radcliffe his sometimes steady date during most of his sophomore year jennifers teeth always clanged against his when they kissed but that had not been the only difficulty in his relationship with jennifer she was a physicist and her approach to sex had been almost clinical she measured sizes and durations and frequencies and even quantities of ejaculant after three scheduled performances with jenny nick had decided it wasnt worth it nick gasped as he slid into monique both of them knew it would be over soon ten seconds later nick finished his climax and started to withdraw but monique held his rear firmly in her hands keeping him in place and deftly rolled over so that she was on top nick was now out of his element in his limited experience withdrawal was the next step after orgasm he didnt know what monique was doing ever so slowly her eyes half closed as she hummed a piece of classical music to herself monique rocked back and forth on top of him her vaginal walls holding tightly to his now flaccid penis after a couple of minutes she began to grind her pelvis forward as she rocked and much to nicks amazement as her breath shortened he found himself becoming aroused again now her eyes closed altogether and her rhythm became stronger the thrusts of her forward motion grinding with a little pain into his bones nick was now definitely erect and he started following her motion lightly gyrating in pattern with her monique leaned forward concentrating but smiling with her eyes closed preparing for her own orgasm she was acutely aware and delighted that nick was up again timing her own progress perfectly she adroitly and softly reached down and began titillating nicks nipples in rhythm with her forward thrusts nick had never had his breasts touched in lovemaking before and was shocked but the raw excitement was overwhelming she increased her play even pinching him when she saw his response as wave after wave of delightful release coursed through her body nick uttered a loud wailing scream and had his second orgasm in fifteen minutes at the end of the climax he was completely given over to pleasure and made animal sounds and shook involuntarily from exhausted satiety nick was a little embarrassed by his noisy and uncontrolled response but moniques playful and friendly afterplay assured him that everything was all right she went to his closet pulled out one of his three dress shirts and put it on the tails came almost down to her knees and she looked positively gamine with her pixie smile long hair and mans shirt nick began to declare his love but monique came forward and put her finger to his lips then she kissed him lovingly told him that she needed to pick up teresa jumped in the shower for what could not have been more than a minute dressed kissed him again and walked out the door nick did not move during this entire time after she left he fell asleep contentedly he did not dream for the next eight days nick was on top of the world he saw monique every day most of the time at her palm beach mansion but sometimes at his uncles condominium they made love at every opportunity and it was always different monique was full of surprises the second time nick went to her house for example he found her in the back swimming naked in the pool she told him that she had given all the servants the day off within minutes they were frolicking and laughing on the grass between the garden and the pool their affair was conducted in french monique taught him about food and wine they shared their knowledge of french literature one passionate night they argued about andre gides la symphonie pastorale both before and after lovemaking monique defended the pastor and laughed at nicks insistence that the blind gertrude was an innocent another evening when monique demanded that nick wear a black halloween mask and a pair of white leotards throughout their long french dinner they read jean genets le balcon together as a prelude to sex the days raced by relentlessly clothed in the magic of love and intimacy once nick showed up at the mansion and monique greeted him dressed in an incredible coat a fulllength alaskan seal fur with indigo fox trim around the collars as well as down the lapels and framing the sleeves from the shoulders to the wrists the coat was the softest thing nick had ever touched even softer than her tantalizing skin his playful paramour had turned the air conditioning up as high as it would go so that she could wear her favorite coat she was wearing nothing underneath it after lovemaking that evening she dressed nicks naked body in one of her husbands beaver coats explaining the presence of half a dozen fur coats in palm beach with a simple its our business and we like to have some things to show our friends and acquaintances in case they are interested nick professed his love with increasing zeal each time they met anew monique responded with her usual je taime but would not reply to nicks insistent questions about the future she avoided all questions about her relationship with mr silver except to say that he was a workaholic and that he stayed in montreal most of the year he had bought the place in palm beach primarily because monique did not like the cold and wanted a more active social life than the one they had in montreal monique usually spent the period from christmas to easter in palm beach teresa who had just finished her spring break from her exclusive private school and had returned to canada came down as often as possible so that she could be with her mother monique gave short terse answers about her present life but she waxed rhapsodic about her childhood in paris she never criticized her husband or complained about her married life yet she did tell nick that her days with him had been the happiest time of her life she also talked about some of her friends but nick never met any of them they were always alone one day she picked him up in her cadillac and they headed toward key largo so that he could do some diving at the pennekamp recreation area as always she was wearing her wedding ring on this particular day nick had vowed to himself that he would get some answers about the future and the constant presence of her wedding ring pissed him off he asked her to remove it she politely refused then grew angry when he pressed her she pulled the car off the highway in the marshland north of the keys and stopped the engine it is a fact that i am married she said resolutely and taking the ring off is not going to change anything i am in love with you without doubt but you have understood my situation from the beginning if you cannot deal with it anymore then perhaps we should just call it quits nick was shocked by her response the thought of being without her terrified him he apologized and professed his love he began kissing her passionately and then jumped in the back seat he told her that he needed her right then that moment she somewhat reluctantly joined him and they had intercourse on the back seat of her cadillac monique was quiet and pensive most of the rest of the day on friday exactly a week after they had met monique took nick to a tuxedo shop to have him fitted for a black tie dinner with some friends that she was having on saturday night in her home so finally he was going to be seen with her and nick thought now she will talk about our future nick was supposed to be in boston on monday morning and his parents were expecting him saturday night in falls church but he assured himself that he could drive all day to get to classes on monday morning nick was full of hope and dreams when he showed up at the silver mansion on saturday night he looked elegant in his summer tux and the smile with which he greeted monique at the door could have won a prize even with the doorman standing by he handed her a dozen red roses gave her a kiss and told her that he loved her of course you do she said lightly doesnt everybody she took him inside and introduced him to the four other people who had also come early as the young man who saved our teresa one day in lauderdale then monique excused herself it was her fashion nick later learned to ask a few select friends to come early to a party to greet them in casual attire and then to return an hour or so later when everyone had arrived with a grand entrance as monique gracefully walked up the stairs of the mansion nicks eyes followed her with an unmistakable look of adoration isnt she magnificent nick was asked by a relaxed tanned man of about fifty who offered him a martini his name was clayton once i was with her all weekend on their yacht while aaron was in montreal i thought she had invited me for a little diversion he laughed but i was wrong she just wanted some company and i could talk about france and europe come with me and ill introduce you to the select group that was invited early today nick was treated with extreme courtesy by the other favored guests but he was wary of their questions about monique he was after all a southern boy and if there was something to say about their relationship it was her place to say it so he answered politely but modestly and didnt elaborate at all one of the two women at the bar who introduced herself as jane somebody said that she was monicas oldest friend in palm beach jane was in her late thirties plump and raucous a heavy drinker and a chain smoker she had once been fairly attractive but had lived too hard too soon she was one of those people who touch everybody during a conversation she made nick nervous the other guests began to arrive jane and clayton seemed to be acting as hostess and host in moniques absence they introduced him to everybody nick had three or four martinis and told the teresa story at least seven times during the first hour that he was in the silver mansion nick was becoming fairly spiffed by this time he sang to himself as he took another martini off the cocktail tray being proffered by one of the servants the alcohol had buoyed his spirits and made him feel somehow temporarily suave and debonair nick was on the patio talking to moniques riding partner a lovely woman in her midtwenties named anne when he heard scattered applause from the living room its monica anne said lets go see the grand stairway in the silvers colonial mansion rose to a platform maybe six feet above the living room floor and then split with two different sets of stairs then continuing up to the second floor monique was standing on the platform acknowledging the applause dressed in a simple navy blue knit dress that seemed formfitted to her perfect body the back was cut way down almost to the bottom of her spectacular hair and in the front two thin pieces of cloth ran from her shoulders to her waist covering each breast adequately but leaving plenty of cleavage to be admired entranced by the vision of his queen nick cheered lustily a little too loud bravo bravo monique seemed not to hear his cheer she had turned and was looking up the stairs it probably took an entire minute for nick to comprehend the sight he was seeing a man a distinguishedlooking man in his early fifties wearing a custommade tan tuxedo and sporting an amazing sapphire ring on his little finger came down the staircase and put his arms around moniques waist she reached up and kissed him he smiled and waved at the crowd as they politely applauded they walked down the stairs together to the living room who is that nick thought to himself and even through the gin and the vermouth and all the incredible feelings the answer came back that is her husband aaron what is he doing here why didnt she tell me and then following very swiftly how could she do this to me i love her and she loves me and there is something very very wrong this cannot be happening nick tried to breathe but felt as if a large piece of earthmoving machinery were pressed against his chest instinctively he turned away from the sight of monique and aaron walking down the stairs arm in arm as he did he spilled part of a martini on annes shoulder his apology was very clumsy now completely discombobulated he stumbled over to the bar trying desperately to breathe and to stop the pounding in his chest no no she cant be doing this there must be some mistake his mind could not read the message that his eyes were transmitting he drank another martini swiftly barely aware of his surroundings or the jumbled feelings torturing his soul there he is he heard her voice behind him the voice that had come to signify everything that was valuable and important in life the voice of love but this time he was terrified nick turned and monique and aaron were standing right in front of him so finally i get to meet this young man ive heard so much about he said aaron was pleasant friendly without a trace of anything but gratitude in his voice aaron silver was holding out his hand monique was smiling god shes so beautiful even now when i should hate her nick mechanically shook aarons hand and quietly accepted his thanks for helping teresa at a difficult time nick said nothing he turned to look at monique she reached up and kissed him on the cheek oh those lips how i long still for those lips why why what happens to us now nick suddenly realized that there were tears in his eyes ohmygod im going to cry embarrassed beyond measure nick abruptly excused himself and walked out onto the patio now the tears were running down his cheeks he was afraid he was going to sit down on the grass and start bawling like a baby confused puzzled he walked around the garden with his head down and tried without success to draw a regular breath he felt a hand on his elbow it was jane the last person on earth that nick wanted to see at this moment shell be out to see you in a few minutes first she and aaron have to make the rounds you know how it is at parties when youre the hostess jane lit a cigarette nick was certain he was going to puke he turned quickly to ask her to put out the cigarette and he lost his equilibrium maybe it was the drink maybe the adrenaline maybe it was just too much nicks head was spinning around and around he inadvertently leaned against jane for support she misunderstood and then pulled his head to her shoulder there there she said dont take it so hard you and monique will still be able to have some time together aaron will only be here for a couple of days and then hell go back to montreal to work besides she said with gusto if youre anywhere near as good as monica says you are id be delighted to take care of you when shes with aaron nick pushed her away and staggered back he felt as if he had just been hit in the face with a sledgehammer the full impact of janes comment sunk in slowly and an uncontrollable mixture of anger and hurt surged to the surface what what she knows this cloying bitch knows maybe they all know what fuck fuck this altogether and then almost immediately as his mind began to take the measure of the evenings events how do i get out of here where is the exit as he walked around the house to the front from deep inside nick there now came a sound a sound that welled up to the surface and could not be contained this was the wail of pain the unmitigated and ineluctable cry of the animal in total despair millennia of acculturation have made it rare to hear such cries from human beings but this loud and untoward scream which rose into the palm beach night like a siren from a police car gave nick his first comfort while the partygoers were trying to decide what they had heard nick climbed into his pontiac and drove away he drove south toward fort lauderdale his heart still pumping like crazy and his body trembling from adrenaline he didnt think about anything coherently the pictures in his mind seemed to come at random without any clear connection between them monique was the focus of all the pictures in the montage monique in her alaskan seal coat monique in her red and white bathing suit monique in her dress tonight had it all been meaningless was it just a game nick was too young to know about the grays of life for him it was a simple question of black or white it was either wonderful or it was shit monique either loved him passionately and wanted to give up her luxurious life to marry him or she was just using him to satisfy her sexual needs and her ego so he concluded as he arrived at his uncles condominium in fort lauderdale i was another of her toys i was like her furs and horses and yachts and clothes i made her feel good disgusted with himself depressed beyond belief a headache starting to tear his brain apart from the martinis nick rapidly packed his clothes he didnt bathe or eat he took his two suitcases down to the car left the rented tuxedo with the managers of the complex and drove out toward interstate a couple of miles before he reached the freeway nick pulled the car off on the shoulder and allowed himself a few tears that was all the external hardness that would characterize the next ten years of his life began at that moment never again he said to himself i will never again let some bitch make a fool of me no way jose ten years later early on a march morning in his condominium in key west nick williams would idly play with a metallic golden object sitting on his coffee table and experience again the terrible pain of seeing monique with her husband at that party wistfully with some mature chagrin he would remember also how when he reached he turned left and south toward miami and the keys instead of right and north toward boston he couldnt have explained why at the time he might have said that harvard was trivial after monique or that he wanted to study life and not books he didnt understand that his need to start absolutely fresh came from the fact that he could not face himself he had not played the memory of monique through from start to finish for five years this morning for the first time nick had been able to distance himself from the recalled emotions ever so slightly and to see the entire affair with a tiny bit of perspective he recognized that his blind youthful passion had set him up for the anguish but he was still reluctant to find monique faultless at least the memory no longer destroyed him he picked up the trident and walked to the window maybe its all coming together now he said to himself a new treasure a final molting of the last adolescent angst he thought about carol dawson she was vexing but her intensity fascinated him always the dreamer nick visualized carol in his arms and imagined the warmth and softness of her kiss carol watched in fascination as the octopus captured its prey with its long tentacles imagine what it would be like to have eight arms oscar burcham said just think of the brain architecture necessary to separate all the inputs to identify which stimulus was coming from which limb to coordinate all the tentacles in defense or acquisition of food carol laughed and turned to her companion they were standing in front of a large translucent glass window inside a dimly lit building oh oscar she said to the old man with the bright eyes you never change only you can think of all these living creatures as biological systems with architectures dont you ever wonder about their feelings their dreams while they are sleeping their concepts of death aye well i do oscar replied with a twinkle in his eye but its virtually impossible for human beings even with a common language and developed communications skills to truly describe their feelings how could we even know or appreciate for example a dolphins sense of loneliness in our maudlin way we ascribe to them human emotions which is ridiculous he paused for a moment to think no he continued its more fruitful to conduct scientific inquiry at levels where we can understand the answers in the long run i believe that knowing how these creatures function in the scientific sense is more likely to lead us to their emotional quotients than conducting psychological experiments whose outcomes cannot be interpreted carol reached over and kissed him fondly you take everything i say so seriously oscar even when im kidding you always pay attention to my comments she stopped and looked away youre the only one who does oscar pulled back dramatically and put both his hands on carols right shoulder somewhere here theres a chip i know it for a fact its almost always here ah i found it he looked at her knowingly its not becoming you know here you are a successful even celebrated reporter still suffering from what could only be described as terminal insecurity whats this about did you and the boss have a big fight this morning no carol replied as they walked across the room to another part of the aquarium well sort of i guess you know how he is he takes over everything im working on this big story down in key west dale comes to the airport to pick me up takes me out to breakfast and proceeds to tell me exactly what i should be doing to cover my assignment his suggestions are almost all good and i appreciate his help on the technical issues but its the way he talks to me as if he thinks im stupid or something oscar looked at her intently carol my dear he talks to everybody that way including me he doesnt mean anything by it he is absolutely convinced of his own superiority and nothing has ever happened in his life to change his mind he was a millionaire from his own patents before he graduated from mit carol was impatient and frustrated i know all that oscar believe me i know but youre protecting him again dale and i have been lovers for almost a year he tells everybody how proud of me he is how much he enjoys being stimulated by my mind but when were together he treats me like a fool this morning he even argued with me about what i was having for breakfast for christs sake ive been nominated for a pulitzer prize but the guy who wants to marry me doesnt think i can order my own breakfast they were standing in front of a large tank with crystalclear water about half a dozen small whales were swimming in circles around the tank occasionally going to the surface for air you came and asked my opinion in the beginning my young friend he said quietly and i told you that i thought your souls were not compatible do you remember what you said to me yes she answered with a rueful smile i asked you what the chief scientist of moi could possibly know about souls im sorry oscar i was sorry at the time i was so headstrong dale looked great on paper and i wanted your approval forget it he interrupted her you know how i feel about you but never underestimate a scientist some of them he said abstractedly want to know facts and concepts so that ultimately they can understand the overall nature of everything including the putative soul now take these whales oscar continued increasing the tempo and adroitly changing the subject we have been mapping their brains for almost a decade now isolating various kinds of functions in specific locations and trying to correlate their brain structure with that of a human being we have been reasonably successful the language function that governs their singing has been separated and the location of the physical controls for all parts of the body have been identified in fact we have found an area in the whale brain that corresponds to the equivalent function for every major capability in the human brain but theres still a problem a mystery if you will one of the whales stopped in its normal circuit about the tank it seemed to be watching them theres a large section of their brain that we have been unable to allocate to any specific function a brilliant scientist years ago after listening to the whales songs while they were migrating and correlating those songs with the rest of their behavior postulated that this large unmapped portion of their brain was a multidimensional memory array his hypothesis was that the whales store entire incidents in that array including sights sounds and even feelings and that they relive these incidents during migration to alleviate the boredom our tests are starting to confirm his theory carol was intrigued you mean they might put in that array the entire set of sensory impressions from something important like calving and then have in a sense a full instant replay during a particularly boring part of the migration route wow thats fascinating my memory irritates me all the time it would be great if somehow i could go in there in a directed sense and pull out anything i want complete with feelings she laughed there have been times in the summers when i couldnt remember exactly how great it felt to ski and i have almost panicked worrying about whether or not that feeling might be gone the next winter oscar waved at the whale and it swam away be careful he said other people have also thought that it would be fantastic if our memories were more complete like a computers but suppose we did have a perfect multidimensional memory like that hypothesized for the whale and suppose we had the same lack of entry control that is characteristic of human memory as it now exists you know where what we remember and when we remember it are not under our individual control then there would be problems we might even be nonfunctional as a species a song a picture a smell even the taste of a cake might suddenly force us to confront anew the full emotions associated with the death of a loved one we might have to see again a painful fight between our parents or even the trauma of our own birth oscar was quiet for a moment no he said finally evolution has served us in good stead it couldnt develop an entry control mechanism for our memories so to protect us to keep us from being demolished by mistakes or past events evolution built a natural fade process into our memories carol dawson carol dawson report immediately to the audiovisual conference room adjacent to the directors office the loudspeaker interrupted the quiet in the moi aquarium carol gave oscar a hug its been great ozzie as always she said watching him wince as she used her pet name for him but it looks like theyve finished developing the pictures incidentally i think the whole business about the whales memories is fascinating i want to come back and do a feature on it maybe next week sometime give my love to your daughter and grandson carol had become so engrossed in the discussion with oscar that she had momentarily forgotten why she had flown to miami early that morning now she felt anew a keen sense of excitement as she drove back to the main moi administrative building from the aquarium dale had been confident at breakfast that processing the infrared images would reveal something of interest after all he had said logically the foreign object alarm was triggered repeatedly and nothing could be seen in the visual images therefore either the infrared observations caused the alarm or the algorithm did not work properly the second possibility is very unlikely since i designed the data flow myself and my best programmers tested it after it was coded dale was uncharacteristically excited when she walked into the conference room carol started to ask him a question but was silenced by a vigorous negative motion of the head that followed his smile of greeting dale was talking to two of the imageprocessing technicians okay then were squared away display the images in this sequence ill call for each one by using the pickle the technicians left the room dale came over and grabbed carol you are not going to believe this he said what a bonanza what a fucking bonanza he settled down a little but first things first i promised myself that i would not spoil it for you he showed her to a seat at the conference table in front of the large screen and then sat down beside her he pushed the remotecontrol switch up on the large screen came a still frame of the three whales in the reef area under the boat the fissure could clearly be seen to the right and beneath the whales dale looked at carol i see she shrugged but whats the deal i took pictures with my underwater camera that are just as good dale turned back to the screen and pushed thc remote several more times the successive scenes zoomed in on the hole in the coral reef eventually isolating and centering on a small glint in the lower left side of the fissure again dale looked at carol i have a similar blowup she said pensively but its impossible to tell if something is really there or if its an artifact of the photographic process she stopped herself although the fact that two distinctly different techniques found the light in essentially the same place suggests that it might not be a processing distortion she leaned forward interested so whats next there was no way he could contain himself dale jumped up and started pacing around the room whats next he began could be your ticket to the pulitzer dinner in new york now i am going to show you exactly the same sequence of images only these were taken in the infrared a fraction of a second later watch closely especially in the center of the fissure the first processed infrared image covered the same area underneath the boat that the first visual image had shown in the infrared picture however what was shown were thermal variations in the scene in the processing each pixel was given a specific temperature based on the infrared radiation observed from that portion of the frame similar temperatures were then grouped together by the computer processing and assigned the same color this process created isothermal regions or regions of roughly the same temperature that were visually connected by color the result was that in the first picture the whales stood out in red most of the reef plants were blue and the normalized water temperature formed a dusky gray background it took carol a moment to adjust to the display dale was smiling triumphantly before carol had a chance to focus on two small regions one red and another brown down in the center of the hole in the reef the zoom process had begun in a few seconds an infrared closeup of the fissure clearly demonstrated why dale was so excited i told you there was something under the boat he said walking to the screen and pointing at a brown elongated object the object was cylindrical at one end and tapered to a point at the other the fissure had been blown up by the zoom process so that it almost completely filled the screen even with all the magnification the quality of the infrared image was superb inside the opening three or four different colors could be seen however only two the brown and the red were continuous over a significant number of pixels holy shit said carol involuntarily rising from her seat and walking over to join dale that brown thing must be the lost missile it was underneath us all the time she picked up the pointer and waved it at the screen but whats this red area it looks like the cheshire cat from alice in wonderland im not absolutely certain dale replied and its probably not anything of major significance but i do have a crazy idea actually its based on what you told me about the strange behavior of the whales down there it may be the head of another whale back away from the light looking out of the cave or whatever the opening is here look at this by zooming out a little we obtain one single picture that shows both of the red isothermal regions look how the red region in the middle of the fissure and the red from your sentinel whales look the same even with additional stretching the two regions remain comparable in temperature not a proof of any kind but it certainly supports my proposition carols mind was racing ahead she was already planning her next move it was essential that she retrieve that missile before anybody knew it was there she needed to return to key west as soon as possible she picked up her purse and her briefcase can someone drive me to the airport please dale right now i want to call that lieutenant todd again and scare him a bit you know make him a little more cautious and buy some time for us she paused thinking of a million things at once but i cant call him from here without making him suspicious and i must make some arrangements for a boat for tomorrow oh incidentally i assume you have hard copy of those pictures available for me dale nodded his head i do he said but first sit down and relax for a second i want to show you something else i dont yet know if its a real phenomenon but if it is carol started to protest but there was something in his manner that told her to acquiesce she sat down he launched into a discussion of enhancement algorithms explaining how the information in pictures could be stretched to highlight special features and allow easier interpretation okay okay she said at length the bottom line is what i need i know already how clever you and your engineers are dale put the first infrared image back on the screen the one that showed the full view of the three whales underneath the boat this picture does not have much thermal granularity every pixel in the region colored red for example does not correspond to exactly the same temperature in reality the spread in temperatures for the same color is roughly five degrees now if we stretch the image and make the isothermal regions only cover a total spread of two degrees each we obtain this picture in the new image there were ten different colors it was much harder to see individual features and spurious data points made the picture extremely difficult to interpret a portion of the front of one of the whales was now a different color from the rest of the animal the limit of accuracy of the equipment by the time the raw spectral data is converted to temperatures is about one degree if we show another stretch of the same picture with the connected isothermal regions now only covering a total range of one degree each then the picture almost becomes gibberish now there are twenty different colors for the isothermal regions and because the noise or error in each data point is of the same magnitude as the spread in the isothermal region it is virtually impossible to see the figures of known objects like the three whales i tell you all this up front to make certain you realize that what i am about to show you may be completely wrong it is nevertheless absolutely fascinating the next image projected on the screen was a closeup down on the floor of the ocean just above the trench that carol had followed when backtracking to find the origin of the tracks the familiar parallel lines just barely showed up in the infrared image the fissure was almost off the left side of the image on either side of the trench blue color broken with some occasional green marked the two reefs carol looked at dale with a puzzled expression on her face this closeup has the same fivedegree granularity as the big reference image there is nothing of note here he flashed another picture nor here where we have increased the number of colors to ten again but look at this one more image went up on the screen the picture was very difficult to follow much less interpret as many as twenty different colors connected odd regions in what appeared to be random patterns about the only thing that was regular in the picture were the background rocks on which the coral and other sea life were living and it was those background rocks that had dale so excited this is what i wanted you to see he said waving his hand at the rocks on the two sides of the trench the two reef structures do not have the same color for some unknown and absolutely inexplicable reason every background rock area on this reef is coded chartreuse on the opposite reef just across the trench a few feet away all the background rock is yellow a onedegree difference now if some of the yellow pieces were interspersed with the chartreuse and vice versa then i would say that the data clearly has no significance and that what we are seeing are noise signatures but this pattern is compelling carol was lost she could see that the rocks on one reef structure were all chartreuse and that the opposite reef was yellow but it didnt mean anything to her she shook her head she needed more explanation dont you understand dale said with a final dramatic flourish if this data is right then we have found something else of great importance either there is some source inside one of the reef structures that is making its surface uniformly warmer or and i admit this sounds truly incredible one of the two is not a reef at all and is something else masquerading as a reef it was almost always impossible to find a parking place in the middle of the working day near amanda winchesters house in key west the hemingway marina had revitalized the old part of the city where she lived but as usual everyone had underestimated the need for parking all the repainted and renovated nineteenthcentury mansions along eaton and caroline streets had signs on the street saying such things as dont even think about parking here if youre not a resident but it was no use people who worked in the retail shops around the marina parked where it was convenient for them and avoided the heavy parking fee at the marina lot after searching fruitlessly for a parking place for fifteen minutes nick williams decided to park outside of a convenience store and walk the block or so to amandas house he was strangely anxious part of his nervousness was due to his excitement but he was also feeling a little guilty amanda had been the major sponsor of the original santa rosa expedition and nick had spent considerable time with her after they had found the treasure amanda and nick and jake lewis had all three believed that homer ashford and his menage a trois had somehow hidden part of the treasure and then cheated them out of their proper shares nick and amanda worked together trying to find evidence that homer had stolen from them but they were never able to prove anything conclusively during this period amanda and nick had become quite close they had seen each other virtually every week and for a while he had thought of her as an aunt or grandmother but after a year or so nick had stopped going by to visit her he hadnt understood it at the time but the real reason he began to avoid her was that amanda was too intense for him and she was always too personal she asked him too many hard questions about what he was doing with his life on this particular morning he had no real options amanda was widely recognized as the expert on sunken treasure in the keys there were two components in her life treasure and the theater and her knowledge of each was encyclopedic nick had not called first because he didnt want to discuss the trident unless she was willing to see him so it was with some trepidation that he rang the doorbell on the front porch of her magnificent home a young woman in her early twenties came to the door and opened it just a bit yes she said her face wedging into the crack her expression wary my names nick williams he said i would like to see mrs winchester if possible is she in there was a pause im an old my grandmother is very busy this morning the girl curtly interrupted him perhaps you can call and make an appointment she started to close the door and leave nick standing on the porch next to his exercise bag then nick heard another voice a muffled exchange and the door swung open well for goodness sake amanda said with her arms outstretched i have a young gentleman caller come here nikki and give me a kiss nick was embarrassed he walked forward and gave the elderly woman a perfunctory hug as he withdrew from the embrace he started to apologize im sorry i havent been by to see you i mean to but somehow my schedule its all right nikki i understand amanda interrupted him pleasantly her eyes were so sharp they belied her age come in and tell me what youve been up to i havent seen you since goodness has it been a couple of years already since we shared that cognac after streetcar she led him into a combination study and living room and sat him down next to her on the couch you know nikki i thought your comments about the actress playing blanche dubois were the most observant ones i heard during the entire run you were right about her she couldnt have played blanche except as a total mental case the woman simply had no concept of a feminine sexual appetite nick looked around him the room had hardly changed in the eight years since he had last visited it the ceiling was very high maybe fifteen feet the walls were lined with bookcases whose full shelves extended all the way to the ceiling opposite the door a huge canvas painting of amanda and her husband standing outside their home on cape cod dominated the room a new ford was partially visible in the background of the painting she was radiantly beautiful in the picture in her early thirties dressed in a white evening gown with daring red trim both around the wrists and along the collar of the neck her husband was in a black tux he was mostly bald with short blond hair graying at the temples his eyes were warm and kindly amanda asked nick if he wanted tea and he nodded the granddaughter jennifer disappeared into the hallway amanda turned and took nicks hands in hers i am glad you came nikki i have missed you from time to time i hear a snippet here or there about you or your boat but often secondhand information is altogether wrong what have you been doing still reading all the time do you have a girlfriend nick laughed amanda had not changed she had never been one for small talk no girlfriend nick said same problem as always the ones that are intelligent turn out to be either arrogant or emotionally inept or both the ones that are sensitive and affectionate have never read a book for some reason carol dawson jumped into nicks mind and he almost said without thinking except for maybe but he stopped himself what i need he said instead is someone like you no nikki amanda replied suddenly serious she folded her hands in her lap and stared momentarily across the room no she repeated softly her voice then gathering intensity as she turned back to look at him even i am not perfect enough for you i remember well all your fantasy visions of gracious young goddesses somehow you had mixed the best parts of all the women in your favorite novels together with your teenage dreams it always seemed to me that you had put women up on a pedestal they had to be queens or princesses but in the girls you actually dated you looked for weaknesses signs of ordinariness and indications of common behavior it was almost as if you were hoping to find them imperfect to detect chinks in their armor so that you could justify your lack of interest jennifer arrived with the tea nick was uncomfortable he had forgotten what it was like to talk to amanda her emotional probing and her unsolicited observations were both extremely disquieting to him this morning nick had not come to see her to dissect his attitude toward women he changed the subject speaking of treasure he said bending down to pick up his bag i found something very interesting yesterday while i was out diving i thought maybe you might have seen something like it before he pulled the trident out and handed it to amanda she almost dropped it because she was not prepared for its weight goodness she said her skinny arm trembling under the strain of holding the golden trident out in front of her what could it possibly be made from its too heavy to be gold nick leaned forward and took the object he held it for her as she ran her fingers over its exceptionally smooth exterior ive never seen anything like this nikki i dont need to get out all the books and the photographs for comparison the smoothness of the finish is inconsistent with the processing techniques in europe during or after the galleon days this must be modern but i cant tell you anything else where in the world did you find it he told her just the outline of the story careful as always not to give away key bits of information it was not just the agreement he had made with carol and troy treasure hunters never really trust anybody but he did share with amanda his idea that perhaps someone had cached this particular piece as well as some others for later retrieval nick insisted that this idea of his was a perfectly plausible explanation for the tracks on the ocean floor your scenario seems very unlikely to me amanda said although i must admit that i am baffled and have no better explanation maybe miss dawson has some sources that can shed some light on the origin of this thing but there is almost no chance that i am mistaken i have personally seen or viewed closeup photographs of every significant piece of treasure recovered from the keys in the past century you could show me a new piece today and i could probably tell you in what european country it was made and in what decade if this object comes from a sunken ship it is a modern ship almost certainly after world war ii beyond that i cant help you nick put the trident back in the bag and started to leave wait just a minute before you go nikki amanda said as he stood up come over here for a minute she took him by the arm and led him over to a spot just in front of the large painting you would have liked walter nikki he was a dreamer also he loved to look for treasure every year we would spend a week or two in the caribbean on a yacht ostensibly looking for treasure but just generally sharing each others dreams from time to time we would find objects on the bottom of the ocean that we couldnt understand and we would create fanciful conjectures to explain them almost always there was some prosaic explanation that was inferior to our fantasies nick was standing beside her with his bag in his right hand amanda turned to him and put her hand softly on his left forearm but it didnt matter it didnt even matter that most of the years we came up emptyhanded altogether for we always found the real treasure our love for each other we always returned home renewed and laughing and thankful that life had allowed us to share another week or ten days in which we had imagined and fantasized and hunted for treasure together her eyes were soft and loving her voice was low but full of passion i do not know when or if you will come again nikki but there are some things that i have been wanting to say to you for some time if you like you can dismiss them as the ravings of a sententious old woman but i may never have a chance to tell you these things again you have all the attributes i loved in walter intelligence imagination sensitivity but something is wrong you are alone by choice your dreams of treasure your zest for life you do not share these things it is very sad for me to see this she stopped for a second and looked back at the painting then she completed her thought almost as if she were talking to herself for when you are seventy years old and look back at what your life has meant you will not focus on your solo activities what you will remember are the incidents of touching those times when your life was enriched by a moment of sharing with a friend or loved one it is our mutual awareness of this miracle called life that allows us to accept our mortality nick had not been prepared for an emotional encounter with amanda he had thought that he would stop by to see her for a few moments ask her about the trident and then depart in retrospect he realized that he had treated amanda very callously over the years she had offered genuine friendship and he had spurned it taking her out of his life altogether when their interaction no longer suited him he winced as he recognized how selfish he had been as he walked slowly down the street idly looking at the gracious old houses built over a hundred years ago nick took a deep breath he had experienced too many emotions for one morning first monique then amanda and it looks as if the trident is not going to solve all my problems funny how things always come in groups he found himself musing that maybe there had been a lot of truth in what amanda had said he acknowledged that he had been feeling lonely lately and he wondered if the vague loneliness was indeed coupled to a creeping awareness of his own mortality to the passage of that phase of life enshrined by thomas wolfe with the phrase for we were young and we knew that we could never die nick was feeling very tired when he came to the end of the sidewalk and turned onto the pavement of the convenience store parking lot he saw her before she saw him she was standing next to the drivers side of her brandnew red mercedes sports coupe she had a small brown paper hag in her arm and was looking in the window of the car next to hers nicks pontiac nick felt a quick rush of adrenaline followed by anger and distrust she finally saw him just as he started to speak why greta what a surprise i guess we just happened to be in this part of key west today at exactly the same time ya nick i thought it was your car how are you greta put the paper bag on the hood of her car and approached him in a friendly manner she had either missed or was ignoring the sarcasm in his greeting she was wearing a sleeveless yellow tank top and a pair of tight blue shorts her blonde hair was pulled back in two short pigtails dont play innocent with me fraulein nick overreacted i know you didnt come here to shop he was nearly shouting he used his free arm to accentuate his comments and block gretas approach this is not one of the stops on your circuit you came here to find me now what do you want nick dropped his arm a couple of passersby had stopped to watch the exchange greta stared at him for a moment with those crystalclear eyes she was wearing no makeup she looked like a little girl except for the wrinkles on her face are you still so angry nick after all these years she came up next to him and smiled knowingly into his eyes i remember one night almost five years ago she said playfully when you were not so angry you were glad to see me you asked me if i would have you for one night no questions asked and i agreed you were great in a momentary flash nick remembered the rainy night when he had stopped greta just as she was leaving the pier he recalled also how desperately he had needed to touch someone anyone on that particular night that was the day after my fathers funeral he said roughly and didnt mean shit anyway he looked away he did not want to return her piercing gaze that wasnt the impression i had greta continued in the same playful but otherwise emotionless tone i felt you inside me i tasted your kisses you cant tell me look interrupted nick clearly irritated what do you want i dont want to stand here all morning arguing with you about some stupid night five years ago now i know that youre here for a reason what is it greta backed off a step and her face hardened you are a very difficult man nick it could be such fun doing business together if you werent such a how do you say pain in the ass she stopped for a moment i have come from homer he has a proposition for you he wants to see what you found yesterday in the ocean and maybe discuss a partnership nick laughed triumphantly so i was right all along you were sent to find me and now that bastard wants to discuss a partnership hah not a fucking chance you wont steal from me again tell your employer or lover or whatever he is to cram his proposition up his ass now if youll excuse me he started to walk around greta and open his car door her strong hand grabbed his forearm youre making a mistake nick her eyes bored into his again a big mistake you cant afford to do it on your own what you found is probably worthless if it is let him spend the money her chameleon eyes shifted one more time and it would be such fun to work together again nick climbed into his car and turned on the engine no dice greta youre wasting your time now ive got to go he backed out of the parking place and then drove into the narrow street the treasure was front and center in his mind again he had been momentarily depressed by what amanda had told him about the trident but the fact that homer wanted to see it gave nick a feeling of power but he asked himself how does he know already who talked or could someone have seen us when commander winters returned to his office after a scheduled meeting with the public relations department his secretary dora was conspicuously reading the key west newspaper ahem she said deliberately attracting his attention is the vernon winters starring in the night of the iguana at the key west playhouse tonight anyone i know or are there two of them in this town he laughed he liked dora she was almost sixty black a grandmother more than a dozen times and one of the few secretaries on the base who actually had some pride in her work she treated everybody including commander winters like one of her children so why didnt you tell me she said with feigned outrage after all what if i had missed it altogether i told you last year to make certain that you always told us when you were performing he took her hand and gave it a little squeeze i had intended to tell you dora but somehow it just slipped my mind and you know that my thespian activities are not exactly embraced by the navy so i dont ballyhoo them about so much but ill have some tickets for you and your husband in a couple of weeks he looked at the stack of message notes on her desk that many huh and i was only gone a little over two hours it never rains but it pours two of these are supposedly urgent dora looked at her watch a miss dawson from the miami herald will call back in about five minutes and that lieutenant todd has been calling all morning he insists that he must see you before lunch or he cant be properly prepared for the meeting this afternoon apparently he left a long message on your top secret telemail sometime this morning right now hes furious with me because i wouldnt interrupt your meetings to tell you about his message is it really that important commander winters shrugged his shoulders and opened the door to his office i wonder what todd wants he thought i guess i should have checked my telemail before running off to the meeting with the chief did you put all the rest of the messages on the computer he asked dora before he closed the door she nodded okay ill talk to miss dawson when she calls tell todd that i will see him in fifteen minutes he sat down at his desk and turned on his computer he activated his telemail subdirectory and saw that he had three new entries already this morning one in the top secret queue commander winters identified himself entered the top secret code word and started to read lieutenant todds transmission the phone rang after a few seconds dora buzzed him and told him that it was miss dawson before they started commander winters agreed that the interview could be on the videophone and that it could be taped he recognized carol immediately from her occasional appearances on television she explained to him that she was using the communications facility at the miami international airport commander winters she said wasting no time we have an uncorroborated report that the navy is engaged in a search for something important and secret in the gulf of mexico between key west and the everglades your press people and a lieutenant todd have both denied the report and referred all questions to you our source also told us and we have subsequently verified both of these facts that there are today a large number of technology ships sailing in the gulf and that you have been trying to rent sophisticated ocean telescopes from the miami oceanographic institute do you have any comment certainly miss dawson the commander wore his best acting smile he had carefully rehearsed the response in his morning meeting with the admiral its really amazing how rumors fly particularly when someone suspects the navy of nefarious deeds he chuckled all the activity is just preparation for some routine maneuvers next week a few of the sailors who man the technology ships are a little rusty and wanted some practice this week as for the moi telescopes we intended to use them in our maneuvers to check their value in assessing underwater threats he looked directly at the camera thats it miss dawson theres nothing special going on carol watched the commander on the monitor at the airport she had expected someone with an imposing air of authority this man had a softness in his eyes some kind of sensitivity that was unusual in a career military officer carol had a sudden idea she walked up close to her own camera commander winters she said pleasantly let me ask you a hypothetical question if the navy were testing a new kind of missile and one test flight went astray possibly even threatening population centers wouldnt it be likely that the navy claiming national security reasons as its defense would deny that such a thing had happened for a fleeting fraction of a second the expression in the eyes of commander winters wavered he looked shocked then he regained control it is difficult to answer such a hypothetical question he intoned formally but i can tell you that it is navy policy to keep the public informed about its activities only when the flow of information to the public could significantly undermine our national security would any kind of censorship take place the interview wound up quickly carol had accomplished her objective damn said commander winters to himself as dora announced that lieutenant todd was waiting to see him i should have expected that question but how did she know that did she somehow trick todd or one of the other officers or did someone in washington spill the beans winters opened the door to his office and lieutenant todd nearly stormed into the room with him was another tall young lieutenant thick shouldered with a bushy mustache whom todd introduced as lieutenant ramirez of the naval intelligence division did you read my telemail message what did you think my god its almost unbelievable what those russians have done i had no idea they could be so clever todd was almost shouting as he paced excitedly around the office winters watched todd jumping around the room this young lieutenant he thought is in a big hurry to get somewhere his impatience is oozing out of every pore but what in the world is he saying about the russians and why is this mexican muscleman here with him sit down please the commander replied motioning at the two chairs opposite his desk he looked sternly at lieutenant todd and start by explaining why lieutenant ramirez is here you know the regulations we were all briefed on them again last week only officers at the rank of commander or higher can authorize sharing information on a needtoknow basis todd immediately defended himself against the reproach commander winters sir he replied i believe that what we have here is a major international incident far too big to be handled by special projects and systems engineering alone i left word on your telemail interrupt at this morning for you to contact me asap that there was a significant new development in the broken arrow project when i had not heard from you by even though i had tried several additional times to reach you by telephone i became worried that we might be losing valuable time i then contacted ramirez so that he and his men could start their work todd stood up from his chair sir he began again the excitement rising in his voice maybe i didnt make it clear enough in my telemail message we have hard evidence that someone commanded the panther to go astray right after the aprs was activated we have confirmed from a special manual search of the intermittent telemetry data that the command receipt counters went crazy during a twosecond period just before the missile veered off course calm down lieutenant todd and sit down again winters was irritated not just by todds nonchalant dismissal of the regulations issue but also by his undisguised accusation that winters had been delinquent in responding to his messages the commanders day had begun with a meeting with the admiral who ran the air station he had wanted a briefing on all this broken arrow business so winters had not even been in his office except for a couple of minutes until after he came back from the public relations department when todd was again seated winters continued carefully now spare me the hysteria and your personal conclusions i want you to give me the facts only the facts slowly and without prejudice the accusations you made a few moments ago are very very serious in my eyes if you have jumped to unsubstantiated conclusions too quickly your fitness as an officer may be in doubt so start at the beginning there was a flash of anger in the lieutenants eyes and then he opened his notebook when he spoke his voice was a monotone carefully modulated to be free of all emotion at precisely this morning he began i was awakened by ensign andrews who had been working most of the night on the telemetry dumps that we recalled both from the canaveral station and the tracking ship near bimini his assignment had been to go through the scheduled sequence of events onboard the panther missile and determine from the scattered telemetry if possible if any anomalous events had occurred onboard just before the missile went off course we thought that this way we might have a chance to isolate the cause of the problem basically ensign andrews was a detective as you know the data system is quite constrained by the limited downlink bandwidth so the packets of telemetry data come out in a somewhat artificial way meaning that many of the data values governing the behavior of the bird at the time it changed direction would not have been sent to the earth until several minutes later after the missile had gone awry and the tracking stations had already dropped and regained lock a couple of times ensign andrews showed me that in the intermittent data there were four discrete measurements taken from the command receipt counter a simple buffer in the software that increments by one every time a new command message is correctly received by the missile at first we did not believe what we were seeing we thought perhaps someone had made an error or that the decommutation maps were wrong but by we had both checked the values from the two tracking sites and verified that we were indeed looking at the correct channel commander in the seconds after the aprs was activated the command receipt counter registered over three hundred new messages and then the missile swerved away from its intended target the commander was writing in a small spiral notebook while todd was talking it took him almost half a minute to finish his notes then he looked up at todd and ramirez am i to believe then he said his voice heavy with sarcasm that this is the entire data set upon which you wish to base your indictment of the soviet union and put our navy intelligence community on alert or is there something else todd looked confused you think its more likely commander winters continued his voice now rising that the russians knew the code for the command test set and transmitted three hundred messages in less than two seconds exactly at the right time and from somewhere off the florida coast than it is that somewhere in the software system there is an error that is improperly incrementing the command receipt counter my god lieutenant use your head are you seeing bogeymen at night this is there is virtually no tension on the international scene you believe that the russians are so colossally stupid that they would risk detente to command a navy cruise missile off course while it is still under test even if they could somehow command the missile to a specific location and then recover it and understand it thoroughly by reverse engineering why would they take such a horrendous chance for such a comparatively small return todd and ramirez said nothing during the commanders harangue ramirez was starting to look uncomfortably embarrassed toward the end todds boyish selfconfidence had faded as well and he began to wring his hands and pop his knuckles absentmindedly after a long pause winters continued firmly but without some of the exasperation of his initial speech we assigned some specific work items yesterday lieutenant they were supposed to be addressed by today look again at the software particularly to see if there were any errors in the interface with the command test set that showed up during module or integration testing maybe there was a bug in the command receipt counter subroutine that did not get corrected in the new release and for the meeting this afternoon i want you to show me a list of possible failure modes that would explain the telemetry data other than commands being sent from a foreign power and then show what you are planning to do to analyze each failure mode and reduce the length of the list ramirez stood up to leave under the circumstances commander i feel that my presence here is a little uh improper i have briefed a couple of my men already and have kicked off some investigative work to see if there is now or has been recently any russian military or civilian activity in the area i had put a top priority on the effort in view of this conversation i feel i should suspend not necessarily commander winters interrupted him it might be very difficult for you to explain at this juncture he looked at both of the squirming young lieutenants and it is not my wish to be vindictive and put you both on report although i think you both acted hastily and outside regulations no lieutenant continue with the intelligence gathering it may eventually be of some importance just dont make a big deal out of it ill accept the responsibility ramirez walked toward the door he was clearly grateful thank you commander he said sincerely for a minute there i thought maybe i had crapped in my mess kit ive learned a very valuable lesson winters saluted the intelligence officer and motioned todd who was apparently also preparing to leave back to his seat the commander walked over in front of the renoir painting and appeared to be studying it he spoke quietly without turning to face the junior lieutenant did you say anything to that reporter miss dawson about a missile or did she mention a missile to you while you were talking to her no sir there was nothing like that todd asserted she was even vague when i asked her what she had heard she either has some inside information or is very very lucky the commander said abstractedly almost to himself he walked over closer to the painting and imagined that he could hear the piano being played by the younger of the two sisters today he heard a mozart sonata but it was not the right time to listen this young man needs a good lesson out of all this winters thought as he turned around do you smoke lieutenant he asked offering todd a cigarette and placing one in his own mouth the younger man shook his head i do said winters lighting his pall mall even though there are a thousand reasons why i shouldnt but i almost never smoke around people who dont its a question of consideration winters walked over to look out the window and blew the smoke slowly out his mouth todd looked puzzled and right now winters continued im smoking strangely enough also out of consideration for you you see lieutenant todd he said wheeling around dramatically im calmer after i smoke that means i can deal better with my anger he walked directly over in front of the lieutenant because im goddamn mad about this young man make no mistake about that theres a part of me that wants to make an example of you maybe even court martial you for not following regulations youre too cocky too sure of your own conclusions youre dangerous if you had slipped and made some of the comments you made in here to that woman reporter then it would be katie bar the door but winters walked around behind his desk and stubbed out his cigarette it has always been my belief that people should not be crucified for a single mistake the commander sat down and leaned back in his chair just between us guys lieutenant youre on probation with me i dont want to hear any more nonsense about an international incident this is a simple case of a malfunctioning test missile do your job thoroughly and carefully dont worry youll be noticed if the work is done properly the system is not blind to your ambition or your talent but if you run off halfcocked one more time on this problem i will personally see to it that your personnel file is ruined todd could tell that he was being dismissed he was still angry now at himself mostly but he knew better than to let any of it show he considered commander winters to be a marginally competent old fart and he hated being lectured by him as of now however i have no choice but to accept it he said to himself as he left the commanders office nicks message light was blinking when he walked into his townhouse after the meeting with amanda and the encounter with greta he put the bag with the trident back in the closet and turned on the answering machine julianne appeared on the small threeinch monitor nick smiled to himself she always left all of his messages no matter how small in video sorry to tell you this nick but your tampa charter for tomorrow and sunday just called up to cancel they said they heard a weather forecast calling for thunderstorms anyway all is not completely lost cause you get to keep their deposit she paused a couple of seconds by the way linda and cotinne and i are going to sloppy joes tonight to hear angie leatherwood why dont you stop by and say hello i might even buy you a drink shit said nick to himself i needed the money and troy did too he automatically entered troys name on the small keyboard near the phone and waited for troy to pick up the receiver and turn on the video switch why hello professor what are you doing on such a beautiful day in the tropics troy was in a good humor as usual nick could not understand how anyone could be in such a perpetually good mood i have bad news and bad news my friend nick replied first amanda winchester says our trident is modern and almost certainly not a part of any ancient treasure for my part im not completely convinced but it doesnt look promising second and probably more important for the short term our charter has cancelled we have no work for the weekend ouch troy said a frown sweeping over his face that do present some problems for a moment it seemed that troy couldnt figure out what to say then the normal troy was back smiling cheerfully hey professor i have an idea since we now both have nothing to do this afternoon why dont you come over here to the jefferson sanitarium for some chips and beer i want to show you something anyway his eyes were twinkling under almost any circumstances nick would have declined troys offer and spent the afternoon reading madame bovary but the morning had already been heavy with emotion and nick was acutely aware that he needed some levity he smiled to himself troy was a very funny man an afternoon of booze and mirth sounded appealing besides troy had been working for him for four months and they had not yet taken any time to socialize even though they had spent many hours working together on the boat nick had never once visited troys apartment all right nick heard himself respond youre on ill bring the food and you get the beer ill see you in twenty to thirty minutes when nick stopped his car in front of the small frame duplex in one of key wests oldest sections troy was just arriving himself he had apparently walked to a nearby store for he was carrying a large brown paper bag containing three sixpacks of beer this ought to hold us for the afternoon he winked as he greeted nick and led him up the walkway to his front door a paper sign was taped to the door it said prof be back in a jiff troy troy took the sign down and reached up to a small ledge above the door to find a key nick had never wondered what troys apartment would be like but he certainly would not have imagined the living room that he found when he followed troy inside the room was laid out neatly and furnished in what could only be called early grandmother style the motley array of old couches and easy chairs purchased at neighborhood garage sales were arranged in a rectangle with a long wooden coffee table in the middle an assortment of electronics and video magazines were neatly stacked upon the table dominating the room was a stateoftheart sound system whose four tall speakers were carefully placed in the corners so that all the sound was focused toward the center of the room as soon as the two men were inside troy went over to the compact disc player on thc top of the stereo equipment rack and turned it on a wonderfully rich black female voice backed by a piano and a guitar filled the room this is angies new album troy said handing nick an open beer he had been to the kitchen and the refrigerator while nick was looking around the room her agent thinks this one will go gold love letters just barely missed but she made more than a quarter of a million off it anyway not counting the money from the concert tour i remember your telling me that you knew her nick said taking a long drink from his beer he had walked across the room to a box next to the stereo rack where sixty or seventy discs were neatly arranged on the front of an open disc jacket on the top of the box was a beautiful young black woman softly backlit she was wearing a long dark cocktail dress memories of enchanting nights was the title of the album is there more to the story of miss leatherwood nick said looking up at troy this is one magnificent lady if you ask me troy came over beside him he programmed the disc player to cut eight on the album thought youd never ask he grinned expansively this song probably says it the best nick sat down in one of the strange easy chairs and listened to a soft ballad with an easy beat in the background the title of the song was let me take care of you baby it told the story of a gifted lover who made the songstress laugh at home or in bed they were compatible they were friends but he couldnt talk commitment because he hadnt made it yet so in the last stanza the woman singing the song appeals to him to swallow his pride and let her make it easy for him nick looked at troy and rolled his eyes while he shook his head jefferson he said youre too much i never know when youre telling the truth and when youre slinging bullshit with both arms troy laughed and stood up from the couch but professor he protested thats what makes it more interesting he came over and took nicks empty beer can its hard for you to believe isnt it he said still smiling while he looked directly at nick that maybe your funny black first mate has a few dimensions you havent seen troy turned and walked toward the kitchen nick could hear him opening beer cans and putting the chips in a bowl so nick hollered im waiting whats the scoop angie and i have known each other for five years troy said from the kitchen when we were first dating she was only nineteen and completely naive about life one night we were over here right after i first moved in and we were listening to a whitney houston album angie started singing troy came back in the living room he put the bowl of assorted chips on the little wood coffee table and sat down in a chair next to nick the rest as they say in hollywood is history he waved his arms i introduced her to the owner of a local night club within a year she had a recording contract and i had a problem she was my woman but i couldnt afford to keep up with her troy was uncharacteristically quiet for a few seconds its really shit when your pride stands in the way of your feelings for the only woman youve ever loved nick was surprised to discover that troys intimate revelation had touched him nick leaned forward in his chair and dropped his hand lightly on troys shoulder in a gesture of understanding troy changed the subject quickly and what about you professor how many broken hearts are hanging in your closet ive seen the way julianne and corinne and even greta look at you why havent you ever married nick laughed and guzzled his beer christ this must be my lucky day do you know jefferson that youre the second person today to ask me about my love life and the first one was a seventyyearold woman nick took another drink speaking of greta he continued i ran into her this morning and it wasnt an accident she was waiting for me while i was talking to amanda she knew that we found something yesterday and wanted to talk about a partnership deal do you know anything about this sure do troy answered easily homer must have had her spying on us when i finished up with the boat last night she was waiting to pump me for information she had watched you leave with your exercise bag and either guessed or knew that we had found something i didnt tell her anything although i didnt deny it either remember ellen saw carol and me in the marina office with all that snazzy equipment yeah i know said nick and i really didnt expect to keep it entirely under wraps forever i just wish we could find more of the treasure if it exists before those snoops start to follow our every move the two men sat in silence drinking their beer but youve managed to avoid my question troy said at length with a mischievous smile the subject was women how come a guy like you handsome educated apparently not gay does not have a steady woman nick thought for a moment he studied troys friendly guileless face and decided to take the plunge im not sure troy he said seriously but i think maybe i push them all away i find something wrong with them so i have an excuse a new idea crept into nicks mind maybe im getting even in a way you asked about broken hearts the biggest one in the closet is my own mine was torn to shreds when i was a kid by a woman who probably doesnt even remember me troy rose from his chair and walked over to the disc player to change the music listen to us he said lightly both struggling with the infinite complexity of the female species may they remain forever crazy and mysterious and wonderful and by the way professor troys characteristic grin had returned i brought this subject up to warn you unless i miss my guess that reporter lady has her sights set on you she likes challenges and so far you have given off nothing but negative signals to say the least nick jumped up from his chair with a spurt of energy im going for another beer my good man until just this moment i had thought that i was talking to someone with insight and understanding now i find that im talking instead to some stupid black man who thinks asshole is a term of endearment he paused briefly on his way to the kitchen to pick up some potato chips by the way he shouted at troy between crunches on his chips you said on the phone that you wanted to show me something was that the angie leatherwood album or was it something else troy met him in the hall as nick was returning with the beer no he said earnestly it was something else but i wanted to talk to you for a little first to make sure well im not sure why maybe to give me some confidence that you wouldnt put me down what are you talking about nick said a little confused its in here troy replied knocking on a closed door off the hall in the opposite direction from the living room its my baby ive been working on it for over two years now alone most of the time although angies artistic kid brother lanny has helped me with some of it and now i want you to try it out he smiled you will be my first alpha tester what the hell im lost whats an alpha tester nicks brow furrowed as he tried to follow the conversation the two quick beers on an empty stomach had already given him a small and unexpected buzz my invention troy said slowly letting each word sink in is a computer game ive been working on it for almost two years and you are going to be the first outsider to play it nick screwed up his face as if he had just eaten a particularly tart piece of grapefruit moi he exclaimed you want me to play a computer game you want me whose handeye coordination is almost nonexistent even when completely sober to sit down and shoot aliens or dodge bombs or roll marbles at a frenzied pace that only neoadolescents can enjoy jefferson have you lost your mind this is nick williams the guy you call the professor the man who sits and reads books for entertainment very very good troy replied laughing heartily at nicks outburst youre perfect as an alpha tester my game is not one of those arcade games that test your reflexes although there are a few places in the game where the pace is fairly fast my creation is an adventure game its a little like a novel except that the player defines the outcome of the game im aiming at a wide audience and im including a lot of unusual technological wrinkles i would love to see how you respond troy took nicks shrug as grudging assent and opened the door to what should have been the master bedroom in the duplex unit instead what greeted nicks eyes was an almost phantasmagoric collection of electronic equipment filling every nook and cranny of a fairly large room his first impression was one of total chaos but after shaking his head and blinking a couple of times nick could make out some order in the jumble of scopes monitors cables computers and sundry unattached parts on one side of the room was a chair about ten feet in front of a giant screen between this chair and the screen was a low table with a keyboard on it troy motioned to nick to sit down my game is called alien adventure troy said excitedly and it will start as soon as i boot the discs and you are ready at the keyboard but there are some things that i must tell you first before you start he knelt beside nick and pointed at the keyboard there are three critical keys for you to remember while you are playing the game first the x key stops the clock from the moment you start the game the clock continues to run while the clock is running you are consuming vital resources there is only this one way to stop the clock and gather your wits without paying a penalty hitting the x key allows you to stop and think even more important than the x is the s key the s allows you to checkpoint or as you would say save the game right now you cant understand what im telling you because you havent played complicated computer games before but believe me you must learn regularly to save the game when you hit the s key all the parameters of the game you are playing are written into a special data base that has a unique identifier then at any time in the future you can call that identifier and the game will restart in exactly the place where you saved it this feature can be a life saver if you take a risky route in the game and your character ends up dying its the save game feature that keeps you from having to start all over again nick was amazed this was a different troy than he had ever seen before true he had been a little surprised and considerably impressed by his first mates ability to fix virtually any piece of electronic gear on the boat but never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that troy left the boat and went home to work with similar parts in a much more creative way now this same smiling black man had him sitting in a chair in front of a giant screen and was lecturing him patiently like a child nick could hardly wait to see what would happen next finally troy said asking with his eyes if nick was still following him theres the h or help key when you simply have run out of imagination and dont know what to do you can push h the game will then give you some hints on how you might proceed but i must warn you of one thing the clock continues to run while you are being helped and there are some places in the game during a battle for instance where pushing the h key can be disastrous because you are essentially defenseless during the time that the game processes your request for help h is most useful when you are in a benign spot and trying to figure out your overall strategy still squatting beside him troy handed nick a small spiral notebook and motioned for him to open it the first page said command dictionary on each page was a separate entry legibly written by hand that explained the game command that would result from hitting the key listed at the top of the page here are the rest of your commands fifty in all troy said but you dont need to memorize them ill help you youll learn some of them yourself after you play the game for a while most of the important commands are activated by a single stroke on the keyboard but some of the commands require two entries nick flipped through the notebook he noted that the key l prompted the command look but another entry was necessary to identify what instrument was being used to look l followed by a for example meant to look with your eyes l meant to look with an ultraviolet spectrometer whatever that was nick was already overwhelmed he looked over at his friend who was busy making final checks on some equipment troy came back to the chair and looked down at nick now he said i think youre ready any questions just one my lord and guide nick replied with mock meekness may i please have another beer before i risk my manhood in some weird world of your creation actually nick was not yet ready to play the game even after troy booted three compact discs there were more preliminary activities before nick could begin the game itself he had to enter his name race age and sex in response to questions that appeared on the giant screen nick looked at troy with a curious tilt of his head and a weird expression on his face dont ask questions at this point troy told him it will all be clear soon enough the screen next was filled with a beautiful ringed planet that looked like what an artist who favored purple might make out of saturn the perspective was from the pole of the planet the rings were all displayed like the different sections of a dart target little flecks of light gleamed intermittently from the rings indicating that the sun or star or whatever was the source for the reflected light was in the vicinity of the viewer it was a lovely picture a simple credit in block titles alien adventure by troy jefferson was superimposed on the ringed planet for three or four seconds and the sound of soft classical music could be heard in the room nick resisted an urge to chuckle when he heard troys voice clearly serious and selfconscious coming from one of the speakers troys recorded voice explained the initial conditions for the game the adventurer was on a space station in polar orbit around gunna the largest planet belonging to another solar system whose central body was the gtype star that we call tau ceti only ten light years or so away from the earth tau ceti has eight primary bodies in its system troys voice said including six planets and two moons maps of the system are available at the commissary on the space station troys voice continued although some of the regions have been incompletely mapped when your adventure begins you are sleeping in your cabin onboard the station an alarm sounds on your personal receiver the voice faded and the sound of an alarm could be heard the picture on the giant screen was the inside of a space cabin almost certainly taken from one of the many successful science fiction movies in the upper right hand corner of the screen was a game digital clock that was changing by one unit every four seconds or so nick looked helplessly at troy troy suggested that he hit the l key in a few seconds nick learned that he could use the direction keys on the board to look at specific items in his cabin each time he hit a direction key the picture on the screen changed to correspond to a different point of view nick noticed that there was a fuzzy picture on his small television and followed troys suggestion to watch until it became clear when the focus on his cabin television sharpened nick could see a young woman wearing a long full richly red dress that dropped almost all the way to the floor she was standing somewhat incongruously in a small stark room furnished with a single bed a little desk and a straight chair some light was entering the room through the solitary window near the ceiling and behind the desk thick vertical bars were imbedded in the window glass the camera zoomed in on her face nick leaned forward in his chair in troys apartment why why its julianne nick said in astonishment just as the woman began to speak captain nick williams she said much to his surprise you and i have never met but your reputation for valor and justice is unequaled in the federation i am princess heather of othen while attending the great ball at the inauguration of the viceroy of toom i was kidnapped by willens and taken to their stronghold on the planet accutar they have told my father king merson that they will not release me unless he cedes to them all the orerich asteroids in the endelva region he must not do that nick the princess continued earnestly as the camera zoomed in on her face or he will deprive our people of their only source of hanna the key to our immortality my sources tell me that already my father wastes away brooding over his impossible predicament my sister samantha has fled from othen with a key division of our best soldiers and a huge store of hanna it is not clear whether she intends to try to free me or to revolt against my fathers rule in the event that he should decide to give up the endelva asteroids in exchange for my life she has always been completely unpredictable yesterday the willens delivered an ultimatum to my father he must make his decision in one month or they will behead me captain williams please help me i do not want to die if you come and rescue me i will share with you the othen throne and the secret of our immortality we can live forever as king and queen the transmission stopped suddenly and the picture was gone the screen again showed a picture of the inside of nicks cabin onboard the space station nick resisted an impulse to applaud and sat without moving somehow troy had made julianne into a very believable princess heather but how did my name get into the script he wondered he wanted to ask questions but a warning message flashed on the giant screen indicating that time was passing and the adventurer was not taking any action nick found the x key and the digital clock on the screen stopped he turned to troy so what do i do now with troys occasional help nick equipped himself for a journey found his way to the spaceport and climbed in a small shuttle craft despite troys hints that his chances for survival in open space were small unless he spent more time examining the other facilities on the space station nick blasted off anyway it was great fun he used the commands on the keyboard to control his speed and direction what he saw on the screen was perfectly matched with his commands giving him the illusion that he was actually flying a vehicle through space he saw many other vehicles on the monitor as he maneuvered toward his target a planet named gunna but none of them approached his shuttle just outside the gunna sphere of influence however a needlenosed craft approached him quickly and then without warning blasted him with a battery of missiles nick was unable to escape the screen filled with fire from the explosion that ripped through his shuttle then the monitor went blank and black except for the simple message game over in white letters in the middle of the screen time for another beer nick asked surprised to discover that he was actually disappointed by the death of his character right on captain troy replied they walked into the kitchen together troy opened the refrigerator and pulled out two more beers he handed one to nick the professor was still absorbed in thinking about the game if i remember correctly there were four sections marked on that map of the space station nick said aloud and i only went in two of them would you mind telling me about the other two sections you missed the cafeteria and the library troy said delighted that nick was still interested the cafeteria is not all that important he added laughing although ive never known you to go anywhere before without eating first but the library dont tell me nick said interrupting him let me figure it out in the library i can learn about willens and the otheners or whatever theyre called who can live forever and what exactly is a viceroy of toom he shook his head my my troy i must say that i am more than a little impressed i have no idea how anyone could create something like this and i have a feeling that ive just scratched the surface i take it youre ready to continue professor troy replied acknowledging the praise with a huge grin one piece of advice while youre in the library look in the encyclopedia of space vehicles so you can at least tell a hostile ship when it appears otherwise youre never going to reach the exciting parts of the game the afternoon passed quickly nick found that escape into the imaginative world of troys game was magnificently relaxing just the tonic that he needed after the morning memories of monique troy knew that nick was enjoying the playing and he was thrilled he felt a surge of creative pride and his belief that alien adventure would be his ticket to success was reborn in his vain search for princess heather nick died a couple more times once when he landed on the unmapped planet thenia a black man with a lizard head approached him and told him to leave that there was nothing but trouble on thenia nick ignored the warning and moved away from his shuttle in a land rover he narrowly escaped a volcanic eruption only to be trapped and eaten by a gigantic slime mold that oozed out of the ground in the vicinity of his shuttle landing site in another reincarnation nick encountered samantha princcss heathers sister played for a couple of scenes by juliannes buxom friend corinne actually troy had made corinne up to look like susie q the famous porn queen of the early nineties and most of the actual pictures that appeared on the game screen were taken from her ribald classic pleasure until pain deft interleaving of new footage with the borrowed shots gave the illusion of being in the movie with susie q while she offered sexual delights beyond refusal samantha alias susie q alias corinne seduced nick and then stabbed him to death with a small dagger while he was lying naked and expectant on the bed by this point the two men were drinking their final sixpack of beer and the combination of the pornographic scenes and the alcohol had made their conversation coarse and degenerate shit exclaimed nick entreating troy to replay the scene where a naked samanthasusie q comes up to the camera to take his erect penis in her mouth i have never no never even heard of a computer game where you almost get a blow job man you are twisted a genius yes ill agree but absolutely fucking twisted what on gods earth induced you to put sex scenes in this game hey man troy laughed putting his arm around nick as they half staggered into the living room the name of the game is sales and right here in entertainment software it says that seventytwo percent seventytwo fucking percent my friend of all the people who buy computer games are to yearold males and do you know what that group likes in addition o computer games and science fiction sex my man cant you just see some teenage nerd retreating into his room to play this game and whack off eeee yaaa troy fell down on one of the easy chairs and beat his chest youre crazy jefferson nick said watching troys display i dont know if i can ever again be alone with you on a boat you are a certified nut case i mean just imagine the reviews alien adventure features an encounter with susie q the queen of pornography in an underground castle on the asteroid vitt which reminds me how in the world did you get all those movie pieces in there lots of research and hard work professor troy answered starting to calm down a little lanny and three of his friends have spent maybe a thousand hours watching film for me trying to find exactly the right clips and none of this would be possible of course without the new data storage methods we can now store an excellent digital version of every movie ever made in the united states in a warehouse not much larger than this duplex ive just used data base capabilities to the fullest nick crushed a beer can in his hands its fabulous really but i dont know about the sex business and why do you have the player register his race at the beginning of the game dont you think that will offend some people i never saw anything in the game that was based on the racial information even though he was drunk troy became momentarily serious and almost somber look man he said firmly sex and race are both a part of life it may be true that people play computer games primarily for entertainment and that they would prefer not to be confronted by some topics when they are amusing themselves but i must be allowed some creative license race is with us every day and ignoring it it seems to me only contributes to the problem troy brightened up hey professor that lizardman who warned you on thenia was black you went ahead anyway despite his warning what if he had been white would you have turned around and gone back to the shuttle a black man playing the game encounters a white lizardman on thenia its part of the show man there are twenty or so changes in the scenario that are based on racial input nicks expression was clearly disbelieving really troy said standing up to return to the room where they had played his game ill show you watch how the game starts if you register that you are a black male nick followed troy back into the computer room his curiosity was clearly piqued troy turned the game on and nick entered the biographical data changing his race to black this time when the television picture in his space station cabin came into focus princess heather was black the princess this time was in fact angie leatherwood well ill be damned nick said looking over at a beaming troy you are one clever dude mr jefferson nick walked out of the room whistling and shaking his head again troy turned off the game and followed okay nick began once they were back in troys living room and seated on the couch one last question and then lets forget the game for the time being how did you get my name into it i thought that was very impressive it was originally lannys idea based on a movie he watched about a speech therapist lanny had all the minor characters spend a day mouthing all the vowel and consonant sounds in a test session then we just put the sounds together with what are called audio analytic continuation techniques troy laughed he was feeling ebullient and basking in the compliments but it does have its drawbacks our interpreter only knows how to read simple english words we may have to suppress that feature if we sell the game abroad nick stood up well ive run out of superlatives by the way are there more of you brothers sisters anything i guess id like to warn the rest of the world only me now troy replied a faraway look fleetingly crossing his face i had a brother jamie six years older than me we were very close he died in an automobile accident when i was fourteen there was an awkward silence im sorry nick said again touched by troys openness troy shrugged his shoulders and struggled with the sudden memory nick changed the subject they talked about the boat and then about homer and his crew for several minutes suddenly nick looked at his watch jesus christ he said its after four oclock werent we supposed to meet carol dawson at four troy jumped out of his chair we sure were some partners we turned out to be he was grinning again spending the entire afternoon drinking beer and playing games the two men shared a small hug threw the empty beer cans in the trash and went out the door toward nicks car carol was clearly irritated as she sat in the communications room at the marriott she was drumming her fingers on the desk while she listened to the telephone ring there was a click and then nicks voice said i am not at home at the present time but if she flipped the switch off hastily and completed the sentence her sardonic mimicry releasing some of her frustration but if youll leave your name your number and the time that you called ill get back to you as soon as i return shit shit i knew i should have called before i left miami she dialed another number bernice answered and put her right through to dr dale michaels carol did not bother with a greeting can you believe that i cant even find the stupid bastard hes not on his boat hes not at home nobody knows where he is i could have stayed in miami and taken a nap carol had not told dr dale much about nick and troy and what she had said about nick had not been flattering well what did you expect dale responded you wanted to go out with amateurs as a cover why would you think that he would be easy to find before your appointment that kind usually stays in bed with his dame of the day until he has some reason to greet the world dale chuckled to himself carol found herself strangely annoyed by dales disdainful comment about nicks love life she started to say something but decided against it say dale she said instead is this phone line absolutely secure i have a couple of sensitive items to discuss with you he smiled nothing to worry about i have sensors that flash if there is the slightest unexplained break anywhere in the line even on your end good carol replied she pulled out her notebook and scanned a handwritten list as far as arnie webber knows she said looking up at the video camera there are no legal prohibitions against salvaging any u s government property provided it is returned to its rightful owner very soon after its retrieval so i wouldnt technically be committing a crime if i pull the missile up she checked the first item off her list but dale i thought about something else on the flight down here from miami this thing is after all some kind of guided missile what if it blows up am i crazy to worry about such a thing or is it somehow incapacitated or whatever by sitting down there in the sand and salt water for several days dale laughed sometimes carol youre divine i am fairly confident that the new missile is designed to operate either in the air or in water and i dont think that the sand would be able to foul up its critical parts in a short period of time however the fact that it hasnt exploded yet suggests to me that it probably wasnt armed in the first place except possibly for a small destruct device that may or may not have already failed you are taking a calculated risk in retrieving that missile i still strongly suggest that you make your dive obtain the photographs and then go public with the story dredging the missile up for display purposes seems to me to be more of a stunt than journalism besides its dangerous carol was curt as i said in the car you are entitled to your opinion the navy could make a case that i faked the pictures somehow but they cannot argue with a missile that has physical presence and can clearly be seen by a nationwide television audience i want maximum impact for the story she checked another item off the list in her notebook oh yes i forgot to mention this morning that i met another boat captain down here a bit of a creep actually an older fat man named homer he seemed to recognize me almost immediately wealthy big yacht and all that strange crew was his last name ashford homer ashford dale interrupted her carol nodded so you know him she asked certainly dale replied he was the leader of the expedition that found the santa rosa treasure in youve met him too although its obvious youve forgotten he and his wife were guests at the moi awards banquet early in dale stopped to think thats right i remember now you were real late coming to the party because of that threat made against you by juan salvador but im surprised you forgot them the wife especially she was a great big fat woman and she thought you were the cats pajamas slowly but surely it all clicked in carols memory she recalled a bizarre evening right after she first started going with dale she had run a piece in the herald on cocaine trafficking and had suggested that the cuban city councilman juan salvador was deliberately inhibiting the police investigations at noon that day a usually reliable source had called her editor at the paper and told him that senor salvador had just purchased a contract on carols life the herald had assigned her a bodyguard and recommended that she alter her normal schedule so that her whereabouts would always be uncertain the evening of the moi banquet carol was in a fog the bodyguard had been with her for only three hours and already she felt confined and restricted but carol had been genuinely frightened by the threat at the banquet she had scrutinized every face looking for an assassin waiting for someone to make a move as she sat in the hotel communications room fourteen months later she did vaguely remember meeting homer and some jolly fat woman who had followed her around for twenty minutes or so damnit carol thought its my memory again i should have recognized him immediately how stupid of me okay carol said to dale i remember them now but why were they at the moi awards banquet we were honoring our leading benefactors that night dale replied homer and ellen have been big supporters of our underwater sentry effort in fact he has field tested many of our prototypes at his facility there in key west real solid test data too best compilation of sentryintruder responses that anybody has catalogued why it was ashford who showed us how the mq could be fooled okay okay carol said realizing that her tolerance threshold was still extremely low thanks for the information its now a quarter till four im going to go down to the marina to meet nick williams and make arrangements for tomorrow if anything new comes up ill call you at home tonight ciao said dale michaels trying without success to sound sophisticated and please be careful carol hung up the phone with a sigh she wondered if she should spend a minute or two figuring out where she and dale were going or not going as the case may be she thought about all the things she needed to do she closed her notebook and rose from her chair not right now she thought i dont have time now to think about dale but as soon as i have a break in this crazy life of mine carol was really fuming when she walked back into the marina headquarters the second time she approached the information desk with fire in her eyes miss she said nastily to julianne as i told you fifteen minutes ago i had an appointment here at four oclock with nick williams and troy jefferson it is now as you can see after fourthirty carol pointed at the digital clock with an impatient sweeping gesture that commanded julianne to look we have both established independently that mr williams is not home carol continued now ate you going to give me mr jeftersons phone number or should i make a scene julianne did not like carol or her obvious attitude of superiority she held her ground as i told you miss dawson she said politely but with a biting overtone marina policy prohibits our giving out the phone numbers of the independent boat owners or their crew members its a question of privacy now if you had a formal charter through the marina julianne continued enjoying her moment of glory then it would be our job to assist you but as i said earlier we have no record goddamn it i know that replied carol furiously she slammed the envelope of photos that she was carrying down on juliannes counter im not an imbecile weve been through this before i told you i was supposed to meet them here at four oclock now if you wont help me i want to talk to your superior the assistant manager of whatever fine said julianne her eyes firing darts of contempt at carol if you will just take a seat over there i will see if i can locate i will not take a seat shouted carol in exasperation i want to see him now this is an issue of extreme urgency now pick up the phone and is something wrong here perhaps i can help carol spun around homer ashford was standing right behind her just to the right toward the gate in the direction of the jetties greta and a big heavy woman were talking quietly ellen smiled at carol greta looked right through her well hello captain homer julianne said sweetly its nice of you to ask but i think everythings under control miss dawson here has just indicated that she does not accept my explanation of marina policy she is going to wait for maybe you can help carol interrupted julianne defiantly i had an appointment here at four oclock with nick williams and troy jefferson they have not shown up do you by any chance happen to know troys phone number captain homer gave carol a suspicious look and exchanged a knowing glance with ellen and greta he turned back to carol well it is certainly a surprise miss dawson to see you back here again why we were just talking about you this morning saying that we hoped you had a good time on your free day in key west he paused for effect now i wonder why youve come back here again the very next day and did i hear correctly you need to see williams and jefferson on an issue of extreme urgency it couldnt possibly have anything to do with all that equipment you brought in here yesterday could it or the little gray bag that williams has been guarding since last night uh oh thought carol as greta and ellen moved in around her im surrounded captain homer started to pick up the sealed envelope on juliannes counter but carol stopped him if you dont mind captain ashford she said firmly taking his hand off the envelope and putting the photos under her arm she lowered her voice i would like to talk to you privately carol nodded her head at the two women can we go out in the parking lot together for a minute homers beady eyes squinted at her then his face broke into the same obnoxious lecherous smile that carol had seen on the ambrosia certainly my dear he said he shouted to greta and ellen as he walked out the door with carol wait here ill only be a minute necessity is the mother of invention carol thought to herself as she led homer ashford out the door so invent bitch and now as in this moment they walked up the steps to the parking lot carol turned to captain homer at the top of the steps with a conspiratorial look on her face i can tell that youve figured out why im here she said i didnt want it this way i thought it would make a better story if nobody knew what i was doing but youre obviously too clever for me homer grinned foolishly but i would ask you to tell as few people as possible you can tell your wife and greta but please nobody else the herald wants it to be a surprise homer looked puzzled carol leaned over and almost whispered in his ear the entire sunday magazine section the fourth week in april isnt that unbelievable working title dreams of being rich stories about people like you like mel fisher like the four floridians who have won over a million dollars each in the lottery on how sudden income changes your life im doing the whole piece im starting with the treasure angle because of its general interest carol could see that captain homer was reeling she knew she had him off guard yesterday i just wanted to check your boat quickly see how you lived see how it would photograph i freaked out a little when you recognized me so fast but i had always planned to go out with williams first carol laughed my treasurefinding equipment from moi faked him out he still thinks i am a genuine treasure seeker i almost completed my whole interview with him yesterday i only came back today to finish a couple of small items an alert went off in homer ashfords system when carol talked about faking out nick williams homer wasnt certain he believed this smooth reporters story even now he mused to himself that her story was plausible but there was still one big unanswered question but what is williams carrying around in that bag he asked that said carol sensing his distrust is nothing she raised her eyebrows and laughed again or almost anyway we pulled up a worthless old trinket yesterday afternoon so i could photograph the salvage process for the story i told him to have it appraised today he thinks im an eccentric he must be keeping it hidden in the bag because hes embarrassed and doesnt want anybody to see him with it carol lightly hit captain homer in the ribs with her elbow he shook his head part of him realized he was being told a very clever lie but somehow enough of it made sense that homer couldnt pierce the deception his brow furrowed for a moment so i guess youll want to talk to us when youre through with the other two at just that moment unbeknownst to carol nick and troy drove into the marina parking lot they were still slightly drunk and silly lawdy lawdy said troy spotting carol and captain homer in conversation i believe my eyes have screwed up theyre sending a picture of a beauty and a beast to my brain its miss carol dawson together with our favorite fat captain now what do you suppose theyre talking about i dont know said nick bridling instantly but im damn sure going to find out if shes doublecrossing us he pulled the car quickly into a parking place and started to jump out troy reached across and restrained him now why dont you let me handle this one troy said humor may be just the right ticket here nick thought for a moment maybe youre right he said ill let you go first troy walked into view just as carol and captain homer were finishing their conversation helloooo angel he said from forty yards away whats happening carol held her hand up in acknowledgment but didnt turn around to greet troy so thats columbia just beyond the pelican resort at eightthirty tomorrow night right replied homer ashford he nodded his head in troys direction and started to leave well be ready for you bring plenty of tape for its a long story he made a peculiar clucking sound with his mouth and plan to stay for a little party afterward homer was already halfway down the steps when troy walked up beside carol hello captain homer goodbye captain homer he said quietly still playing the comic he leaned over to kiss carol on the cheek hi there angel yuch carol pulled her cheek away you smell like brewery no wonder ive had to look all over town for you two she saw nick coming toward them across the parking lot he was carrying the exercise bag she raised her voice well mr williams what a pleasant surprise how nice that you and your brother here could climb down from your bar stools long enough to keep our appointment she looked at her watch my my she said in her most sarcastic voice we are certainly fashionably late lets see if one waits fifteen minutes for a full professor how long does one wait for a fake professor knock off the bullshit miss high and mighty nick said responding angrily to her barbs he joined carol and troy and then caught his breath we have a few bones to pick with you as well he continued just what were you doing talking to that asshole ashford nick sounded threatening carol recoiled listen to him she said the typical macho male always shifts the blame to the woman hey bitch he says forget im late forget im an arrogant bastard it was your fault anyway hey hey hey troy interceded carol and nick were glowering at each other they both started to speak but troy interrupted them again children children please he continued i have something important to say they both looked at him troy raised his arms for quiet then he adopted a stiff pose and pretended to be reading fourscore and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation carol cracked up first troy she said smiling despite her anger you are something else you are also ridiculous a grinning troy punched nick on the shoulder how did i do professor would i make a good lincoln could a nice young black boy play lincoln for the white folks nick smiled reluctantly and looked down at the macadam while troy jabbered when troy was finished nicks tone to carol was conciliatory im sorry we were late he said in measured tones we forgot what time it was heres the trident carol recognized how difficult it had been for nick to apologize she accepted gracefully with a short smile and a gesture with her hands you keep the trident for a little while longer she said after a brief silence we have a lot of other things to talk about she looked around but this may be the wrong place and the wrong time both nick and troy were giving her questioning looks i have some very exciting news she explained some of which is here in your copy of the pictures that i developed this morning bottom line is that the telescope picked up an infrared signal coming out of the fissure from some kind of large object or objects she turned to nick it may be more treasure we can t be certain what it is based on the images nick reached for the envelope carol pulled it away not here not now too many eyes and ears take my word for it what we have to do now is make plans can you two take me out again tomorrow morning early and be prepared to salvage objects possibly as big as two hundred pounds of course i intend to pay for chartering the boat again wow whistled nick two hundred pounds i can hardly wait to see the pictures he was sobering up rapidly well need to borrow a dredger and i still have the telescope so we can use it again carol added she looked at her watch its almost five oclock now how much preparation time do you need three hours four hours at the most nick said calculating swiftly with troys help of course he added gladly my friends troy replied and since angie has reserved a special table for me at sloppy joes for her tenthirty show tonight why dont we meet there and go over the details for tomorrow angie leatherwood is a friend of yours carol said obviously impressed i havent seen her since she made the big time she paused for a second and handed the envelope to nick look at these images in private the whole set was taken just under the boat where we were diving some are obviously blowups of others it may take a little time for your eyes to adjust to all the colors but its the brown object or objects that were after carol could tell that both of the men were eager to see the pictures she walked with them toward nicks car so ill see both of you tonight at sloppy joes about tenfifteen she turned to head for her own parking place uh carol just a minute nick stopped her carol waited while nick suddenly awkward tried to figure out a nice way to ask his question would you mind telling us why you were talking to captain homer he at last said tactfully carol looked at nick and troy for a minute and then laughed i ran into him while i was in the office trying to call you guys he wanted to know about the piece we retrieved yesterday i put him off the track by telling him i was doing a feature article on all members of the crew that found the santa rosa treasure eight years ago nick glanced at troy with mock disgust you see jefferson he said with exaggerated emphasis i told you there was a legitimate explanation the two men waved at carol as she headed for her car lieutenant todd the commander said with exasperation i am beginning to think that the us navy has overestimated your intelligence or experience or both it is beyond me how you can continue even to consider the possibility that the panther was commanded off course by the russians particularly in light of the new information you presented this afternoon but sir the younger man answered stubbornly it is still a viable hypothesis and you yourself said in the meeting that a good failure analysis does not exclude any reasonable possibility the two men were in commander winters office the commander walked over to look out the window it was almost dark outside the air was heavy still and humid thunderstorms were building over the ocean to the south the base was nearly empty at length winters looked at his watch heaved a sigh and came back across the room toward lieutenant todd he was smiling only slightly you listened well lieutenant but the operative word here is reasonable lets review the facts did i or did i not hear correctly that your telemetry analysis unit found this afternoon that the commands rejected counter on the bird also incremented during the flight beginning as early as off the coast of new brunswick and that apparently over one thousand command messages were rejected as the missile made its way down the atlantic coast how do you propose to explain all this in terms of your scenario did the russians deploy an entire fleet of ships along the flight path just to confuse and capture one solitary navy test missile commander winters was now standing directly in front of the taller young lieutenant or maybe you believe he continued sarcastically before todd could respond that the russians have a new secret weapon that flies alongside a missile going at mach and talks to it en route come on lieutenant on what reasonable grounds do you consider this bizarre russian hypothesis of yours still viable lieutenant todd did not yield sir he answered none of the other possible explanations for the missiles behavior makes any more sense at this stage you now say that you believe its a software problem however our very brightest programmers cannot imagine how the only external indication of a major systemlevel software malfunction could be that two and only two command counters go haywire they have checked all the internal software diagnostic data that was telemetered to the ground and they can find no problems besides the prerelease checkout indicates that all the software was working fine just seconds before the flight began and we know something else ramirez has learned from washington that there have been peculiar movements in the russian submarine fleet off the florida coast in the last fortyeight hours im not saying that the russian hypothesis as you call it is the answer just that until we have a more satisfactory explanation of a failure mechanism that could cause both command counters to increment it makes sense to carry one option that assumes maybe the panther was actually commanded winters shook his head all right lieutenant he said finally i will not order you to take it off the list but i will order you to concentrate this weekend on finding the missile in the ocean somewhere and identifying a hardware andor software problem that could have caused either the command counter anomaly or the change in the flight path or both there must be an explanation that does not involve operations on a massive scale by the russians todd started to walk around winters and leave just a minute the commander said his eyes narrowing i dont believe its necessary is it lieutenant to remind you of who will be held responsible if the outside world gets wind of this russian business no commander sir was the answer then carry on said winters and let me know if there are any significant new developments commander winters was in a hurry he had called the theater right after todd had left and told melvin burton that he was going to be late he drove quickly into a hamburger stand wolfed down a burger and fries and headed for the marina area he arrived at the theater when most of the rest of the cast was already dressed melvin met him at the door quickly now commander we have no time to spare the makeup must be correct the first time he looked nervously at his watch youre in the pulpit in exactly fortytwo minutes the commander entered the mens dressing room took off his navy uniform and put on the dour black and white regalia of an episcopal priest outside the door to the dressing room melvin paced back and forth going through a final checklist in his mind commander winters was in the pulpit when the curtain rose he had a strong case of normal openingnight jitters he looked across the three rows of his stage congregation to the full audience in the theater he saw his wife betty and son hap in the second row winters smiled at them quickly before the applause died down then his nervousness disappeared as he launched into shannons sermon the short prologue sped by quickly the lights dimmed another time for fifteen seconds the set changed automatically and he was in the final scene walking into his hotel room in mexico and still mumbling to himself phrases from his letter shannonwinters sat down on his bed he heard a noise in the corner of the room and looked up it was charlottetiffani her gorgeous auburn hair was down over her shoulders she was wearing a light blue silk nightshirt cut low in the middle which her ample and upright breasts filled completely he heard her say larry oh larry finally were alone together and she came to sit beside him on the bed her perfume filled his nostrils her hand was behind his head her lips pressed against his insistent hard searching he pulled back her lips followed then her body he fell back on the bed she crawled on top her kisses continuing her breasts pushed against his pounding chest he put his arms around her slowly at first and then lying on his back he enveloped her with a deep embrace the lights flashed off and on for several seconds charlottetiffani slid off of winters and lay beside him on the bed he could hear her labored breathing a voice was heard charlotte then again with a loud knock on the door charlotte i know youre in there the door sprang open the two lovers half sat up in bed the lights went off and the curtain came down the applause was loud and sustained commander vernon winters pushed open the door and stumbled outside he was at the alley entrance to the theater the door over which was a single light bulb covered with insects opened onto a small wooden platform a few steps above the pavement winters walked down the three steps and stood beside the red brick wall of the theater he pulled out a cigarette and lit it he watched the smoke curl upward against the red brick in the distance there was a burst of lightning then a pause before the sound of rolling thunder he inhaled deeply again and tried to understand what he had been feeling during those five or ten seconds with tiffani i wonder if they could tell he thought i wonder if it was obvious to everyone when he had changed clothes for the first full act of the play he had noticed the telltale tracks on his undershorts he expelled some more smoke and winced and that little girl my god she knows for sure she must have felt it when she was on top of me despite himself he recaptured for an instant his excitement when tiffani had pressed herself against him his breath shortened a first tinge of guilt began to manifest itself my god he thought again what am i im a dirty old man for some reason he found himself thinking of joanna carr of a night almost twentyfive years ago he remembered the moment when he took her commander he heard a voice say he turned around tiffani was standing on the platform in her tshirt and jeans her long hair down over her shoulders now she was walking down the steps toward him commander she said again with a mysterious smile may i have a cigarette he was dumbfounded stupefied he said nothing winters automatically reached into his pocket and pulled out his pack of pall malls the girl took one packed it against her fingernail and slid it into her mouth she waited a second maybe two then she gave him another smile winters at last woke up and produced his cheap supermarket lighter she cupped his trembling hand and inhaled vigorously on the cigarette winters watched her fascinated as she pulled the smoke into her lungs he studied her mouth her white neck her uplifted chest as she caressed the smoke with the same rapt attention he watched her diaphragm subside and the smoke curl out of her pursed lips they stood there together quietly smoking neither speaking over the ocean there was another flash of lightning another roll of thunder each time that tiffani would put the cigarette in her mouth the mesmerized winters would follow her every move she would inhale deeply intently pulling hard on the cigarette for the nicotine her body cherished he was only vaguely aware of his jumbled thoughts shes beautiful so beautiful young and fresh and full of life and that hair how i would love to wrap it around my neck but shes not a little girl shes a young woman she must sense what im feeling my fascination for her she smokes as i do with complete concentration she caresses i love stormy nights tiffani broke the silence as still another distant flash of lightning lit up the sky she moved closer to him and then craned her neck to see around a group of trees that was blocking her view of the cloud formation where the lightning was occurring she brushed against commander winters ever so slightly he was electrified his mouth was dry his body was suffused with desire a desire he barely recognized he could not answer her comment instead he stared off at the growing storm and took the final drag from his cigarette she too finished her cigarette and dropped it on the pavement as she turned to face him and their eyes met the last wisps of smoke were playfully wandering across her lips she gave a quick flirtatious blow with her mouth and winters felt a burst of lust in his groin he retained his selfcontrol and they entered the theater in silence the applause continued commander winters brought the women who had played maxine and hannah one on either side of him forward for their final bow just as they had planned before the performance began the applause intensified again he stared at the empty seats where betty and hap had been before the intermission he heard a voice from the audience shout charlotte goodall and winters improvised he took the two ladies back to the line of the assembled cast and walked down the line to tiffani for a moment she did not understand then her face broke into a radiant smile and she took his hand he walked forward with her to the front of the stage their hands wrapped together in a tight hold this was her special moment she was near tears as she heard the applause grow again he stood aside and she bowed gracefully to the audience she finished her bow took his hand again with a delightful squeeze and backed up into the line with the cast melvin marc and amanda were all backstage while they were dressing enthusiastic congratulations were everywhere melvin particularly seemed ecstatic he admitted that he had had some misgivings during rehearsals but that everyone had been wonderful the director confided to winters that the bedroom scene with tiffani had been superb couldnt have been better as melvin literally danced out the dressing room door winters was overwhelmed with a myriad of emotions he was pleased with his performance in the play and the audience reception but other more personal things were on his mind what had happened to betty and hap why had they left at intermission in his minds eye winters imagined betty watching his love scene with tiffani he had a momentary panic as he convinced himself that she had known from out in the audience that her husband was not acting at all that he was every bit as aroused as the character he was playing what had occurred with tiffani he could not begin to understand and could not even think about without starting to feel guilty while he was putting back on his navy uniform he allowed himself to taste again her kisses on the bed in the play and to feel the sexual tension while they smoked together in the alley but beyond his awareness of his arousal he would not go guilt was a depressing emotion and on his successful opening night he did not want to be depressed when commander winters walked out of the mens communal dressing room tiffani was waiting for him her hair was back in pigtails her face scrubbed free of makeup she looked again like a little girl commander she said almost with servility would you do me a favor please he smiled his assent she beckoned to him and he followed her out in the hall that was adjacent to the backstage quarters a redhaired man about the commanders age was standing in the hall nervously smoking a cigarette and pacing it was obvious that he felt uncomfortable and out of place next to him was a tawdry brunette early thirties perhaps chewing gum and talking to the man in a whisper the man noticeably relaxed when he saw the commander in his uniform well sir he said to winters when tiffani introduced him as her father its good to meet you i dont know much about this acting business but i worry that its unhealthy for my daughter sometimes he winked at his wife tiffanis stepmother and lowered his voice you know sir with all the wimps and fags and other weirdo actors a man cant be too careful but tiff told me there was a real navy officer a bona fide commander as part of the cast at first i didnt believe her mr thomas was definitely getting signals both from tiffani and his wife he was talking too much im regular navy myself he blurted out as winters remained silent almost twentyfive years signed up when i was just a boy of eighteen met tiffs mother two years later daddy tiffani interrupted him you promised that you wouldnt embarrass me please just ask him he probably has things that he needs to do the commander had certainly not been prepared to meet tiffanis father and stepmother in fact he had never for a moment even thought about her parents although as he stood there listening to mr thomas it all made sense tiffani was after all only a junior in high school so of course she lives at home he thought with her parents mr thomas was looking very serious for about a second winters felt fear and the beginning of panic no no he thought quickly she cant have told them anything its all much too soon my wife and i play bridge mr thomas was saying duplicate bridge in tournaments and this weekend theres a big sectional in miami well be leaving tomorrow morning and coming back very late on sunday night winters was puzzled he was lost in this conversation why should he care about what the thomases did with their free time at length mr thomas came to the point so we had called maes cousin in marathon and asked her if she would pick my daughter up after the show tomorrow night but that would mean tiff would have to miss the cast party tiff suggested that maybe you would be willing to see her home safely from the party and mr thomas smiled pleasantly keep a fatherly eye on her while im off playing bridge winters instinctively glanced at tiffani for just a few milliseconds he saw a worldly look in her eyes that tore through him like a fireball then she was a little girl again entreating her father to let her go to the party the commander played his role well all right mr thomas he replied ill be glad to help you out he patted tiffani fondly she deserves to go to the party shes worked hard he paused for a moment but i have a couple of questions there will certainly be champagne at the party and it will probably go real late does she have a curfew how do you feel about just use your own judgment commander mr thomas cut him short mae and i trust you completely the man reached over and shook winters hand and thank you very much by the way he added as he turned around to leave you were great although i must admit i was worried when you were necking with my daughter the fag that wrote the play must have been one weird dude tiffanis stepmother mumbled thanks over her chewing gum and the girl herself said see ya tomorrow as the three of them walked away the commander reached in his pocket for another cigarette betty and hap were both asleep as commander winters knew they would be when he finally arrived home around eleven oclock he walked softly past his sons room but then stopped outside of bettys basically a considerate man winters spent a few seconds weighing bettys sleep against his need for an explanation he decided to go in and wake her up he was surprised to find that he was nervous when he sat down on the side of her bed in the dark she was sleeping on her back with a sheet and a very thin blanket both pulled up neatly to within about two inches of her shoulders he shook her lightly betty dear he said im home id like to talk to you she stirred he shook her again its vernon he said softly his wife sat up in bed and turned on the light on the end table underneath the light was a small picture of the face of jesus a man wise beyond his thirty or so years with a full beard a serious look and a glow approximating a halo behind his head goodness she said frowning and rubbing her eyes whats going on is everything all right betty had never been particularly pretty but in the last ten years she had ignored her looks altogether and had even put on twenty pounds of ungainly weight yes he answered i just wanted to talk and to find out why you and hap left the show just after the intermission betty looked him directly in the eyes this was a woman without guile even without nuance life was simple and straightforward for her if you truly believed in god and jesus christ then you had no doubts about anything vernon she began i have often wondered why you choose to perform in such strange plays but i have never complained about it particularly since it seems to be the only thing that has excited you in a good way since libya and that awful beach incident she frowned and a cloud seemed to cross her face momentarily then she continued in her matteroffact way but hap is no longer a child he is becoming a young man and hearing his father even in a play refer to god as a petulant old man and a senile delinquent is not likely to strengthen his faith she looked away and i thought it was equally disturbing for him to watch you groping with that young girl all in all she said glancing back at her husband and summarizing the entire issue i thought the play had no values no morals and nothing worth staying for winters felt his anger building but struggled with it as he always did he envied betty her steadfast faith her ability to see god clearly in every daily activity he himself felt disjoint from the god of his childhood and his fruitless personal searches had not yet resulted in a clearer perception of him but a couple of things winters did know for certain his god would laugh with and have compassion for tennessee williams characters and he would not be pleased by bombs falling on little children the commander did not argue with betty he gave her a brotherly kiss on the cheek and she turned off the light for just a moment he wondered how long has it been three weeks but he couldnt remember the exact time or even whether or not it had been good they fooled around as betty called it whenever her awareness of his need overcame her general lack of interest probably about normal for couples our age winters thought somewhat defensively as he undressed in his room but he was not able to sleep as he lay quietly in the dark underneath the sheet the feeling of arousal that had been so intense first during the play and then again out in the alley continued to call to him with pictures when he closed his eyes he could again see tiffanis soft and flirtatious lips blowing out the last of the smoke that had been deep within her lungs his mouth could still taste those passionate kisses that she had forced upon him during the bedroom scene and then there was that special look when her father had asked him to take care of her at the party had he imagined it several times commander winters changed positions in his bed trying to dispel the images in his mind and the nervousness that was keeping him awake he was unsuccessful eventually while he was lying on his back he realized there was one possible release from this kind of tension at first he felt guilty even embarrassed but the waves of images of tiffani continued to flood into his brain he touched himself the images from the day sharpened and began to expand into fantasies she was lying on top of him on the bed as she had been in the play and he was responding to her kisses for a brief second winters became frightened and held himself in check but a desperate surge of longing removed his last inhibition he was again an adolescent alone in his rich imagination the scene in his mind changed he was lying naked on a huge kingsize bed in an opulent room with high ceilings tiffani approached him from the lighted bathroom also naked her long auburn hair cascading over her shoulders and hiding the nipples of her breasts she took a last languorous pull from her cigarette and put it out in the ashtray beside the bed her eyes never leaving his as she slowly almost lovingly expelled the last of the smoke from her mouth she climbed into the bed beside him he could feel the softness of her skin the tingle of her long hair against his neck and chest she kissed him gently but passionately with her hands behind his head he felt her tongue playing enticingly across his lips she moved her body into position next to him and pressed her pelvis into his he felt himself rising she took his penis in her hand and squeezed lightly he was completely erect she squeezed again then gracefully raised her body up and inserted him deep inside her he felt a magical moist warmth and then exploded almost immediately commander winters was staggered by the power and the intensity of his fantasy somewhere inside him a voice cried for caution and warned of dire consequences if he let this fantasy become too real but as he lay spent and alone in his suburban home he pushed his guilt and fears aside and allowed himself the unrivaled bliss of postorgasmic sleep sloppy joes was an institution in key west the favorite bar of hemingway and his motley crew had managed to adapt quickly to the multifaceted evolution of the city that it had come to symbolize many denizens of the old city had been almost apoplectic when the bar had forsaken its historic location downtown and moved into the vast shopping complex surrounding the new marina but even they grudgingly admitted after the club reopened in a wellventilated large room complete with sound stage and excellent acoustics that the tiffany lamps long wooden bars narrow mirrors from ceiling to floor and memorabilia from a hundred years in key west had been tastefully rearranged in a way that retained the spirit of the old bar it was altogether fitting that angie leatherwood should perform as the headliner at sloppy joes during her brief and infrequent returns to the city of her birth troys glib tongue had originally talked the owner a transplanted fiftyyearold new yorker named tony palazzo into giving her an audition when she was still nineteen tony had heard her sing for five minutes and then had exclaimed punctuating his comments with wild hand gestures its not enough that you bring me a black girl whos so beautiful she takes your breath away no you bring me one who also sings like a nightingale mama mia life is not fair my daughter carla would kill to sound like that tony had become angies biggest fan and had unselfishly promoted her career angie never forgot what tony had done for her and always sang at sloppy joes when she was in town she was like that troys table was front and center about ten feet away from the edge of the stage nick and troy were already seated at the small round table and had finished their first drinks when carol arrived about five minutes before tenthirty she apologized and mumbled something about parking in siberia as soon as she arrived nick pulled out the envelope of images and both men told her that they had found the pictures fascinating nick began asking questions about the photographs while troy summoned a waiter nick and carol were involved in an earnest conversation about the objects in the fissure when the new drinks reached the table nick had just mentioned that one of them looked like a modern missile it was ten thirtyfive the lights flashed off and on to announce that the show was beginning angie leatherwood was a consummate performer like many of the very best entertainers she never forgot that it was the audience that was the customer that it was they who both created her image and enhanced her mystique she began with the title song from her new album memories of enchanting nights and then sang a medley of whitney houston songs according a tribute to that brilliant songstress whose talent had sparked angies own desire to sing next she showed her versatility by blending a quartet of songs with different beats a jamaican reggae a soft ballad from her first album love letters a nearly perfect diana ross imitation from an old supremes song where did our love go and an emotionally powerful lilting encomium to her blind father entitled the man with vision thunderous applause greeted the conclusion of each song sloppy joes was sold out including all the standing room along the hundredfoot bar seven different huge video screens scattered throughout the spacious club brought angie home to those who were not close to the stage this was her crowd these were her friends a couple of times angie was almost embarrassed because the clapping and the bravos would not stop at troys table very little was said during the show the threesome pointed out songs they particularly liked but there was no time for conversation angie dedicated her penultimate song let me take care of you baby to her dearest friend and then finished with her most popular cut from love letters the audience gave her a standing ovation and hooted noisily for an encore nick noticed while he was standing that he was a little woozy from the two strong drinks and was also feeling strangely emotional possibly because of the subliminal associations created by the love songs that angie was singing angie returned to the stage as the noise subsided her soft and caressing voice could be heard you all know that key west is a very special place for me it was here that i was raised and went to school most of my memories bring me back here she paused and her eyes scanned the audience there are many songs that bring back memories and the emotions that go with them but of all of them my favorite is the theme song from the musical cats so key west this is for you there was scattered clapping as the music synthesizers accompanying her played the introduction to memories the audience remained standing as angies mellifluous voice launched into the beautiful song as soon as she began nick was instantly transported to the kennedy center in washington dc in june of where he was watching a production of cats with his mother and father he had finally come home to explain to them why he had been unable to return to harvard after his spring break in florida but try as he might he could not begin to tell the story to his disappointed father and brokenhearted mother all he could say was it was a woman and then he would fall silent it had been a sad reunion while he was visiting his home in falls church the first malignant polyps had been discovered and removed from his fathers colon the doctors had been optimistic about several more years of life but they had stressed that colon cancer often recurred and metastasized to other parts of the body in a long talk with his suddenly frail father nick had promised to finish his degree in miami but that was little solace to the older man he had dreamed of seeing his son graduate from harvard the performance of cats at the kennedy center had been only mildly entertaining for nick in the middle he had found himself wondering how many people in the audience really knew the author of the source material for the songs this poet ts eliot who not only admired and enjoyed feline idiosyncrasies but also once began a poem by describing the evening spread out against the sky like a patient aetherized upon a table but when the old female cat walked to center stage her beauty faded into wrinkles and began her song of her days in the sun nick had been moved right along with the entire audience for reasons he never understood he had seen monique singing the song years in the future and in washington he had wept silent tears hidden quickly from his parents when the achingly pure soprano voice had reached the climax of the song touch me its so easy to leave me all alone with my memories of my days in the sun if you touch me youll understand what happiness is angies voice at sloppy joes was not nearly as piercing as that soprano in washington but she sang with the same intensity evoking all the sadness of someone for whom all the joys of life are in the past the corners of nicks eyes filled with tears and one of them brimmed out to run down his cheek from where carol was standing the lights from the stage reflected off nicks cheek she saw the tear the window of vulnerability and was herself moved in return for the first time she felt a deep stirring almost an affection for this distant solitary but strangely attractive man ah carol how different it might have been if for once in your life you had not acted impulsively if you had just let the man have his moment of loneliness or heartbreak or tenderness or whatever he was feeling then you might have mentioned it later at a quieter time to some advantage the sharing of this moment might even have eventually been part of the bonding between you but you had to tap nick on the shoulder before the song was through before he even realized himself that he was tearful and break his precious communion with his inner self you were an interloper worse as so often happens he interpreted your smile as derision not sympathy and like a frightened turtle withdrew completely from the evening it was guaranteed that he would reject as insincere any subsequent overtures of friendship troy missed the interplay between carol and nick so he was quite surprised when he turned around and sat down after the final applause to find nicks shoulders set in an unmistakable pose of hostility wasnt she wonderful angel troy said to carol and how about you professor was this the first time you heard her sing nick nodded she was great he said almost grudgingly and i am thirsty can a man get a drink in this place troy was slightly offended well pardon us he said so sorry that the entertainment lasted so long he tried to signal for the waiter whats eating him angel he said conversationally to carol carol shrugged her shoulders then trying to lighten the atmosphere she leaned toward nick and tapped him on the forearm on top of the table hey nick she said have you been taking angry pills nick quickly withdrew his arm and grumbled something inaudible as a reply he turned away from the conversation and saw that angie was approaching the table he stood up automatically and both carol and troy joined him you were fantastic said carol a little too loud just as soon as angie was within earshot thanks hi replied angie as she walked up to the table and took the chair that troy had pulled out for her she spent a few moments graciously acknowledging the praise from people at the nearby tables then she sat down and smiled you must be carol dawson she said easily leaning across the table toward the reporter angie was even more beautiful in person than she had been in the picture on the disc jacket her coloring was a dark brown not quite black her makeup including the light pink lipstick was muted to permit her natural assets including virtually perfect white teeth on prominent display when she smiled to draw the attention but beyond the beauty was the woman herself no still photograph could do justice to the natural warmth that radiated from angie you liked her immediately and you must be nick williams angie said extending her hand to nick he was still standing looking uncomfortable and uncertain although troy had already seated himself troy has told me so many things about you in the past few days i feel as if were already friends he claims that youve read every novel ever written thats worth reading thats an exaggeration of course nick replied obviously pleased to be recognized he seemed to loosen up a little and finally sat down he started to add another comment but carol jumped into the conversation and cut him off did you write that beautiful song about the blind man yourself she asked before angie had really had time to sit down and collect herself it seemed to be a very personal statement yes angie answered carol pleasantly without a trace of irritation at carols aggressive behavior most of my material comes from other sources but occasionally i write a song myself when it is a very special subject for me she smiled briefly at troy before continuing my father is a remarkable loving man blind from birth but with an uncanny comprehension of the world at all levels without his patience and guidance i probably would never have had the courage to sing as a little girl i was too shy and selfconscious but my father convinced all of us when we were small that we were somehow special he told us that god had given each of us something unusual something uniquely ours and that one of the great joys of life was discovering and then developing that special talent and that song let me take care of you baby did you really write that for troy nick blurted out his question before angie had finished her sentence he thereby destroyed the soft mood created by angies loving description of her father nick was on the edge of his chair and for some reason seemed agitated and unsettled troy wondered again what he had missed in the interaction between carol and nick that had caused his friend to become so tense angie looked at troy i guess so she said with a wistful smile although it was originally meant to be a playful tune a light commentary on the game of love she stopped for a moment but it does talk about a real problem its very hard sometimes being a successful women it interferes amen amen carol interrupted while angie was still developing her thought this was one of carols favorite subjects and she was ready to pounce on the opportunity most men cannot deal with a woman who is the least bit successful much less in the spotlight she looked directly at nick and then continued even now in there are still unwritten rules that must be followed if you want to have a permanent relationship with a man there are three donts dont let him think youre smarter than he is dont suggest sex first and above all dont make more money than he does these are the three key areas where their egos are extremely fragile and if you undermine the ego of any man even when youre just kidding with him then it s a lost cause sounds like youre an expert nick replied sarcastically his hostility was obvious i wonder if it ever occurred to any of you liberated females that men are not put off by your success but rather by the way you handle it what you accomplish in life does not mean shit at the personal level most ambitious aggressive women i have met go out of their way to make malefemale relationships into some kind of competition they will not let the man even for a moment have the illusion that he lives in a patriarchal society i think some of them purposely emasculate there it is carol jumped in triumphantly she nudged angie who was smiling but still a little embarrassed at the rancor in this exchange thats the magic word whenever a woman wants to argue and not accept as gospel some profound male truth she is trying to castrate or emasculate okay you guys troy interjected firmly shaking his head thats enough lets change the subject i had thought that maybe you two could enjoy an evening together but not if were going to start this way the problem carol continued now looking at angie and ignoring troys request is that men are frightened their hegemony in the western world is threatened by the emergence of women who arent willing to be just barefoot and pregnant why when i was at stanford she stopped and turned when she heard the legs of a chair scraping across the roor with all due respect miss leatherwood nick was standing up again holding the chair in his hand i believe i will excuse myself i thoroughly enjoyed your music but i do not wish to subject you to any more bad manners i wish you continued good fortune in your career and i hope that someday you can spend some time on the boat with troy and me nick turned to troy ill see you at the marina at eight oclock in the morning finally he looked at carol you too if you still want to go you can tell us about the wimps at stanford while were out in the middle of the gulf nick did not wait for a reply he picked up the envelope and walked back through the crowd toward the exit as he was approaching the door he heard a voice calling him nick oh nick over here it was julianne waving to him from a nearby table full of glasses and ashtrays she and corinne and linda were surrounded by half a dozen men but julianne was moving them all around and pulling up an empty chair nick walked over to her table thirty minutes later nick was very drunk the combination of juliannes occasionally brushing his leg corinnes gigantic breasts and intermittent glimpses of carol through the cigarette smoke had made him very horny as well god damn it williams he had thought to himself when he first sat down with juliannes group you blew it again here you had this perfect chance to charm her maybe even score but half an hour later after the drinks his thoughts were more reminiscent of aesops fox shes too aggressive for me anyway famous pushy probably too hard underneath and cold in bed another ballbuster yet still he watched her from across the room the extra chairs that had been brought in for angies performance were cleared away to make room for dancing a disc jockey orchestrated the rest of the evening from a booth next to the stage one could dance to a variety of modern musical selections watch the outrageously overproduced music videos on the big screens or just talk for the music was not overwhelmingly loud most of the people around nick were from the marina during a break in the music just after nick had downed another fast tequila linda quinlan leaned across the table come on nick she said let us in on your secret what did you and troy find yesterday nothing special said nick remembering his agreement but surprised to discover that he did indeed want to talk about it rumor says different jumped in one of the men at the table everybody knows that you took something to amanda winchester this morning come on tell us what it was have you found a new treasure ship maybe said nick a drunken grin on his face just maybe another strong impulse pushed him to tell the story and show the pictures but he stopped himself i cant talk about it was all he would say at this moment two burly young men shorthaired navy types wearing officers uniforms were making a beeline for nicks table from the other side of the floor one of them was dark hispanic their approach was confident even arrogant and their arrival at the table stopped all the conversation the white lieutenant put his hand on juliannes shoulder all right gorgeous he said boldly the navy is here why dont you and your friend there come and dance with us julianne said no thank you very politely and smiled todd looked down at her he was weaving just a little and it was clear from his eyes that he had been drinking heavily you mean to tell me he said that you would prefer to sit here with these local geeks rather than dance with future admirals julianne felt his hand tighten on her shoulder she looked around the table and tried to ignore him todd did not like rejection he took his hand off juliannes shoulder and pointed at corinnes breasts christ ramirez you were right they are monsters wouldnt you like to snarf one of those the two lieutenants laughed crudely corinne squirmed selfconsciously linda quinlans steady boyfriend rose from his chair other than nick he was the only one of the men at the table who was approximately the same size as todd and ramirez look guys he said reasonably the lady said no very nicely there is no need to insult her or her friends listen to him ramirez todd interrupted this character said we insulted someone since when is admiring the size of someones cachungas an insult he chuckled to himself at his cleverness ramirez made a sign to leave but todd waved him off the drunken nick had been ready to explode all night get out of here asshole he said quietly but firmly he was still sitting down next to julianne who are you calling asshole cocksucker the truculent lieutenant todd replied he turned to ramirez i do believe that i am going to be forced to strum the head of this impertinent bastard but nick was ahead of him rising swiftly he uncoiled a vicious punch that struck todd full in the face and sent him tumbling backwards into another table covered with drinks todd and the table crashed to the floor and nick went after him ramirez pulled nick off his fellow officer and when nick turned and swung at him as well ramirez gave nick a push that caused his unsteady legs to give way nick fell back over julianne and another full table collapsed upon the floor from across the room carol and angie and troy could see the fracas and recognize nick in the middle of it uh oh troy said jumping up to go to his friends aid carol was right behind him when they reached the opposite side of the room both club bouncers were already on top of the action meanwhile nick and julianne were still trying to get unscrambled on the floor and todd was slowly rising to his feet in the fight the envelope of photos had been knocked free and a couple of them had fallen partially out ramirez had picked the envelope up off the floor and because of the bright colors was looking at the pictures the closeup of the brown missile in the fissure was clearly visible in the top photo hey he said to the shaken todd look at this what do you think this is all about carol acted instantly she walked past ramirez grabbed the envelope and pictures and before he could say anything she screamed not again nick no i dont believe it how could you be drunk again she knelt down beside nick on the floor and cradled his head in her free hand oh darling she said as he stared at her in complete disbelief you promised that youd stop the astonished crowd watched as carol kissed nick full on the mouth to prevent his saying anything troy was amazed troy she shouted a moment later while nick was trying to gather his wits troy where are you here give me a hand troy rushed up and helped nick to his feet were taking him home now she announced to the onlookers she and troy each took one arm and the three of them stumbled toward the door of the nightclub they passed the manager in the doorway carol told him that she would come by the next day to settle accounts she and troy half carried nick into the street as they walked away from sloppy joes carol turned around and saw that part of the crowd had followed them to the door ramirez and todd the latter still rubbing his cheek were standing in front of the group with puzzled expressions on their faces where are we taking him angel troy asked when they were out of earshot we dont even know where he parked his car it doesnt matter carol replied just as long as we are out of sight of the club the awkward threesome turned right down the same alley that ran behind the theater where the night of the iguana had finished an hour before just past the theater there was a small vacant lot on the left carol stopped the trio at the edge of the lot opposite a grove of trees and looked back to make certain they were not being followed she heaved a sigh and loosened her grip on nick she unconsciously fanned her sweating face with the envelope she had recovered from ramirez nick was now almost coherent i had no idea he mumbled to carol pulling his arm free from troy and trying to embrace her that you felt that way about me i dont carol said emphatically she pushed his arms away and backpedaled toward the vacant lot nick didnt understand and continued his approach stop she shouted angrily at him stop you drunken bastard she tried to fend off his advance with her hands but he kept coming just before troy moved up to restrain him carol slapped nick hard in the face with the hand that was not holding the envelope momentarily startled nick lost his footing and fell into the grass on his stomach still fuming carol bent down beside him and forcefully rolled him over on his back dont you ever ever use physical force with me she shouted at nick not under any circumstances she dropped the envelope on nicks stomach and stood up quickly she looked at troy shook her head in disgust and stalked off down the alley assembly and test under the scanning electron microscope they look like tightly coiled springs with a small tail when they are placed in water or some other liquid the springs seem to stretch out and cilialike appendages extend a few angstroms out from the tail to provide motility there are millions of them concentrated in a mixture the size of a tiny drop of water and they are being carefully checked by a laser device that is also counting and sorting them as it illuminates microscopic portions of the mixture when the count is completed the smaller division of the separated mixture is sluiced out of the metal receptacle and down a channel into another liquid this one emerald green in color that is contained in a bottleshaped beaker the springs spread out and follow random paths in wandering around the beaker external mechanisms regularly churn the emerald green liquid around the inside of the beaker tiny sensors register the temperature pressure and exact chemical and electrical characteristics of the fluid some parameter is not absolutely perfect a small valve opens a port in the base of the beaker and a new chemical is injected into the green solution continuous measurements monitor the diffusion of this additional material at length the fluid is properly altered and a new equilibrium is reached everything is now ready from above several thousand small pellets are dropped into the container some of these pellets float on the surface but most sink to variable depths in the liquid embedded in each of the pellets is a complicated engineering construction on an amazingly miniaturized scale the external surface of the pellets contains sensors that scan the nearby region of the liquid for the springlike objects a highfrequency transmitter housed next to the sensors directs a call to the springs and attracts them to the neighborhood clusters of springs develop around each pellet now one at a time these springs are harvested by small instruments inside the spongy outer section of the pellet and then loaded in carriers that are electrically fired toward the central cavity of the pellet within that cavity sits a single black amorphous spot its exterior constantly changing shape as its opaque material shifts around to follow unknown stimuli this spot is surrounded by a yellow goo that fills the remainder of the cavity the first spring slips out of its carrier then locates and penetrates the spot the spring can be seen for an instant moving toward the center however it is broken up and destroyed within milliseconds other springs are fired into the cavity at regular intervals and all try after penetration to reach some special region in the spot finally one of the procession succeeds and the spot changes color to bright red in rapid succession some enzyme in the spongy outer section of the pellet is dumped into the yellow goo turning its color a little toward green and all the rest of the springs disappear apparently absorbed by the pellet structure the entire pellet itself next elongates and extends a miniature propulsion system into the emerald liquid after carefully steering around the many hazards it then joins the queue of fertilized pellets moving one by one through a round diaphanous membrane in the bottom of the beaker the fluid dense with pellets speeds along a narrow tube until it reaches a partially closed container approximately the size of the beaker inside this translucent jar a mechanical spoonlike object digs into the stream of liquid flowing through and plucks out the pellets they are lifted up and then suspended momentarily around the passing fluid in a heavy gas enclosed by the jar within moments each of the pellets splits and their carapaces apparently dissolve leaving visible inside the jar an array of the little red spots surrounded by the offyellow goo and suspended in an invisible gas the goo extends itself slowly throughout the jar above the flowing fluid until all the open areas between the red spots are filled when the emerald stream below drops to a trickle and then disappears altogether the goo hardens into a gelatin and fills the ports where the fluid once entered and departed within the jar are several thousand red spots embedded in the yellowgreen gelatin the spots undergo no visible change throughout this process time passes activity in the jar ceases occasionally mechanical probes to test the stability of the gelatin are inserted into the jar at the old fluid ports at last the translucent jar is removed from its storage location by what looks like a robotic forklift it is placed on a moving belt that now carries it along with several dozen other jars containing different kinds of objects also suspended in yellowgreen gelatin to a vast circular oven almost an inch in diameter here all the jars are carefully baked together inside the oven the molecules of the jar material immediately evaporate next a pair of disembodied manipulator hands wrap an incredibly thin blanket of connective filaments around all the gelatinous structures after some time this ensemble unit is then pulled automatically out of the oven and packaged inside a gold metallic envelope whose several layers are designed to provide all the remaining environmental protection the hypergolic propellants mix and burst instantly into flame pouring fire out the rocket nozzle the slender vehicle rises slowly at first but later with astonishing speed before reaching the zenith of its flight the rocket stage underneath the strange paraboloid payload falls away and tiny motors ignite on the underside of the flying boomerang at the apex of the trajectory the entire package suddenly explodes and apparently disintegrates hundreds of pieces of the original payload fall toward the surface of the planet in seemingly random directions closer inspection reveals that each individual piece resulting from the explosion is made of a gold metallic material encased in plastic a small sensorpropulsion package is attached to the plastic it supplies needed vernier corrections during the descent after the controlled explosion the plastic debris falls upon a strange hybrid planet obviously artificial judging by the wide variety of incongruous surfaces and cloud groupings that can be recognized from an altitude of tens of miles there are scattered liquid lakes of different hues plus discontinuous surface topography with regions of desert and grasslands as well as barren mountains and canyons a connected quarter of the planet is covered with clouds the clouds are here white and fleecy there brown and thick some of the clouds are active building and changing with hints of turbulence other parts of the cloudy region are static small wisps of white stretching without change across the sky one of the plastic vehicles plunges through a misty blue cloudbank into an emerald sea the plastic is left on the surface but the encased gold metallic object sinks thirty feet to the floor of the ocean for a day or two there is no discernible change in its appearance then a protrusion begins to form in its north polar region on the top of the golden sphere as it sits on the ocean floor the growth expands slowly until the spherical shape appears to have a large carbuncle on its top a metamorphosis now takes place on the outside of the protrusion the hard metal surface softens and begins to resemble an organic membrane although the membrane is thick and dense it occasionally bulges suggesting some motion on the other side of its golden barrier eventually a thin black rod a probe of some kind thrusts through the surface into the emerald ocean a second probe becomes visible then a third both long black rods like the first one but each equipped with strikingly different apparatus scattered along the length of the rod something larger pushes against the membrane once twice then finally breaking through what a strange contraption its an aerodynamic shape about three inches long in two separate segments with a joint between them the forebody is a nosecone the afterbody is long and slender and tapers to a point in addition to the three probes on the front of its forebody it has four other furlable appendages or arms two connected to the side of each segment it swims over to a nearby underwater plant with its arms stored next to its smooth body there it unfurls the multifaceted appendages and begins to examine the plant an astonishing array of tiny instruments studies the plant for a few moments and then the entity moves away the same procedure is repeated with each plant encountered eventually the thing finds a plant that it likes and its pincers remove a major leaf the leaf is neatly folded into a smaller volume and is then carried back to the object with the golden membrane the strange forager is joined by a partner a carbon copy of itself and by two fat fish with multiple arms and legs the latter pair scuttle off to the side and begin modifying the ocean floor days pass the things with the probes work ceaselessly bringing more and more varieties of plant and animal life back to the home base the legged fish meanwhile have constructed out of available sand rocks shells and living creatures almost a thousand tiny sealed rectangular homes on the ocean floor these fish entities too work without break their next task is to transport each of the red spots one at a time from the golden cradle to their new houses if a microscope were available it would show that some structure was already developing inside the red spots giving them definition and distinction by the time of their initial transport but they are still very very small once the red spots and their gelatin protection are carefully implanted inside their tiny houses the foragers make routine stops on each trip to deposit a portion of their harvest at the same time the fish with legs the architects and builders of the rectangular houses begin working on transparent igloolike homes for the embryos of another species a year later moonlight falls on the emerald lake several hundred eager excited wriggling necks some royal blue and some pale blue struggle upward to find the moon their heads pivot to face all directions and maybe two dozen separate indentations and orifices can be seen in each face the necks crane this way then that way the silent serpents are searching for something from the direction of the moon a bizarre ship approaches on the water it is large compared to the young serpents its twin towers standing about eight feet out of the water and about six feet above on the average a squarish platform fifteen feet on a side that forms the bottom of the boat the top surface of this platform is irregular undulating and cratered the platform floats smoothly upon the water the ship comes into the middle of the serpents and stops the serpents divide into two groups according to the color of their necks and then line up on either side of the ship in very orderly rows and columns a single musical note a bflat with a hautish timbre comes from the ship quickly the note is repeated up and down the rows and columns by each of the serpents on the two sides of the boat then a second note issues forth from the ship also sounding like a flute and the process repeats itself for hours the music lesson continues covering a range of both notes and chords until some of the serpents on each side lose their voices the exercise concludes with an attempted ensemble performance by the royal bluenecked serpents but the result is a painful cacophony inside the ship every note every movement every response by the juvenile serpents to the music lesson is carefully monitored and recorded the ingenious engineering design of the boat is based upon the key controlling elements of the original cradle however although segments of gold metallic material appear in the computer that runs the ship the primary constituents of its mass are derived from great quantities of local rock and organic matter taken from the floor of the emerald lake the ship is the quintessential music teacher a virtually perfect synthesizer equipped with microprocessors that not only store all the responses of the pupils but also contain software that will allow experimentation with a range of individualized methods of teaching but this sophisticated robot engineered by the artificialintelligence packed around the serpent zygotes and made almost entirely of chemical compounds extracted from material found in the neighborhood of the landing point is itself being watched and studied from afar by test engineers the current test is in its earliest stages and is progressing splendidly this is the third different configuration tried for the music teacher the hardest part of the design of the cradle that will carry the serpent zygotes back to canthor the first was an abysmal failure the embryos developed into adolescents all right but the teacher was never able to instruct them well enough that they could sing the mating song and reproduce the second design was better it was able to teach the serpents to perform the courtship symphony and a new generation of the species was produced however this next group of adult serpents was not able subsequently to teach their progeny to sing the best of the bioengineering personnel in the colony were brought in to study this problem after pouring over quadrillions of bits of accumulated data associated with the development of the serpents and other related species they found a curious correlation between the degree of nurturing provided by the parent and the resulting ability of that infant upon reaching maturity to teach its own offspring the artificial intelligence package responsible for the first six months of serpent life was then redesigned to include a surrogate mother whose only purpose was to hold and cuddle the fledgling serpents at regular intervals subsystem tests proved successful this slight alteration of the early nurturing protocol produced adult serpents that were able to teach their children to sing this demonstration test lasts for more than four millcycles at the end of the period the test is declared an unqualified success a strong creative serpent population nearing twentyfive thousand fills the artificial lake limitations to future growth are only test related eventually the test survivors are transported to another locale in the zoo complex and the canthorean serpents are added to the list of species ready for zygote repatriation saturday the full moon rises over the placid ocean troy stares at the moonbeams watching them shimmer on the quiet water angie appears and stands in the water in front of him she is wearing a skintight white bathing suit one piece and is submerged from the waist down she beckons to him and he walks across the damp sand toward the water he is barefoot and is also wearing a white bathing suit the water is surprisingly warm angie begins to sing her magnificent voice enfolds him as troy draws nearer to her in the light surf they touch and kiss she pulls away and gives him a smile of encouragement troy feels himself becoming aroused suddenly a siren pierces the air destroying the calm of the night instantly the sea becomes choppy agitated full of whitecaps troy turns around alarmed and glances at the shore he sees nothing special he looks back at the ocean angie has disappeared out in the distance near the horizon troy thinks he sees the beginning of a tidal wave the siren shrieks again and troy sees a large shapeless mass riding a nearby wave in the moonlight he goes toward the object the tidal wave is now defined in the distance filling half his dream screen the bulky object nearby is a black body dressed in a red muscle shirt and bluejeans the siren grows louder troy rolls the body over and looks at the face it is his brother jamie troy jefferson bolted upright in bed his heart pounding furiously his mind making the transition from the dream world to reality outside his duplex apartment a siren raged he could tell from the frequency change that the police car or ambulance had just sped past his front door he shook himself and crawled out of bed the digital clock on the end table read troy walked to the kitchen he went to the refrigerator and poured himself a glass of grapefruit juice he listened to the siren in the distance until it faded away altogether then he started back to the small second bedroom where he slept in the hallway he was stopped by the sound of another siren this one even louder that seemed to be coming toward him for a few seconds he thought the siren was just outside his front door and he recalled vividly another siren in the middle of another night his heart began to pound anew jamie troy said to himself almost involuntarily jamie why did you have to die troy could still see the events of that evening with perfect clarity nothing in the first tableau had faded even a little the beginning memory was the three of them jamie troy and their mother sitting silently at the dinner table eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes jamie had just arrived home from gainesville for spring break that afternoon and had spent almost an hour before they had sat down to eat regaling his fifteenyearold brother with stories of football and university life jamie had been troys idol throughout his childhood handsome intelligent and articulate jamie had also been blessed with incredible physical gifts as a result he had been the starting halfback for the florida gators in his sophomore year and was being touted as a potential allamerican for the following season troy had bitterly missed jamie when he had first gone away to the university but in the intervening eighteen months he had learned to accept his absence and to look forward to his brothers holiday visits so bro jamie had said with a smile when he finished his dinner and pushed his plate away what about you youve finished another quarter already did you make the grades of a future astronaut i did okay troy had replied hiding his pride i made a b plus in social studies because my teacher thought i had taken an antiamerican position in my paper on the panama canal i guess an occasional b plus is acceptable jamie had laughed his affection for his younger brother clearly showing but i bet burford didnt make many bs when he was in the ninth grade whenever troy recalled the fateful evening that his brother was killed he always remembered the mention of guion burford the first american black astronaut most of the time his memory because it was so painful to proceed immediately to the terrible recollection of his dying brother in his arms would choose to digress to a happier time to a remembrance of his brother jamie that was almost as vivid as the death scene but was happy and reinforcing instead of being gut wrenching and depressing during the summer before his death on a hot humid day in late august jamie jefferson had arranged a third personal meeting with his football coach at florida to request permission to skip practice for two days he wanted to take his little brother troy to see the launch of the space shuttle in the first two meetings the coach had vigorously opposed jamies taking the time away from the important workouts but he had stopped short of denying the request you still dont understand coach jamie had said firmly at the start of their third and final meeting on the subject my little brother has no father and hes a genius at math and science he blows the top off those standardized aptitude tests he needs a role model he needs to know that blacks can do something significant other than sports the coach had eventually relented and given jamie permission but only because he had figured out that jamie was going to go under any circumstances jamie had driven his battered chevrolet nonstop across florida picked up his brother in miami and continued northward without sleeping for another four hours to cocoa beach they had arrived in the middle of the night jamie by now exhausted parked the car in a beach access zone next to a sevenstory condominium along the nicest part of the beach all right little brother he had said now get some sleep but troy had not been able to sleep he had been too excited thinking about the launch scheduled the next evening the eighth shuttle launch in all the first one that had ever occurred at night he had been reading everything he could find about astronaut burford and the plans for the mission he kept imagining that it was the future and that he troy jefferson was an astronaut about to be launched into space after all burford was living proof that it could indeed be done that a black american could attain the upper echelons of society and become a popular hero on the basis of his intelligence personality and hard work at sunrise troy had crawled out of the car and walked the few yards to the beach it was very quiet troys company was limited to a few walkers and joggers plus a couple of those bizarre sand crabs whose eyes wavered back and forth at the end of peculiar stalks as they raced sideways into their holes in the sand to the north troy could see some of the launch pads for the unmanned rockets at cape canaveral air force base but in his minds eye he saw them as the launching apparatus for the shuttle he wondered what astronaut burford was doing at that very moment what was he eating for breakfast was he with his family or with the astronaut crew jamie had awakened around noon and the brothers had spent the early afternoon on the beach together laughing and playing in the surf then they picked up some hamburgers and drove the final half hour to the kennedy space center jamie had strongarmed an avid gator booster an aerospace executive who lived in melbourne for tickets to the vip viewing area they arrived there just before nightfall four miles away the impressive shuttle launch configuration consisting of the orbiter mounted on top of an orange external tank with two solid rocket boosters on the side stood erect against its launching tower as the final countdown began no observing experience in troys life would ever come close to rivaling his watching the space shuttle blast off that night as he listened to the countdown being announced over the loudspeakers in the vip area he was eager and anticipant but not yet in awe the moment the engines ignited however filling the florida night with reddishorange flame and thick white clouds of billowing smoke troys eyes nearly popped out of his head but it was the combination of his seeing the giant spaceship slowly and majestically lifting itself into the heavens riding a long slender flame and his hearing the astonishing sound a constant roar punctuated with unexplained pops that really caused the goose bumps to break out on his skin the tears to come to his eyes and the tingle to spread through his body troys intense emotional excitement lasted well over a minute he stood beside his brother jamie tightly holding his hand his back arched as he strained to follow the flame rising higher and higher and then finally disappearing in the night sky above him after the launch they slept again in the car jamie then dropped troy at the bus station in orlando and headed back to gainesville for football practice young troy felt that he was a new person that he had been transformed by his experience in the week that followed he obsessively followed the flight burford became his hero his new idol during the first two quarters of the following year he applied himself avidly to his schoolwork he had a goal he was going to be an astronaut little did troy know that on a march night only seven months later he would have another experience this one devastating and deeply disturbing that would completely overshadow the thrill he had felt at the shuttle launch on that later march evening his brother jamie would stop by his room before leaving the house around eight oclock im going over to marias bro jamie would say well probably take in a movie maria alvarez was eighteen and still a senior in high school she had been jamies steady girl for a couple of years she lived in little havana together with her cuban family and eight siblings troy had given his brother a hug im glad youre here jamie there are so many things that i want to show you i made you a set of headphones in school i want to see everything his brother had interrupted him but tomorrow first thing in the morning now dont stay up too late astronauts need plenty of sleep so they can be alert jamie had smiled and walked out of troys room it was the last thing troy would ever hear him say troy never could remember what he had heard first when he had awakened in the middle of that night his mothers wild wail had mixed with the screech of the nearby sirens to create an imbroglio of sound that was unforgettable and terrifying troy had raced to the door and into the front yard wearing only his pajama bottoms the sound of the ambulance siren was drawing closer his mother was at the end of the short walkway in front of the house bending down over a dark body spread partly in the street in front of jamies chevrolet and partly in their yard three policemen and half a dozen curious bystanders were huddled around his distraught mother somehow he heard one of the policemen say as troy in a panic tried to figure out what was happening he managed to drive home its incredible after all the blood he lost he must have been hit four times in the stomach his mothers cry intensified again and at that moment troy put all the pieces together and recognized the body lying on its back a chill went through him he gasped and then troy fell on his knees beside his brothers head jamie was struggling for breath his eyes were open but they did not seem to be focusing on anything troy cradled jamies head in his hands he looked down at his brothers stomach his red shirt was awash in blood that seemed to be flowing in a continuous stream from an area just above the genitals blood was on jamies jeans on the ground everywhere troy felt himself gag then retch involuntarily nothing came up hot tears filled his eyes we think it was a gang shooting mrs jefferson the policeman droned on probably some kind of a mistake everybody knows that jamie wasnt mixed up with that kind of crowd reporters had arrived lights were flashing from cameras more sirens approached jamies eyes went blank there was no sign of breathing troy pulled his brothers head to his chest he instinctively knew that jamie was dead he began to sob uncontrollably no he mumbled no not my brother not jamie he never hurt anybody someone tried to comfort him to pat him on the shoulder troy shrugged them off violently leave me alone he shouted between sobs he was my brother he was my only brother after a couple of moments troy tenderly placed jamies head back down on the ground he then collapsed in total despair beside him at almost threethirty in the morning some ten years later in march of troy jefferson would be at home alone in his duplex awake with the memory of that terrible moment when jamie had died he would feel a new the heartbreak of that loss and he would realize again very clearly that most of his adolescent dreams had died with his brother that he had forsaken his dreams of college and being an astronaut because they were inextricably coupled with his memory of jamie somehow he had stumbled through high school in the three years that had followed jamies death but it had taken the combined efforts of his mother and the school and the city authorities to keep troy from abandoning school altogether then as soon as he had graduated he had left miami or rather ran away away from what had happened and what might have been for over two years he then wandered in a desultory manner throughout north america a young solitary black man bereft of love and friendship looking for something to overcome the feeling of emptiness that was his constant companion so i finally came to key west troy would think years later as he settled back in his bed in the middle of the morning for a couple more hours of sleep and for some reason made myself a home maybe it was just time or maybe i had learned enough to know that life goes on but somehow although the wound has never healed i got past jamie and found the lost troy or so i hope the dream that had been interrupted by the siren suddenly came back into his mind angie was beautiful in the moonlight in her white bathing suit and now for some unfinished business troy laughed to himself concentrating on the image of angie as he returned to sleep good morning angel troy said with a grand smile as carol approached the florida queen ready to do some fishing he hopped out of the boat and shouted at nick who was around at the back on the other side of the canopy shes here professor he hollered im going out to the parking lot to get her stuff carol gave troy the keys to her car and he took off in the direction of the marina office carol paced for a few moments on the jetty before nick emerged from behind the canopy come on down on the boat he said scowling a little as he wiped some heavy dredging chain with a dark cloth nick felt terrible he had a nasty hangover and he was still bothered by the events of the night before carol didnt say anything at first nick stopped cleaning the chain and waited for her to speak i dont know exactly how to say this she began in a firm but pleasant voice but its important to me that i say it before i get on the boat carol cleared her throat nick she said deliberately i dont want to dive with you today i want to dive with troy nick gave her a quizzical look he was standing in the sun and his head was aching but troy he began i know what youre going to say she interrupted him he doesnt have much experience and it could be a dangerous dive she stared directly at nick that doesnt matter to me i have enough diving experience for both of us i prefer to dive with troy she waited a few seconds now if youre not willing this time it was nick who interrupted carol all right all right he said turning away he was surprised to find that he was both hurt and angry this woman is still pissed he said to himself and i thought maybe nick walked away from carol and went back on the other side of the canopy to finish preparing the small rented salvage crane he and troy had installed the night before since they had used this old equipment several times on other excursions the installation had been straight forward and without major problems carol climbed onto the boat and put her copy of the photos on top of the counter next to the steering wheel wheres the trident she called to nick i thought id take another look at it this morning bottom left drawer under the nav equipment was his swift and sharp reply she took the gray bag out of the drawer opened it and pulled out the golden trident she held it by the long middle rod it felt funny for some reason carol put the object back in the bag and pulled it out a second time again she held the heavy trident in her hands it still didnt feel right carol remembered grasping the rod underneath the overhang in the water and wrapping her hand slowly around the central rod thats it she said to herself its thicker she turned the object over in her hands whats the matter with me she thought have i lost my mind how could it he thicker she examined it one more time with great care this time she thought that the individual tines of the fork had lengthened and that she could detect a perceptible increase in the overall weight good grief can this be possible she wondered carol pulled out the photos she had brought along all the images of the trident that she had with her had been taken underwater but she was certain that she could discern two subtle changes since it was first photographed the axis rod did appear to be thicker and the tines of the fork did indeed look longer nick she said in a loud voice nick can you come here im right in the middle of something an unfriendly voice responded from the other side of the canopy is it important no i mean yes carol answered but it can wait until your first available moment carols mind was racing there are only two possibilities she said to herself with logical precision either it has changed or it hasnt if it hasnt changed then i must be spooked for it definitely seems thicker but how could it change either on its own or someone changed it but who nick but how could he nick came up to her yes he said in a distant almost hostile tone he was obviously annoyed carol handed him the trident well she said smiling and looking at him expectantly well what he answered totally confused by what was happening and still angry about the earlier interaction can you tell the difference carol continued nodding at the trident in his hand nick turned it upside down as she had done the sunlight glinted off the golden surface and hurt his eyes he squinted then he switched the object from hand to hand and looked at it from many different angles i think im lost nick said at length are you trying to tell me that theres some change in this thing he held it out between them yes she said cant you feel it the central rods thicker than it was on thursday and the tines or individual elements of that fork on one end are a little longer and dont you think the whole thing is heavier nicks headache continued to throb he looked back and forth between the trident and carol as far as he could tell the object had not changed no i dont he said it seems the same to me youre just being difficult carol persisted grabbing the trident back here look at the pictures check out the length of the fork there compared to the overall rod and then look at it now its different there was something in carols general attitude that really irritated nick she always seemed to assume that she was right and everyone else was wrong this is absurd nick nearly shouted in reply and i have a lot of work to do he paused for a moment and then continued how the hell could it change its a metal object for christs sake what do you think that somehow it grew shit he shook his head and started to walk away after a couple of steps he turned around you cant trust the pictures anyway he said in more measured tones underwater photos always distort the objects troy was approaching with both the cart and carols equipment he could tell from the body positions even without hearing the words that his two boatmates were at it again my my he said as he walked up i cant leave you two alone for a minute what are you fighting about this morning professor this supposedly intelligent reporter friend of yours nick replied looking at carol and speaking in a patronizing manner insists that our trident has changed shape overnight i guess although she has not yet begun to explain how will you please since she wont believe me explain to her about the index of refraction or whatever it is that fouls up underwater pictures carol appealed to troy but it has changed honest i remember clearly what it felt like at first and now it feels different troy was unloading the cart and putting the ocean telescope system on the florida queen angel troy said stopping to check the trident that she was extending toward him with both hands i cant tell whether it has changed or not but i can tell you one thing you were very excited when you found it the first time and you were also underwater with that combination i wouldnt trust my own memory of how something felt carol looked at the two men she was going to pursue the discussion but nick abruptly changed the subject did you know mr jefferson that our client miss dawson has requested your services as a diving partner today she doesnt want to dive with me his tone was now acerbic troy looked at carol with surprise thats real nice angel he said quietly but nick is really the expert im just a little more than a beginner i know that carol responded brusquely still chafing from the outcome of the previous conversation but i want to dive with someone i can trust someone who behaves responsibly i know enough about diving for both of us nick gave carol an angry look and then turned and walked away he was pissed come on jefferson he said ive already agreed to let miss high and mighty have her way this time lets get the boat ready and finish setting up that telescope thing of hers again my father finally divorced my mother when i was ten carol was saying to troy they were sitting together in the deck chairs at the front of the boat after they had gone over the procedures for the dive a couple of times carol had mentioned something about her first boating experience a birthday on a fishing boat with her father when she was six and the two of them had moved comfortably into a discussion of their childhood the breakup was awful she handed the can of coke back to troy i think you might have been luckier in some ways never to have known your father i doubt it troy replied seriously from my earliest days i resented the fact that some of the kids had two parents my brother jamie tried to help of course but there was only so much he could do i purposely chose friends who had fathers living at home he laughed i remember one dark black kid named willie adams his dad was at home all right but he was an embarrassment to the family he was an older man nearing sixty at the time and he didnt work he just sat on the front porch in his rocking chair all day and drank beer whenever i went over to willies house to play i would always find some excuse to spend a little time on the porch sitting next to mr adams willie would fidget uncomfortably unable to understand why i wanted to listen to his father tell his old supposedly boring stories mr adams had been in the korean war and he loved to tell about his friends and the battles and particularly the korean women and what he called their tricks anyway you could always tell when mr adams was about to start one of his stories his eyes would begin to stare in front of him as if he were looking intently at something far off in the distance and he would say as much to himself as anybody tell the truth baby ruth then he would recite the story almost as if he were quoting from a written book we had driven the north koreans back to the yalu and our battalion commander told us they were ready to surrender he would say we were feeling good talking about what we were all going to do when we got back to the states but then the great yellow horde poured out of china troy stopped he stared out at the ocean it was easy for carol to see him as a young boy sitting on a porch with his embarrassed friend willie and listening to stories told by a man who lived hopelessly in the past but who nevertheless represented the father that troy had never had she leaned over to troy and touched his forearm it makes a pretty picture she said you probably never knew how happy you made that man by listening to his stories around on the other side of the canopy nick williams was sitting by himself in another deck chair he was reading madame bovary and trying without success to ignore both his residual hangover and the scattered tidbits of conversation he was overhearing he had programmed the navigation system to return automatically to the dive site from thursday so there was nothing else he really needed to do to pilot the boat nick almost certainly would have enjoyed sharing the conversation with carol and troy but after his earlier confrontation with her in which he felt she had made it clear that she didnt want to associate with him he was not about to join them it was now necessary that he ignore her otherwise she would conclude that he was just another wimp and besides he liked his book he was reading the part where emma bovary gives herself over completely to the affair with rudolph boulanger nick could see emma sneaking away from her house in the small french provincial village and racing across the fields into the arms of her lover most of the time in the past whenever nick had read a novel about a beautiful dark heroine he had pictured monique but interestingly enough the emma bovary that he was envisioning while he was reading on the boat was carol dawson and more than once that morning when nick had read flauberts descriptions of the passions of emma and rudolph he had imagined himself in the role of the bachelor from the french landed gentry making love to emmacarol the automatic navigation system that guided the boat while nick was reading consisted of a simple transmitterreceiver combination and a small miniprocessor taking advantage of a worldwide set of synchronous satellites software in the processor established the boats location very precisely and then followed a preprogrammed steering algorithm to the desired final site along the way the twoway link with the satellite overhead provided the necessary information to up date the path through the ocean when the florida queen was within a mile of the dive site the nav system sounded a tone nick then went to the controls and changed to manual guidance carol and troy rose from their chairs remember she said the primary purpose of our dive is to photograph and salvage whatever it was that we saw down in that fissure on thursday if we have enough time afterward we will go back to the overhang where we found the trident carol walked over and switched on the monitor attached to the ocean telescope she was standing only a few feet away from nick they had not exchanged any words since right after the boat left key west good luck he said quietly she looked at him to see whether he was serious or was being sarcastic she couldnt tell thank you she said evenly troy joined carol at the monitor she pulled the photographs out of the envelope so they could be used to define the exact spot to anchor for a couple of minutes she issued instructions to nick based on what she was seeing from the telescope commanding small corrections to the boats position at last the ocean floor underneath them looked almost exactly as it had on thursday when they had seen the whales with one major difference now wheres that hole in the reef troy said innocently i dont seem to be able to find it on the monitor carols heart was speeding as she glanced back and forth from the telescope screen to the photographs where is that fissure she thought it cant have disappeared the boat drifted away from the dive site and nick steered it back this time troy dropped the anchor overboard but carol still could not see any sign of the fissure she could not understand it nick she said finally could you give us a hand we were down there together and we both saw the hole are troy and i just confused in some way nick came over from the steering wheel under the canopy and stared into the monitor he too was puzzled but he thought he saw other things on the bottom of the ocean that also looked a little different i dont see the hole either he said but maybe its just the lighting we were here in the afternoon last time and now its ten in the morning troy turned to carol maybe nick ought to dive with you he was there before has seen the fissure and knows how to find the overhang everything i know is from the pictures no said carol quickly i want to dive with you nicks probably right we just cant see the fissure because of the different lighting she picked up her underwater camera and walked around the canopy toward the back of the boat lets get going she said well do just fine troy gave nick a silent shrug as if to say i tried and followed her a few moments later but richard ramirez said we could get into big trouble i dont see how lieutenant todd replied or why anybody ever has to know the navy built the system after all primarily for its own ships we just allow everyone else to use it all we have to do is interrogate the master register and get the doppler and ranging time history for their particular identification code then we can figure out where they are its easy we do it all the time for our own vessels but we signed a maritime convention restricting our access to the private registers except in lifeordeath or national security cases ramirez continued i cant just tap into the satellite files because you and i suspect a certain boat of being on an illegal mission we need more authority look roberto todd argued vehemently who do you think is going to give us permission we dont have the photographs we only have your word for it no we must act on our own if were wrong then nobody ever has to know about it if were right well nail that bastard well both be heroes and nobody will give us a hard time about what weve done ramirez was silent for a few seconds dont you at least think we should inform commander winters he is after all the officer in charge of this panther investigation absolutely not said lieutenant todd quickly you heard him at the meeting yesterday he thinks were out of line already hed like nothing better than to shit all over us hes jealous todd saw that ramirez was still undecided ill tell you what he said well call him after we find out where the vessel is lieutenant ramirez shook his head that wont make any difference we still will have exceeded our authority shit said todd in exasperation tell me what has to be done and ill do it without you ill take all the risk he stopped and looked directly at ramirez i cant fucking understand it i guess you mexicans really are gutless youre the one who actually saw the missile in the photograph but ramirezs eyes narrowed his voice became hard thats enough todd well get the data but if this turns out to be a disaster i will personally break your neck with my own hands i knew youd see it my way lieutenant todd replied smiling as he followed ramirez to a command console commander winters put the extra sixpack of coke on the top of the ice and then closed the cooler anything else he shouted out the door at his wife and son before i haul this thing out to the car no sir was the reply from the driveway the commander picked up the cooler and carried it through the screen door whew he said as he loaded it in the open trunk of the car you have enough food and drink in here for a dozen people i wish you were coming sir said hap most of the rest of the fathers will be there i know i know answered winters but your mothers going and i need to do some private rehearsing for tonight he gave his son a brief hug besides hap weve talked about this before lately i havent felt comfortable at organized church activities i believe that religion is between god and the individual you havent always felt that way betty interjected from the other side of the car in fact you used to love church picnics youd play softball and swim and we would laugh all evening there was just a trace of bitterness in her voice come on hap she said after a momentary pause we dont want to be late thank your father for helping us pack thanks dad hap climbed into the car and winters closed the door behind him they waved to each other as the pontiac backed out of the driveway into the street as they drove away winters mused to himself i must spend more time with him he needs me now if i dont it will soon be too late he turned around and walked back into the house at the refrigerator he stopped and opened the door he poured himself a glass of orange juice while he was drinking it he looked idly around the kitchen already betty had cleaned up the breakfast dishes and put them in the dishwasher the counters were scrubbed the morning paper was neatly folded on the breakfast table the kitchen was tidy orderly like his wife she abhorred messes of all kinds winters remembered one morning back when hap was still in diapers and they were living in norfolk virginia the little boy had been exuberantly pounding the kitchen table and suddenly his arms had flailed out knocking bettys cup of coffee and the creamer onto the floor they both broke and made quite a mess all over the kitchen betty had stopped her meal abruptly by the time she had returned to her cold scrambled eggs there was not the slightest indication anywhere not on the floors the lower cupboard or even in the wastebasket that there had been an accident just to the right of the refrigerator in the winterses kitchen hanging on the wall there was a small plaque with simple lettering for god so loved the world it said that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believe in him shall have everlasting life john vernon winters saw this kitchen plaque every day but he had not actually read the words for months maybe even years on this particular saturday morning he read them and was moved he thought about bettys god a god very similar to the one he had worshipped in his childhood and adolescence in indiana a quiet calm wise old man who sat up in heaven somewhere watching everything knowing everything waiting to receive and answer our prayers it was such a simple beautiful image our father who art in heaven he said recalling the hundreds maybe thousands of times that he had prayed in church hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven and what is thy will for me old man winters thought a little taken aback by his own irreverence for eight years you have let me drift ignored me tested me like job or maybe punished me he walked over to the kitchen table and sat down he took another sip from his orange juice but have i been forgiven i dont yet know never once in all that time have you given me a definite sign despite my prayers and my tears one time he thought right after libya i wondered if maybe he remembered being half asleep on the beach lying on his back with his eyes closed on a big comfortable towel in the distance he could hear the surf and childrens voices occasionally he could even distinguish haps voice or bettys the summer sun was warm relaxing a light began to dart about on the inside of his eyelids winters opened his eyes he couldnt see much because the sunlight was too bright and there was also a glare a metal glint of some kind in his eyes he shaded his forehead with his hand a little girl with long hair a year old perhaps was standing just above him staring at him the glint was coming from the long metal comb in her hair winters closed his eyes and opened them again now he could see her better she had shifted her head just a little so the glare was gone but she was still staring fixedly at him with absolutely no expression on her face she was wearing only diapers he could tell that she was foreign arab perhaps he had thought at the time looking back into her deep brown almondshaped eyes she didnt move or say anything she just watched him curious relentless without seeming to notice anything that he did hello winters said quietly who are you the little arab girl gave no sign that she had heard anything after a few seconds however she suddenly pointed her finger at him and her face looked angry winters shuddered and sat up abruptly his quick action frightened her and she began to cry he reached for her but she pulled away slipped lost her balance and fell on the sand her head hit something sharp when she fell and blood started running down her scalp and onto her shoulder terrified first by the fall and then by the sight of her own blood the little girl began to wail winters hovered over her struggling with his own panic as he watched the blood splatter the sand something unrecognized flashed through his mind and he decided to pick the little arab girl up to comfort her she fought him violently with the reckless abandon and surprising strength of the toddler and struggled free she fell again on the sand on her side the blood from her scalp injury scattering drops of red around the light brown sand she was now completely hysterical crying so hard she often could not catch her breath her face suffused with fear and anger she pointed again at winters within seconds a pair of dark brown arms swooped out of the sky and picked her up for the first time winters noticed that there were other people around lots of them in fact the little girl had been picked up by a man who must have been her father a short squat arab man in his midtwenties wearing a bright blue bathing suit he was holding his daughter protectively looking as if he were expecting a fight and consoling his distraught young wife whose sobs intermingled with the little girls frantic cries both the parents were looking at winters accusingly the mother daubed at the little girls bleeding head with a towel i didnt mean to hurt her winters said recognizing as he spoke that what he said would be misinterpreted she fell and hit her head on something and i the arab couple were backing away slowly winters turned to the others maybe a dozen people who had come over in response to the little girls cries they also were looking at him strangely i didnt mean to hurt her he repeated in a loud voice i was just he stopped himself big tears were falling off his face and onto the sand my god he thought im crying no wonder these people he heard another cry betty and hap had apparently just walked up behind him as the arab couple had backed away with their bleeding daughter now having seen the blood on his fathers hands fiveyearold hap had broken into tears and buried his face in his mothers hip he sobbed and sobbed winters looked at his hands then at the people standing around him impulsively he bent down and tried to clean his hands in the sand the sound of his sons sobbing punctuated his vain attempt to wipe his hands free of the blood as he was kneeling in the sand commander winters glanced at his wife betty for the first time since the incident had started what he saw on her face was abject horror he entreated her for support with his eyes but instead her eyes glazed over and she too fell to her knees careful not to disturb her tearful son who was clinging to her side and betty began to pray dear god she said with her eyes closed the crowd dispersed slowly several of them going over to the arab family to see if they could be of any help winters stayed on his knees in the sand shaken by his own actions at length betty stood up there there she consoled her son hap everything will be all right without saying another word she carefully picked up the beach bag and towels and started walking toward the parking lot the commander followed they left the beach and drove back to norfolk where they were living and she never asked about it winters thought as he sat at his kitchen table eight years later she wouldnt even let me talk about it for at least three years it was as if it had never happened now she mentions it once in a blue moon but we still have never discussed it he finished his orange juice and lit a cigarette as he did so he thought immediately of tiffani and the night before fear and arousal simultaneously stirred in winters when he thought of the coming evening he also found that he had a curious desire to pray and now dear god he said tentatively are you testing me again he was suddenly aware of his own anger or are you laughing at me maybe it wasnt enough for you to forsake me to leave me adrift maybe you wont he satisfied until i am humiliated again he felt like crying but he resisted winters crushed out his cigarette and stood up from the table he walked over to the side of the refrigerator and pulled the plaque containing the bible verse off the wall he started to throw it in the trash but after hesitating for a second he changed his mind and put it in one of the kitchen drawers carol was swimming rapidly about six feet above the trench as they approached the final turn she took a few photographs while she waited for troy to catch up pointed down below her to where the tracks turned to the left and then started swimming again more slowly this time following the tracks in the narrow crevice toward the overhang nothing here had changed she motioned for troy to stay back and swam down into the trench carefully as she had done before when she was with nick her search of the area under the overhang was very thorough she did not find anything she gestured to troy that nothing was there and then after another quick sequence of photographs the two divers began retracing their path going back along the tracks toward the area under the boat where they had already spent fifteen minutes earlier searching fruitlessly for the fissure they had seen on thursday it had mysteriously vanished all the tracks although somewhat eroded still converged in front of the reef structure where the hole had been just two days before carol had poked and prodded even damaged the reef in several places but had not found the fissure if troy had not seen it so clearly first on the ocean telescope monitor and then in the pictures he would have thought that it was just a figment of nick and carols collective imagination as carol deep in her thoughts turned right over the main trench after leaving the side path that had led to the overhang she was careless and brushed ever so slightly against a crop of coral that was extending outward from the reef she felt a sting on her hand she looked down and saw that she was bleeding thats funny she thought i just barely touched it her mind flashed back to ten minutes before when she had been roughly pushing the coral and kelp aside in search of the fissure and i wasnt even scratched a wild inchoate idea started forming in her mind excited now she intensified her swimming down the long trench where the fissure had been troy could not keep up with her it was a long swim but carol completed it in about four or five minutes she checked her regulator pressure as she waited for her diving partner they exchanged the thumbsup sign when he arrived and carol tried without success to explain her idea to troy using hand signals finally she bravely reached out and grabbed a piece of coral with her hand carol saw troys eyes open wide and his face grimace behind his mask she opened her hard there were no cuts no scrapes no blood astounded troy swam over beside her to look at the coral colony she had just disturbed he too could touch and even hold this strange coral without cutting his hand what was going on carol was now pulling the coral and kelp away from the reef troy watched in amazement as a huge segment of the reef structure seemed to peel off almost like a blanket they heard the great whoosh only milliseconds before they felt the pull a giant chasm opened in the reef behind them and everything in the area troy carol schools of fish plants of all kinds and an enormous volume of water was swept into the hole the current was very swift but the channel was not too large for carol and troy bounced against what felt like metallic sides a couple of times there was no time to think they were carried along as if on a water slide and simply had to wait for the ride to be over the dark gave way to a deep dusk and the current slowed markedly separated by about twenty feet carol and troy each tried to gather his wits and figure out what was happening they appeared to be in the outer annulus of a large circular tank and were going around and around passing gates of some kind after every ninety degrees of revolution the water in the tank was about ten feet deep carol rolled on her back and looked up she could see a lot of large structures above her some of them moving that seemed to be made out of metal or plastic she could not see troy anywhere she tried to grab the sides of the tank so she could stop and look for him it was useless she could not resist the motion of the current they made three or four trips around the circle without seeing each other troy noticed that all the fish and plants had slowly disappeared from their annulus suggesting that some kind of sorting process was underway suddenly the current increased and he was pitched forward and down under the water and then through a halfopen gate into darkness again just as a trace of light appeared above the water and the rate of flow again slowed he felt something clamp on to his right arm troy was lifted out of the water a foot or so in the dim light he couldnt see exactly what it was that had caught him but it felt very strong it held him without additional movement troy looked behind him in the current where he had been and he saw carols tumbling body approaching with his free left arm he grabbed at her she felt his arm and immediately wrapped herself around it she composed herself lifted her head out of the water and struggled to reach the trunk of troys body she succeeded in holding tight to him as the current rushed past she caught her breath and for just a moment their eyes met behind their diving masks then inexplicably the clamp released when they were back in the water the current did not seem so strong they were able to hold on to each other without much difficulty after about fifteen seconds the flow of the water slowed down altogether they had been deposited in a pool in what appeared to be a large room and the water was draining out running into some unseen orifice at the far end of the room the last of the water disappeared shaken and exhausted carol and troy started to stand up in their diving gear carol had great difficulty getting to her feet troy helped her up and then pointed to his regulator ever so slowly he slipped out of his mouthpiece and sampled the ambient environment one breath then another as far as he could tell he was breathing normal air he shrugged his shoulders at carol and in a fit of bravado took off his mask as well hellooo he shouted nervously anybody there you have guests out here carol slowly removed both her mask and her regulator she had a dazed look on her face the two of them looked around the ceiling was about ten feet above them overall the dimensions of the chamber were roughly equivalent to a large living room in a nice suburban home the walls however were quite unusual instead of being flat and forming nice rightangle joints at each of the intersections the walls were made of large curved surfaces some concave and some convex that were alternately colored red and blue without thinking carol began walking around slowly of course because of the bulky diving gear and taking photographs uh just a moment miss dawson troy said with a hesitant smile he pulled off his flippers and followed her before you take any more pictures angel would you kindly tell this unsophisticated black boy just where in the fuck he is i mean last i knew i was going down under the boat to look for a hole i think i found it but i must say its a trifle unnerving to be visiting someone and not know just who it is so could you stop with the journalism bit for just a minute and tell me why you are so calm carol was right in front of one of the concave blue wall panels there were two or three indentations in the wall structure at about eye level that formed circles or ellipses now what do you suppose this is carol wondered aloud her voice sounded flat as if she were far away carol troy almost shouted stop it stop right now we cant just blissfully walk around here as if this is a typical afternoon stroll through a model house we have to talk where are we how are we going to get out and go home home remember the place i guarantee you its not under the ocean two hours away from shore he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her she started to snap out of her daze she looked slowly around the entire room and then back at troy jesus she said and shit he saw her tremble a little and stepped forward to hug her she indicated for him to leave her alone im all right at least almost carol took a couple of deep breaths and then smiled anyway ive sure got one hell of a story here she looked around the room again uh troy she said with her brow wrinkled how did we get in here i dont see a doorway or an opening or anything good question troy replied a very good question to which i might have the answer i think these crazy colored walls move around i believe i saw the walls rolling into place when i was under the water so all we have to do is push them aside and find our way out he tried to wedge his hands into a crack that was a connection between a red and a blue piece of the wall structure he was unsuccessful carol left troy and started to pace around the perimeter of the room in her ungainly diving apparatus she quickly stopped and took off everything except her bathing suit she seemed intent on both examining and photographing every single panel in the wall troy took off his own air tanks and buoyancy vest as well dropping them on the light metal floor with a clank he watched her for a minute carol oh carol he said from across the room a big fake grin spreading across his face would you like to tell me what youre doing now i mean after all angel i may be able to help im looking for something that says eat me or drink me she replied with a nervous laugh of course troy mumbled to himself that was absolutely obvious do you remember alice in wonderland carol asked from the opposite side of the room she had found a long thin protuberance that looked like a handle sticking out from the center of one of the red panels she waved and he came over the two of them tried to twist and turn the handle nothing happened carol became frustrated struggling with it troy thought he saw a first sign of panic in carol as her eyes frantically scanned the rest of the room he pulled himself up and stood at attention military style speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases the deep furrows in carols face showed that she thought troy had temporarily lost his mind that was the queen of hearts i think troy laughed im not sure exactly but i had to learn it for a play when i was in the fifth grade carol had relaxed and was also laughing in spite of her fear she reached up and gave troy a kiss on the cheek careful now careful he said with a twinkle in his eye we black men are easily aroused carol slid her arm through troys as they finished walking around the rest of the room searching the walls for any sign of an exit troys banter made carol feel comfortable when i was in the eighth grade a black teacher of mine told me that alice was a racist story he contended that it was very significant that it was a white rabbit that alice followed he said that no nice little white girl would ever have pursued a black rabbit down a hole he stopped in front of another red panel well well he said what have we here this red panel looked just like the rest of the wall from a distance but up close within a range of a couple of feet or so all kinds of patterns made with small white dots could be seen stippled on top of the red paint an array of consecutive rectangular sections outlined by the white dots highlighted the center of the panel hey angel troy said pushing on the sections at random dont you think this looks suspiciously like a keyboard troy began to push on the keys at random carol joined him it became a game the two of them stood at the red panel for almost a minute putting their fingers into every outlined section and pushing hard suddenly carol backed away from the panel turned around and started walking directly across the room where are you going yelled troy as carol spinning around to answer nearly stumbled over her diving gear on the floor i have a crazy idea called carol call it feminine intuition call it psychic if you will she had reached the red panel where they had struggled with the handle now she pulled it down easily and immediately heard a creak she jumped back startled as the entire panel folded back and away from her revealing a dark opening large enough for a truck to enter troy came over beside her and the two of them stared into the void holy shit he said are we supposed to go in there carol nodded im certain we are troy looked at her with a curious expression and just how do you know that because its the only way out of here carol replied troy cast one final glance around the strange room with the curved and colored walls there was an indisputable logic to what carol had said he took a deep breath held carols hand and walked into the black tunnel behind them they could barely see the small shaft of light coming from the room where they had left their diving gear inside the pitchblack hallway they moved very slowly cautiously troy kept one hand on the wall and the other clenched around carols the sound of their labored breathing heightened by the constant fear and apprehension reverberated off the rounded walls they didnt talk twice troy had started to sing a few lines from a popular song to assuage his own disquiet but both times carol stopped him she wanted to be able to hear in case there were any other noises at one point she squeezed his hand and stopped listen she said in a whisper troy held his breath there was utter silence except for something very soft that he couldnt quite identify way off in the distance music carol said i think i hear music troy strained to identify the sound just below the threshold of his hearing it was useless he pulled on carols hand its probably inside your head he said lets go they had made a turn and the light behind them had disappeared altogether they had been in the tunnel for about ten minutes carol was becoming despondent what if this doesnt go anywhere she asked troy that doesnt make any sense he replied quickly somebody built it for some purpose its obviously a connecting passageway he fell silent who built it carol asked the question that had been troubling both of them during the long tense walk down the dark hallway another good question troy replied he hesitated just a minute before continuing with his answer my guess is the united states navy i think were in some kind of topsecret underwater laboratory that nobody knows about of course he thought not saying it out loud because he didnt want to disturb carol it could also be russian in which case we are in deep shit if the russians have a large secret laboratory this close to key west they are not going to be happy look troy carol said excitedly i see a light there is somebody here after all the tunnel was about to split into two pans at the end of one of the two forks the one sharply to the left a patch of illumination could clearly be seen still holding hands troy and carol walked briskly toward the light troy was aware that his heart was beating very rapidly carol almost raced into the new room she had expected that they were about to be found that this mysterious adventure was now going to end and everything would be explained instead as she looked around her in a small oval chamber with the same bizarre panels for walls she felt a tremendous confusion what is this place she asked troy and how are we going to get out troy was standing in the center of the room with his head tilted back as far as it would go he was staring up at a vast arched ceiling some thirty to thirtyfive feet above them wow he exclaimed this is one huge place the muted light illuminating the room was coming from slabs of partially translucent material possibly glass crystals that were embedded in the ceiling the brown and white panels forming the walls for the particular room they had entered were only ten feet high but they were high enough to prevent carol and troy from seeing out they had a strange sense of both freedom and confinement on the one hand first the tunnel and now this small room the size of a childs bedroom in a small house had made them feel claustrophobic however the sense of space conveyed by the cathedral ceilings was liberating well asked carol somewhat impatiently after waiting a few moments while troy walked around and surveyed the room he was observing that the brown and white wall panels were only slightly curved and were thus much closer to normal walls than those in the initial room had been im sorry angel he replied i forgot the question she shook her head there is only one question mr jefferson i believe that you asked it of me on our last tour stop she looked at her watch in about fifteen minutes we will have exceeded the maximum time for our air supply unless i miss my guess our friend nick is probably starting to worry right now but we still have no idea what are you doing she interrupted herself when troy bent down to pull a small knob on one of the brown panels in the corner of the room these are drawers angel he said as the bottom part of the panel came out several inches from the wall like a dresser he opened a second drawer above the first and they have something in them carol came over to see she reached into the second drawer that troy had opened and pulled out a rustcolored sphere about the size of a tennis ball the surface of the ball was very curious instead of being smooth and regular it had grooves cut into it mostly on one side and tiny bumps like those on the surface of a pickle around and next to the grooves in other places there were poorly defined indentations as well carol examined the sphere in the weak light ive seen something like this before she said but where she thought for a few seconds ive got it she announced pleased that her memory had come through this looks exactly like the model of mars in the national air and space museum then i must have the earth troy replied showing her a mostly blue sphere the size of a softball that he had removed from the top drawer the two of them stood together in the dim light looking back and forth at the spheres they were holding in their hands shit troy shouted eventually spinning around and looking at the ceiling and double shit whoever you are weve had enough come out now and identify yourself a partial echo of his voice came back to them otherwise they heard nothing anxious to be doing something carol continued her search of the room she found another group of three drawers in a nearby brown panel while she was opening the first of these troy playfully hurled his blue ball at what appeared to be an exit a dark opening between panels on the other side of the room the sphere hit a white panel near the exit with a thunk and started to fall to the floor however just before it touched the ground the sphere lifted up as if pulled somehow from above and stopped in the center of the room about five feet above the floor it began to spin troys eyes opened wide he walked over to the sphere and placed his hand between the ball and high ceiling trying to find the strings nothing happened the earth sphere continued to spin slowly and inscribe a circle in the air in the middle of the room troy pushed the ball lightly it moved in response to his push but after his applied force was removed and the effect had dissipated the sphere returned to its previous location and continued its earlier movement troy turned around carol had her back to him and was searching unsuccessfully for another set of drawers the mars ball was still in her left hand uh carol troy said slowly would you mind coming over here a moment certainly she replied without looking jesus troy these drawers are full of all kinds she had turned around and now noticed the earth sphere hovering in the air near the center of the room her brow knitted thats cute she said tentatively real cute i didnt know you were a magician as well her voice trailed off she could see the perplexed expression on troys face she walked over next to him to have a closer look the two of them stood silently for at least ten seconds as they watched the blue softball slowly spin in the air next troy took the mars sphere from carol and tossed it underhanded up toward the high ceiling it arched up and fell down normally until it was just above the floor then like the blue sphere before it the mars ball developed its own sense of direction and momentum it floated up about five feet off the floor began to spin slowly and hovered in the air next to the blue sphere representing the earth carol grabbed troys hand she shivered and then regained her composure theres something about this that gives me the willies she said all in all i would deal better with a caterpillar asking me who are you at least in that case i would have some idea what im up against troy turned around and led carol back over to the partially opened drawers i ran into this old bearded dude once when i was hitchhiking he began as he pulled out a basketball that was covered with latitudinal belts and bands in shades of red and orange he aimlessly tossed the big jupiter ball over his shoulder using both hands carol watched it still fascinated as it joined the other two spheres orbiting around an empty focus in the middle of the room he was driving an old rundown pickup truck and smoking a joint at first we talked a little he would ask me questions and i would start to give an answer but after a sentence or two he would interrupt me and say you dont know shit man that was his response to everything troy methodically emptied all six of the drawers while he was telling his story he threw all the objects he found into the center of the room a few of them he watched casually as if he were witnessing an everyday occurrence each of the new spheres repeated the earlier pattern a nearly complete working model of the solar system was forming about five feet above the foor finally i grew tired of his game and was quiet we drove along for miles in silence it was a clear and beautiful night and he kept hanging his head out the window to look at the stars once when he pulled his head back in he lit another joint handed it to me and pointed back out the window at the stars they know man they know he said miles later when he let me out of the truck he leaned over and i could see the wildness in his eyes remember man he whispered you dont know shit but they know as troy finished the tale carol came over beside him and pulled out two handfuls of tiny fragments from the final drawer they were a little sticky to the touch she shook them off her hands and they miraculously flew around the room and coalesced into the ring systems of saturn and uranus she looked at troy in awe does that bizarre story have a point carol asked i must admit that i am amazed at how nonchalant you are about this whole damn thing for myself im just about ready to freak out completely troy pointed at the miniature planets floating in the air what we are seeing has no explanation in terms of our experience weve either died together or transferred to a new dimension or someone is playing mind games with us he smiled at carol if you must know angel im scared absolutely shitless but like that old stoned hippie i keep telling myself they know somehow it gives me comfort they heard a soft sliding sound and a shaft of bright light burst into the room from an opening that was forming between two panels one brown and one white just to the right of the exit carol recoiled automatically and covered her eyes for an instant troy also jumped back at first but then shaded his eyes with his hands and watched the panels continued to slide until an opening about two feet wide had developed the room was beginning to fill with light troy saw a great illuminated ball coming slowly through the opening here comes the sun dootundoodoo doo here comes the sun he sang anxiously and i say its all right he hummed a few more bars of the song as carol opened her eyes jesus she said the bright orb the size of a giant beach ball lifted itself into its proper place in the orrery and flooded the entire room with its radiance the spinning orbiting planets shone with reflected light from their sides facing the sun carol stood transfixed silent tears running down her face she could not speak or move she was completely overwhelmed troy was also frightened but not yet so much that his ability to function was impaired however a moment later he saw something in the exit that sent a bolt of terror through his system his heart surged into overdrive as he blinked and then squinted making certain his mind was not playing tricks on him as he looked just around the bright light of the model sun instinctively he turned to protect carol and shielded her from what he had just seen dont look now he whispered but we have a visitor what said carol confused and still stunned troy held her by the arms and they moved together several steps to the right he looked over his own shoulder and saw the thing again over by the exit he said turning around unable any longer to hide his panic carols eyes indicated that she had found the source of troys terror she had no idea what it was but she could see that it was large clearly threatening and absolutely different from anything that she had ever seen or imagined it had also moved into the room she heard troys frantic incoherent shouts but their meaning didnt register she looked at the thing again and her mind balked she opened her mouth to scream nothing came out at first she dropped to her knees on the floor she heard the sound of screams in her ear but they seemed far far away her brain was sending a message that said youre screaming but for some reason it didnt seem possible it had to be someone else the thing was coming toward her its main body was about eight feet tall at that moment but it was continually changing its shape and size as it undulated across the room whatever it was troy and carol could see into it and even through parts of its structure a transparent external boundary membrane was wrapped around a permanently seething set of mostly clear fluid matter that ebbed and flowed with each movement the thing moved like an amoeba matter simply heading in the right direction but with astonishing speed tiny black dots were scattered just behind all its external surfaces darting in all directions apparently supervising the continuous reconfigurations that gave it motion a half dozen chunks of grayish opaque matter objects a foot or so square were also embedded near the center of the primary body but it was not the main body of the thing that was so terrifying protruding from its upper portions was a frightening array of a dozen appendages mostly long and slender in shape that appeared to be stuck into the main body like sharp objects in a pin cushion it looked as if the large clear amoebalike structure was a versatile transportation system that could carry virtually anything and that the payload at least for this usage was this family of constantly active rods all of which were threatening because their end effectors resembled needles hands brushes teeth and even swords and guns in carols mind she was being attacked by a heavily armored tank that could change size in an instant and move on invisible treads in any direction troy moved to the side trying to calm his fear and catch his breath as he watched the thing zero in on carol its longest attachment a reddish plastic implement which split into two short tines about a foot away from the primary body suddenly extended itself outward an additional three feet and stopped just six inches in front of carols eyes she screamed and pushed it away forcefully but it popped right back into position troy plucked the jupiter ball out of the air and with all his might hurled the sphere at the center of the thing the shapeless mass fell back on impact and immediately retracted its extended appendages but in an instant the thing reconfigured itself somehow and adjusted its matter to let the ball pass completely through before it hit the floor on the other side jupiter rose into the air and came back to take its proper position in the solar system model the thing had now stopped advancing toward carol it was sitting in the middle of the room its spindly appendages flailing around in all directions it seemed to be making a decision troy bravely grabbed a rod with an end effector like a brush and tried to pull it away from the main structure instantly core clear material flowed into the joint where that particular rod was attached strengthening the connection but troys action definitely caused a change in its pattern the thing started after him ever so carefully making sure it would follow him while watching out for another quick extension of the red implement with the two tines troy edged toward the exit as the thing continued to move toward him troy motioned for carol to get back then he broke for the door tripping slightly over an extended rod on his way out it hardly hesitated with surprising celerity the thing made itself short and squat a maximum amount of exposed surface was now on the floor and it could move more quickly and efficiently the deployed group of attachments were placed into some kind of compact traveling configuration and the thing hustled out the door carol was left alone on her knees on the floor the solar system model was above her and to the right for over a minute she didnt move she just watched the spinning planets abstractedly and listened for the occasional sound of troys footfalls in the distance at length there was a long period of silence and carol rose to her feet she took several small slow steps reassuring herself that she was all right and then walked over to the exit opening between the panels the exit opened onto a corridor that ran in both directions troy had gone to the right when he had left the room after remembering her camera and going back to take a few quick photographs of the suspended planets carol followed troys path also taking the corridor to the right she walked slowly down the black hall turning around frequently to locate the light coming from the room that she had just left there was now a close ceiling over her head the hall next split into two forks both directions were dark carol listened for sounds again she thought she heard music but she couldnt begin to identify where it was coming from this time she chose the left fork in the hallway soon it narrowed and seemed to be circling back in the direction from which she had just come she was just about to turn around and retrace her steps when she distinctly heard two noises something like a thud followed by a scraping sound off to the right in front of her drawing her breath slowly and struggling to conquer her fear carol moved forward in the dark after about twenty more feet she came upon a low door that opened to the right she bent down slightly and peered in in the dusky light she saw unusual shapes and structures in another small room with walls made of the now familiar curved and colored panels she crawled through the doorway and stood up soft local lights located in a few of the wall panels came on as soon as carols feet contacted the floor in the room her arrival also triggered two or three notes from some kind of musical instrument it sounded like an organ and was apparently way off in the distance in another part of the cathedral area enclosed by the vast arched ceilings that were again above her she stopped surprised she stood still for several seconds then without moving carol carefully surveyed her new surroundings in this room the wall panels were very bright alternating between purple and gold and they were extremely curved along with carol in the room there were three objects of unknown purpose one looked like a writing table a second like a long low bench that was wide at one end and tapered to a point at the other and the third resembled a very tall telephone pole whose top and bottom were connected by sixteen thin strings stretched out and around a broad ring about one third of the way down the pole carol could walk between the thin strings the ring made out of a gold metallic material was a couple of feet above her head almost at the level of the top of the wall panels she grabbed one of the strings and felt it vibrate it made a muffled flat sound she backed away from the string and tried to pluck it a note sounded very lyrical like a heavy harp carol realized she was standing inside a musical instrument but how to play it she spent a few minutes wandering around the room trying without success to find the equivalent of a bow she knew it would be impossible to play the harp if she had to run around and pluck each individual string herself she walked over to the writing table she quickly figured out that it was also a musical instrument it looked much more promising there were indentations in the table sixtyfour altogether set up in eight rows and eight columns pressing each key produced a different sound although carol had taken five years of piano lessons as a small child it was a difficult chore at first for her even to play silent night on the strange writing table she had to correlate the sounds made by pressing the individual keys with the notes and chords that she remembered from her childhood while she was teaching herself to play the instrument she stopped often to listen to the delicate crystal sound that it made it reminded her mostly of a xylophone carol stood at the table for several minutes eventually she played an entire verse of silent night without making a single mistake carol smiled pleased with herself and relaxed momentarily during this interlude the great organ in the distance suddenly began to play carol felt goose bumps rise on her arms partially due to the beauty of the music and partially because it reminded her again of what a bizarre world she had entered what is that organ playing she thought to herself it sounds like an overture she listened for a few seconds why thats an introduction to silent night its very creative the organ sound was joined by several others each emanating from somewhere in the ceiling all the instruments together played a complex version of the silent night that carol had so painstakingly pounded out on the writing table a few moments before the beautiful music swelled throughout the cathedral carol looked up and then closed her eyes she spun her body around and around in a little dance when she opened her eyes again each of them confronted what appeared to be a tiny optical instrument no more than an inch away carol froze in terror the thing had noiselessly come up behind her while she was playing music at the writing table and had waited patiently while deploying its appendages until she was ready to turn around it was about her height now and the closest part of the translucent main body was only an arms length away as carol stood there motionless barely daring to breathe five or six of the things attachments came forward to touch her a small digging instrument scraped some skin off her bare shoulder the sword cut off some of her hair a tiny cord attached to one of the long rods wrapped around her wrist a set of bristles the size of the head of a toothbrush traveled across her chest tickling her nipples through her bathing suit and crossing over the camera that was draped around her neck she was having so many feelings simultaneously that she had lost track of all the stimuli carol closed her eyes and tried to concentrate on something else she felt a needle prick her forehead it was over very fast less than a minute altogether the thing retracted its appendages backed up a couple of feet and stood there observing her from a distance carol waited after another twenty seconds the attachments were stowed as they had been when the thing had gone after troy and it left the room carol listened for sounds it was totally quiet again she backed up from the writing table and tried to organize her thoughts after about a minute the purple and gold wall panels began to move to the side on their own accord they folded upon themselves and formed small stacks then the corridors around the music room collapsed and automatically organized their partitions into neat piles carol found herself standing in one huge room under the cathedral ceilings in the distance her weird antagonist with the flailing appendages passed through a side door about twentyfive yards away and disappeared quickly from view she looked around there was no sign of troy the walls were creamy white and nondescript somewhat boring after the colored panels in the earlier rooms there were two doors opposite each other in the middle of the room except for the musical instruments which now seemed completely out of place clustered together at one end of such a vast room the only other object she could see was a small piece of carpet against thc wall to the left in front of her against the far wall about fifty yards away there was what appeared to be a large window on the ocean even from a distance she could see and identify some of the fish swimming by at first carol hurried toward the window when she was about halfway there and even with the doors she stopped a few seconds and took a few photographs of the rather bland room curiously the small carpet was not where she remembered it it had somehow been moved while she was walking she approached the carpet very slowly her weird experiences since she and troy had been sucked out of the ocean had made carol understandably wary as she drew closer she saw that the flat object lying on the floor was definitey not a carpet from above she could see an intricate internal design like a complex network of sophisticated electronic chips there were strange whorls and geometric patterns on its surface they had no specific meaning to carol but they reminded her of the fractal designs dr dale had shown her one night in his apartment the symmetries of the object were readily apparent in fact each of the four quadrants of the carpet was identical it was about six feet long three feet wide and two inches thick the dominant color was slate gray although there were some significant color variations some of the larger individual components must have been colorcoded according to some master plan carol could identify groupings of similar elements in red yellow blue and white within the design the overall harmony of the colors was striking suggesting that some effort had been made by the designers to include aesthetic considerations carol bent down on her knees beside the carpet and studied it more intently its surface was densely packed the closer she looked the more detail she found extraordinary she thought but what in the world is it and how did it move or could i possibly have imagined it she put her hand on the exposed top surface she felt a soft tingle like a gentle electric shock she slid one hand under the edge and lifted slightly it was heavy she removed her hand her desire to escape from this strange world now overruled her curiosity carol took a photograph of the carpet from the top and started walking away in the direction of the window after several strides she turned quickly to her left to look at the carpet one more time it had moved again and was still even with her in the room carol continued walking toward the window now watching the carpet out of the corner of her eye when she had walked another ten feet her peripheral vision saw it arch up quickly along a line through its center pulling the rear of its body in a forward direction half a second later the front end of the carpet scooted forward and the center fell flat against the floor again this maneuver was repeated six or eight times in rapid succession as the carpet zipped up to a position even with carol in the room despite her situation carol laughed she was still full of adrenaline and uptight but there was definitely something humorous about a multicolored carpet that could crawl like an inchworm ha carol said out loud i caught you now you owe me an explanation carol certainly did not expect a reply to her comment nevertheless after just a short delay the behavior of the carpet was altered first it began to generate small wave pulses along its surface with four or five crests from front to back after smartly reversing the direction of motion of the waves several times the carpets next trick was to keep its front end fixed on the floor as if there were suction cups holding it down and raise its back side entirely off the floor in that mode it was about six feet tall it seemed to be looking at carol she was flabbergasted well i asked for it she said out loud still amused by the antics of the carpet now it seemed to be motioning for her to go toward the window i have lost my mind she thought to herself completely troy was right maybe were dead the carpet arched over on the floor and began to scamper toward the window tumbling in somersaults like a slinky toy carol followed this is nuts she thought as she watched the carpet move somehow through the window and into the ocean and alice thought she was in wonderland the carpet was playing in the water dodging fish as they swam by in schools and teasing a sea urchin stuck fast against the reef at length it came back into the room and stood upright a little water dripped on the floor when the carpet set in motion a series of fast simultaneous waves both latitudinal and longitudinal that effectively shook the residual liquid from its surface it then faced carol and clearly beckoned for her to go through the window into the ocean look here flat guy she said chuckling to herself as she tried to figure out what to say now i know im insane she thought in a flash im standing here talking to a carpet next thing i know it will talk back now im not stupid she continued i recognize that youre trying to get me to go into the ocean but there are a few things that you dont the carpet interrupted the conversation by going quickly through the window into the ocean again it performed a couple of flips and came back into the room with carol once more it shook itself and then stood rigidly upright as before as if to say see its easy as i was saying carol began again i have perhaps gone crazy but im willing to trust that i can indeed go through that window in some magical way my problem is that these is water out there i cant breathe in water without my diving gear which i left somewhere in this labyrinth i will die the carpet didnt move carol repeated her statement using elaborate hand gestures to make her key points then she fell silent after a short wait the carpet began to move about actively it then approached her carefully and amazingly stretched itself out in all directions so that it was almost double its original size carol wasnt significantly fazed at this point she was almost incapable of being astonished again even by an elastic carpet that pulled its two top sides together over her head to form a cone carol backed away a couple of steps from the now giant carpet oh ho she said i think i understand you are going to form an air pocket for me so that i can breathe she stood still for a moment thinking and shaking her head why not she said at last its no weirder than anything else thats happened with the carpet hovering over and around her head carol closed her eyes and walked directly toward the window she took a deep breath when she felt a soft plastic touch on different parts of her body suddenly the water was all around her except for the small air pocket from the neck up it was hard for carol to keep her diving discipline but she managed to equalize the pressure every six to eight feet during her ascent she took one final breath and zoomed up to the surface the carpet peeled off in the last foot before she broke water the florida queen was about fifty yards away nick she shouted with all her might nick over here she swam furiously toward the boat a wave broke over her head the boat was again visible she could see a figure in profile he was looking over the side of the boat nick carol cried again when she had gathered her strength this time he heard her and turned around she waved her arms nick had followed carol and troy on the monitor right after their initial descent when they were still directly under the boat searching for the fissure but he had quickly tired of watching them swim around in circles and had returned to his deck chair to read his novel afterward he had walked over to the screen several more times to look for them and had seen nothing carol and troy had already left to investigate the area under the overhang nick had checked the monitor again after he had finished madame bovary he had been a little surprised to discover that the fissure was again clearly visible underneath the florida queen he next assumed that he must have been correct that it had just been a case of bad lighting since with the sun directly overhead the hole in the reef looked much smaller to him than it had two days before he had then busied himself about the boat until his wrist alarm went off indicating that carol and troy had about five more minutes of air remaining nick walked over and looked at the images being taken by the ocean telescope and placed in realtime on the screen there was no sign of carol and troy under the boat nick started becoming restive i hope theyre paying attention he thought he realized that they had been gone from view for a long time and that he had never seen them actually explore the fissure their primary goal a creeping disquiet began to spread through him as the clock continued to run out theres only one explanation he thought fighting against the negative ideas that were filtering into his mind they have been gone a long time so they must have found something interesting at the overhang or somewhere else for just a moment nick imagined that carol and troy had found a lode of treasure full of objects that looked like the strange trident they had retrieved on thursday the second hand seemed to be racing on his watch it was now one minute until they should run out of air nick nervously checked the monitor again nothing he felt his heart speed up they must be in the red he thought even if they have carefully conserved the air they must be in the red nick worried for a second about a gauge failure but he quickly remembered checking both of them himself when he arrived at the boat that morning besides its terribly unlikely they would both fail so there must be trouble another minute passed and nick realized that he had not formulated a plan as to what he would do if they didnt show up his mind raced swiftly through his options there were two distinctly different action patterns he could follow he could put on his diving gear and go look for them along the trench between the fissure and the overhang or he could assume that in their excitement carol and troy had simply neglected to check their air gauges regularly and as a result had been forced to surface wherever they were when they ran out of air if i go down after them he thought i probably wont reach them in time nick had a moment of selfrecrimination because he had not properly prepared for this contingency it would take him several valuable minutes to put on and check out his own diving apparatus that settles it i must assume theyre around here somewhere floating on the surface he looked briefly at the screen one more time and then walked over to the side of the boat he scanned the ocean it was a little choppy now he didnt see any sign of them nick turned on the engine and pulled in the anchor he made a quick mental assessment of the general direction to the overhang and started steering with the engine at very low throttle unfortunately he could not see the telescope monitor from the steering wheel and the canopy blocked his vision behind him nick was in perpetual motion back and forth from the wheel to the screen to the sides of the boat as his fear and frustration began to build so did his anger it was now five minutes after the nominal time that their air supply would have been depleted damnit nick thought still not allowing his brain to nurture images of disaster how could they be so careless i knew i shouldnt have let them go as a pair he continued to castigate himself and then turned on carol i let that woman push me around i will sure as hell straighten her out when i find them nick turned the boat sharply to the left he thought he heard a voice nick ran to the side of the boat he had no sense of what direction the shout had come from after two or three more seconds he heard it again he turned and saw a figure wave nick waved back and went over to the steering wheel to change the direction of the boat he pulled out a strong rope from the equipment drawer and tied it around one of the stanchions next to the ladder he threw the line to carol as the boat pulled up alongside her and then he cut the motor back to idle she had no trouble catching the line as he was reeling her in nicks eyes searched the surrounding water for troy he could not see him carol had now reached the ladder you would not believe she started trying to catch her breath as she put her first foot on the ladder wheres troy interrupted nick gesturing out at the ocean carol took another step up the ladder it was clear that she was exhausted nick took her hand and she came into the boat she stood up on her wobbly legs wheres troy nick asked again forcefully he looked at carol and what happened to all your gear carol took a deep breath i dont know where troy is she stammered we were sucked down you dont know shouted nick now frantically looking around on the ocean surface you go on a dive come up without your gear and dont know where your partner is what kind a small wave hit the boat carol had raised her hand to protest nicks diatribe but the motion of the boat knocked her feet out from under her she fell hard on her knees and winced at the pain nick was hovering over her still shouting well miss perfect you better come up with some fucking answers fast if we dont find troy soon hell be dead and if hes dead it will be your goddamn fault carol instinctively cowered at the anger of the large man her knees hurt she was exhausted and this man was yelling in her face suddenly her emotions gave way shut up she shouted shut up you asshole and get away from me she was flailing with her arms hitting nick on the legs and in the stomach you dont know anything she said after taking a quick breath you dont know shit carol put her head in her hands and began to cry in that instant a longburied memory burst upon her mind her fiveyearold brother was sobbing hysterically and attacking her pummeling her with his fists she had her hands up to protect herself its your fault carol he was screaming he left because of you she remembered the hot tears in her eyes its not true richie its not true it wasnt my fault on the boat carol glanced up through her tears at nick he had backed away and was looking sheepish she wiped her eyes and took a deep breath it was not my fault carol said deliberately and emphatically nick stuck out his hand to help her up and she smacked it away he mumbled im sorry as she rose to her feet now if youll just shut up and listen she continued ill tell you what happened the reef under the boat wasnt a reef at all oh my god its here nick saw a look of consternation break on carols face she pointed over behind him on the other side of the boat he turned around to look at first he didnt notice anything then he saw a strange flat object that looked like a piece of carpet inching along the boat toward the telescope monitor he screwed up his face and turned back to carol with a puzzled expression while carol had been talking the carpet had somehow crawled up the side and then flopped into the boat by the time she started to explain it was already standing in front of the television monitor looking at the images the telescope was taking of the ocean floor beneath the boat there was no time for lengthy explanations what the fuck nick said and walked over to apprehend the peculiar visitor when his hand was about an inch away from touching the carpet he felt a strong electrical discharge in the end of his fingers ow he said jumping back he shook his hand and watched with amazement the carpet continued to stand in front of the screen nick looked at carol as if he expected some assistance but she was finding the whole scene amusing that thing is just one of the reasons the dive was strange she said making no effort to provide any help but i dont think it will hurt you it probably saved my life nick grabbed a small fishnet hanging on the side of the structure holding up the canopy and slowly approached the carpet as he drew near it seemed to turn and look at him nick lunged forward with the net the carpet dodged deftly and nick lost his balance he fell against the monitor with his arms akimbo carol laughed out loud remembering the first time they met the carpet flipped over to the telescope data system and wrapped itself tightly around the entire set of electronic equipment from the floor of the boat nick watched the carpet investigating the data system and shook his head in disbelief what the hell is that thing anyway he shouted to carol she came over and graciously offered a hand to help him up it was her way of apologizing for her earlier outburst i have no earthly idea carol replied at first i thought it might be a sophisticated navy robot but it is much too advanced too intelligent she pointed at the sky with her free left hand they know she said with a smile the comment reminded carol of troy and she became solemn she walked over to the side of the boat and stared at the ocean nick was now standing up next to the monitor within an arms length of the carpet and the data system it looked as if the carpet had somehow extended part of itself into the internal electronics nick watched for a few seconds fascinated as the various digital diagnostic readouts on the top of the data system went crazy hey carol he said come here and look at this that damn thing is plastic or something she did not turn around at first nick carol asked softly finally facing him what are we going to do about troy as soon as we get this damn invader out of here nick replied from underneath the canopy where he was now looking through his kitchen implements well do a systematic search of the area i may even dive and see if i can find him nick had picked up a large cooking fork with a plastic handle and was about to attempt to pry the carpet off the data system i wouldnt do that if i were you admonished carol hell leave when hes ready but it was too late nick stuck the fork into and through the carpet and up against the uppermost rack of electronic parts there was a popping sound and a tiny blue arc zapped down the fork driving nick backward with a powerful kick alarms went off the digital readout from the data system went blank and the ocean telescope monitor began to smoke the carpet dropped down on the floor and began making the little waves that it had showed to carol in the large room with the window on the ocean a moment later two alarms from the navigation system sounded indicating not only that the boats current location had been lost but also that the nonvolatile memory where all the parameters that permitted satellite communication were stored had been erased in the middle of the noise and smoke nick stood with a puzzled expression on his face he was rubbing his right arm from his wrist to his shoulder im numb he said in astonishment i cant feel anything in my arm the carpet continued with its wave patterns on the floor of the boat while carol picked up a pail leaned overboard for some water and doused the monitor nick had not moved he was still standing there looking helpless and pinching his arm carol threw the rest of the water on nick shit he sputtered backing up involuntarily why did you do that because we have to find troy she said walking over to the boats controls and we cant wait all day ignore the damn carpet and your arm a mans life is at stake she increased the speed of the boat as she did the carpet stood up again twisted around and hustled to the side nick tried to stop it but it was out of the boat and into the water in a flash as carol steered the boat through circles of larger and larger radius nick stood on the side of the florida queen and searched for troy an hour later they both agreed there was no reason for them to continue the search carol and nick had been over the entire region of the ocean in the boat several times and had found no trace of troy after he had convinced himself that his arm was all right nick had even donned his diving equipment as a last resort and had retraced the path from the fissure to the overhang and back still no sign of troy nick had been just slightly tempted to investigate the fissure but carols wild story seemed remotely plausible and nick did not like the idea of being sucked into some bizarre underground laboratory and he knew that if he were to disappear it would be virtually impossible for carol to guide the boat back to key west without an active navigation system carol recounted the whole story of her dive while she and nick were canvassing the area he was certain she was liberally embellishing the details but he could see no overarching logical flaws in her tale and he himself had after all confronted the carpet on the florida queen so he acknowledged in his own mind that carol and troy had indeed had hairraising experiences in an underwater building of some type and that the technology they had encountered was definitely more advanced than anything they had ever seen before but nick was reluctant to accept carols blithe explanation that the trio had met some extraterrestrials it didnt seem likely to nick that a first contact would be made under such mundane circumstances although he readily admitted that the carpet was a marvel of capability far beyond his ken he did not think of himself as being technologically sophisticated and therefore he could not state categorically that human beings could not have created it infact nick thought to himself as he was carefully searching the horizon with his binoculars for reference landmarks before beginning the trip back to key west what a perfect deception suppose the russians or even our own navy wanted to mislead he stopped himself in midthought and realized that if he were right and their encounter had been with a human creation then they could very well still be in danger but why was carol allowed to leave and why didnt they confiscate my boat nick found a small island that he recognized off in the distance and changed the orientation of the boat he shook his head it was all very confusing you dont agree with me that weve just met some ets carol came up beside nick and slightly teased him with her question i dont know he answered slowly it seems like quite a leap to make after all if there is an extraterrestrial infestation in the waters of the gulf of mexico it should have been found before now submarines and other boats with active sonar must cross this region at least once or twice a year he smiled at her youve been reading too much science fiction on the contrary she responded fixing him with her gaze my experience with stateoftheart technology is almost certainly more extensive than yours i have done a series of features on the miami oceanographic institute and have seen what kind of ingenious new concepts are being developed and nothing absolutely nothing comes close to the carpet or the giant amoeba thing the likelihood that there is some nonfantastic explanation for all this is very very small she paused for a moment besides she continued maybe the laboratory hasnt been there for long maybe it was just recently finished or even transported here nick had felt himself bridle when carol had started her comment there she goes again he had thought so sure of herself so cocky and competitive almost like a man he admitted to himself that he had also been known to make arguments from authority and she was certainly right in one respect she had had much more exposure to high technology than he had nick decided not to argue with her this time there was a momentary pause in the conversation carol was also becoming more sensitive to the dynamic of their interaction she had noticed in realtime that nicks face had tightened when she had suggested that she knew more about technology than he did uh oh had flashed through her mind come on carol be a little more tactful and considerate she decided to change the subject how long will it take us to reach the marina she asked in her excitement on thursday afternoon she had not paid much attention to time during their return trip a little less than two hours nick replied he laughed unless i get lost i havent used manual guidance in these waters for over five years and what are you going to say when we get there nick looked at her to whom about what he asked you know about our dive about troy they stared at each other nick finally broke the silence my vote would be to say nothing about it until until we know for certain he said quietly then if troy shows up theres no problem and if he doesnt ever show up carols voice trailed off then we mr williams are both in very deep shit the gravity of their situation was becoming clear to both of them but who do you think will ever believe such an incredible tale nick said after a moment even with your pictures theres no really hard evidence to corroborate our story these days people can create any kind of photo they want on a computer remember that murder case in miami last year where an alibi photograph was produced and admitted as official evidence and then later that data processor showed up and blew the whistle he paused carol was listening intently and whoever built that place may be dismantling it at this very moment he continued otherwise why did they let us get away no i say we wait awhile twentyfour hours or so anyway and think carefully about what were going to do carol nodded her head affirmatively i think i agree with you although not exactly for the same reasons she was aware there was still a journalistic voice inside her that wanted to guard the information for her sensational scoop she hoped her ambition wasnt somehow standing in the way of making the right decision for troy but nick carol said reflectively you dont think were endangering troy in any way by not contacting the authorities no nick replied immediately i suspect that if they were going to kill him they would have done so already or will soon this part of the conversation was too casual for carol she walked over to the edge of the boat and stared out at the sea again she thought of troy and their wild adventure after they were sucked into the fissure he had helped her hang together no question about it his humor and wit had kept her from falling apart and he may have well saved her life by deflecting the attention of that thing he was a warm sensitive man underneath that funny exterior she thought very aware he also seemed to be covering lots of pain from somewhere for a moment carol convinced herself that troy was all right after all they had helped her to escape then she wondered why she had never run into him again down there a seed of doubt was planted in her mind she squirmed damnit we dont really know one way or the other its uncertainty again i hate uncertainty its unfair a profound sadness a deep and disturbing feeling from the past stirred in carol she felt helpless without any control of the situation tears filled her eyes nick had come up beside her without saying anything he saw the tears in her eyes but didnt comment he just put his hand over hers for a moment and then removed it troy was becoming a good friend carol said starting to hide what she was really feeling all of a sudden her need to share her true emotions overcame her normal protection mechanisms she looked down at the water but thats not really why im upset just now im crying because of the uncertainty i cant stand not knowing carol paused and wiped her eyes nick was quiet he did not understand exactly what she was saying but he sensed that something special was about to happen between them the gentle waves lapped against the side of the boat it reminds me of my childhood right after my father left she continued softly i kept believing that he would be coming back all three of us richie my mom and i would tell each other that it was just a temporary separation that someday he would walk through the door and say im home at night i would lie in my bed and listen for the sound of his car in the driveway the tears were flowing now big drops cascading down her cheeks and falling into the vast ocean when he would come to pick us up for dinner or on a saturday i would help mom fix herself up choose her clothes for her brush her hair carol choked up for a moment after i hugged him at the door i would always take him to mother and say isnt she beautiful for six months this went on i never knew what i was going to feel from day to day the uncertainty destroyed me made me sick i begged my father to give my mom one more chance richie even suggested that he could buy the house next door if he and mother couldnt get along so we could at least all be close together carol smiled grimly and took a huge breath then my father took my mother to san francisco for the weekend i was so excited for thirtysix hours my heart soared my future was assured i was the happiest tenyearold girl in the san fernando valley but when they came home un sunday night my mother was very drunk her eyes were swollen her mascara was running she was a mess she marched right past richie and me and went to her room my dad richie and i stood in the living room all hugging and wept together in that instant i knew it was all over carol was calming down now but the tears were still there she looked at nick her eyes entreating it would have been so much easier if i could have cried one time and been done with it but no there was uncertainty so there was still hope so every day every goddamn day my little heart was broken again carol wiped her eyes one more time then she looked out at the ocean and shouted with all her might i want to know now or at least soon what happened to troy dont make me wait forever i cant take it she turned to nick he opened his arms without a word she put the side of her face against his chest he closed his arms around her nick reached above the door to troys duplex and found the key on the ledge he knocked on the door again and opened it cautiously hello he called out is anybody there carol followed him into the living room i didnt know you two were such close friends she said after she glanced with amusement at troys motley collection of furniture i dont think ive ever told anyone where i keep my key what nick was looking for was not in the living room he walked down the hallway past the large bedroom with its storehouse of equipment and into the smaller bedroom where troy slept actually nick yelled at carol who had stopped behind him in the hall opposite the first bedroom and was gawking at the jumble of electronics filling every conceivable cranny it was only yesterday that i came over here for the first time so i dont really know where oh good i think ive found something he picked up a sheet of computer printout that was underneath a paperweight on the end table beside troys bed it was dated january and contained about twenty names addresses and phone numbers nick met carol in the hallway he read quickly through the page and showed it to her theres not much here phone numbers and addresses for electronics and software supply houses a bunch of numbers for angie leatherwood probably while she was still on tour he pointed at one entry this must be his mother kathryn jefferson in coral gables florida but theres no phone number listed with the address carol took the sheet from nick and checked it herself i never heard him mention anyone but angie his mother and his brother jamie no other friends or family and i somehow have the impression that he hasnt seen much of his mother recently did you ever hear him say anything about any other family no nick replied they had wandered together into the game room and nick was idly turning knobs and switches as he walked past the arrays of equipment he stopped and thought for a moment so that means angie is the one well tell her right away and then wait carol and nick both froze as they distinctly heard the front door open and close after about a second nick called out in a loud but uncertain voice hello whoever it is were back here in the bedroom there was no answer they could hear soft footsteps in the hallway nick instinctively moved over to protect carol a moment later troy came around the corner and into the room well well he said grinning broadly as i live and breathe i have found a pair of burglars in my home carol ran up to troy and threw her arms around his neck troy she said her comments coming in quick staccato bursts is it ever good to see you where have you been you scared the shit out of us we thought you were dead troy returned carols hug and winked at nick my my such a reception i should have vanished before he extended a hand to shake the one that nick was offering him for a moment his face became serious on second thought one experience like that is definitely enough carol backed away and troy saw the computer sheet in her hand we were going to try to notify your family she started troy reached out to take the page and carol noticed a bracelet on troys right wrist that she had never seen before it was wide almost an inch and a half and looked as if its twenty or so links had been made from flattened gold nuggets where did you get this carol asked holding his wrist up so that she could see the bracelet more clearly nick was unable to restrain himself any longer before troy could answer carols question he jumped into the conversation according to carol he said you were last seen disappearing down a corridor in an underwater laboratory with a sixfoot amoeba in hot pursuit how the hell did you escape we searched all over the area troy held up his hands he was enjoying being the center of attention friends friends wait a minute will you i will tell you the story as soon as i take care of the necessities of life he turned and walked into the bathroom nick and carol heard a familiar sound get some beer out of the refrigerator and go into the living room troy shouted from behind the closed door we might as well enjoy this part of it two minutes later nick and carol were sitting together on the large couch in the living room troy plopped into the chair opposite them just as nick took a huge swig from his beer once upon a time troy began with a mischievous grin there was a young black named troy jefferson who while diving with his friends vanished for almost two hours in a strange building underneath the ocean when he emerged from his underwater adventure he was rescued by divers from the united states navy who just happened to be in the area at the time soon thereafter young troy was flown in a military helicopter back to key west there he was interrogated at length about why he was swimming in the gulf of mexico all by himself ten miles from the nearest island an hour later he was released without anyone believing any part of his story troy looked back and forth from nick to carol of course he added now more serious i didnt tell them anything that really happened theres no way they would have believed the truth carol was leaning forward on the couch so the navy picked you up just after we left she turned to nick they must have been following us for some reason the missile must have been there after all she thought to herself but where did it go did the navy find it and how are they involved with this crazy laboratory nothing makes sense we spent over an hour looking for you nick was saying he was feeling remorseful because they had abandoned the search for troy so quickly it didnt occur to me that you might still be down in that place whatever it was and of course we couldnt hang around forever all of our electronics were zapped by this funny carpet thing that came out of the sea so we lost all nav he stopped in midsentence and looked at troy im sorry friend dont worry about it troy replied with a shrug i would have done the same thing at least i now know that you have met one of the bizarre characters in my story you didnt by any chance also meet one of the wardens did you great big globs of clear jelly amoebalike with little boxes in the middle and removable rods hanging out all over the top nick shook his head warden carol asked quickly her brow knitted why do you call that thing a warden warden sentinel whatever troy answered they told me the warden things protect the principal cargo of the ship troy stared into the blank gazes of his friends which leads me back to the first question he continued they gave me this bracelet it is some kind of twoway communications device i couldnt begin to explain how it works but i know that they are listening and watching as well as transmitting messages to me only a few of which i understand carol was starting to feel overwhelmed again in her mind this already complex situation had added a new dimension hundreds of questions were crowding into her brain and she could not decide which one to ask first meanwhile nick stood up hold it a minute he said looking dubious and just a little confused did i hear you right did you say you were given a communications bracelet by some extraterrestrials and then released into the ocean and then the navy picked you up and brought you back to key west christ jefferson you do have an imagination save your creativity for that computer game please just tell us the truth i am replied troy really what did they look like carol interrupted her journalistic training taking over she had pulled a small tape recorder the size of a fountain pen out of her purse troy reached over and switched it off for now angel he said this is strictly between us i dont think i saw any of them anyway just the wardens and the carpets and my guess is that theyre just robots machines of some type intelligent yes but controlled by something else jesus nick interrupted youre serious he was becoming exasperated this is turning into the most amazing shaggy dog story that i have ever heard wardens carpets robots i am lost who are they what are they doing in the ocean and why have they given you a bracelet he picked up one of the little pillows on the couch and threw it across the room carol laughed nervously nicks not the only one feeling frustrated troy i was with you down there and i must admit that im having a hard time tracking your story maybe we should stop interrupting and let you talk ive told nick what happened in that solar system room up until you ran out and the thing or warden followed start from there if you would and tell the story in logical sequence im not sure there is such a thing as a logical sequence angel troy replied echoing carols laugh the whole episode defies logic altogether the warden thing eventually trapped me in a blind alley and sort of anesthetized me with one of its rods it was like i was dreaming but the dreams were real i remember a similar feeling after a fistfight when i was a teenager i had a small concussion then i knew that i was alive but i was very very slow to react reality seemed toned down out there in the distance somewhere anyway another warden character showed up same kind of body but different fixtures sticking in the jelly and carried me to what i think was an examination room i dont know exactly how long i was there i was stretched out on the floor and touched by all kinds of instruments my brain felt as if it were in superfast motion but i dont recall any specific thoughts some images i do remember i relived my brother jamie breaking through the line on a trap play and going fortyfive yards for a touchdown in the florida state championship then the bracelet was put on my wrist and i had the distinct impression that someone was talking to me very quietly perhaps even in a foreign language but every now and then i understood what was being said what they told me troy continued with an intense and distant expression on his face was that what we call the laboratory is really a space vehicle from another world and that it has crashlanded in a sense on the earth to allow time for some difficult repairs they that is whoever built the ship need help from us from me and you to obtain some of the specific items necessary for the repairs then they can continue on their journey nick was now sitting on the floor just opposite troy both carol and he were hanging on every word they sat in silence for almost thirty seconds after troy had finished if this story is true nick finally spoke then we are there was a loud knock at the door all three of them jumped several seconds later the knock repeated troy went to the door and partially opened it there you are you little shit carol and nick heard a gruff angry voice say captain homer ashford pushed through the door he didnt see nick and carol at first we had a deal and youve welshed on it you have been back two hours already out of the corner of his eye captain homer saw that there were other people in the room he turned around to talk to greta who had not yet entered the house guess what he said nick williams and miss dawson are also here no wonder we couldnt find her at the hotel greta followed homer into the living room her clear expressionless eyes spent no more than one second staring at each of the trio carol thought she saw just a trace of disdain in gretas look but she wasnt certain homer turned to carol the tone in his voice markedly more civil we saw you two return from your excursion around two oclock he said with a fake smile but somehow we missed troy he winked at carol and turned to nick find any more exciting trinkets today williams nick had never made any attempt to hide the fact that he did not like captain homer why of course captain he answered sneering the epithet would you believe we found a veritable mountain of gold and silver bars looked like that santa rosa stack we had on the boat one afternoon must be about eight years ago remember that was before jake and i let you and greta unload it homers voice had a nasty edge to it i should have sued you for slander williams that would have shut your loud mouth once and for all you had your day in court now knock off the crap or one day youll have more trouble than you can handle while nick and homer were trading insults and threats greta was strutting around the living room as if she were in her own house she seemed to be oblivious to the conversation and even to the presence of the other people in the room she was wearing a tight white muscle shirt and a pair of navy blue shorts when greta walked she carried her arms high her back straight and her breasts erect carol was intrigued by her behavior she watched greta stop and sort through troys compact discs greta pulled out the disc with the cover picture of angie leatherwood and licked her lips this pair belongs in a kinky novel carol thought as she overheard troy tell captain homer that he was busy this afternoon but would get back to him later whats their story wondered carol and where does fat ellen fit in carol remembered that she was scheduled to interview the three of them later in the evening but im not sure that i really want to find out we were calling to tell you to bring your swimming suit tonight captain homer was addressing carol she had missed the first part of his statement while she was watching greta parade around the room pardon me she said politely could you repeat what you just said im afraid i had drifted away for a few seconds i said that you should come early about eight oclock homer replied and bring your suit we have a most interesting and unusual pool during this exchange greta walked up behind nick and quickly reached both arms around him with everyone else in the room watching she lightly twisted his nipples through his polo shirt and laughed when he jumped you always did like that ya nikki she said releasing him after an instant carol saw anger flash in homers eyes nick started to say something but greta had already walked out the front door before he could register a protest be sure to call me when youre through here homer said to troy after an embarrassing silence we need to straighten out a few things the older man turned around awkwardly and without additional comment followed greta toward his mercedes parked in front of troys house now where were we said troy abstractedly as he closed the door behind homer and greta you said nick with emphasis were telling us an amazing story and had almost reached the punch line where you were going to tell us what we could do to help some aliens who landed here on earth to repair their space vehicle but first i for one would like some explanations i dont know if i believe any of this wild fairy tale youre telling us but i will admit that it is extremely creative what concerns me at this minute however is not the issue of creatures from another world its those two reallife sleazebag human beings who just left what did they want and are they somehow involved in our current adventure just a minute nick carol intervened before we become sidetracked i would like to know what kind of help these ets of troys want from us a telephone a new spaceship lets find this out now and talk about homer and your girlfriend greta later her reference to greta was light and playful nick accepted it with good humor and feigned a wound then he nodded his assent to carols suggestion troy pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket and took a deep breath now you guys must understand that im not yet absolutely certain that i am properly receiving all their messages but this particular transmission where they list the things they need from us is repeated every half hour my interpretation of it hasnt changed for the last ninety minutes so im fairly certain that i have it right its a long list and of course i dont pretend to comprehend why they want all this stuff but i am certain you will both find it very interesting troy started reading from his handwritten list they want an english dictionary and grammar plus the same thing for four other major languages an encyclopedia of plant and animal life a compact world history a statistical tract defining the current political and economic status of the world a comparative study of the worlds major existing religions complete issues covering the last two years of at least three significant daily newspapers summary journals of science and technology including surveys of weapon systems both deployed and under development an encyclopedia of the arts preferably including video and sound where appropriate fortyseven pounds of lead and fiftyeight pounds of gold nick whistled when troy was finished at carols request troy handed the sheet to her and nick read it another time over her shoulder absorbing every item neither of them said anything believe it or not troy added as an afterthought about a minute later the first eight items are not too difficult to obtain i stopped by the key west public library on the way home from the marina and for a fee they are preparing for me a set of compact discs that contain virtually all of the requested information the difficult items are at the end of the list thats where your help is needed troy stopped for a second to see if nick and carol were following him just to make certain i understand nick was now walking slowly around the room with the list in his hand what you want or they want if you will is for us to return to their laboratory or vehicle or whatever it is with all this information plus the lead and gold troy nodded but fiftyeight pounds of gold thats about a million dollars worth where would we get it and what would they do with it anyway troy acknowledged that he didnt know the answers to those questions but i have the feeling he added again based upon what i think they are telling me that partially satisfying their needs will make their task that much easier so i guess we do what we can and hope that its enough nick shook his head back and forth you know carol he said as he handed the list back to her never in my wildest flights of imagination could i have concocted such an intricate and crazy scheme this entire thing is so unbelievable and fantastic that it just begs to be accepted its pure genius troy smiled so you will help after all he asked i didnt say that answered nick i still have lots of questions and of course i cant speak for miss dawson but somehow even if its all make believe the idea of playing the good samaritan for an extraterrestrial ship is very appealing during the next half hour both carol and nick questioned troy extensively troy dismissed homer and greta in a hurry simply stating that he had agreed on thursday night to keep them informed about what was happening onboard the florida queen in exchange for a shortterm loan he also indicated that he never intended to really give them any information but that was all right because they were crooks anyway nick was not completely satisfied with troys explanation he felt that he was not being told the whole truth in fact the more questions he asked the more doubt there was in nicks mind about the entire story troy was telling but what are the other options nick thought to himself i have seen that carpet with my own eyes if it is not an et or at least made by one then it must be a very advanced robot designed by us or the russians as he continued to question troy nicks facile mind began to construct an alternative scenario admittedly wild and improbable but one that nevertheless explained all the events of the previous three days in a way that nick found just as reasonable as troys crazy story about the alien space vehicle suppose somehow troy and that turd homer are working with the russians and this entire thing is just an elaborate cover for a rendezvous where illegal information will be passed homer would do anything for money but why would troy do it having troy participate in a scheme to sell us secrets to a foreign country was the acknowledged weakness in nicks alternative explanation but he rationalized it by convincing himself that perhaps troy needed a lot of extra money to pay for all the electronic equipment in his computer game he certainly couldnt have saved enough money from his paltry salary nick continued thinking so suppose these computer discs of troys have secret military data instead of all that crazy information he just listed then the gold could this payoff or someone elses nick asked several more questions about the gold troy admitted he did not understand very well what they were telling him through the bracelet about why they needed the lead and the gold he just mumbled something about those two elements being difficult to produce by transmutation and then added nothing else for her part carol grew more and more convinced that the story troy was telling was true his inability to answer all the questions did not disturb her as a matter of fact given the rather fantastic nature of his story if he had had pat answers to all the questions she would have felt less assured of its truth despite her critical journalistic background she found herself intrigued and a little enchanted by the idea that some superaliens from another world needed her help carols intuition was just as important as her rational thought processes in the formation of her opinion first of all she trusted troy she watched him very carefully when he answered the questions and did not see the slightest indication that he was lying she had no doubt that troy believed he was telling the truth but whether troy was indeed telling the truth or was instead being manipulated and directed by the very ets that he was purporting to represent was another issue altogether but for what purpose she reasoned theres not much that the three of us can do for them even the information they requested except for the weapons stuff is relatively innocuous she temporarily set aside the notion that her friend troy had become some kind of pawn for the aliens carol could tell that nick was growing more suspicious nick thought it was very peculiar that there were three navy divers in the water at the exactly correct location when one of the carpets ushered troy to the surface and troys report of the interrogation process after they had flown him to key west was so confused that nick became exasperated again christ jefferson he said you either have a very short or a very convenient memory you tell us that the navy kept you in custody for almost an hour yet you hardly remember any of their questions and have no idea why they were interrogating you that just doesnt sound right to me troy was becoming a little angry shit nick i told you that i was tired i had been through a traumatic experience their questions didnt make sense to me and the entire time i felt as if a little voice was trying to make itself heard inside my head nick turned to carol i think im changing my mind i dont want to play in this game no matter how clever it is homer and greta annoy me but i can deal with them if its necessary on the other hand the navy scares me there was some reason they were following us its just too damn unlikely to be a coincidence maybe troy knows something about it and maybe he doesnt i cant tell but i dont like the smell of it he stood up to leave carol motioned for nick to sit down and took a deep breath look you two she said in a low voice i have a confession to make and it seems as if this is the perfect time to make it i did not come down here to key west to look for whales she glanced at nick and not for treasure either i came here to check out a rumor that a new navy missile had gone astray and crashed in the gulf of mexico she paused several seconds to let her message register i probably should have told you earlier but i never found the right time im truly sorry and you thought the missile was in the fissure said troy a few seconds later which was why you came back yesterday we were going to salvage it for you and give you a worldwide scoop added nick his feeling of betrayal softened somewhat by the obvious sincerity of her apology you were using us all the time you could call it that carol conceded but as a reporter i dont see it that way she noticed the tension in the room nick seemed especially guarded but now it doesnt matter anyway she continued what is important is that i have given an explanation for the navys presence at the dive site during the last two days i have made several inquiries at all levels about the clandestine activities that the navy currently has underway to search for the missile last night that mexican lieutenant got a good look at our best closeups of the missile in the fissure undoubtedly someone put two and two together look angel troy spoke after another short silence i dont know anything about a missile and too much is going on for me to be hurt because you lied to me im sure you had your reasons what i need to know now is whether or not you will help me take this stuff back to the ets or aliens or whatever you want to call them before carol could answer nick stood up again and started walking toward the door im very hungry he announced and i want to think through this entire situation if you dont mind troy ill have an early supper and meet you later on tonight with my answer carol realized that she also was extremely hungry it had been a long exhausting day and she had not eaten anything significant since breakfast she was also a little concerned about nicks response to her confession why dont i join you for a bite she said to nick he gave a noncommittal shrug as if to say suit yourself carol gave troy a hug lets all meet at my room in the marriott around seventhirty i have to go there anyway to dress for my interview with the triple creeps you guys can give me some pointers her humor did not lighten the atmosphere in the room troy was clearly worried about something his face was very earnest almost stern professor he said to nick in a soft and deliberate monotone i know i didnt have all the answers to your questions i dont even have the answers to my own but i do know one thing for certain nothing like this has ever happened on the earth before at least not in recorded history the creatures who built that spaceship are when compared to us as we would appear to the ants or the bees if they could comprehend us they have asked the three of us for help in repairing their vehicle to say that this is a onceinalifetime opportunity would be a colossal understatement it would be great if we could sit around and debate this issue for weeks or even months but we cant time is running out the navy is certain to find them soon maybe they have already with possibly dire circumstances for the human beings on this planet they have made it clear to me that their mission must be fulfilled that they must repair their vehicle and continue their voyage even if they must interfere with the earth system to achieve their goal i know all this sounds incredible maybe even absurd but i am going to collect some lead weights from my diver friends and pick up the compact discs at the library with or without your help i want to be over their spaceship at dawn tomorrow nick studied troy very carefully during this speech for an instant in the middle it seemed as if it were not troy speaking at all but someone or something else speaking through him an eerie chill raced down nicks spine shit he thought im as bad as they are im now caught up in this thing too he gestured to carol to follow him and walked out the door as i have told you twice before the voice sounded tired and bored i was out diving with my friends nick williams and carol dawson she had a problem with her equipment and decided to make a quick return to the boat we had found a particularly interesting reef with some very unusual features and we werent certain we would be able to locate it again so i decided to stay and wait for her to come back when i finally surfaced half an hour later there was no sign of them or the boat the recorder clicked off the two lieutenants stared at each other shit ramirez do you believe that bastards story any part of it the other man shook his head then why the hell did you let him go that black shitass sat there for an hour making fools out of us with ridiculous answers to our questions and then you summarily released him we cant detain someone without positive evidence of wrong doing responded ramirez as if he were quoting from a military manual and swimming in the ocean ten miles from the nearest island although strange does not constitute wrong doing ramirez could see that his colleague was scowling besides he never slipped up he always told exactly the same story the same bullshit you mean lieutenant richard todd leaned back in his chair the two men were sitting around a small conference table in an old room with white plaster walls the tape recorder was on the table in front of them next to an empty ashtray he didnt even believe his own story he just sat there that cocky grin on his black face knowing that we couldnt charge him with anything todd put all four of his chair legs back on the floor and pounded the table for emphasis an experienced diver would never stay down by himself for five minutes much less thirty too many things could go wrong as for his friends why the hell did they leave him now todd stood up and made gestures in the air with his hands ill tell you why lieutenant because they knew he was all right that he had been picked up by a russian submarine shit i told you we should have taken one of the new vessels we probably could have spotted the sub with the upgraded electronic gear ramirez was playing idly with the glass ashtray while todd was giving his lecture you really believe that those three are involved with the russians in this dont you it sure seems farfetched to me fucking a replied todd nothing else makes even a tittle sense every engineer we have talked to says there are no conceivable failures that are consistent both with the observed behavior of the missile and the telemetry we received at our tracking stations so the russians must have commanded it off course todd grew excited as he explained the rest of the plot the russians knew they would need some local help to find the exact location of the missile in the ocean so they hired williams and crew to search for the bird and then tell them where it was they planned to pick it up with one of their subs adding that dawson woman to their team was a master stroke her inquiries have slowed down our own search by making us more concerned about the press lieutenant ramirez laughed you always sound convincing richard but we still do not have even one shred of evidence i dont believe troy jeffersons story any more than you do but there could be many reasons why he lied only one of which is any of our business besides there still is a fundamental problem with your explanation why would the russians go to all this trouble just to seize a panther missile you and i and even commander winters may not know the true story of the panther missile todd countered quickly it may be designed to carry some new breakthrough weapon that we havent even heard about its not all that unusual for the navy to represent a project falsely and to keep its true purpose hidden he stopped to think but whats motivating the russians is not that important to us we have evidence of a conspiracy here our job is to stop it ramirez did not reply right away he continued to push the ashtray around on the table i guess i no longer view it that way he said at length gazing directly at todd i see no substantial evidence of any conspiracy unless commander winters himself orders additional work from my department i am abandoning my investigation he looked at his watch at least i can still spend saturday night and sunday with my family he rose to leave and what if i bring you proof todd asked making no effort to hide his disgust with ramirez proof will convince winters as well ramirez answered coldly i have taken enough risk on this project i will not take any more action unless instructed by the proper authority winters wasnt really certain he would find something appropriate ordinarily he carefully avoided shopping malls especially on a saturday afternoon but while he had been lying on the couch watching one of the ncaa basketball games and sipping a beer he had remembered how pleased he had been when helen turnbull who had played maggie had given him a set of unusual tile coasters after the opening weekend of cat on a hot tin roof its a fading tradition in the theater i fear the experienced actress had said when he thanked her but giving small presents after the opening night or nights is still my way of congratulating those people i have enjoyed working with the mall was crowded with saturday shoppers and commander winters felt oddly conspicuous as if everyone were looking at him he walked around for several minutes before he even thought about what kind of gift he might get for her something simple of course he thought nothing that could be misinterpreted just a nice memento or souvenir he saw tiffani in his minds eye as she had appeared in his fantasy just before he had fallen asleep the night before the image embarrassed him in the shopping crowd and he nervously called up another picture this one wholesome and acceptable of the little girl tiffani during his conversation with her father her hair he thought remembering the pigtails ill buy her something for her hair he walked into a gift shop and tried to make some sense out of the jumble of bricabrac that lined the walls and was assembled on top of an assortment of tables in no identifiable pattern can i help you winters jumped when a salesgirl approached him from behind he shook his head now why did you do that he said to himself of course you need help otherwise youll never find anything excuse me young lady he almost shouted at the retreating salesgirl i guess i could use some advice i want to buy a present winters again felt as if everyone were watching him for my niece he added quickly the salesgirl was a brunette about twenty very plain but with an eager face did you have anything in mind she asked her hair was long like tiffanis winters relaxed a little sort of he said she has beautiful long hair like yours what could i get her that would be really special its her birthday again he felt a strange anxiety that he did not understand what color the girl asked the question didnt make sense i dont even know yet what i want he replied with a puzzled expression so i certainly dont know the color the salesgirl smiled what color is your nieces hair she said very slowly almost as if she were speaking to a mental retard oh of course winters laughed reddishbrown auburn he said and its very long you said that already a voice whispered inside of him you are acting like a fool the salesgirl motioned for him to follow her and they walked back to the rear of the store she pointed at a small round glass case full of combs of all shapes and sizes these would make excellent gifts for your niece she said there was an inflection in her voice when she said the word niece that bothered winters could she know something one of her friends or maybe she was at the play he took a breath and calmed himself again winters was astounded by the volatility of his emotions on one of the small shelves were two beautiful matching brown combs with gold filigree across the top one of the combs was large enough to hold all that magnificent hair in a chignon against her neck the other smaller comb was a perfect size to adorn the side or back of her hairstyle ill take those he said to the girl the ones with the gold work along the top and please giftwrap them for me the efficient salesgirl reached inside the display case and pulled out the combs she told winters to wait a couple of minutes while she wrapped the present she disappeared into the back of the store and winters was left alone ill leave them on her dressing table at the end of intermission he was thinking he conjured up a picture of tiffani going into the dressing room by herself and finding the present under her nameplate against the mirror winters smiled as he imagined her reaction at that moment a woman with her eight or nineyearold daughter brushed by him in the store pardon me the woman said without looking around as she and the little girl rushed to finger some easter baskets hanging on the wall the salesgirl had finished wrapping the present and was standing next to the computer cash register when winters reached the counter she handed him a small card that had happy birthday imprinted on the upper left corner winters stared at it for a few seconds no he said finally no card ill buy another at the stationery store cash or charge the girl asked him winters panicked for a moment i dont know if i have enough cash on me he thought and how would i ever explain the charge to betty he opened his wallet and counted his money he smiled at the girl and said cash please when he realized that he had almost fifty dollars the bill was only thirtytwo dollars including the tax commander winters felt a rush of joy as he nearly skipped out of the store his earlier nervousness had completely disappeared he even began to whistle just before he pushed open the door and left the enclosed airconditioned environment of the mall i hope she likes the combs he said to himself then he smiled again i know she will nick poured the last of the bottle of chablis into carols glass i dont think i could ever be a journalist he said to be successful it sounds to me as if you have to be a sneak carol moved a piece of broiled catfish mixed with some cauliflower onto her fork and put the bite in her mouth its not that much different from any other job there are always questions of ethics as well as places where your personal and professional lives come into conflict she finished chewing her food and swallowed before she continued i had thought that maybe i would tell you and troy on friday evening but things just didnt work out as you know if you had nick pushed his plate away to indicate that he was finished with his meal then everything would have been different i would have been aware of the possible danger and most likely it would have been you and i in that place together who knows what might have happened then ive had worse conflicts before carol took a drink from her glass of wine she wanted to finish with this subject in her way right after i graduated from stanford i worked for the san francisco chronicle i was dating lucas tipton a little at the time that the warrior drug scandal broke i used the social contacts i had made through him to obtain a unique slant on the story lucas never forgave me so im used to problems they go with the territory a waiter came by and poured them some coffee but now that i have finished apologizing for the third time carol said pointedly i hope we can go back to more important matters i must tell you nick that i find your russian plot idea absolutely off the wall the weakest element is troy theres simply no way he could be a spy its preposterous more preposterous than a superalien space vehicle in need of repairs at the bottom of the gulf of mexico nick countered stubbornly besides i have a definite motive money did you see all the equipment he has wrapped up in that computer game angie probably makes enough off her royalties in one week to cover all that computer stuff carol replied she reached across the table and put her hand on nicks forearm now dont overreact but you know there are some relationships where the woman carries the financial load i can tell that she loves him theres no doubt in my mind that she would offer to help him then why did he try to borrow money from me and then captain homer on thursday night hell nick i dont know carol was becoming slightly frustrated but its irrelevant anyway i cant imagine any set of conditions unless i was convinced that i was going to be killed that would prevent my going back out there with troy whatever the truth is it is certainly a sensational story im surprised you are so hesitant i thought you were an adventurer carol stared directly across the table at nick he thought he saw a flicker of flirtation hiding behind her unwavering gaze you are one fascinating woman he thought and youre taunting me a little now i caught your double meaning he remembered how good he had felt when he held her on the boat in the afternoon underneath that aggressive veneer is another person beautiful and intelligent hard as nails one minute and a vulnerable little girl the next nick was certain that any hope he might have of continuing his relationship with carol was dependant on his helping troy she wasnt interested in men who were not willing to take chances i used to be nick finally replied he twirled his empty wine glass in his hand i dont know what happened i guess i got stung a couple of times and that has made me more cautious particularly where people are concerned but i will admit that if i stand back from this situation and imagine myself as simply an observer i find the whole affair absolutely fascinating carol finished her wine and put the glass back on the table nick was quiet she drummed her fingers on the tabletop and smiled well she said fixing him with her eyes and picking up her coffee cup have you made a decision he laughed okay okay ill do it now it was his turn to reach out and touch her arm for lots of reasons good she remarked now that something has been decided why dont you help me prepare for my interview with captain homer and the crew how much was the stuff worth that you pulled up from the santa rosa and who was jake i must act as if im serious about this story carol put her fountain pen tape recorder on the table and turned it on we officially cleared a little over two million dollars jake lewis and i each received ten percent amanda winchester was reimbursed for the expense advance plus twentyfive percent of the profit homer ellen and greta kept the rest nick stopped but carol indicated for him to continue jake lewis was the only close friend i have ever had as an adult he was an absolute peach of a person honest hardworking intelligent and loyal and completely naive he fell for greta like a ton of bricks she manipulated him completely and then used his love to her own advantage nick looked away out the window of the small seafood restaurant at some seagulls who were soaring over the water in the fading twilight the night we came back with the big haul jake and i agreed that one of the two of us would always be awake even then there was something peculiar in the homerellengreta triangle at that time they were not yet all living together but i still didnt trust them while jake was supposedly on watch greta balled his brains out to celebrate he said when he apologized to me for falling asleep afterwards when i woke up more than half of the treasure was gone anger long buried was seething in nick carol watched him carefully noting the intensity of his passion jake didnt give a shit about the money he even tried to talk amanda and me out of going to court thats the kind of guy he was i remember he told me hey nick my friend we made two hundred thousand apiece out of this we cannot prove there was more lets just be thankful and get on with our lives homer had cheated him and greta had shit all over him but jake still wasnt pissed not much more than a year later he married a water ski queen from winter haven bought a house in orlando and went to work as an aerospace engineer the light was vanishing outside nick was deep in a memory recalling the full measure of his storm of righteous indignation from eight years before ive never understood them carol said quietly she switched off the recorder nick turned and looked at her a quizzical frown on his face you know she added the people like your friend jake infinite resiliency no harbored grudges whatever happens to them they just shake off like water and go on living cheerfully it was her turn to feel a little emotion sometimes i wish i could be more like that then i wouldnt be afraid they stared at each other in the soft light nick put his hand over hers and theres that vulnerable little girl again he felt a deep emotional longing stirring in his heart shes let me see it twice in a single day carol he said gently i want to thank you for this afternoon you know for sharing your feelings with me i feel like i saw an entirely different carol dawson you did she said smiling and making it clear that her protective shield was going up again and only time will tell if it was a huge mistake she pulled her hand slowly away from his for the moment though we have other business back to the menage a trois what kind of facility is it that they manage and what do they do there excuse me replied nick obviously confused a friend of mine dr dale michaels of the miami oceanographic institute told me that captain homer and ellen have some kind of hightech operation here i dont remember exactly how he described it you must be mistaken nick interrupted i have known them for almost ten years and they are never anywhere except in that fancy house of his or onboard the ambrosia carol was puzzled dales information is always correct he just told me yesterday in fact that homer ashford had field tested the institutes most advanced underwater sentries throughout the last five years and that his reports hold it hold it nick was leaning forward on the table im not sure im following you back up this could be very very important carol started again one of mois newest product areas is underwater sentries robots essentially that protect aquaculture farms from sophisticated thieves as well as large fish or whales dale said that homer contributes money for the research and then field tests the prototypes son of a bitch nick was standing up he was bursting with excitement how could i have been so stupid of course of course now carol was lost would you mind telling me whats going on certainly nick answered but right now were in a hurry we have to go by my apartment to look at an old map and pick up another navigation system for the boat ill explain everything on the way nick put his key card in the reader and the garage door opened he pulled his pontiac into his reserved spot and stopped the car so you see he was saying to carol he knew that we wouldnt find anything he let us search both his house and the lot that he had bought for his new mansion down at pelican point we found nothing at that time it was still hidden somewhere out in the ocean did you look in the water around his new property at that time yes we did jake and i each dove there on separate days we found a very interesting subterranean cave but no sign of any of the santa rosa treasure but we must have given him the idea i bet he moved the stuff there a year or two after jake left he probably figured it was safe by then and he had doubtless worried himself sick that someone would discover the treasure out in the ocean you see it all fits including his involvement with underwater sentries carol nodded and laughed a little it certainly makes better sense than your idea that troy was working for the russians they opened the doors and climbed out of the car so how much do you think they have left carol asked as they headed for the elevator who knows nick answered maybe they stole three million out of five he thought for a minute they must still have a bunch otherwise greta would have split by now the elevator doors opened and nick pressed the button for the third floor carol heaved a big sigh whats the matter he asked im exhausted she said i feel as if im on a carousel thats spinning faster and faster so much has happened in the last three days im not sure i could deal with much more what i need now is a second wind magic days nick replied as they walked out of the elevator these are magic days she looked at him with a curious expression he laughed ill explain an old theory of mine later he said he entered a sequence of numbers into the small plate on his door and the lock disengaged nick moved to the side with feigned gallantry and let carol enter first what she saw was chaos the place was a total shambles in the living room just beyond the kitchen area all of nicks precious novels had been scattered randomly about on the floor the couch and the chairs it looked as if someone had taken each book out of the bookcase held it up and shook it and then either dropped it or thrown it across the room nick pushed by carol and stared at the destruction shit he said the kitchen had been plundered as well all the drawers were open pots pans and tableware were strewn on the counters and on the floor to nicks right the cardboard boxes containing his memorabilia had been pulled into the middle of the second bedroom their contents had been partially dumped onto the floor around them what hurricane hit this place carol asked as she surveyed the mess i didnt expect you to be a good housekeeper but this is ridiculous nick was unable to laugh at carols comment he checked the master bedroom and found that it also had been ransacked he then returned to the living room and started picking up his beloved novels and stacking them neatly on the coffee table he winced when he found his worn copy of letranger by albert camus the spine of the book was destroyed this is not the work of vandals he said as carol knelt down to help they were searching for something specific have you found anything missing yet she asked no nick replied picking up another novel with a mutilated cover and shaking his head but the bastards have really screwed up my books she stacked his faulkner collection on the easy chair i can see why troy was impressed she said have you really read all these novels nick nodded carol picked one up that had fallen under the television stand whats this about she held up the book ive never even heard of it nick had just arranged another dozen books on the coffee table oh thats a fantastic novel he said enthusiastically forgetting for a moment that his condominium had just been trashed the whole story is told through this exchange of letters among all the principal characters its set in eighteenthcentury france and the main couple socially prominent and bored cement their weird relationship by sharing details of their affairs with other lovers of course it caused quite a scandal in europe that doesnt exactly sound like your typical harlequin romance carol remarked trying to commit the title of the book to her memory nick stood up and walked into the smaller bedroom he began to sort through the contents of the cardboard boxes there are things missing in here he called out to carol she stopped arranging books and joined him in the bedroom all my photographs of the santa rosa treasure and even the newspaper clippings are gone thats odd he said carol was beside him on the floor in front of the boxes she frowned is the trident still on the boat yes he answered he stopped rifling through the papers down in the bottom drawer of the electronics cabinet you think theres a connection she nodded i think that was what they were after i dont know why it just seems right nick picked up a large yellow folder that had been on the floor and replaced it in one of the cardboard boxes a photograph and some sheets of typing paper fell out carol picked up the picture while nick scrambled after the papers she studied the photo and read the french inscription she was surprised to feel a twinge of jealousy beautiful she commented she noticed the pearls also very rich and sophisticated she doesnt look like your type she handed moniques photograph to nick despite his attempt to be nonchalant he was blushing that was a long time ago he mumbled as he hastily stuffed the photo back into the folder really carol said eyeing him carefully she looks as if shes about our age it couldnt have been too long ago nick was flustered he packed some more loose material in the boxes and glanced at his watch wed better leave soon if were going to meet troy at your hotel he stood up carol remained kneeling on the floor looking up at him with a steady gaze its a long story he said someday ill tell you all about it carols curiosity was piqued she followed nick out of his condominium and into the elevator he was still ill at ease bullseye she thought to herself i think i have just discovered a major key to mr williams a woman named monique she smiled as nick motioned for her to precede him out of the elevator and the man does love his books carols room at the marriott had two entrances the normal approach to the room was by way of the corridor that led to the lobby but there was another door that opened on the garden and the pool when she exercised in the morning carol always used the garden entrance nick and carol were talking casually but quietly as they came toward her room from the lobby she pulled out her electronic card key just before they arrived as she started to insert the card into the lock they heard an unusual sound like metal banging against metal from the inside of her room before carol could say anything nick shushed her by putting his finger to his mouth you heard it too she whispered softly he nodded his head using gestures he asked her if there was another entrance to the room she pointed out the door to the hotel grounds at the end of the corridor palm trees and tropical hedges covered most of the area to the east of the marriott swimming pool nick and carol left the walkway leading to the pool and crept up to the windows of her room the venetian blinds were drawn but they could still see into the room through a crack under the bottom of the blinds at first the room was completely dark then a solitary beam from a flashlight reflected for an instant off one of the walls in that split second they saw a silhouetted figure in the neighborhood of the television set but they could not identify him the flashlight came on again and it paused for a moment on the door to the corridor the door was bolted in the brief flicker of the light beam carol also saw that all her dresser drawers were open nick crawled over next to carol in the flower bed just under the windows you stay here and watch he whispered ill go get something from the car dont let them know youre here he squeezed her shoulder and disappeared carol stayed glued to the window once more the flashlight came on illuminating electronic parts spread out on the far bed carol strained for a look at who was holding the flashlight she couldnt see him she became acutely aware of the passage of time her intuition told her that the intruder was getting ready to leave she suddenly realized she was completely exposed sitting out there underneath the window come on nick she said to herself hurry it up or i may be chopped liver the figure in the room moved toward the garden door and then stopped carol felt her pulse rate increase at just that moment nick returned out of breath he had brought back a long crowbar from the trunk of his car carol motioned to him to stand by the door that the intruder was about to come out she saw the figure put his hand on the doorknob and she flattened herself against the dirt nick was behind the door poised to deliver a powerful blow to whoever exited from the room the door opened nick started to strike troy screamed carol from the flower bed he jumped back just in time barely missing the downward swoop of nicks crowbar carol was on her feet in an instant she ran up to a shaken troy are you all right she said his eyes were wide from fright jesus professor he said glancing at the crowbar that nick was wielding you might have killed me shit jefferson nick replied the adrenaline still coursing through his system why didnt you tell us it was you and what were you doing in carols room he looked at troy accusingly troy backed into the room and turned on the lights the room was a disaster it looked like nicks condominium when carol had first walked through the front door carol turned to troy why on earth i didnt do it angel he replied honest injun troy looked at his two friends sit down he said this will only take a second meanwhile carols eyes were scanning the room crap she said angrily all my cameras and film are gone and virtually the entire telescope system including the postprocessor unit dale will shoot me she looked in one of the open drawers the assholes took my photographs from the first dive as well they were in a large envelope on the right side of this top drawer carol sat down on the bed looking a little dazed all the film from the photographs that i took inside that place has been stolen so much for my sensational story she said nick tried to comfort her who knows maybe theyll turn up and besides yal still have all the negatives from the first dive carol shook her head its not the same thing she thought for a minute damnit she said i should have kept the exposed film with me when we left the hotel to go to troys apartment she looked at the two men and then brightened a bit oh well she said theres always tomorrow troy was still waiting patiently to give his explanation he indicated for nick to sit down on the bed next to carol ill make this short and sweet he said just the facts i arrived here about seven oclock i came early because i wanted to make some modifications to your television set ill explain why in a minute the people in the hotel wouldnt give me a key to your room so i came down here and fooled the card reader he smiled its no problem for someone who knows how these things work anyway as soon as the green light came on and the guard bolt released i heard the garden door slam someone had been in the room while i was opening the door i caught a fleeting glimpse of him as he hightailed it around the corner of the building he was a big man not someone i recognized immediately he was moving with difficulty as if he were carrying something heavy part of the ocean telescope carol said go on added nick what happened next i want to hear why you were in carols room working in the dark i bet youll come up with a good story for that too thats easy troy said to nick i was afraid the thief or thieves might come back i didnt want them to see me youre amazing jefferson nick responded youre the kind of person who would tell a cop that you were exceeding the speed limit because you wanted to get to a filling station before you ran out of gas and the cop would believe him carol remarked they all laughed the tension in the room was diffusing all right said nick now tell us what youve done to the television incidentally how did you get inside it i thought these hotel sets were all alarmed they are troy replied but its very simple to disable the alarm system it always cracks me up somebody sells the hotel the idea that they can protect their property with these alarms but the burglars can easily find out what system has been installed buy the circuit data sheets and completely disable the protection troy glanced around the room he then checked his watch carefully lets see he said why dont you two move over here in these chairs i think youll be able to see better nick and carol exchanged puzzled looks and arranged themselves as troy had requested now he continued in a surprisingly serious tone you will see what i believe is incontrovertible proof that my story about the aliens is true they have told me through this bracelet that they are going to televise a short program from inside the vehicle at exactly seventhirty if i have translated their directions properly and made the correct modifications this television should now be able to receive their transmission he turned on the set and put it on channel there was nothing but snow and static this is great troy nick commented it will probably steal rating points from soap operas and music videos watching this requires even less intelligence a picture suddenly appeared on the screen the lighting was poor but carol immediately recognized herself in the scene she was standing with her back to the cameras her fingers moving around on top of what appeared to be a table an orchestral version of silent night featuring an instrument not unlike an organ accompanied the picture thats the music room i told you about carol said to nick i guess that warden thing had a video camera in all his paraphernalia the television scene switched immediately to a closeup of carols eyes for five seconds her marvelous frightened eyes filled almost the entire screen she blinked twice before the camera pulled back and revealed her in front view terrified standing and shaking in her bathing suit carol shuddered as she recalled the horror of those seconds when the wardens appendages intruded upon her person it was all shown in the video some parts even in slow motion one of the featured scenes was the deliberate movement of the bristles across her chest including both her erect nipples oh my god she thought i hadnt realized they were erect maybe fear does that carol squirmed she felt surprisingly embarrassed in front of nick there was a jump discontinuity in the program in the next scene the three of them were looking at troy lying on his back on the floor somewhere with enough wires and cords attached to him that he could have been gulliver bound by the lilliputians the camera panned around the room two wardens were in one of the corners their upper body attachments were not even similar but they both had the same central body amoebalike that had confronted troy and carol on the other side of the room a pair of carpets were standing together from their motions it looked as if they were engaged in a conversation nick and carol and troy watched while the camera stayed fixed for about ten seconds the carpets apparently finished conferring and then flipped off in separate directions the final frames of the transmission were a closeup of troys head showing more than a hundred probes and inserts connected to his brain then the screen went back to snow and static wowee said nick after a moment can i have an instant replay he stood up from the bed you were terrific he remarked to carol but i think your scenes will have to be edited if we want a pg rating carol looked up at him and blushed slightly sorry nick but i dont think you make a good comedian we have one already she nodded at troy and i think thats enough she glanced at the clock beside her bed now i figure we have fifteen minutes or so to make plans no more and i have to dress as well why dont you tell troy about your decision and what you have concluded about the santa rosa loot while i change my clothes she grabbed a blouse and a pair of pants and headed for the bathroom hey wait a minute nick protested arent we going to discuss who it was that broke into my condominium and your hotel room carol stopped outside the bathroom door there are only two possibilities that make any sense she said its either the navy or our sicko friends from the ambrosia either way well find out soon enough she stopped a moment and an elfin smile played across her lips i want you two to see if you can figure out a way to steal homers gold tonight before we go back to meet with our extraterrestrials tomorrow morning carol and troy went over the details one last time and she checked her watch its eightthirty already she said if im much later i know theyll be suspicious she was standing outside nicks pontiac in the parking lot of the pelican resort a restaurant about threequarters of a mile from the ashford mansion at pelican point where is he she fretted we should have finished with this fifteen minutes ago just calm down angel troy replied we have to test this new unit first it could be very important in an emergency and ive never actually used it he gave her a reassuring hug your friends at moi originally developed it why did i have to suggest such a wildass idea carol said out loud to herself wheres your brain dawson did you leave it in the can you hear me nicks garbled voice interrupted her it sounded as if it were coming from the bottom of a well yes troy answered into a tiny walkietalkie shaped like a thimble but not too clearly how deep are you say again said nick i did not copy completely yes we can hear you troy shouted he carefully enunciated each word but not very clearly you must speak slowly and distinctly how deep are you about eight feet was the response go down to sixteen and try it again said troy lets see if it will work from the deepest part of the cave hows he doing that carol asked while they waited for nick to descend its a brandnew system built into the regulator troy answered you have to speak while youre exhaling for it to work theres a small transmitterreceiver inside the mouthpiece and an earphone attachment unfortunately it doesnt work much below ten feet almost a minute later carol and troy heard something very faint not even recognizable as nicks voice troy listened for a moment we cannot read you nick there is too much attenuation come on back now im going to send carol on her way troy pressed a button on the walkietalkie that would repeatedly transmit this last message he handed the communications unit to carol okay angel he said youre ready we should be in the water around nine oclock and out if all goes well by half an hour later keep them occupied with your questions you should leave by tenthirty at the latest and drive directly to nicks apartment we will meet you there with your wagon he raised his eyebrows and the gold i hope carol took a deep breath she smiled at troy im scared she said i would rather face a carpet or even one of those warden things than this trio she opened the car door do you really think i should go in nicks car isnt that certain to make them suspect something weve been through all this twice before angel troy laughingly replied he gently nudged her into the car they already know were friends besides we need your wagon for the diving gear the backpacks and the lead and gold he closed the door and planted a light kiss on her cheek through the open window be safe angel he said and dont take any unnecessary chances carol started the car and backed into the middle of the parking lot she waved at troy and pulled into the dark lane that led through the marsh to the end of the island the only light was from the nearly full gibbous moon that was already above the trees all right dawson she thought to herself now youre in the middle of it just stay calm and alert she drove very slowly she reviewed the plans for the evening several times in her mind then she started thinking about nick he holds on to things like i do he still hates homer and greta for cheating him he couldnt wait to dive for the gold she smiled as she turned into the circular drive in front of homer ashfords house i just hope there is some left over for him a split second after carol rang the doorbell homer opened the door and greeted her youre late he said in a pleasant monotone we thought maybe you were not coming greta is already in the pool do you want to change and join her thanks captain homer but i decided not to swim tonight carol answered politely i appreciate the offer but im mostly here on business i would prefer to start the interview as soon as possible even before dinner if that would be all right with everyone else homer led carol into a gigantic family room and stopped by a large wet bar a magnificent handcarved wooden statue of a swimming neptune about four feet long altogether was on the wall above the bar carol asked for some white wine homer tried without success to talk her into something stronger the family room had a billiards table at one end on the other side a sliding glass door opened onto a covered patio that narrowed into a cement walkway carol followed homer in silence sipping from her white wine every twenty steps or so the walkway wound past big trees and a lighted gazebo off to the left before it spread out around the huge swimming pool actually there were two pools in front of carol was a classic rectangular olympicsized pool under strong lights at one end was a slide and waterfall that ran down an artificial mountain into the swimming area at the other end in the direction of the second pool and the ocean there was a sunken jacuzzi constructed out of the same decorated blue tiles that rimmed the top of the main pool the entire complex was cleverly designed to create the impression of moving water there seemed to be a steady flow from the waterfall to the large pool down into the jacuzzi and then into a stream that meandered off in the direction of the house the second pool was circular and dark it was off to carols left at the edge of the property near what looked like a small cottage for changing clothes greta was in the rectangular pool in front of carol she was swimming laps her powerful body moving rhythmically through the water carol who was an excellent swimmer herself watched greta for a few seconds isnt she something homer walked over next to carol his admiration was obvious she wont let herself eat a big meal unless she works out beforehand she cant stand fat homer was wearing a light brown hawaiian shirt with a pair of tan slacks brown loafers were on his feet and a big drink crammed with ice cubes was in his hand he seemed relaxed even affable carol thought he could have passed for a retired banker or corporate executive greta continued to swim relentlessly through the water homer was hovering over carol and she was beginning to feel uncomfortable as if her space were being invaded wheres ellen she asked turning to the large man and moving just slightly farther away from him shes in the kitchen homer replied she loves to cook especially when we have guests and tonight shes making one of her favorite dishes there was almost a twinkle in his eye he leaned down to carol she made me promise not to tell you what were having he whispered confidentially but i will tell you that its a powerful aphrodisiac ugh said carol to herself as she caught a whiff of homers breath and listened to his leering chuckle how could i have forgotten how repulsive this man is does he really think that carol stopped her thought she reminded herself that people with excessive money very often lose touch with reality probably some of the women respond for what he can give them she almost gagged the thought of having any kind of sexual liaison with homer was totally repugnant greta had finished swimming laps she climbed out of the pool and dried herself off her allwhite racing uniform was like a transparent body stocking even from a distance carol could not avoid seeing the full detail of her nipples and breasts as well as her clump of pubic hair through the thin suit she might as well have been naked homer stood beside carol unabashedly staring as greta strode across the cement no suit greta said just before she reached them her eyes were trying to bore holes in carols carol shook her head im sorry said greta homer had hoped that we might have a race she looked at the captain with an odd expression that carol did not understand he loves to see women in competition it would have been no contest carol answered she thought she saw greta tense you would have won easily she added you swim beautifully greta smiled accepting the compliment her eyes roamed over carols body she made no effort to hide the fact that she was doing an appraisal you have a good body too for swimming greta said maybe a little too fat on the ass and upper legs i could suggest workout why dont we show miss dawson the other pool homer interrupted before you go inside and change clothes he started walking toward the little cottage near the ocean without saying another word greta turned and followed him carol took a sip from her wine who knows what goes on here she thought those three have not had to work for eight years they take people out fishing and diving for amusement a strange mixture of disgust and depression started to spread in her so they manufacture entertainment to keep from being bored moments after homer entered the cottage a bank of floodlights down underneath the second pool was illuminated homer gestured for her to hurry and carol skipped into the cottage they led her down a flight of steps under the ground was a walkway that completely encircled the large glass aquarium that had looked in the darkness like a second swimming pool we have six sharks now homer said proudly as well as three red occi a pair of cuttlefish and of course hundreds of more standard species of fish and plants occi inquired carol thats the slang plural of octopus homer responded with a smug selfsatisfied smile actually the correct plural is octopodes even though everyone now accepts octopi because it has been used so much greta was standing with her face pressed against the glass a couple of bat rays swam past she was waiting for something after twenty seconds or so a grayish shark appeared the shark seemed to notice greta and stopped watching her its face about five feet away from the glass carol could see the long sharp teeth and identified it as a mako a fierce smaller cousin of the maneating great white shark thats gretas pet said homer his name is timmy somehow she has trained him to recognize her face against the glass homer watched a few more seconds from time to time she goes in there to swim with him when the sharks have finished eating of course the shark remained in place staring blankly in gretas direction she began to drum her fingers against the glass in regular cadence now this is exciting homer said walking over next to greta and the aquarium what you are going to see is what biologists call a typical pavlovian response ive never seen it quite this way before in a shark the mako began to be agitated greta started increasing the tempo the shark responding by whipping the water back and forth with its tail suddenly greta disappeared up the stairs carol thought she noticed a faraway look in her eyes when greta zoomed by her carol looked at homer for an explanation come down here closer he gestured to carol you dont want to miss this greta cares for the rabbits herself and timmy always puts on a grand show carol wasnt exactly sure what homer was talking about but she was enjoying the lovely aquarium it contained crystalclear sea water obviously filtered and recycled regularly carol noticed several species of sponges and coral as well as urchin and anemone someone had gone to great trouble and expense to recreate the conditions in the reefs just offshore key west suddenly a beheaded white rabbit impaled on a long vertical staff the blood still spurting from its arteries appeared in the aquarium just opposite where carol and homer were standing it was over in an instant driven to immediate frenzy by the blood in the water the mako attacked its teeth ripping half the hapless rabbit off the stave with the first bite the second swoop captured the rest of the rabbit and snapped the rod as well carol barely had time to recoil and turn her head when she jumped back she spilled wine all over her blouse trying to appear calm she reached in her purse for a tissue to wipe her blouse she said nothing she had had a perfect view of the sharks attack and could still feel the adrenaline imbalance that the fright had produced great way to start a dinner party she thought why havent i ever thought of it dawson these people are weird homer was still excited wasnt that spectacular such raw savage power in those jaws driven by pure instinct i never get tired of it carol followed him up the stairs good show greta she heard homer say when they walked out of the cottage it was right in front of us two bites wham wham and the rabbit was gone i know said greta she was holding a diving mask what was left of the staff was on the ground beside her i could see from up here greta was staring at carol obviously trying to discover her reaction carol averted her eyes she was not going to give greta the satisfaction of knowing she had found it repulsive greta has the whole thing down to splitsecond timing homer continued as they walked back through the gardens to the house she prepares the live rabbit on the chopping block an hour early then when timmy is ready she carol tuned his gruesome story out of her mind i dont want to hear this she thought she glanced at her watch ten minutes after nine come on guys be swift im not certain i can stand these people for another hour nick and troy swam silently along the shoreline in the moonlight they had carefully rehearsed the plan no additional light until they were in the cove beside homers property and at least ten feet under water troy would lead searching for alarm systems he could disable with the tools stuffed in the pockets of his wet suit he would also keep a lookout for the infamous robot sentries nick would follow with the buoyancy bags they would use to carry the gold they had walked along the beach from the pelican resort parking lot wearing their heavy diving suits as well as the backpacks until they were only about a hundred yards from the thick fence that marked homers property then they had set down the packs containing their clothes and eased into the water during the walk troy had had several problems with his tools and a decision to reduce his arsenal of gadgets had delayed their arrival at the embarkation point by five minutes just before they went into the water nick had given an uncharacteristic squeal of excitement and grabbed troy by the shoulders i hope that fucking gold is there he had said i cannot wait to see their faces after we steal it it was time to submerge holding hands in the darkness nick and troy dropped about five feet under the water they stopped equalized the pressure in their heads and repeated the procedure when they were down about ten feet troy turned on the searchlight they quickly worked out their directions and headed around the corner deeper into the cove adjoining homers estate troy was in the lead he had no trouble finding the entrance to the natural tunnel that led to the subterranean cave as they had planned nick waited outside the tunnel while troy went inside to look for alarms the rock cliffs closed over his head the watery entryway was about five feet across and four feet high troy immediately found a metal box affixed to the left wall where it was partially hidden from view when he examined the box he discovered that it was emitting two laser beams separated by about three feet on the other side of the natural tunnel were the receiving plates for the beams as well as the alarm electronics troy swam over carefully pulled out his screwdriver and dismantled the housing the system was very simple failure of either plate to receive a beam would trigger the opening of a relay when both relays were open current could flow to the alarm thus an object had to be large enough to break both beams simultaneously to set off an alarm troy smiled to himself as he validated the operating principle by passing his hand in front of one of the beams then he jerryrigged one of the relays permanently closed satisfied with his work he swam back and forth in the tunnel breaking both beams at the same time assuring himself that he had rendered the alarm system ineffective he swam back out to meet nick and gave him the thumbsup sign the two men passed through the fifty yards of natural tunnel into the subterranean cave where the narrow passageway widened troy again gestured to nick to remain behind while he troy went into the cave to check for boobytraps nick let his feet fall to the bottom of the tunnel and switched on his own small flashlight he was in a perfect place for an ambush the tunnel was so small here that there was virtually no maneuvering room he wondered what an underwater sentry would look like what a place to die he thought suddenly fear swept over him as he turned off his flashlight and looked down at his illuminated divers watch he watched the glowing second hand sweeping around the face he tried to calm himself it had been three minutes since troy had left why is he taking so long he asked himself he must have found something another minute passed then another nick was having a hard time quelling the onset of panic what do i do if he doesnt return just as nick was about to swim into the cave on his own he caught sight of troys searchlight coming toward him troy waved and nick followed within thirty seconds they were in the shallow part of the cave where the water was only about four feet deep the two men stood up with their flippers lodged against the rocks to protect themselves from falling in the intermittent tidal surges nick pulled his regulator out of his mouth and flipped his mask back on his head before he could speak troy put a finger against nicks lips speak very softly troys whisper was barely audible the place could be alarmed for sound as well there was no light in the cave except troys searchlight however over their heads in the highest corners of the rock ceiling troy pointed out two separate banks of fluorescent lighting the cave itself was an irregular oval about thirty yards in its longest dimension and maybe fifteen yards across at its widest point the ceiling was only about three feet above the water near the entrance to the tunnel out to the ocean but it was twenty feet high in the corner where they were standing in the shallow water well professor troy continued whispering i have good news and bad news the bad news is that there is no treasure here in this cave the good news is that there are two other tunnels both manmade that lead away from this place and go under captain homers property he paused for a moment and watched his partner shall we go for it nick looked at his watch it was ninetwenty already he nodded the bastard spent a lot of money down here they must have stolen more than i figured nick adjusted his diving equipment well start with the tunnel on the left as before ill lead to look for trouble troy cast his searchlight around on the ceiling this is a strange place but beautiful it looks like another planet doesnt it nick pulled his mask back over his face and slipped the regulator in his mouth he flopped backward into the sea water troy followed and once under the surface showed nick the way to the first manmade tunnel this tunnel was on the other side of the cave about twelve feet below the water at its lowest point it was made of normal circular sewer pipe the diameter of the pipe was about five feet making the tunnel approximately the same size as the natural passageway between the ocean and the cave troy entered the tunnel gingerly he swam back and forth from side to side examining one wall for a few yards and then going across to the other he almost missed the long slender alarm box it was embedded in the ceiling at a junction between two sections of sewer pipe and troy just happened to look up before he triggered the alarm this system worked on a different principle a camera or other optical device in the box on the ceiling took repeated images of a square foot of the tunnel bottom that was backlit by an illuminated square cleverly concealed below the normal concrete floor apparently some kind of data comparison algorithm in the alarm processor contained logic by which the consecutive pictures could be assessed in terms of threat and an alarm triggered if necessary it was the most complicated device of its kind that troy had ever seen and he quickly recognized the similarities between this system and the ocean telescope that had been onboard the florida queen that means moi designed and developed it he thought to himself so id best be careful i bet the algorithm is set so that disturbances to the camera trigger the alarm as well nick had swum over to the side of the tunnel out of the way and was watching troy try to open up the alarm box without jiggling the optical instrument to accommodate the almost twoinch width of the box there was a gap of that size everywhere around the circle connecting the two sequential sections of pipe throughout the rest of the tunnel all adjoining sections were cemented together here the passageway was discontinuous curious thought nick he idly shone his small flashlight into the blackness in the gap beside him expecting to see nothing but a wall of rock what in the world is that he wondered as his light fell upon some metal object that looked like a large grating the grating was resting upon an old piece of railroad track nick looked more carefully he could make out a gear box and some pulleys but he had no idea how all these mechanical devices fit together meanwhile troy had managed to remove the housing from the alarm box without disturbing the camera and was busy trying to understand the inner workings of the system whew he thought this is much too complicated to figure out in five minutes if i can just isolate the alarm that should be enough it was tough work under the water but troy was clever and the electronics were packaged in a logical fashion he was able to find the alarm and disable it afterward troy lingered for several seconds trying to determine the purpose of the other circuits connected to the alarm subassembly nick had intended to show troy what he had found in the gap however as he watched his friend struggling with the complex circuitry of the alarm box he became again worried about the passage of time it was now almost a quarter to ten he caught troys eye and pointed at his watch troy reluctantly abandoned his investigation of the alarm and proceeded down the tunnel thirty yards farther the tunnel passed what looked like a door to a submarine on their left both troy and nick tried pulling on the handle of the large and very heavy round door but nothing happened with gestures troy told nick to continue trying to open the door while he swam on down the tunnel the gold bars and other objects that remained from the santa rosa treasure were sitting in the tunnel another thirty yards beyond the round door the passageway itself came to an abrupt halt against a rock wall in front of the wall was an array of gold and silver objects stacked to an average depth of a foot or so across the width of the tunnel the treasure was not hidden in any way it was simply scattered in random piles on the concrete floor at the end of the tunnel troy was ecstatic theres plenty here he thought enough for the aliens enough for nick maybe even some left over for carol and me he swam back to find nick nick was absolutely exultant when he saw the unmistakable smile on troys face he raced around his friend to the end of the tunnel when nick first reached the treasure he spent a minute or two swimming around picking up each object that was different and dropping it back into the piles on the floor holy shit nick said gleefully to himself as he and troy started putting gold bars into the buoyancy bags i was right for once there must be over a hundred pounds in bars alone they had agreed before the dive just to bring out the bars provided there were enough the bars were the only objects they could be certain were pure gold even if we take fiftyeight to troys friends that might leave fifty or so for us he did a quick mental calculation that could be over three hundred thousand dollars apiece whoopee joy and excitement surged through nick he was having difficulty containing himself he wanted to sing to dance to jump with joy he had been right after all the bastards had stolen most of the treasure and now he was stealing it back theres no happiness quite like the redressing of an old and painful grievance and to do it with panache nick was already celebrating in his heart this was his day filling the bags took no time at all nick and troy both felt as if they had infinite energy when they had finished picking up the gold bars troy gestured down the tunnel nick looked down at the other treasure objects remaining on the floor we should take it all he thought we should leave homer and greta nothing nothing at all but he had to be practical each of their bags was virtually full and they would be heavy enough as they were nick swam off in the direction of the ocean his buoyancy bag full of gold trailing behind him troy followed as they passed the bulky door on the right troy found himself thinking again about the circuitry leading to the alarm in the box just ahead between the two sections of pipe what could those other connections be for suddenly he remembered seeing a diagram in an electronics magazine about advanced timers that could reinitialize systems and swap out failed parts by now the component that troy had disabled might have been declared a failure by the smart processor in the alarm box in which case it would have either been replaced by a redundant part or the system would be ignoring its output in either situation troy thought that means the system could be active again it was too late nick swam into the field of view of the optical device and lights came on throughout the tunnel a metal gate started closing behind nick and his bag of gold it was only with a burst of speed that troy propelled himself through before the gate shut completely but his buoyancy bag full of gold bars was left behind on the other side of the gate nick stared at troys lost bag as it floated to the floor he reached through the bars grabbed the bag and tried to pull it through it was useless he shook the gate the metal was extremely sturdy angry and frustrated he punched the gate with his fists as nick caught his breath in between punches he became aware of a strange droning sound like a motor somewhere in the distance behind him he turned around to find troy he could not see him anywhere troy had been exhausted by his swimming sprint through the closing gate his energy spent he had let himself fall to the floor of the pool in the deepest part of the cave halfway between the two manmade tunnels he took several deep breaths through his mouthpiece and checked his air supply he had about ten minutes remaining he watched for a moment as nick almost out of sight to his right tried fruitlessly to pull troys bag through the gate shit troy thought disappointed that he had lost the gold if only i had been thinking i should have known he heard an unusual sound off to his left curious troy swam over to the entrance of the other tunnel and right into the path of the robot sentry even though the original distance between them was over fifty feet the guidance mechanism of the sentry fixed on troy as soon as he appeared startled and fascinated at first troy did not try to avoid the onrush of the bulletshaped submarine the sentry was three feet long and a foot wide in its midsection when it was about eight feet away the sentry slowly loaded and fired a small but powerful spear the size of a table knife that troy just managed to avoid as it hurtled past the spear crashed into the wall beside him adrenaline surged into troys system and he swam out into the middle of the pool the sentry did not follow him immediately instead it moved over in front of the natural passageway to the ocean thereby cutting off the escape route and then turned around to make a systematic search of the pool damnit troy was thinking why didnt i leave while i had the chance he wondered if nick was still over by the gate the sentry had now found nick in its field of vision he was swimming slowly toward the exit with his buoyancy bag he was unaware that he and troy were not alone in the pool by the time nick saw the sentry he was fifteen feet away and within easy range of its underwater gun troy watched the sentry load a spear oh no he cried out to himself watch out nick there was nothing he could do it happened so fast that neither nick nor troy knew exactly what occurred troy would later explain that he felt a sudden warm tingle on his wrist and then something a light beam or a laser burst or a stream of plasma perhaps fired out of his bracelet and zapped the robot sentry into silence and motionlessness nick would say that the sentry just when it was going to fire at him was first distracted by troy and then recoiled as if from an impact whatever happened the sentry stopped all activity immediately thereafter the two men swam together over to the shallow part of the cave they were temporarily safe carol could not believe how plump and succulent the oysters were ellen was sitting at the other end of the table opposite her and was beaming with pride would you like some more dear she smiled lifting the huge pot containing the oyster stew im now going to eat a second portion carol thought in addition to the catfish with nick greta would be disgusted she smiled to herself and nodded at ellen there was at least one thing she had learned this evening ellen was certainly a fantastic cook and a very sad person too carol thought as she spooned herself some more spicy stew rich with the fabled appalachicola oysters homer had personally answered all the questions during the twentyminute interview before dinner whenever a question had been controversial or delicate such as when carol had asked about the allegations that part of the treasure haul had been secretly stolen and hidden by the three of them he had looked only at greta before he made a response no wonder ellen eats all the time shes the odd man out or is it woman this stew is fabulous carol remarked to ellen would you mind giving me the recipe ellen was delighted certainly dear she said it would be my pleasure carol remembered dales reference to ellens behavior at the moi awards dinner and wondered if there was indeed any sexual component to the warmth ellen was displaying i dont see it carol decided this is just a lonely and profoundly disturbed woman i dont feel one iota of sexual tension youve been asking the questions all evening miss dawson homer was saying now why dont we ask you a few he had been surprisingly pleasant and subdued since the bizarre preprandial shark feeding they must be normal sometimes carol thought otherwise they couldnt survive but who knows when mr hyde will show up again ya greta said it was the first time she had spoken directly to carol during the meal homer told me you were with dr dale you are lovers no you dont beat around the bush do you greta carol partially evaded the question dale michaels and i are very good friends we spend quite a lot of time together both socially and professionally he is a smart man greta said those clear eyes stared at carol and a smile played at the corner of gretas lips what is she trying to tell me the conversation was interrupted by the sound of a sharp alarm carol knew immediately that something had gone wrong what in the world is that carol asked innocently as the strident alarm continued with its loud bursts homer and greta were already up from the table excuse us homer said its our burglar alarm probably an error well go check it out they hurried out of the dining room leaving carol and ellen alone and headed down a nearby hallway i must follow them and find out whats going on carol thought her heart and mind racing together she sneaked a peek at her watch it was five minutes past ten oclock they should have finished by now im going to the rest room she said to ellen dont bother she added as ellen started to explain the directions im sure i can find it myself carol walked quickly into the hall and listened for sounds of homer and greta moving very quietly she followed them until she was just outside a large den on the opposite side of the house the door to the den was ajar it will focus in a second she heard homer say there was a pause shit he shouted it looks like the gold bars are already gone they must have moved very fast the picture is really not very clear here you take a look ya said greta the bars are gone i think but homer the gold would be very heavy maybe the thieves are trapped in the tunnel timmy could search for them that would fix the bastards homers nervous laugh sent chills down carols spine she back pedaled slowly until she had retreated to the main foyer of the house she heard an outside door slam in the direction of the den theyve gone out to turn the sharks loose jesus i must warn nick and troy carol walked into the nearest bathroom in the hallway pushed the door closed and turned on the water faucet then she flushed the commode and untaped the small walkietalkie that was hidden inside her shirt she put the unit right next to her mouth mayday mayday she said they know youre there you are in danger she repeated the message and then pushed the button that would automatically recycle the communication several more times i certainly hope this damn thing works she thought she started to affix the tiny unit to the inside of her blouse again while she was taping it down she happened to look in the mirror her heart nearly stopped ellen was standing in the doorway staring at her the baleful glare in her eyes indicating that she had seen and heard everything she took a step toward carol just hold it right there ellen carol said carol put her hands up i have no quarrel with you the fat woman hesitated homer and greta only use you anyway carol added softly why dont you leave them and make a life for yourself anger broke across ellens face her eyes narrowed her cheeks reddened and she raised her huge fists to threaten carol its none of your damn business how i live my life she said menacingly she moved again in carols direction carol grabbed the thick metal towel rack beside her and pulled with all her might the bar sprung free from the wall dumping two peach bath towels and a wooden end piece on the linoleum floor carol brandished the bar over her head dont make me hit you she said just move aside and get out of my way ellen did not slow down carol aimed carefully and struck her hard on the right shoulder the heavy woman collapsed greta she wailed in a monstrous voice greta help me still waving the bar from the towel rack carol walked carefully around ellen and backed toward the door once in the hall she sprinted to the family room and headed for the front door right beside the wet bar she was tackled from behind carol fell forward hard and smashed her nose on the carpet she tried to squirm out of gretas arms but it was impossible she was pinned a few drops of blood trickled out of carols nose and fell on the carpet both women were breathing heavily carol managed to turn her body around so that she was facing greta she struggled vainly to free herself gretas strong arms slammed carols wrists against the floor greta bent down until her face was only inches away from carols you were trying to get away ya and just why vere you in such a hurry there was something feral in gretas eyes on impulse carol lifted her head and kissed greta full on the lips startled her assailants arms momentarily relaxed that was all carol needed gathering all her strength she smashed the bottom of her palm into the side of gretas head greta was stunned carol pushed her off and made a dash for the door carol was already calculating when she ran out the front door and down the steps greta will be up in an instant she thought i wont have time to open the car door i might as well run for it the german woman was only fifteen yards behind her and gaining fast when carol turned onto the lane that led from homers house to the pelican resort for ten years i have run three times a week but this is the only time my life has ever depended on it she tried to accelerate greta continued to close the gap carol was certain she was going to be caught at any minute once she thought she felt gretas hand on her blouse but after two hundred yards greta began to drop back when she was a quarter of a mile from homers driveway carol dared to look over her shoulder her pursuer was clearly struggling and was now fifty yards behind her carol felt a renewed burst of energy im going to make it she thought im actually going to escape greta slowed to a walk eventually carol did too but not until she was almost to the restaurant even then she continued to look back to try to find her antagonist in the moonlight now ill call a taxi she was thinking and go over to nicks apartment i hope that the two of them heard my warning and are safe she could no longer see greta she stopped and strained her eyes she must have turned back carol thought while she was looking back down the lane a pair of very strong hands grabbed her shoulders she spun around and stared into the laughing eyes of lieutenant richard todd he had purposely waited until all the rest of the actors had left the dressing room the package itself was inconspicuous about the size of a large bar of soap wrapped in white paper with a dark red ribbon you dont even know if its from her winters thought as he pulled the bow on the ribbon the commander was full of anticipation the show had been even better tonight and in the bedroom scene he had felt for just a second the touch of tiffanis tongue against his lips she didnt have to do that winters told himself suspending for a moment all vestiges of guilt his hands trembled a little as he opened the package it was a plain white box inside was a silver cigarette lighter simple but handsome with the initials vw engraved on the outside at the bottom his heart raced so she does feel it too commander winters felt a powerful burst of lust in his groin now he was imagining a scene no more than three or four hours in the future he was taking tiffani home and they were kissing at her front door would you like to come in she would say i feel pretty oh so pretty i feel pretty and witty and gay he heard her singing as she came down the hall she pushed open the door to his dressing room and twirled around tiffanis hair was stacked high on her head showing the lines of her elegant neck the gold filigree along the top of the comb that the commander had given her blended in perfectly with the rich red and brown of her hair her dress was white low cut with her shoulders exposed except for tiny straps in the corners well she said with a big and eager smile she turned around again what do you think you look beautiful tiffani he replied he stared at her with such intensity that she blushed oh vernon she sighed now changing her mood the combs are wonderful she pulled a cigarette from his pack on the dresser table and lit it herself with his new lighter she took a deep drag her eyes fixed on his and put the cigarette down in the ashtray i dont know how to thank you she murmured she walked over to him and put her hands in his its already been another wonderful evening she put her left hand behind his head and reached up to kiss him his heart was about to explode within his body she could feel his arousal as her lips nestled softly against his she pulled his head down to meet hers and subtly increased the pressure of her kiss at length he put his arms around her and pressed her body against his commander winters thought he was going to drown in the pleasure of that kiss never had he felt such longing he was certain he would gladly die in the morning if he could just continue to kiss her all night first for a moment as he let himself experience fully the rush of joy and love and lust all his worries and despair were pushed aside he wanted to wrap himself around tiffani somehow zip her inside his skin and close out everything else in the universe melvin and marc had come to the dressing room to find the commander they had not approached with stealth and were not even being especially quiet but neither tiffani nor commander winters heard them walk up the two men could see the pair kissing through the open dressing room door they looked at each other and reached out instinctively to touch hands for an instant from their own experience they knew about the difficulty of love affairs outside the accepted norm tiffani and winters finally broke the kiss and she put her head against his chest her back was to the door winters opened his eyes and saw melvin and marc standing there in front of him he blanched but the director made a gesture with his hands that said its all right its your business not ours melvin and marc considerately waited several seconds so that it would look as if they had not arrived until after the kiss the commander patted tiffani on the shoulder and turned her around in a fatherly manner great show commander melvin said as he walked into the room and another super performance from you too young lady he paused marc smiled his compliments and tiffani unconsciously straightened out her dress theres a lieutenant todd waiting outside for you commander melvin added he says its urgent he asked me to tell you to hurry winters face was creased with wrinkles what in the world is he doing here he thought its after ten oclock on a saturday night thanks melvin he answered tell him ill be out in a few minutes the director and his friend turned and left the dressing room tiffani reached over for the lit cigarette whose ash had grown so long it had nearly fallen out of the ashtray she inhaled and handed it to winters did they see us kissing she asked anxiously no lied winters but already he was realizing how untenable his fantasy was precious tiffani he thought my teenage lover we were lucky but we cannot kid ourselves we will be seen eventually he looked into her eyes and saw the flame of adolescent passion again he felt the surge in his loins he reached down and pulled her forcefully to him and if the wrong person sees us he thought as his lips tingled with her kiss there is no limit to my risk winters threw his cigarette down on the ground and stomped it out he shook his head in disbelief you are telling me that you have taken those three into custody and youre holding them at the base lieutenant todd was confused but sir dont you understand we have an entire set of photographs in three of them you can clearly see the missile and there are other pictures that show the black guy in some kind of underwater structure down there in the ocean just as i had guessed what more could we possibly need we also caught them redhanded no less coming back from a dive with fifty pounds of gold bars in their backpacks fifty pounds commander winters turned around and went back in the theater go back to the base lieutenant he said disgustedly ill be there in five minutes it was apparent that melvin and marc were just waiting for tiffani and the commander before they locked up the theater and went to the party can you take her over melvin he asked theres a big mess out at the base tonight and it looks as if i will have to straighten it out the conversation with todd had been sobering for winters on at least two levels first it had reminded him that there was a real world out there outside of the theater a world that would not look kindly on a fortythreeyearold navy commander having a sexual relationship with a seventeenyearold high school student secondly todds astonishing announcement that he had indeed detained three civilians one of whom was a wellknown reporter jolted the commander into realizing that his preoccupation with tiffani had affected his work i should never have let this thing get so far out of control he thought from here on out that lieutenant makes no move that i dont personally approve im sorry tiffani he said in a fatherly voice he gave her an ambiguous hug and a light kiss on the top of her head ill come to the party as soon as i can hurry or youll miss the champagne tiffani said with a smile melvin turned off the lights in the theater the four of them walked out the door winters had parked down the street almost a block away he waved to tiffani as she climbed into melvins car i wonder if you will ever know young lady he thought know how close i came tonight to throwing everything away in his minds eye it was twentyfour years before on a cold night outside of philadelphia and he had just gone berserk and virtually raped joanna carr winters started his pontiac and eased into the street it would be so easy he thought just one time to forget the rules and constraints to dive into the water without looking first he remembered his pact with god after he had spent the night with joanna so you kept your part of the bargain i guess and i became an officer and a gentleman and a killer he winced he turned the car past the swank miyako gardens and headed for the base with great effort he forced himself to stop thinking about tiffani and joanna and sex its not enough that i have this trial with tiffani at the same time i am assigned a redneck lieutenant who runs roughshod over civilians in his attempt to prove some cockamamie commander winters stopped at a signal slowly the full impact of what todd had told him began to sink in jesus i may be in trouble too unlawful entry wrongful detention theyll throw the book at todd he eased his car through the intersection he mechanically put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it so i should be apologetic but shit that dawson woman is a reporter bad bad news he had arrived at the base he waved to the security guard and drove on to where todd had said they were keeping the trio winters stopped in front of a plain white building situated on a small hill about fifteen feet above the street level a nervous lieutenant roberto ramirez was waiting at the edge of the road he was holding two large thick envelopes in his hands ramirez turned and called something toward the front door todd came out in a moment he locked the door carefully came down the steps and walked toward the other two officers ramirez was already showing the photographs to commander winters when todd joined them the three men had a short but animated discussion so what happened after you received my message carol turned to the other two as soon as todd disappeared out the door they had not had many chances to talk in private since todd and ramirez had taken them into custody in the parking lot at the pelican resort troy was ready to split nick laughed but i thought your warning only referred to the robot sentry and since he had been quiet for several minutes i figured we were already safe i was still really pissed off about the second bag of gold bars so i hurried back over to the gate i was concentrating so hard on finding a way to pull the bag through the opening that i must have been oblivious to everything else suddenly i felt troy jerk me backwards maybe a second later two or three sharks one definitely a mako slammed hard into the gate i was certain the gate was going to fall into pieces those sharks were really nasty angel troy interjected and stupid too the big one must have banged against the gate a dozen times before he gave up the buoyancy bag with the gold bars was immediately ripped to shreds by the crazy sharks they may even have swallowed most of the bars themselves it was not fun being that close to them nick shuddered when i close my eyes i can still see that makos teeth three feet away from me ill probably have bad dreams for years i pulled nick toward the ocean i didnt want any part of those mean bastards and i didnt trust the gate to remain intact in case they launched another attack we made it out in record time of course neither of us expected to be greeted by the us navy when we returned to the station wagon troy paused this todd character whats his problem any way he sure thinks hes a bad ass is he just pissed because the professor decked him last night carol smiled she reached her left hand over and put it on nicks leg just above the knee her hand remained there while she was talking todd is one of the naval engineers trying to find the lost missile im certain that he and his men must have been responsible for the breakins at nicks apartment and my hotel room otherwise they wouldnt have detained us what grounds do they have for holding us nick inquired he dropped his hand down and wrapped it around carols its not against the law to have gold bars in a backpack dont we have rights as citizens that prevent this kind of thing probably carol replied she squeezed nicks hand and then retracted her own but as a reporter i find this part of our adventure extremely interesting you can tell that lieutenant ramirez is very nervous he wouldnt let todd even ask us any questions until commander winters was contacted and he has been very concerned about our comfort as if on cue the front door opened and the three naval officers walked in winters was in the lead with the two lieutenants just behind nick and carol and troy were sitting on gray metal auditorium chairs on the left of a partitioned area that served as a waiting room for the larger offices in the rear of the building winters moved into the area and half leaned against the large gray desk opposite them im commander vernon winters he said his eyes meeting each of theirs in turn as miss dawson knows im one of the senior officers on the base here i am currently in charge of a secret project code named broken arrow he smiled im sure you are wondering why you have been brought to the base winters reached out with his left arm and ramirez handed him the infrared blowups that showed the missile in the most detail he waved the photos at the three detainees one of the goals of project broken arrow is to find a navy missile that has been lost somewhere in the gulf of mexico lieutenant todd here believes based on these photographs that you know where that missile is that is why he has acted to bring you here for questioning winters voice rose in pitch and he began to wave his arms now im certain i dont need to remind you that stateoftheart weapons systems are what keep our nation free and secure spare us the patriotic lecture and the histrionics commander winters interrupted carol we all know that you are searching for a lost missile and that you think we may have found it sorry we went out looking for it today but were unable to locate it again she stood up now you listen to me a minute your zealous lieutenant there and his men have broken more laws than i can count in addition to kidnapping us they have looted and vandalized my hotel room and mr williams apartment they have also stolen some photographs and valuable equipment she fixed winters with a hard gaze you sure as hell better have good reason for dragging us down here or i swear ill see to it that all three of you are court martialed carol glanced at ramirez he was squirming in the meantime she continued you can start by giving us an official written apology returning all our property and making adequate payment for all the damages in addition i want exclusive access to all broken arrow files from this moment on if you dont agree to all these terms you might as well prepare right now to read about the gestapo tactics of the united states navy in the next edition of the miami herald uh oh thought winters this is not going to be easy this woman reporter intends to play the bluff and threat game he pulled out a cigarette while he was thinking would you please not smoke in here carol broke into his train of thought we all find it offensive damn these aggressive nonsmokers he replaced the pall mall in the pack in his pocket winters had been thrown off at first by carols rapid attack but he eventually regained his composure now miss dawson the commander began a minute later he looked away from the trio in the direction of the front door i can understand why you might be upset by what has happened i will admit that our men may indeed have acted in an unwarranted manner while they were searching your rooms to find evidence however winters stopped in midsentence turned around and came back toward nick and carol and troy however he repeated we are talking about treason here he waited to let his threat register and i dont need to tell you miss dawson that treason is serious business even more serious than journalism he hesitated again for effect and his voice became very stern if any of you have knowledge of the whereabouts of this missile and have conveyed that knowledge to a member of any foreign government especially one viewed as inimical to our national interests then you have committed treason what kind of dope have you been smoking commander carol replied we freely admit that weve been looking for your missile but that doesnt make us spies you have no case against us she glanced at nick he was admiring her performance im simply a reporter covering a story this treason business of yours is pure fabricated bullshit oh yeah said lieutenant todd unable to restrain himself then where were these pictures taken he showed the photo of troy in full diving regalia in the initial underwater room with the red and blue walls he then turned and pointed to the backpacks sitting in the opposite corner of the room and what were your two friends doing with fifty pounds of gold after their dive tonight all right man troy remarked in an exaggerated manner he took a step toward lieutenant todd all right youve figured it out havent you we found the missile and sold it to the russians for fifty pounds of gold his eyes widened as he looked at todd and now the missile is onboard a submarine on its way to moscow or wherever come on man get serious were not that stupid lieutenant todds temper flared up you black bastard he muttered before commander winters jumped between them winters needed some time to think todds questions were after all still unanswered even if there were good answers it was not difficult to understand how someone could have come to the conclusion based on the photographs that there might be a conspiracy involved in addition there was the issue of defending the actions of his junior officers and the investigating team if i let these three go now thought winters then we are essentially admitting that we made an error in the first place ramirez was gesturing at the commander he nodded outside with his head winters did not understand at first but ramirez repeated the motion excuse us a second winters said the two officers walked out on the porch above the steps leaving todd with nick and carol and troy what is it lieutenant winters asked commander sir ramirez answered my career is the navy if we release these three now after no formal questioning i couldnt agree more winters interrupted abruptly i wish that none of this today had happened but it did now we must finish it up properly and thoroughly or we have no defense for what we did he thought for a minute how long would it take you to get the video and sound equipment set up for a formal interrogation about thirty minutes ramirez replied maybe fortyfive at the most lets do it while youre getting ready ill prepare the list of questions shit said winters to himself as he watched ramirez walk briskly toward his office on the other side of the base i am indeed going to be here all night he thought of his missed chance with tiffani id better call her and explain while im drafting these questions he felt a sudden burst of anger toward lieutenant todd as for you he thought if we come out of this unscathed i will personally see to it that you are transferred to lower slobbovia it was after eleven oclock lieutenant todd stood near the front door he was holding a billy club in his hand once before in the evening just after nick and troy had reached the pelican resort parking lot todd had used the club on nicks back to coerce him into the car nick could still feel the welt how long is all this going to take troy asked he was standing near the desk cant we go home now and get some sleep and come back on monday morning you heard what the man said todd replied he was definitely gloating theyve gone off to prepare for a formal interrogation you should be using this time to get your story straight todd pounded his palm with the billy club troy turned to his companions all right team he said with a wink i move we blow this joint lets overpower this geek and blast out of here just try it you shits todd rejoined he smacked one of the empty folding chairs with his club for emphasis id like nothing better than to report that you tried to escape nick had not said much since winters and ramirez had left he now looked across the room at todd you know what annoys me the most about this lieutenant he said to his captor its that people like you he continued without waiting for an answer end up in positions of power or authority all over the world look at you you think that because you have us under your control that makes you somebody let me tell you something you arent shit todd did not try to hide his dislike for nick at least i can find white men to be my friends he replied sarcastically i do declare troy chimed in swiftly i believe our associate lieutenant todd may be a bigot we may be talking to a true life honky lets see if nigger is his next boys boys carol interceded as todd started to move toward troy enough is enough the room became quiet troy walked back over to his friends and sat down in his chair a minute later troy leaned over to nick and carol as he was whispering to them he put the gold bracelet right next to his mouth you know folks he said if we dont get out of here soon we may be here all night i can well imagine the questions taking three or four hours and that means the navy will get to the dive site before us in the morning but what can we do carol asked it would be a miracle if they let us just walk out without any questions a miracle angel said troy with a grin is just what we need a good oldfashioned miracle like the blue fairy what are you shits whispering about over there the truculent lieutenant todd began to walk toward the bathroom at the west end of the long room knock it off and dont try anything the outside door is locked and i have the key he didnt close the bathroom door the urinal was fortunately out of view to the right there was not much light in the back of the small bathroom as todd was finishing his piss he became aware of a strange sensation all over his right side as if a thousand very small needles were sticking in him puzzled he turned toward the corner what he saw there sent an incredible shock of terror racing through his system in the corner partially hidden in the poor light was what could only be described as a sixfoot carrot the thicker end of the creature was balanced on four webbed pads planted on the floor there were no arms but about five feet above the ground just under a maze of blue spaghetti of unknown purpose on top of its head four vertical slits each a foot long were cut in what might have been its face out of each of these slits something strange was hanging troy would later explain to nick and carol that these were sensors that the carrot saw heard smelled and tasted with these dangling extensions lieutenant todd did not wait to study the creature he let out a whoop and backed quickly out of the bathroom he did not stop to retract his penis or zip his fly when the weird orange thing next appeared in the light at the door to the bathroom the lieutenant was certain it was going to follow him he stared at it petrified and immobile for half a second then when it did indeed move toward him todd immediately turned around unlocked the front door and burst through it unfortunately he forgot about the eight concrete steps in his panic he tripped and fell he smacked his head hard on the second step and tumbled down to the bottom he lay unconscious on his back on the sidewalk in front of the building carol had cowered against nick when she had first seen the carrot then they had both glanced at troy he was smiling and humming to himself when you wish upon a star makes no difference who you are he seemed so blase about everything that nick and carol even relaxed temporarily however after lieutenant todd disappeared out the front door and the carrot turned to face them it was difficult to remain calm nuts said troy with a big smile i was really hoping for the blue fairy i thought she might make me rich or maybe even white all right jefferson nick said his face looked as if he had just eaten a lemon please explain what that thing in front of us is troy first walked slowly over to the corner of the room to pick up their backpacks this professor he replied as he then walked directly up to the carrot is what we might call a holographic projection he put his hand into and through the orange body somewhere in the universe there is supposedly a real life creature like this but they have only sent his image to help us escape even with troys explanation nick and carol did not want to come any closer to the stationary carrot than was absolutely necessary they moved with their backs against the walls until they reached the door dont worry troy laughed it wont hurt you the sensor hanging out of the slit on the far right of the carrots head was totally incomprehensible carol could not take her eye off of it it looked like a wad of gooey honeycomb stuck on the end of a majorettes baton what does it do with that carol asked pointing as she preceded troy out the door i dont know angel troy answered but it must be fun nick and troy joined carol on the platform at the top of the stairs they all saw todd at about the same time they were naturally surprised to find him lying at the bottom of the steps his head was bleeding should we help him carol wondered out loud as troy bounded down the stairs in front of her no way nick replied quickly troy bent down beside todd and carefully examined the unconscious lieutenant from head to toe he slapped the big man lightly on the cheek lieutenant todd did not move troy winked at his friends at the top of the stairs the professor was right my man he said breaking into a grin you really arent shit so i kissed her carol said with a laugh you did what asked nick they were in troys old ford ltd driving toward the hemingway marina after leaving the base they had walked the mile and a half to troys duplex to pick up his car carol was beside troy in the front seat and nick was in the back next to the backpacks containing the gold and the information discs carol turned around to nick i kissed her she laughed again as nick screwed up his face in disgust what was i supposed to do the woman is stronger than most men she had me pinned on the floor there was something just a little suggestive about the way she was holding me whoooee angel troy slapped the dashboard with his left hand you are amazing what did superkraut do next she released her grip on my wrists just for a second i think she was deciding whether to kiss me back yuch said nick from the back seat i think im going to be sick so you smashed her up side of the head and then ran off asked troy carol nodded troy laughed heartily and then became more serious be careful if you ever see her again angel greta does not like to lose but youre wrong about her in one respect carol nick remarked gretas not into women at all she likes sex with men too much carol found nicks comment smug and even irritating she spoke across the front seat to troy why is it troy that men naturally assume that any woman who has sexual relations with men could not possibly be interested in having sex with another woman is this another example of their fundamental belief in their own innate superiority she didnt wait for an answer carol turned around again to talk to nick and in case youre wondering the answer is no im not a lesbian i am relentlessly heterosexual as much because of my san fernando valley middle class background as anything but i will admit that sometimes i grow extremely tired of men and what i call their baboon demonstrations of macho hey nick replied i didnt mean to start an argument i was just suggesting okay okay carol interrupted loosening up a bit no harm done i guess i am a little quick on the trigger she was quiet for a few seconds by the way nick she remarked then theres one part of this that i still dont understand completely why did captain homer go to such great lengths to hide the rest of the treasure all this time why didnt he just sell it off as soon as he could lots of reasons nick replied not the least of which was fear that he might somehow be discovered and indicted for the perjury he committed during our trial but this way he also escapes the irs the value of the gold appreciates in time and most importantly greta has to hang around if she wants her whole share he almost certainly converts some of it to cash from time to time probably through a third party but never enough to call attention to the transaction so you see angel troy said thats why theres no way he can call the police because he would have to admit everything i bet hes really pissed off troy pulled into a lefthand turn lane and waited for the signal to change a car pulled up beside them on the right next to carol and she just happened to look idly in that direction it was a mercedes later on carol would recall that time seemed to dilate for her each second of the next minute was recorded in her memory in super slow motion as if it were covering a much longer period of time greta was driving captain homers car and was staring at carol homer was sitting beside her waving his fists shouting something that carol couldnt hear through her closed window carol focused on gretas amazing eyes never had she seen such hatred for just an instant carol looked away to alert troy and nick when she turned back she saw that greta had a pistol pointed directly at her three things happened almost simultaneously carol ducked troy pulled into the intersection against the red light barely missing a speeding car and greta fired the gun the bullet ripped through carols window and crashed into troys door somehow miraculously missing them both carol sat cringing under the dashboard in the front seat she fought against panic and tried to catch her breath the chase was on it was after eleventhirty on a saturday night in key west and the traffic in the residential area was light troys ford was no match for the mercedes twice more greta maneuvered into position and the ford was sprayed with bullets windows were broken and pitted but none of the occupants of the car was injured nick was lying on the floor in the back seat get downtown if you can he shouted at troy maybe we can lose them in the traffic troy was hunkered down behind the steering wheel as far as he could go he could barely see the roadway in front of them he was driving like a lunatic swerving across the fourlane street into oncoming traffic honking frantically and making it impossible for greta to predict his next move where are the cops when you really need them he said out loud we have maniacs firing guns at us in the middle of key west and there are no men of blue anywhere in sight after nicks suggestion troy suddenly spun around in the middle of the street and started heading in the opposite direction greta was not prepared she hit the brakes on the mercedes went into a skid caromed off a parked car and then resumed the chase there were now no cars on the street in front of them and the mercedes was closing the gap uh oh said troy fearing another attack he violently pulled the steering wheel to the left shot through an alley into a parking lot and back onto a narrow street a few moments later he made a quick turn into a driveway the car became flooded with light and troy jammed on the brakes everybody out he hollered while nick and carol were trying to determine what the hell was happening troy was giving his car keys to a tall figure dressed in a red uniform were just having drinks he said they heard the screech of the brakes on the mercedes and those people behind us troy said in a loud voice to the half dozen onlookers including two parking attendants who were standing nearby have guns and are trying to kill us it was too late for greta and homer to escape troy had driven into the parking entrance of the miyako gardens hotel and already another car had come into the circular drive behind the mercedes greta threw the car in reverse smashed against the grill and bumper of the jaguar behind her and then tried to make a run for it by squeezing around troys ford troy and the uniformed attendant dove for cover as greta hit the open door of the ford lost control of the mercedes and eventually crashed into the parking kiosk in the middle of the driveway as nick and carol stumbled out of the car four hotel security men surrounded greta and homer troy walked over to join his friends anybody hurt both carol and nick shook their heads troy broke into a grand smile i guess that ought to take care of those characters he said carol gave him a hug it was a brilliant idea to drive here she said what made you think of it birds troy answered birds nick responded what the fuck are you talking about jefferson well professor said troy opening the door to the elegant hotel and following his colleagues inside into the open atrium when they were about to catch us that last time i realized that they were probably going to kill us for stealing their gold and i wondered if there really were birds in heaven my mother always told me that there were troy carol said with a smile you are so full of shit come to the point exactly angel he answered look around you in the atrium of the miyako gardens was a magnificent aviary whose tiny threaded wire rose four stories into the air under a bank of skylights hundreds of colored birds played among the vines and palm trees and brought the real sound and feel of the tropics to the lobby of the hotel when i thought about birds troy could no longer restrain a crazy laugh i realized we were in the vicinity of this hotel and the plan sort of jumped into my mind the three of them stood together and gazed up at the aviary carol was in the middle she reached out her hands to both men repatriation beneath the emeraldgreen ocean the spacecraft rests quietly odd fishlike creatures swim by observe the visitor from the heavens and then continue on their journey the final checkout before deployment is underway when the checkout is completed a door near the bottom of the craft opens and a gold metallic sphere with a diameter of about five inches appears the sphere is tied down on top of a long narrow platform the treads underneath the platform propel it down a small ramp and then across the sandy ocean floor the flatbodied vehicle and its cargo disappear in the distance after a long wait the strange moving platform returns to the spaceship without the golden sphere the ramp slides back into the vehicle the door closes and the spacecraft is prepared for launch soon thereafter the great ship eases forward in the water rising until it is just beneath the surface of the emerald ocean it then reconfigures itself adds wings steerable flaps and other control devices and breaks the water looking temporarily like an airplane its ascent into the blue sky filled with light from the twin suns is rapid and breathtaking orbital velocity is reached in almost no time once in orbit above the atmosphere the aerodynamic surfaces are retracted and the spaceship makes one final voyage around the planet canthor when it reaches the proper true anomaly of its orbit the craft accelerates quickly and hurtles again toward the cold and dark of interstellar space the third delivery has been completed nine more remain on its sixtymillicycle mission three millicycles pass the next target planet is only six systems away another oceanic planet orbiting around a solitary yellow sun of unusual stability the fourth cradle will be deposited there on the third body away from the star a planet whose period of motion about its central sun is so short that it makes fourteen revolutions in one millicycle before reaching the target the spaceship makes a detour it dives deep into the hydrogenrich atmosphere of the largest planet in the new system thereby accomplishing two goals its velocity with respect to the central star is significantly slowed through conversion of kinetic energy to dissipated heat and its reservoir of raw elements and primitive chemical compounds from which the onboard manufacturing equipment creates all the backup and replacement parts is partially replenished after exiting from the dive into the thick atmosphere the interstellar voyager covers the final distance to its target in a leisurely six hundred nanocycles during the approach the automatic software in the central computer goes through a welltested sequence designed to discover whether any of the conditions on the target planet have changed since the last complete set of systematic observations three cycles ago since the contents of each cradle have been uniquely designed based upon the environment of the specific planet where the zygotes must grow and flourish any major change in that environment could drastically reduce the probability of survival for the repatriated species upon command from the computer a battery of advanced remote sensing instruments is deployed to confirm the original design specifications for the planet but the instruments do not as planned validate the set of design assumptions the environment has changed not markedly not as if it had been reworked on a massive scale by an advanced intelligence for some specific purpose the initial data strongly suggests instead that during the last cycle or two some indigenous intelligence has emerged that has had a nontrivial impact on both the planets surface and its atmosphere as the remote sensing instruments continue their survey of the target planet something even more unusual is discovered there are artificial satellites thousands of them in orbit around the body a spacefaring species now makes this planet its home an alarm is triggered in the central computer of the spaceship the zygotes and the cradle system destined for this planet were not designed to deal with any other advanced species however the brilliant engineers of the colony had anticipated that at least one of the dozen target planets might have changed significantly during the three cycles since the last regular observations a contingency protocol for handling new situations has been programmed into the approach sequence essentially this protocol calls for careful analysis of the new conditions on the planet assessment of the impact of those conditions on the key probability of survival parameters and then assuming that the impact assessment is not unsatisfactory transfer where possible of new information into the electronic infrastructure responsible for the education of the repatriated species after cradle deployment one of the special subroutines in the contingency protocol handles the surprise emergence of a new spacefaring species the first action in the sequence is the examination of one of the orbiting satellites to assess its technological sophistication with great care the interstellar spaceship eases into a rendezvous position with one of the artificial satellites that remain mostly stationary above a single region on the rotating planet below using superfast burst algorithms stored in the communications macro the spacecraft searches for and establishes the command and telemetry frequencies of its neighbor but attempts to actually command the satellite fail suggesting an elaborate protective code embedded in the receivers andor a complicated redundant command procedure without being able to command the satellite and thus assess its capabilities the visiting spaceship cannot conclusively establish the technological stage of the new spacefaring species the contingency protocol calls in this situation for trying to capture the satellite to perform in situ analysis provided there is no obvious danger from devices onboard the satellite itself this particular branch in the software logic for the spaceship was the subject of intense debate by the oversight board of the committee of engineers back during the design process several cycles earlier many of the more experienced engineers thought that it was risky to include such a logic loop primarily because of the possibility that a paranoid emerging culture might arm their satellites with destructive devices that could not be easily recognized and disarmed however it was argued on the basis of historical evidence from throughout the galaxy that since most incipient civilizations abolish warfare and aggression before they become spacefaring absence of a clearly identifiable destruct or protective device was sufficient additional evidence to allow the careful capturing and dismantling of a satellite and everyone agreed that the detailed information about the technological status of the new species that would result from such reverse engineering would be extremely valuable in completing the assessment of the risk to the repatriated species great remote manipulator arms extend from the spacecraft seize the surveillance satellite and pull it into a large room with vaulted ceilings an army of small electronic robots attacks it at once scurrying all over its surface with probes and attachments trillions of bits of data about the satellite are fed into the primary data storage device in the spaceship computer the new spacefarers are not very advanced technically in fact the computer algorithm concludes it is very surprising that they have even mastered launching and maintaining so many satellites an explosion starts to rip through the room an astonishing sequence of events takes place almost instantaneously after the explosion as the spaceship deploys its protective resources to stop the spread of the fireball and mitigate the damage caused by the small nuclear device that has vaporized its host satellite the explosion is quickly contained by unknown techniques but not until considerable destruction has been caused onboard the interstellar craft an elaborate selftest occupies the great spaceship after the explosion detailed computer analysis of the damage indicates that the probability of successfully deploying the cradles at the additional eight planets would be measurably increased if the mission were temporarily interrupted to allow some repair processes to take place a safe haven to conduct the repair operations in a known environment with very few variations is the concomitant requirement the master computer decides based on the system and subsystem constraints that must he applied during the repairs that the shallow ocean floor on this target planet is a perfect place for such a hiatus in the mission plan the spaceship descends into the atmosphere again reconfiguring itself to expose a set of aerodynamic control surfaces during its rapid descent the flight path is crossed by a bulletshaped vehicle that has just been released from a high altitude airplane the spaceship approaches and then flies alongside the missile the missile telemetry is intercepted by the spaceship and correlated with the types of downlink data extracted from the satellite earlier the spaceship computer uses its enormous processing capability and crosscorrelation algorithms to try to break the command code of the tiny missile eventually it is successful and the visitor is able to interact with the guided projectile the spaceship commands the missile to read out its guidance subroutines performing quadrillions of computations per second the intelligent computer at the heart of the interstellar craft deduces the targeting strategy for the missile a target image that would result in the missile landing in the ocean close to the chosen location for the space vehicle is commanded into the missiles guidance algorithm the spacecraft and missile plunge in tandem into the gulf of mexico the two vehicles come to rest about two miles apart on the ocean floor within the carefully coded fault protection software of the great spaceship which took over operation of the craft immediately after the explosion of the satellite four separate activities are being conducted in parallel one of the processors is sorting through the data archives associated with this particular planet to determine what possible indigenous species could have gone through an evolutionary burst and become spacefaring with such rapidity coupled with this first set of computations is an evaluation of the impact of such a local advanced intelligence on the survivability of the repatriated zygotes among the questions addressed by the evaluation is what active steps can be taken by the spaceship now to increase the likelihood of successful embryo germination and development a third processor in the central computer performs a thorough detailed analysis of the spacecraft state including careful assessments of repair techniques and materials needed to fix each and every damaged component the fourth major parallel subroutine directs the effort of the small flat robots that go out into the ocean first to verify that the nearby missile is harmless and can be safely brought back to the ship and second to catalogue all the flora and fauna in the neighborhood in case any kind of camouflage becomes necessary the carpets bring the missile to the spaceship for additional analysis no major new insights are gleaned from this study the engineering similarities between the missile and the earlier artificial satellite are simply catalogued in the data archives the concurrent spaceship damage assessment concludes that all the raw materials and tools necessary for the repairs are available except for the proper quantities of lead and gold both of which are difficult and timeconsuming to make in the transmuter if somehow enough additional lead and gold can be found then the spaceship can be ready to leave this planet in three local days if the spaceship has to make the lead and gold by itself including leaching the elements in trace amounts from the ocean around it then the total repair effort might take as long as thirty days the other two processors reach some equally interesting probabilistic conclusions mostly based upon the data taken during the endangered species roundup seven cycles earlier two separate types of animals one landbased and one waterbased are identified as the only possible candidates for the evolutionary burst that produced spacefarers in such a short time actually according to the computer if the landbased human beings survived their earlier nadir and did not become extinct they had by far the better chance of becoming the space voyager especially in view of the results of the experiments conducted on them at the zoo complex but if indeed the descendants of those bipedal upright aggressive creatures have become spacefarers the processor warns then the chances for survival to maturity by the zygotes in the cradle are extremely low unless somehow significant design changes in the cradle can be made on the spot or the development of the repatriates can be kept a secret from the humans for as long as a millicycle more worrisome for the extraterrestrial spaceship from the point of view of the overall mission is the tentative conclusion that it may well be discovered by the intelligent and potentially hostile inhabitants of the target planet in a comparatively short period of time if discovered and seriously threatened the spaceship could depart from the planet quickly and search for another haven to make repairs however traveling in the space environment in its current damaged state would be very risky another option would be for the spacecraft to send its own robots to the mines on this planet to extract the lead and gold that would virtually guarantee safe arrival at the next target where the heavy metals are plentiful in either case premature discovery by uncooperative earthlings would almost certainly doom the zygote cradle that would be left on the earth if it is known that the cradle system came from the alien spacecraft thus the first action that the spaceship takes is to check out deploy and then hide the earth cradle away from the vehicle the carpets locate a sequestered spot six or seven hundred yards away on the nearby ocean floor and the platforms move the gold metallic cradle into that place under a rock overhang to reduce the probability of being discovered the spaceship changes its outer surface to match the ocean floor around it after a complex set of analyses of its entire decision matrix the central computer concludes that the maximum likelihood of success path for the overall mission involves trying to enlist either the whales or the human beings to supply the extra lead and gold as well as the new information to be transmitted to the cradle so the spacecraft implements those repairs that are straightforward puts itself into a standby for launch mode and begins the task of communicating with the earthlings the data taken by the zoo explorers seven cycles ago suggested that the whales and human beings at that time had approximately the same potential for intelligence the whale language was richer and more complicated at the time of this earlier investigation the zoo explorers studied it briefly and recorded in the archives its fundamental tenets based upon that old data while at the same time trying to develop a scenario for communicating with the humans the spaceship attempts to make contact with the whales because the whales have not substantially changed in the intervening time the attempts are partially successful the whales understand that they are being called but they are mostly confused by the messages and unable to figure out how to respond two small pods of whales do however decipher the message transmitted in the ocean by the alien ship and swim toward its source the robots in the extraterrestrial spacecraft examine the whales carefully even showing the captive missile to one of the pods to elicit recognition and conclude absolutely that the whales cannot be the spacefarers therefore it is the human beings who have made the great evolutionary strides and must be contacted and somehow induced to provide the lead and the gold and the requisite information further attempts to communicate with the whales are abandoned before the alien ship has determined the method it will use to contact humanity chance provides it with an excellent opportunity during the final interactions with the whales three human beings are swimming in the neighborhood by incredible luck these three find the deployed cradle and take it to the land as a cautionary move the spaceship computer commands temporary changes inside the cradle to ensure its protection and to provide for more frequent status monitoring however there is no major concern yet the humans do not recognize the connection between the cradle and the spacecraft in addition with the zygotes in their early stages of pullulation the cradle has an extremely robust design having the cradle in the possession of humans at this time can also be viewed as an advantage for the superaliens receivers in the cradle can be commanded to listen to the conversations and then telemeter to the mother spacecraft information that will permit learning the rudiments of the human language the logical processes in the extraterrestrial computers are strained to the limit to figure out a way to contact human beings for help without creating undue risk for both the earth cradle and the rest of the mission the computers are about to decide on a rapid strike at mines for the lead and gold when they realize based on their partial understanding of the human language that the three humans who found the cradle may be coming back into the vicinity all of the spaceship processors are strapped together to design a scenario that will induce these humans to help them the inside of the spaceship is even reconfigured from scratch for the arrival of the humans for if the scenario is successful there is a high probability that the spaceship can continue on its mission having successfully deposited the millions of repatriated zygotes but without having disrupted the main flow of life on earth this was the original goal of the mission sunday it was after two oclock in the morning by the time the florida queen left the marina and headed out into the gulf of mexico carol and troy stood together against the railing while nick steered the boat through the harbor well angel troy said it has already been an unbelievable experience hasnt it and i must admit that i myself am a little nervous about what were going to find out at the dive site this time i thought you knew what was going to happen troy carol replied pointing at his bracelet dont they tell you everything they tell me a lot and im getting better at understanding their messages but how do i know if theyre telling the truth we have had the same problem with you at times nick interjected from under the canopy the boat was almost out in the open ocean the lights from key west were receding behind them in the final analysis particularly when nothing makes sense anyway it comes down to a question of trust if i were to ask myself logically why i am going out into the gulf of mexico in the middle of the night to take lead and gold and information to some extraterrestrials who stopped here on the earth to make repairs carol laughed and interrupted but theres no logical way to discuss this entire series of events troy already pointed that out were not operating on logic and i dont even think its a question of trust so much she paused and looked up at the stars its more like faith troy put his arm around carol and smiled i agree with you angel after all we dont know shit only they know carol yawned there was silence on the boat everyone was very tired after the security men had surrounded homer and greta at the miyako gardens the police had of course been called they had arrived within ten minutes but it had seemed as if their questions were going to last forever carol nick and troy had each been required to file a separate written statement homer and greta admitted nothing despite the fact that the security men had taken two handguns from them and matching bullet fragments were found inside troys car homer had phoned his lawyer and was expecting to be out on bail within four to six hours when the trio did finally reach the marina carrying the backpacks troy remembered that he had not yet connected the new navigation equipment maybe it was because troy was tired or perhaps having his two friends watch him part of the time over his shoulder made him nervous whatever the reason troy was very slow in installing and verifying the new navigation processor meanwhile carol and nick had been checking to ensure that there were three complete sets of diving apparatus onboard the boat the diving gear the men had used earlier in the evening was still out at the base in the possession of the united states navy nick thought he recalled putting enough extra equipment on the boat to handle the large party from tampa that had originally chartered the florida queen for the weekend he was correct but one of the regulator systems did not function properly during the checkout and had to be exchanged for a spare during the walk from the hotel to the marina nick and carol and troy had come to the unanimous conclusion that they would all three keep the underwater rendezvous with the superalien spaceship there was no other reasonable solution the boat could certainly be safely anchored and none of the three of them could bear to think of missing the climax to their adventure nick entered the ocean coordinates of the dive site into the navigation processor and put the boat on autopilot he saw carol yawn again it was infectious as he opened his mouth for a long relaxing yawn nick realized how exhausted he was he walked around behind the canopy and found two light air mattresses in a jumbled pile of supplies he started inflating one of them by blowing into a valve at the end carol came around to the back of the boat when the first mattress was almost inflated the light on top of the canopy gave her face a glow shes even beautiful when shes tired nick thought he motioned to the other mattress carol bent down to pick it up and started inflating it and very capable ive never met a woman who was so good at so many things nick finished with his air mattress and laid it down on the bottom of the boat carol was tiring so he helped her inflate the rest of her mattress he grabbed some towels and wadded them up like pillows we all have to sleep some he said to her as an explanation otherwise well be punchy when we try to dive carol nodded and walked back to the edge of the canopy is it all right with you if nick and i take a short nap she said to troy he smiled his assent wake one or both of us in an hour she continued if you want to use one of the air mattresses she turned around and started to leave uh troy she asked before she left the side of the canopy yes angel he answered do you know where they came from she pointed at the sky not too many stars were visible because of the brightness of the gibbous moon it was well past its zenith and already into its western descent troy looked up at the heavens and thought for almost a minute no angel he responded at length i think theyve tried to tell me maybe even twice but i cant understand what theyre saying but i do know that they come from another star troy now walked over beside carol and gave her a kiss on the cheek sleep tight and dont let the bedbugs bite he said and maybe you can ask them yourself after you wake up where do you come from carol was thinking and why did you land here in this place at this time she shaded her eyes from the glare of the moon and concentrated her attention on sirius the brightest true star in the sky do you have a home there around another star with mothers and fathers and brothers do you have love and oceans and mountains and music and longing and loneliness and fear of death for reasons she could not understand tears found their way into carols eyes she dropped her gaze and walked back to the air mattresses nick was already stretched out on one of them he was on his back and his eyes were closed carol lay down on the mattress beside him she reached out and put her hand in his he pulled her hand to his lips kissed it softly and dropped it on his chest nicks dream was confusing he was in the main lobby of a huge open library with twenty floors of books he could see the spiral staircases ascending to the stacks above him but you dont understand he said to the clerk standing behind the long counter i must read all these books this weekend otherwise i wont be ready for the test on monday im sorry sir the diffident clerk replied quietly after scanning nicks list a second time but all copies of these books are currently checked out nick started to panic he looked up at the enormously high ceiling and the floors of shelved books above him he saw carol dawson up on the third floor leaning against the railing and reading a book his panic subsided shell know the material he thought to himself in the dream he raced over to the staircase and bounded up the two flights of curving stairs he was out of breath when he reached carol she was reading one of the books that had been on his list oh good he said between gasps i knew as soon as i saw you that there was no worry she looked at him quizzically without warning she thrust her hand down into the top of his jeans and grabbed his penis he responded immediately and leaned forward to kiss her she shook her head and backed up he pursued her pushing her against the railing she fought him he pressed hard against her body and succeeded in kissing her the railing gave way and they were falling falling he woke up before they hit the floor in the lobby of the library nick shuddered himself awake carol was watching him intently her head was resting on her hands propped up by her elbow are you all right she asked as soon as he opened his eyes it took nick a few seconds to acclimate after the vivid dream his heart was still racing out of control i think so he said carol continued to stare at him why are you looking at me like that he asked well she began i woke up because you were talking i even thought i heard my name a couple of times maybe i imagined it if you dont mind my asking do you often talk in your sleep i dont know nick answered he laughed a little nobody has ever mentioned it to me before not even monique carol said her eyes did not leave nicks she could tell that he was trying to decide what kind of answer to give to her question youre pushing again a voice inside her said let the man do things at his own pace nick looked away we did not sleep together that much he said softly there was a long pause besides he said now turning back to carol that was ten years ago i was very young and she was married to someone else while they had been sleeping troy had switched off the light on the top of the canopy the only light on their faces now was the reflection from the moon they continued to look at each other in silence nick had not said very much to carol about monique but it had been more than he had ever told anyone else including his parents carol knew how much of an effort it had been for him to answer her question honestly she rolled over on her back again and extended her hand to nick so here we are mr williams two solitary voyagers on the sea of life both of us are now past thirty many of our friends and classmates have already settled down into that house in the suburbs with the two kids and a dog why not us whats different about us the moon was accelerating its downward arc through the sky above them as it descended more stars could be seen on the opposite horizon nick thought he saw a shooting star there would be no way to hide from feelings nick was jumping ahead of the conversation imagining for the moment that he was going to be involved with carol she would not permit it at least i would not have any doubts about where we stood when i was over at her house on friday morning nick finally replied to her question amanda winchester told me that im looking for a fantasy woman someone absolutely perfect and that mere mortals always come up short in my estimation he propped his head up and looked at carol but i think its something else i think maybe im not willing to make a commitment because of fear of rejection did i really say that wondered nick shocked at himself instantly he felt as if he never should have shared the thought his defenses began to build and he braced himself for a flippant or insensitive reply but it did not come instead carol was quiet and thoughtful at length she spoke my protection is different from yours she said i always play it safe i pick men i admire and respect intellectual pals if you will but for whom i do not have any passion when i meet a man who sets off the banjos and bells i run the other way because im afraid she thought afraid that i might love him as much as i did my father and i could not survive if i were abandoned like that again she felt nicks hand on her cheek he was caressing her gently she reached up took his hand and squeezed it he pulled himself up on his side where he could see her better she could tell that he wanted to kiss her she squeezed his hand again slowly tentatively he dropped his mouth on hers it was a tender adoring kiss without pressure or overt passion a subtle artful question that could have been either the beginning of a love affair or the sole kiss exchanged between two people whose paths just happened to cross in life carol heard banjos and bells winters stood on the deck by himself smoking quietly it was not a large boat this converted trawler but it was very fast they had not left the dock until after four oclock and they had almost caught up with their prey already the commander rubbed his eyes and yawned he was tired he blew smoke out over the ocean on the eastern horizon there was just a faint suggestion of dawn to the west in the direction of the moon winters thought he saw the dim light of another boat these young people must all be crazy he thought to himself as he reflected back on the events of the evening why the hell did they leave did they push todd down those stairs without his knowing it it would have been so much easier if they had just stayed there until we returned he remembered the look on lieutenant ramirez face when he had interrupted the telephone conversation that winters had been having with his wife betty excuse me commander ramirez had said he had been out of breath you must come quickly lieutenant todd is injured and our prisoners have escaped he had told his wife that he had no idea when he would be home and then joined ramirez for the short walk back to the administration annex on the way winters had been thinking about tiffani about the difficulty he had had in explaining to the seventeenyearold why he could not just drop everything and meet her at the party but you can work any day or night vernon she had said this is our only time to be together she had already drunk too much champagne later in the conversation when winters had made it clear to her that he almost certainly would not make it to the party at all and that he would probably ask melvin and marc to take her home tiffani had become petulant and angry she had stopped calling him vernon all right commander she had said i guess ill see you at the theater on tuesday night the phone had clicked off and winters had felt an ache tearing through his heart oh fuck he had thought for a moment ive blown it he had imagined himself jumping in the car forgetting todd and ramirez and the panther missile and driving over to the party to sweep tiffani into his arms but he had not done it despite his incredible longing he was not able to pull himself away from his duty if it was meant to be he told himself consolingly then those flames of passion will burn again but even with his limited romantic experience winters knew better timing is everything in a love affair if momentum is lost at a critical moment especially when the rhythm of the passion is heading for a climax it will never be regained ramirez had already called the doctor on the base and he had arrived at the annex just after the two officers while they were standing there together ramirez had insisted to winters that it must have been foul play that todd could not have fallen so hard unless he had either been pushed or thrown down the concrete steps the lieutenant had begun to stir during the doctors examination he has a bad concussion the doctor had said after he first checked todds eyes hell probably be all right but hell have a ferocious headache in the morning meanwhile well take him over to the infirmary and sew up that gash in his head to winters it didnt make sense while he was waiting patiently in an adjoining room for the doctors and nurses to finish the stitches in the lieutenants head winters tried to figure out what possible motive nick and carol and troy could have had for attacking todd and then escaping the dawson woman is smart and successful why would she do it he wondered if perhaps the trio might have been involved in some kind of big drug transaction that would at least explain all the gold but todd and ramirez did not find any indication of drugs so what the hell is happening lieutenant todd had been kept awake during the procedure in the emergency room he had been given only a local anesthetic to reduce his pain but he had not been very lucid in response to the doctors simple questions that sometimes happens with a concussion the medical officer had told winters afterward he may not be very coherent for the next day or two nevertheless around two oclock immediately after todds head had been shaven stitched and bandaged commander winters and lieutenant ramirez had decided to ask him about what had occurred at the annex the commander could not accept todds answer even though the lieutenant repeated it twice verbatim todd had insisted that a sixfoot carrot with vertical slits in its face had hidden in the bathroom and had jumped him while he was trying to take a piss he had escaped that first assault but the giant carrot had then followed him into the main room at the annex and just how did this thing carrot interrupted todd and how did this carrot attack you continued winters jesus he had thought this man has cracked one bump on he head and he has finally flipped its hard to describe exactly lieutenant todd had answered slowly you see it had four doodads hanging out of these vertical slits in its head they were all mean looking the doctor had come up and interrupted gentlemen he had said with a perfect bedside smile my patient desperately needs rest surely some of these questions can wait until tomorrow commander winters remembered an overpowering sense of bewilderment as he watched the gurney take lieutenant todd from the emergency operating room to the infirmary as soon as todd was out of earshot the commander had turned to lieutenant ramirez and what do you make of all this lieutenant commander sir im no medical expert i know that lieutenant i dont want your medical opinion i want to know what you think about the uh carrot business damn him winters had thought does he have so little imagination that he cant even react to todds story sir ramirez had replied the carrot business is outside my experience to say the least winters smiled to himself and flipped his cigarette into the water he walked over to the little wheelhouse and checked the navigator they were only seven miles from the target boat and converging rapidly he pulled back on the throttle and put the boat into neutral gear winters did not want to draw any closer to the florida queen until ramirez and the other two seamen were awake and in position he estimated that it was still about forty minutes until sunrise winters laughed again about ramirezs unwillingness to venture a comment on todds carrot story but the young latino is a good officer his only mistake was following todd winters remembered how quickly ramirez had organized all the details of their current sortie picking the hightech converted trawler for speed and stealth rousting the two bachelor seamen who worked for him in intelligence and establishing a special link between the base and the trawler so that the whereabouts of the florida queen would be known at all times we must follow them we really have no choice lieutenant ramirez had said firmly to winters after they had verified that nicks boat had indeed left the hemingway marina just after two oclock otherwise theres no way we could ever justify our having taken them into custody in the first place winters had reluctantly agreed and ramirez had organized the chase the commander had told the younger men to get some sleep while he formulated the plan which is simple okay you guys come with us and answer the questions or well charge you under the sedition act of now after putting the boat in idle winters was ready to wake ramirez and the other two men he intended to apprehend nick carol and troy as soon as it was daylight the wind around the boat changed direction and winters stopped a minute to check the weather he turned his face toward the moon the air suddenly felt warmer almost hot and he was reminded of a night off the coast of libya eight years earlier the worst night of my life he thought for a few moments his resolve to carry out his plan wavered and he asked himself if he was about to make another mistake then he heard a trumpet blast followed maybe four seconds later by a similar but quieter sound winters looked around him in the placid ocean he saw nothing now he heard a group of trumpets and their echo both sounds distinctly coming from the west the commander strained his eyes in the direction of the moon silhouetted against its face he saw what appeared to be a group of snakes dancing out of the water he went inside the wheelhouse to fetch a pair of binoculars by the time the commander returned to the railing a magnificent symphony surrounded him where is this incredible music coming from he asked at first before he succumbed completely to its mesmerizing beauty he stood powerless against the railing listening intently the music was rich emotional full of evocative longing winters was swept away not only into his own past where his deepest memories were stored but also onto another planet in another era where proud and dignified serpents with blue necks called to their loved ones during their short annual mating rite he was spellbound tears were already flooding into his eyes when he at last mechanically lifted the binoculars and focused on the strange sinuous shapes underneath the moon the ghostlike images were completely transparent the moonlight went right through them as winters watched what was a thousand necks dancing above the water cavorting back and forth in perfect rhythm and as he heard the music build toward the concluding crescendo of the canthorean mating symphony his tired eyes blurred and he swore that what he saw across the water in front of him calling to him with a song of longing and desire was an image of tiffani thomas his heart was devastated by the combination of the music and the sight of her winters was aware of an intense sense of loss unparalleled in his life yes he said to himself as tiffani continued to beckon in the distance im coming im sorry tiffani darling tomorrow i will come to see you we will he stopped his interior monologue to wipe his eyes the music had now entered the final crescendo signaling the actual mating dance of the pairs of canthorean serpents winters looked through his binoculars again the image of tiffani was gone he adjusted his glasses joanna carr came into focus smiled briefly and disappeared a moment later the little arab girl from the virginia beach seemed to dance just under the moon she was happy and gay she too was gone in an instant the music was all around him bursts of sound powerful full expressing pleasure no longer anticipated but now being experienced he looked through his binoculars one more time the moon was setting as it fell into the ocean the image created against its illuminated disc by the dancing serpents was unmistakable winters clearly saw the faces of his wife betty and his son hap they were smiling at him together with a deep and abiding affection they remained there in his vision until the moon sank completely into the ocean carol struggled to adjust her diving equipment do you need some help angel troy asked he came over and stood beside her in the predawn dark he was already fully prepared for the dive i havent worn anything like this since my first set of scuba lessons she said fidgeting uncomfortably with the oldfashioned gear troy tightened the weight belt around her waist youre scared arent you angel carol didnt answer right away me too my pulse rate must be twice normal carols equipment seemed to please her finally you know troy even after the last three days my brain is having a hard time convincing the rest of me that all this is really happening imagine writing it down for someone to read as we were preparing to return to the alien spaceship hey you guys come here nick called from the other side of the canopy carol and troy walked around to the front of the boat nick was staring out across the ocean to the east he handed a small pair of binoculars to carol do you see a light out there in the distance just to the left of that island carol could barely make out the light uh huh she said to nick but so what isnt it reasonable that somewhere out in the ocean there would be another boat of course nick answered but that light hasnt moved for fifteen minutes its just sitting there why would a fishing boat or any other kind of boat be sh interrupted troy he put his fingers to his lips listen he whispered i hear music his companions stood quietly on the deck behind them the moon disappeared into the ocean above the gentle lapping of the waves all three of them could hear what sounded like the climax of a symphony played by a full orchestra they listened for thirty seconds the music reached a peak faded slightly and then ceased abruptly that was beautiful carol remarked and weird nick said walking over beside her where the hell was it coming from is someone out there testing a new stereo system my god if the sound travels five or ten miles it must be deafening up close troy was standing off to the side by himself he was concentrating on something suddenly he turned to his companions i know this sounds crazy he said to nick and carol but i think the music was a signal for us to dive or perhaps a warning great said carol thats what we need to reassure us a warning of some kind as if were not nervous enough nick put his arm around her hey lady he said dont wimp out on us now after all those brave comments about a once in a lifetime experience really lets go troy said impatiently he looked anxious and very serious im definitely getting the message that we should dive now troys solemnity changed the mood of the trio the three of them worked together in silence to secure the two buoyancy bags containing the lead the gold and the information discs the eastern sky continued to brighten it was only about fifteen minutes until sunrise while they were working carol noticed that nick seemed a little distracted right before they left the boat she walked up beside him are you all right she said quietly yes he answered im just trying to figure out if ive completely lost my mind for eight years i have been thinking about what i would do if i ever had my full share of the treasure now im about to give it all away to some extraterrestrials from god knows where he looked at her theres enough gold here to last three people a long time i know she said giving him a little hug i must admit that ive thought about it too but in reality part belongs to amanda winchester part to jake lewis most of it to the irs she grinned and its only money thats nothing when you compare it to being the only humans to interact with visitors from another planet i hope youre right he said i hope i dont wake up tomorrow and feel as if ive made a terrible mistake this entire episode has been so bizarre that i suspect my normal faculties arent working properly we dont even know for sure if these aliens are friendly carol pulled her diving mask over her face well never have all the answers she said she took his hand lets go nick troy was first into the water nick and carol followed it had been agreed before the dive that carol would take the searchlight and lead the group she was the most mobile of the threesome because each of the men was dragging a buoyancy bag the trio had been concerned that they might have difficulty finding the ship and had discussed an elaborate set of contingency plans for locating it they neednt have worried thirty feet under the florida queen in virtually the exact place where the fissure had been on thursday there was a light in the water carol pointed at it and the two men swam up behind her as they drew closer they saw that the light was coming from a rectangular area about ten feet high and twenty feet wide they could not see anything except what looked like some kind of material or fabric with a soft light behind it carol hesitated troy swam right on by her into the lighted area his buoyancy bag trailing behind him everything disappeared nick and carol waited carol felt herself tightening up come on now dawson she thought its your turn youve been here before she took a deep breath and swam into the material she felt something like plastic touch her face and then she was in a covered tunnel a swift current was pulling her to the right she went down a small water slide and was deposited in a shallow pool at the bottom she clambered out of the pool and began removing her diving equipment troy was standing on the floor about ten feet beyond the end of the pool next to him a warden had already taken the buoyancy bag opened it and adroitly separated the gold bars and the lead weights from the information discs as carols eyes adjusted to the dim light around her she saw that the warden was now loading the gold on a small platform sitting on top of tank treads about a foot above the floor immediately thereafter the warden placed the information discs and the lead weights on two other platforms a carpet that had been lying inconspicuously over against the wall on the left then rose up apparently activated the treads under the platforms and directed them toward a nearby hallway leading out of the room carol pulled off her mask and finished removing her diving gear she was in a mediumsized room somewhat like the ones she and troy had encountered at the beginning of her last dive the curved wall partitions were colored black and white there was a small window to the ocean next to the splash pool on her left the ceilings were low and tight only a couple of feet above her head giving her a feeling of claustrophobia so here i am again she thought back in wonderland this time i will take plenty of pictures she photographed the procession of the carpet and three platforms just as it disappeared from the room she then changed lenses and took a dozen quick closeup pictures of the warden standing next to troy it had the same amoebalike central body as the one she had confronted the day before but there were only five implements sticking out of its upper half the warden had probably been customized for its particular job of taking the objects from the trio troy walked over beside her wheres nick he asked my god carol thought as she turned around and looked back at the slide and splash pool i almost forgot she chastised herself for not having waited for nick after all hes never been down here nicks big body careened out of control against the sides of the slide and he hurtled into the splash pool the heavy buoyancy bag came down behind him and hit him hard just above the kidneys he stumbled to his feet fell down in the pool and then stood up again in his diving apparatus with the thin plastic material from the bag tied around his wrist it was he who looked like the visitor from outer space carol and troy were laughing as nick climbed out of the splash pool all right professor exclaimed troy he reached forward to give him a hand good show its a shame we dont have that entry on tape nick removed his mouthpiece he was out of breath thanks a lot for waiting team he stammered he looked around him what is this place anyway the warden meanwhile had approached him from the side and was already tugging at the bag with one of its appendages just a minute weirdo nick said suppressing his fright let me get my bearings first the warden didnt stop a knifelike appendage cut the bag below where it was attached to nicks wrist next the warden took the entire bag including its lead and gold contents and somehow pushed it through its own semipermeable outer skin the bag could be seen intact adjacent to the rectangular control boxes as the warden turned and hurried across the floor it went through the same exit that the carpet and platforms had used earlier youre welcome nick managed to say as he watched the strange creature disappear with the loot he finished taking off his diving gear and walked over to troy okay jefferson youre the main man here what do we do now well professor he answered as far as i can tell our job is finished if you guys want we can suit up again and jump through that window wall over there wed be back in the boat in less than five minutes if ive read the messages right these alien dudes will be ready to leave very shortly you mean thats it were done carol asked troy nodded this is the most overrated experience since my first sexual encounter carol commented nick was walking across the room moving directly away from the splash pool and his two friends where are you going troy asked i paid a hefty admission price nick replied im at least entitled to a tour carol and troy followed him they crossed the empty room and walked through an exit between two wall partitions on the opposite side they entered a short dark covered corridor they could see light at the other end they emerged into another room this one circular and significantly larger it had the high cathedral ceilings that carol had liked so much on her last visit this room was not empty sitting in its middle facing them was a gigantic enclosed translucent cylinder about twentyfive feet high altogether and ten feet in diameter at its base a horde of orange pipes and purple cable sheaths attached the cylinder to a group of machines built into the wall behind it there was a light green liquid filling the inside of the cylinder and eight gold metallic objects floating at different heights in the liquid the objects were many different shapes one looked like a starfish another like a box a third like a derby hat the only thing the objects had in common was their gold metallic outer covering upon close inspection of the cylinder thin membranes could be seen inside the liquid these surfaces effectively partitioned the internal volume and gave each of the golden objects its own unique subvolume all right genius nick said to troy after he stared at the cylinder for almost a full minute explain what this is all about carol was in a photographers paradise she had nearly finished recording all hundred and twentyeight pictures that could be stored on one minidisc she had photographed the cylinder from all angles including a closeup of each of the objects suspended in the liquid and was now working on the machines behind it she stopped taking pictures to listen to troys reply well professor troy started his forehead was knitted as he tried to concentrate as far as i can make out from what theyve been trying to tell me this spaceship is on a mission to a dozen planets that are scattered in this part of the galaxy on each planet the aliens leave one of those golden things you see in the cylinder they contain tiny embryos or seeds that have been genetically engineered for survival on that specific planet carol walked over beside them so the ship goes from planet to planet dropping off these packages containing seeds of some kind sort of a galactic johnny appleseed sort of angel except that there are both animal and plant seeds inside the container plus advanced robots that nurture and educate the growing things until they reach maturity then the creatures can flourish on their own without help all in that one little package nick asked he looked again at the fascinating objects floating in the liquid in the cylinder he loved the golden color all of a sudden he thought of the trident he imagined thousands of tiny swarming embryos inside its outer golden surface and in his minds eye he projected the growth of the swarm into the future there was something fearsome about creatures genetically engineered to survive on the planet earth what if they are not friendly nicks heart sped up as he realized what had been bothering him partly subconsciously since he started believing troys story about the aliens why did they stop on the earth in the first place what do they really want from us his mind raced on and if that trident contains beings destined for earth that are extremely advanced he thought then it doesnt matter if they are friendly we will be finished sooner or later anyway carol and troy were talking in general terms about the way an advanced civilization might use seeds to colonize other planets nick wasnt listening carefully i cant tell troy or even carol if the aliens know what im thinking they will stop me id better do it soon troy he heard carol say as she began to take another set of pictures of the objects in the cylinder is it just coincidence that the trident we found on thursday looks so much like one of these seed packages nick did not wait for troy to answer excuse me he interrupted in a loud voice i forgot something very important i must go back to the boat stay here and wait for me ill be right back he burst out of the room down the corridor and across the room with the low ceiling and the window on the ocean good he said to himself nothing is going to stop me without even pausing to put on his diving gear nick took a huge breath and dove through the window he was afraid that his lungs were going to explode before he reached the surface but he made it he climbed up the ladder and onto the boat nick went immediately to the bottom drawer underneath the racks of electronic equipment he reached in and grabbed the golden trident he could feel that the axis rod had thickened considerably it was now nearly twice as thick as it had been the first time that he held it carol was right damnit why didnt i listen to her at the time he pulled the object completely out of the drawer the sun was just about to come up behind him in the dawn light nick could see that the trident had changed in several other ways it was heavier the individual tines on the fork end were much thicker and had almost grown together in addition there was an open hole into a soft gooey interior on the north pole of the larger of the two spheres nick examined it carefully suddenly he felt powerful arms wrap themselves around his chest and upper body forcing him to drop the trident on the floor of the boat now just hold steady he heard a lightly accented voice say and turn around slowly we wont hurt you if you cooperate nick turned around commander winters and a tall fat seaman that nick had never seen before were standing in front of him in wetsuits lieutenant ramirez was still holding him from behind ramirez gradually released nick and bent down to pick up the trident he handed it to winters thank you lieutenant winters said where are your companions williams he then asked nick down there with my missile nick didnt say anything at first too much was happening too fast he was having difficulty integrating winters into his scenario for returning the trident to the spaceship as soon as nick had felt the changes in its outer surface he had known for certain that the trident was one of the seed packages winters was studying the trident and whats the significance of this thing he said you guys have taken enough photographs of it nick was doing some calculations if i am delayed here very long then carol and troy will undoubtedly leave the ship and the aliens will launch he took a deep breath my only chance is the truth commander winters nick began please listen very carefully to what im about to say it will sound fantastic even preposterous but its all true and if you will come with me i can prove everything to you the fate of the human race may well depend on what we do in the next five minutes he paused to organize his ideas for some reason winters thought about the ridiculous carrot story that todd had told him but the earnestness he was seeing in nicks face persuaded him to continue to pay attention go ahead williams he said carol dawson and troy jefferson are right now onboard a superadvanced extraterrestrial spaceship that is directly under this boat the alien vehicle is traveling from planet to planet depositing packages of embryonic beings that are genetically designed to survive on a particular planet that golden thing in your hand is in a sense a cradle for creatures that may later flourish on the earth i must return it to the aliens before they leave or our descendants may not survive commander winters looked at nick as if he had lost his mind the commander started to say something no nick interrupted hear me out the spacecraft also stopped here because it needed some repairs at one time we thought it might have found your missile thats partially how we got involved in the first place we didnt know about the creatures in the cradle so we were trying to help one of the things the aliens needed for their repairs was gold you see they only had three days jesus k christ winters shouted at nick do you really expect me to believe this crap this is the looniest most farfetched story i have ever heard in my entire life youre nuts cradles aliens who need gold for repairs i suppose next youll be telling me that they are six feet tall and look like carrots and have four vertical slits in their faces nick added winters glanced around you told him he said to lieutenant ramirez ramirez shook his head back and forth no nick continued abruptly as the commander looked completely confused the carrot thing wasnt an alien at least not one of the superaliens who made the ship the carrot was a holographic projection the perplexed commander winters waved his hands im not listening to any more of this nonsense williams at least not here what i want to know is what you and your friends know about the location of the missile now will you come with us over to our boat of your own free will or do we have to tie you up at that moment six feet above them a tenlegged black spiderlike creature with a body about four inches in diameter walked unnoticed to the edge of the canopy it extended three antennae in their direction and then leaped off the side landing on the back of lieutenant ramirez neck aieee screamed the lieutenant during the pause in the conversation he fell down on his knees behind nick and grasped at the black thing that was trying to take a sample chunk out of his neck for a second nobody moved then nick grabbed a large pair of pliers from the counter and thwacked the black thing once twice and even a third time before it released its grip on ramirez neck all four men watched it fall to the deck scuttle rapidly over to the cradle that commander winters had put down so that he could assist ramirez shrink its size by a factor of ten and disappear into the cradle through the soft gooey opening on the top of the sphere within seconds the goo hardened and all the external surfaces of the cradle were again rigid winters was flabbergasted ramirez crossed himself the seaman looked as if he were about to faint i swear to you that my story is true commander nick said calmly all you have to do is come down with me and see for yourself i left my diving gear down there so that i could hurry up here to retrieve this thing we can go together with my last working tank and share the air supply winters head was spinning the tenlegged spider was the straw that broke the camels back he felt that he had now entered the twilight zone i have never seen or heard anything even remotely like this before in my life winters thought and only half an hour ago i had wild hallucinations with musical accompaniment maybe i am the one losing touch with reality lieutenant ramirez was still on his knees it looked as if he were praying or maybe this is finally my sign from god all right williams the commander was surprised to hear himself say ill go with you but my men will wait here on your boat for our return nick picked up the trident and raced around the canopy to prepare the diving equipment it took carol and troy a few seconds to react to nicks abrupt departure that was strange carol said finally what do you suppose he forgot i have no idea troy shrugged but i hope he hurries back i dont think its very long until launch and im sure they will throw us out before then carol thought for a moment and then turned back to look at the cylinder you know troy those golden things are exactly like the trident on the outside did you say i didnt answer you before angel troy interrupted but yes youre right it is the same material i hadnt realized until we came down here today that what we picked up on that first dive was the seed package for earth they may have tried to tell me before maybe i just didnt understand them carol was fascinated she walked over and put her face against the cylinder wall it felt more like glass than plastic so maybe i was right when i thought it was heavier and thicker she said as much to herself as to troy and inside that trident are seeds for better plants and animals troy nodded his head in response there was now some motion inside the cylinder the thin membranes separating the subvolumes were growing what appeared to be guidewires that were wrapping themselves around the individual golden objects carol reloaded her camera with a new disc and ran around the outside of the cylinder stopping in the best positions to photograph the process troy looked down at his bracelet theres no doubt about it angel these ets are definitely preparing to launch maybe we should go well wait as long as we can carol shouted from across the room these photographs will he priceless they both could now hear weird noises behind the walls the noises were not loud but they were distracting because they were erratic and so totally alien troy paced nervously as he listened to the gamut of sounds carol walked over beside him besides she said nick asked us to wait for him thats great troy answered as long as they wait as well he seemed uncharacteristically nervous i dont want to be onboard when these guys leave the earth hey there mr jefferson carol said you are supposed to he the calm one relax you just said yourself that you think theyll throw us out before they leave she paused and looked searchingly at troy what do you know that i dont troy turned away from her and started walking toward the exit carol ran after him and grabbed his arm what is it troy she said whats wrong look angel he replied not looking directly at her i just figured it out myself a minute ago and im still not sure what it means i hope i havent made a terrible what are you talking about she interrupted him youre not making any sense the earth package he blurted out it has human seeds in it too along with the trees and insects and grasses and birds carol stood facing troy trying to understand what was bothering him so much when they came here a long long time ago he said his face wrinkled with concern they took specimens of the different species and returned them to their home world where they were improved by genetic engineering and prepared for their eventual return to the earth some of those specimens were human beings carols heart quickened as she realized what troy was telling her so thats it she said to herself there are superhumans inside that package weve found not just better flowers and better bugs but better people as well but unlike troy carols immediate reaction was not fear she was overwhelmed by curiosity can i see them she asked excitedly troy didnt understand the superhumans or whatever you want to call them she continued can i see them troy shook his head theyre just tiny zygotes angel more than a billion would fit in your hand you wouldnt be able to see anything carol was not dissuaded but these guys have such amazing technological ability maybe they can she stopped wait a minute troy remember that carrot on the base it was a holographic projection and must have come somehow out of the information base on this spacecraft carol walked away from troy into the middle of the room she raised her arms and looked up at the ceiling thirty feet above her okay you guys whoever you are she invoked in a loud voice now theres something that i want we risked our ass to get what you needed for your repairs you can at least reciprocate i want to see what we might look like someday to their left not too far from one of the large blocky machines connected to the cylinder two of the wall partitions moved apart to form a hallway they could see light at the other end come on an exultant carol called to troy who was again smiling and admiring her assertiveness lets go see what our superaliens have created for us now at the end of the short corridor there was a softly lit square room about twenty feet on a side against the opposite wall illuminated by a blue light that gave the entire tableau a surrealistic appearance eight children were standing around a large glowing model of the earth as carol and troy approached they recognized that what they were seeing was not real that it was simply a complex sequence of images projected into the air in front of them but the diaphanous picture contained such rich detail that it was easy to forget it was just a projection the children were four or five years old all were wearing only a thin white loincloth that covered their genitals there were four girls and four boys two of them were black two were caucasian with blue eyes and blonde hair two were oriental and the final boy and girl definitely twins looked like a mixture of all humanity what carol immediately noticed was their eyes all eight children had large piercing eyes of brilliant intensity that were focused on the glowing earth in front of them the continents of this planet the little black boy was saying were once tied together in a single gigantic land mass that stretched from pole to pole this was relatively recently only about two hundred million years ago since that time the motion of the plates on which the individual land masses rest has completely changed the configuration of the surface here for example you can see the indian sub continent tearing away from antarctica a hundred million years ago and moving across the ocean toward an eventual collision with asia it was this collision and the subsequent plate interaction that lifted the himalayas the highest mountains on the planet to their current height as the little boy was talking the electronic model earth in front of him demonstrated the continental changes that he was describing but what is the mechanism that causes these plates and land masses to move with respect to each other the tiny blondehaired girl asked psst carol whispered in troys ear how come they are speaking english and know all this earth geography troy looked at her as if he were disappointed and made a circular motion with his hands of course carol said to herself theyve already processed the discs then this activity results in material being thrust upward from the mantle below the earths crust eventually the continents are pushed apart any other questions the black boy was smiling he pointed at the model in front of him heres what will happen to the land masses in the next fifty million years or so the americas will continue to move to the west away from africa and europe making the south atlantic a much larger ocean the persian gulf will close altogether australia will drive north toward the equator and press against asia and both baja california and the area around los angeles will split off from north america to drift northward in the pacific ocean by fifty million years from now los angeles will start sliding into the aleutian islands all of the children watched the changing globe with complete attention when the continents on the surface of the model stopped moving the oriental boy stepped slightly out from the group we have seen this continental drift phenomenon that brian has been describing on half a dozen other planets all of them bodies mostly covered by a liquid tomorrow sherry will lead a more detailed discussion about the forces inside a planet that cause the sea floor to spread in the first place a projected image of a warden entered the scene from the left and removed both the earth globe and several other unidentified props the small boy waited patiently for the warden to complete his task and then continued darla and david now want to share with us a project they have been working on for several days they will play the music while miranda and justin perform the dance they choreographed the mixed twins turned eagerly to their classmates the girl spoke out when we first learned about adult love and the changes that we all can expect after we pass puberty david and i tried to envision what it would be like to find a new desire even stronger than those we already know our joint vision became a short musical composition and a dance we call it the dance of love the two children sat down away from the group almost at the side of the image and began moving their fingers rapidly as if they were typing on the floor a light synthesized melody pleasant and spirited filled the room the blond boy and the oriental girl began to dance in the center of the group at first in the dance the two were totally separate unaware of each other each child completely absorbed in his own activities the boy knelt down to pick a beautiful flower its red and white coloring shimmering in the holographic projection the girl bounced a large bright blue ball as she danced after a while the little girl noticed the boy and approached him somewhat tentatively offering to share the ball the boy played ball with her but ignored everything except the game this is magic thought carol as she watched the childrens images moving with grace and deft precision in front of her these children are wonderful but they cant be real they are too orderly too selfcontained where is the tension the strife but despite her questions she was profoundly moved by the scene she was witnessing the children were acting in concert as a group flowing in harmony from activity to activity their body language was open and unafraid no neuroses were blocking their learning process the dance continued the music deepened as the boy began to pay attention to his partner and she began arranging her hair with his favorite flowers for their brief encounters the body movements changed as well the sprightly exuberant bounces of the initial stages giving way to subtly suggestive motions designed to awaken and then tease the budding libido the tiny dancers touched moved away and came back together in an embrace carol was entranced how would my life have been different she wondered if i had known all this at the age of five she remembered her rich friend at soccer camp jessica from laguna beach whom she had seen occasionally in subsequent years jessica was always ahead always had to be first she had had sex with boys before i even started my period and look what happened to her three marriages three divorces just thirty years old carol tried to stop her mind from drifting so that she could pay complete attention to the dance suddenly she remembered her camera she had just taken her first pictures of the children when she heard a noise behind her nick was coming toward them through the corridor and he was carrying the trident in his hand nick started to say something but troy hushed him by putting his finger against his own lips and pointing at the dance in progress the tempo had now changed the two mixed children had somehow put the music on automatic and joined the blond boy and the oriental girl in the dance carols first impression before nick spoke out loud was that the dance was now exploring friendships between the paired couple and other people whats this all about nick said the moment he spoke the entire projected tableau vanished all of the children the dance and the music disappeared in an instant carol was surprised to find that she was disappointed and even a little angry now youve blown it she said nick looked at his companions stern faces jesus he said holding up the cradle such a greeting i bust my butt to go retrieve this damn thing and you guys are pissed when i come back because i interrupt a movie of some kind for your information mr williams carol replied what we were watching was no ordinary movie in fact those kids in that dance are the same species as the ones in your trident nick looked at her skeptically tell him troy shes right professor troy said we just figured it out while you were gone that thing youre carrying is the seed package for earth some of the zygotes in there are what carol calls superhumans genetically engineered humans with more capability than you or me like the kids we just saw nick lifted the cradle to eye level i had figured out myself that this thing was a seed package but whats this shit about human seeds he glanced at troy youre serious arent you troy nodded his head troy nodded all three of them stared intently at the object in front of them carol kept glancing back and forth from the trident to where the image of the superchildren had been it still doesnt seem possible nick added but then nothing else has for the last so what did you forget nick carol interrupted and why did you bring that thing back there was no immediate response from nick by the way she smiled you missed the show of a lifetime the trident was what i forgot nick answered it occurred to me while i was studying the gold objects in the cylinder that our trident might be a seed package and i was worried that it might be dangerous the sudden sound of organ music flooding down the corridor from the large room behind them stopped their conversation nick and carol looked at troy he put the bracelet up to his ear as if he were listening to it and cracked a large grin i think thats the fiveminute warning troy said wed better make our last touchdown and clear out of here the trio turned and walked back down the corridor to the room with the cylinder when they arrived carol and troy were astonished to see a figure in a blue and white wetsuit on the opposite side of the room he was kneeling reverently right next to the cylinder oh yeah said nick with a nervous laugh i forgot to tell you commander winters came back with me commander winters had felt quite comfortable in the water even though he had not been down on a dive in five years nick had gone freestyle swimming right beside the commander and using the emergency mouthpiece connected to the air supply on winters back despite his sense of urgency nick had remembered that winters was basically a novice again and had not rushed the first part of the dive but when winters had refused several times to follow nick up close to the light in the ocean nick had become exasperated nick had then taken a final deep breath from the ancillary mouthpiece and grabbed winters by the shoulders with gestures he had explained to the commander that he nick was going to go through the plastic stuff or whatever it was in front of the light and that winters could either follow him or not the commander had reluctantly given nick his hand nick turned around immediately and pulled winters into and through the membrane that separated the alien spaceship from the ocean winters had been completely terrified during his tumble on the water slide inside the vehicle as a result he had lost his bearings and had had great difficulty standing up after he landed in the splash pool nick was already out of the pool and anxious to find his friends look nick had said as soon as he could get the commanders attention im going to leave you now for a few minutes he had pointed at the exit on the opposite of the room well be in the big room with the high ceilings just on the other side of that wall then he had left carrying the strange golden object from the boat winters was left alone he carefully pulled himself out on the side of the splash pool and methodically stacked his equipment alongside all the rest of the diving gear he looked around the room noting the curves in the black and white partitions he too felt the closeness of the ceiling now according to williams the commander thought to himself im in part of an alien spaceship that has temporarily stopped on earth so far except for that clever oneway entrance that i did not have time to analyze i see no evidence of extraterrestrial origin comforted by his logic he eased across the room toward the opposite wall and into the dark corridor but his newfound sense of comfort was totally destroyed when he walked into the room dominated by the enormous cylinder with the golden objects floating in the light green liquid he arched his back and stared at the vaulted cathedral ceilings far above his head he then approached the cylinder for winters the connection between the trident that nick had been holding and the objects inside the cylinder was instantaneous those must be more seed packages destined for other worlds winters thought his crisp logic disappearing in a quick leap of faith with sixroot carrots and who knows what else to populate a few of the billions of worlds in our galaxy alone the commander walked around the cylinder as if he were in a dream his mind continually replayed both what nick had told him right before they descended and the amazing scene he had witnessed when the spiderlike creature had shrunk up and jumped into the golden object so its all true all those things the scientists have been saying about the possibility of vast hordes of living creatures out there among the stars he stopped for a moment partially listening to the strange noises behind the walls and we are only a few of gods many many children organ music similar in timbre to that which carol had heard when she had finished playing silent night but with a different tune began to sound in the distant reaches of the ceiling above him it reminded winters of church music his reaction was instinctual he knelt down in front of the cylinder and clasped his hands together in prayer the music swelled in the room what winters heard in his head was the introduction to the doxology the short hymn that he had heard every single sunday for eighteen years in the presbyterian church in columbus indiana in his minds eye he was thirteen years old again and sitting next to betty in his choir robes he smiled at her and they stood up together praise god from whom all blessings flow the choir sang the first phrase of the hymn and winters brain was bombarded by a montage of memories from his early teens and before a suite of epiphanic images of his innocent and unknowing closeness with a parental god one who was in the wall behind his bed or just over his rooftop or at most in the summer afternoon clouds above columbus here was an eightyearold boy praying that his father would not find out that it was he who had set fire to the vacant lot across from the smith mansion another time at ten the little vernon wept bitter tears as he held his dead cocker spaniel runtie in his arms and begged the omniscient god to accept his dead dogs soul into heaven the night before the easter pageant the first time that vernon had portrayed him in his final hours dragging the cross to calvary elevenyearold vernon had been unable to sleep as the night was passing by the boy began to panic began to fear that he would freeze up and forget his lines but then he had known what to do he had reached under his pillow and found the little new testament that always stayed there day and night he had opened it to matthew go ye therefore it had said baptizing all nations that had been enough then vernon had prayed for sleep his friendly fatherly god had sent the little boy an image of himself delivering a spellbinding performance in the pageant the next day comforted by that picture he had fallen asleep praise him all creatures here below with the second phrase of the hymn resounding in his ears the venue for winters mental montage changed to annapolis maryland he was a young man now in the last two years of his university work at the naval academy the pictures that flooded his brain were all taken at the same place outside the beautiful little protestant chapel in the middle of the campus he was either walking in or walking out he went in the snow in the rain and in the late summer heat he would fulfill his pledge he had made a bargain with god a business deal as it were you do your part and ill do mine it was no longer a onesided relationship now life had taught the serious young midshipman from indiana that it was necessary to offer this god something in order to guarantee his compliance with the deal for two years vernon went regularly to the chapel twice a week at least he did not really worship there he corresponded with a worldly god one that read the new york times and the wall street journal they discussed things vernon reminded him that he was steadfastly upholding his end of the deal and thanked him for keeping his part of the bargain but never once did they talk about joanna carr she didnt matter the whole affair was between midshipman vernon winters and god praise him above ye heavenly host the commander had unconsciously bowed his head almost to the floor by the time he heard the third phrase of the hymn in his heart he knew the next stops on this spiritual journey he was off the coast of libya first praying those horrible words requesting death and destruction for gaddafis family god had changed as lieutenant winters had matured he was now an executive a president of something larger than a nation an admiral a judge somewhat remote but still accessible in time of real need however he had lost his allforgiving nature he had become stern and judgmental killing a small arab girl wasnt like burning down the vacant lot across from the smith mansion winters god now held him personally accountable for all his actions and there were some sins almost beyond forgiveness some deeds so heinous that one might wait for weeks months or even years in the anterooms of his court before he would consent to hear your plea for mercy and expiation again the commander remembered his desperate search for him after that awful evening when he had sat on the couch beside his wife and watched the videotaped newsreels of the libya bombing she had been so proud of him she had taped every segment of cbs news that had covered the north african engagement and then surprised him with a complete showing the day after he returned to norfolk it was only then that the full horror of what he had done had struck winters struggling not to vomit as the camera had shown the gruesome result of those missiles that had been fired from his planes winters had stumbled out into the night air alone and wandered until daybreak he had been looking for him a dozen times in the next three years this rite would repeat itself and he would wander again all night alternately praying and walking hoping for some sign that he had listened to the commanders prayers the stars and moon above him on those nights had been magnificent but they could not grant forgiveness could not give surcease to his troubled soul praise father son and holy ghost and so god became blackness a void for commander winters on those rare occasions afterward when he would pray there was no longer any mental image of god no picture of him at all in his mind there was just blackness darkness emptiness until this moment as he knelt there outside the cylinder heard the final phrase of the doxology and prayed to god to forgive him his doubts his longings for tiffani thomas and his general lack of direction there was an explosion of light in winters minds eye god was speaking to him god had at last given him a sign it was not the sign that winters had been seeking not evidence that he had finally forgiven the commander and accepted his penance but something much much better the explosion of light in winters mind was a star a solar furnace forging helium out of hydrogen as his mental camera backed away rapidly winters could see planets around that star and signs of intelligence on a few of the planets there were other stars and other planets in the distance billions of stars in this galaxy alone and after the mammoth voids between the galaxies more huge collections of stars and planets and living creatures stretching incomprehensible distances in all directions winters body shook with joy and his eyes flooded with tears when he realized how completely god had answered his prayers it would not have been enough for him to simply reveal to winters that he was forgiven no this lord of everything imaginable whose domain embraced chemicals risen to consciousness on millions of worlds in a vast and uncountable universe this god who was truly omnipotent and ubiquitous had gone way beyond his prayers he had shown winters the unity in everything he had not limited himself just to the affairs of one individual on a small and insignificant blue planet orbiting an ordinary yellow sun in one of the spiral arms of the milky way galaxy he had also shown winters how that species and its pool of intelligence and spirituality was connected to every part of every atom in his grand dominion as nick walked across the room toward commander winters the intermittent noises behind the walls increased in amplitude and frequency around on the far side of the cylinder next to one of the larger support machines a door opened and two carpets moving inchworm style came into the room they were immediately followed by two wardens and four platforms on treads the platforms were carrying stacks of building materials each of the wardens led two platforms to a corner of the room where they started constructing secure anchor stanchions for the cylinder the two carpets confronted nick in the center of the room they stood up on end and leaned in the direction of the exit toward the ocean theyre telling us its time to go carol said as she and troy came up beside nick i understand that nick replied but im not yet ready to leave he turned to troy does this game have an x key at all he asked i could use a time out troy laughed i dont think so professor and theres no way we can save the game and try again nick looked as if he were in deep thought the carpets continued to beckon come on nick carol grabbed him by the arm lets go before they get angry suddenly nick advanced toward one of the carpets and extended the golden cradle here he said take this and put it with the rest of them up there in the cylinder where it belongs the carpet recoiled and twisted its top from side to side then it pulled its two vertical sides together and pointed at nick i dont need a bracelet to interpret that gesture troy remarked the carpet is plainly telling you to take the trident back to your boat nick nodded his head and was quiet for a moment is this the only one he asked troy troy didnt understand the question is this the only seed package for earth i think so troy answered after a moments hesitation he looked at nick with a puzzled expression meanwhile the activity level in the room had increased substantially as commander winters ambled toward the trio in the middle of the hubbub the wardens and platforms were actively building in the corners moving equipment could be heard behind the walls and the organ music was growing louder and slightly ominous in addition a giant sock or cover of some kind lined with a soft pliant material had unfurled above them in the ceiling and was descending slowly over the cylinder commander winters stared around the room with undisguised astonishment still serenely content in his heart from the beauty and intensity of his epiphany he was not paying much attention to the conversation beside him they must take this thing with them nick was saying earnestly to carol and troy dont you see its even more important now that i know there are human seedlings inside our children wont have a chance but they were so beautiful so smart carol said you didnt see them like we did i cant believe those children would ever hurt anybody or anything they wouldnt mean to destroy us nick argued it would just happen the carpets were starting to jump up and down i know i know nick said as he again extended the cradle toward them you want us to go but first please listen to me weve helped you now im asking that you help us im afraid of what might be in this package afraid that it might upset the delicate stability of our planet our progress as a species has been slow in fits and starts with almost as many backward steps as forward whatever is here could threaten our future development or maybe even halt it altogether the activity in the room continued unabated there was no noticeable reaction to nicks speech from the impatient carpets who were now taking turns walking over to the exit in case the dumb humans still did not understand their message nick looked entreatingly at carol she returned his gaze and smiled after a few seconds she came over and took his hand their eyes met for a brief moment as she started talking and nick saw a new expression something approaching admiration in her glance hes right you know carol said in the direction of the pair of carpets you havent thought carefully enough about the outcome of this mission of yours sooner or later your special embryos and the humans already on this planet will interact and there will be a catastrophe if the seed package is found early in the development of your superhumans i am certain the earthlings will feel compelled to destroy it what possible other reaction could they have the magnitude of the threat may not be fully known but it is easy to recognize that creatures genetically engineered by superaliens could pose a gigantic problem for the native species of this planet troy was standing just behind nick and carol listening attentively to what she was saying around him the preparations for launch continued the wardens and platforms had finished constructing and installing the two pairs of stanchions that would be connected to the cylinder during launch to minimize vibrations the golden cradles in the cylinder could no longer be seen the cover had descended almost to the floor so unless you take this golden package back with you perhaps to place it on another world which does not yet have intelligence there will be unnecessary death either your seedlings will perish before maturity or the native humans like us will eventually be swallowed up if not killed outright by the more capable beings you have engineered that hardly seems to be a fair reward for our effort on your behalf carol stopped to watch four strange cords extend themselves from the top and near the bottom of the cylinder wriggle through the air and end up attached to the stanchions in the corners of the room the carpets were becoming increasingly agitated the two wardens finished supervising their prelaunch procedures they turned abruptly toward the four human beings and moved in their direction carol tightened her hold on nicks hand perhaps its true that our natural development is a slow and not altogether satisfactory process she continued fear creeping into her voice as the dreaded wardens quickly approached them and its certainly true that we humans here make mistakes both as individuals and as groups however you cant overlook the fact that this imperfect process produced us and we had enough foresight or compassion or whatever you want to call it hold it shouted troy he seized the cradle from nicks hand and jumped directly into the path of one of the menacing wardens he was only inches away from two whirling threatening rods with cutting implements on the end hold it he shouted again miraculously all activity ceased the carpets and wardens stood still the noises in the wall stopped even the organ music was silenced of all of us troy said in a loud voice his head tilted back and aimed at the ceiling i have the most knowledge of what your mission is all about and the most to lose by recommending that you abandon this part of it but i agree with my friends troy removed his bracelet and then dramatically jammed both the bracelet and the cradle inside the warden he felt as if he were plunging his hand into a bowl of hot bread dough he released both objects and withdrew his hand the warden didnt move the bracelet and the cradle remained where troy left them inside the wardens body from the very beginning i realized that the bracelet you gave me enabled me to have special powers talents that were not naturally mine i understood without knowing the specifics that there would be a substantial and continuing reward for my helping you and i thought that finally finally troy jefferson would be somebody special in this world troy walked past the amazed commander winters who was following the proceedings with a peaceful detachment and came up beside nick and carol it was absolutely quiet in the room when my brother jamie was killed he began again softly i swore that i would do whatever was necessary to leave my imprint on society during those two years that i wandered all over the country i spent most of my time daydreaming my dreams all had the same conclusion i would discover something new and earthshaking and become both rich and famous overnight troy gave carol a quick kiss and winked i love you angel he said and you too professor troy then turned around and faced the covered cylinder when i left here on thursday afternoon i was so excited i couldnt contain myself i kept saymg shit jefferson here it is you are going to be the most important man in the history of the fucking world troy paused but i have learned something very important these last three days he said something that most of us probably never consider it is that the process is more important than the end result it is what you learn while youre dreaming or scheming or working toward a goal that is essential and valuable not the achievement of the goal itself and thats why you guys must now do what my friends have asked i know that you ets have tried to explain to me in these last several minutes through the bracelet that you offered me for life that the new humans you are depositing here will lead us primitive beings into a bold and wonderful era that may be true and i agree that we could use some help that our species is full of prejudice and selfishness and all kinds of other problems but you cannot simply give us the answers without the benefit of the struggle to improve ourselves without the process of overcoming our own weaknesses there will be no fundamental change in us old humans we will not become better we will become secondclass citizens acolytes in a future of your vision and design so take your perfect humans away and let us make it on our own we deserve the chance there was no movement in the room for several seconds after troy finished then the warden in front of him jerked sideways and began to move troy braced for an attack but the warden moved in the direction of the exit next to the cylinder the bracelet and cradle could still be seen inside its body all right team troy shouted happily nick and carol hugged troy took commander winters by the hand as they were leaving the four of them turned around one last time to look at the large chamber in this final view each one of them saw the room in terms of his own amazing experiences the noises had begun again behind the walls and the carpets platforms and wardens were filing out of the room through the door beside the covered cylinder they had only been onboard the boat for three or four minutes when the water underneath them suddenly became very turbulent they were strangely quiet all four of them a frustrated lieutenant ramirez paced about the deck trying to get someone to tell him what had happened under the water even commander winters virtually ignored the lieutenant and just shook his head or gave simple answers to all his questions they were certain that the spaceship was about to launch they didnt realize that it would glide gently away from their area first so that it would not submerge them with a giant wave before breaking the water and heading into the sky the water stayed agitated for several minutes all of them scanned the ocean for a sign of the vehicle look yelled commander winters excitedly pointing at a giant silver bird lifting into the sky about fortyfive degrees away from the early morning sun its rise was initially slow but as it rose it accelerated rapidly nick and carol and troy clasped hands tightly as they watched the awesome spectacle winters came over and stood beside the trio after thirty seconds the craft had disappeared above the clouds there was never any sound fantastic said commander winters
