enid blyton in the fifth at malory towers going back felicity look theres malory towers at last cried darrell i always look out for it at this bend this is where we catch a glimpse of it first felicity gazed at the big squarelooking building of grey stone standing high up on a cliff by the sea at each end was a rounded tower north tower east tower south tower west tower said felicity im glad were in north tower overlooking the sea are you glad to be going back darrell yes awfully are you asked her sister still with her eyes glued to the gracious building in the distance yes i am really but i do hate saying goodbye to mother and daddy and cook and jane and the dogs and the cat and the robin in the garden and the six hens and the ducks and the goldfish and the earwigs on the veranda finished darrell with a laugh dont be such a goose felicity you know quite well that as soon as you set foot in the grounds of malory towers youll love being there oh yes i know i shall said felicity but its quite a different world from the world of home and its a bit difficult suddenly going from one to the other well all i can say is were lucky to have two such marvellous worlds to live in said darrell home and malory towers look whos that in that car felicity leaned out to see its june she said june and alicia her cousin darrell snorted she didnt like the firstformer june dont you go and get friendly with that sly brazen little june again she warned felicity you know what happened last term you stick to susan im going to said felicity you neednt tell me things like that im not a new girl now im in my second term wish i was said darrell i hate to think that every term the day i leave comes nearer well its the same for me said felicity only i dont bother about it yet with so many terms in front of me i say fancy you being a fifthformer this term in the fifth at malory towers gosh it does sound grand and me only a firstformer yes you firstformers do seem babies to me now said darrell absolute kids its funny to think how i looked up to the fifthformers when i was in the first and hardly dared to speak to one and if one spoke to me i almost fell through the ground i dont notice anything like that about you young felicity oh well i suppose its because youre my sister said felicity im not falling through the ground just because you address a few words to me no not even if you are made headgirl of the fifth well i shant be said darrell i had my share of responsibility last term when i was head of the upper fourth anyway id like to sit back and take a bit of a rest from responsibility this term last term was pretty hectic what with being headgirl and having to go in for school certificate too but thank goodness you passed said felicity proudly and with all those credits too did everyone in the upper fourth pass do you know not gwen nor alicia said darrell you remember she got measles during the exam and connie ruths twin didnt pass either shell be left down in the fourth thank goodness now ruth will be able to say a few words on her own connie and ruth had both been in the upper fourth the term before and the girls had often felt cross because connie never gave ruth a chance to speak for herself but always answered for her she looked after ruth as if she were a baby sister not a girl of her own age nearly sixteen now with connie in a form below ruth would have a chance of being herself instead of connies shadow that should be interesting here we are sweeping into the drive said felicity mother do look at malory towers isnt it super her mother turned round from the front seat of the car and smiled at the two enthusiastic faces behind her quite super as you call it she said in fact smashing said mr rivers who was at the wheel isnt that the right word too felicity its the word i seem to have heard you use more than any other these holidays the girls laughed the lower school call everything smashing or smash said darrell in rather a superior voice and the upper school are too ladida for words began felicity eager to retaliate but nobody heard because mr rivers came to a stop near the great flight of steps and immediately they were all swamped in crowds of excited girls running here and there from cars and coaches the train girls had just arrived in the coaches that brought them from the station and there was such a tremendous noise of yelling and shouting and hooting of car horns that it was impossible to hear what anyone said darrell screamed somebody putting an excited face in at the window good i hoped you wouldnt be late sallys here somewhere the face disappeared and another one came felicity i thought it was you come on out susan im just coming shouted felicity and leapt out so suddenly that she fell over a pile of lacrosse sticks and almost knocked over a tall girl standing nearby saying goodbye to her people felicity rivers look where youre going said a wrathful voice and felicity blushed and almost fell through the ground it was irene speaking irene who was now a fifthformer darrell grinned to herself aha felicity might cheek one fifthformer her own sister but she was still in awe of the big girls after all sorry irene said felicity in a meek voice frightfully sorry darrell jumped out too and was immediately surrounded by her friends darrell ill help you in with your things hallo darrell did you have good hols i say you passed your school cert jolly well congratulations darrell rivers you never answered my letter last hols and i wrote you pages darrell grinned round at the laughing faces hallo alicia hallo sally irene you nearly made my people fall out of the car when you screamed in at the window just now hallo belinda done any good sketching in the hols mrs rivers called out from the car darrell we shall be going in a few minutes dear tell sally to come and have a word with me sally was darrells best friend and her mother was a great friend of mrs rivers she came up to the car and mrs rivers looked at her with approval sally had once been such a prim plain little firstformer now she had blossomed out into a pretty bonny girl sturdy and dependable with very nice manners mrs rivers had a few words with her and then looked round for darrell who was still talking away to a crowd of her friends felicity was nowhere to be seen we must go now she said to sally just tell darrell and felicity will you darrell youre wanted shouted sally and darrell turned and ran to the car she was already halflost in the world of malory towers oh mother are you going thanks for most lovely hols wheres felicity felicity was not to be found so thrilled was she at being back and hearing the excited voices of her friends that she had gone off with them without another thought darrell went to look for her anyone seen felicity plenty of people had but nobody knew where she was blow her shes gone up to her dormy i suppose to see what bed shes got this term thought darrell and sped up to find her but she wasnt there darrell went down again and out to the car i cant find her anywhere mother she said can you wait a bit no we cant said mr rivers impatiently ive got to get back tell felicity we waited to say goodbye we must go he gave darrell a hug and then she hugged her mother too mr rivers put in the clutch and the car moved slowly off there was a shriek behind him daddy dont go without saying goodbye felicity appeared from nowhere and leapt on to the runningboard you were going without saying goodbye you were i was said her father with a grin exactly like darrells cant wait about for girls who forget their mother and father a quarter of a minute after arriving i didnt forget you of course i didnt protested felicity still hanging on the runningboard i just wanted to go and see our formroom its all been done up in the hols and looks super goodbye daddy she gave him a bearhug that almost knocked off his hat she ran round to the other side and gave her mother a hug too ill write on sunday give my love to cook and jane and the gardener and the dogs and the car was moving jump off unless you want to come back home again called her father if you do get in at the back but she didnt want to she jumped off laughing she and darrell stood waving as the car made its way slowly down the crowded drive then it moved out of the gate with other cars and was gone felicity turned to darrell with shining eyes isnt it fun to be back again did you feel like that your second term darrell im not nervous or shy any more as i was last term i belong now i know everyone its smashing she tore up the steps at top speed and collided with mamzelle dupont tiens another mad girl felicity i will not have you but felicity was gone mamzelles face broke into a smile as she gazed after her these girls anyone would think they were glad to be back more arrivals the first day of term and the last day were always exciting nobody bothered about rules and regulations everyone talked at the tops of their voices and as for walking down the corridors or up the stairs well it just wasnt done except by the staid sixthformers and the mistresses it was fun to go and see what bed you had in the dormy and whose bed was next to yours it was fun to go and peep into your classroom and see if it looked any different it was fun to say howdoyoudo to all the mistresses and especially to tease mamzelle dupont not mamzelle rougier though the other french mistress she was as sharp as mamzelle dupont was simple and as irritable as the other was goodtempered nobody ever teased mamzelle rougier darrell went to look for the rest of her friends in the fifth form fifth form how grand it sounded she was actually in the fifth now with only one more form to go into oh dear she was certainly getting very grownup alicia and sally came up with irene and belinda lets go and see our new classroom said darrell the fifth my goodness they all went along together the new classroom was an extremely nice one high up and overlooking the cliff down below was the blue cornish sea as blue as cornflowers today the waves tipped with snowy white i say this is a wizard room isnt it said alicia looking round lovely windows and view nice pictures and all done up in cream and green any new girls does anyone know asked darrell leaning out of the window and sniffing the salty sea air theres someone called maureen coming said irene i heard about her the school she was at shut down suddenly when the head died and shes coming here i dont know anything about her though i suppose youre coming into the fifth alicia said sally i mean i know connies been left down in the fourth because she didnt pass her school cert and you didnt either because you had the measles but surely you wont be left down oh no im up all right said alicia gosh i wouldnt have come back if i hadnt been put up with the rest of you miss grayling wrote to mother and said i could pass school cert on my head any time i liked and i could go up into the fifth with you and work for school cert on the side so to speak anyone left down with us from the old fifth form asked darrell yes catherine gray and moira linton said irene promptly there were groans from the others oh i say two of the worst of them said sally i never did like moira hard domineering creature why has she been left down well actually shes a year young for the sixth said irene so they said shed better stay down a year but personally i think she was so unpopular that they just dropped her thankfully and went on without her what about catherine asked sally she hasnt been well said irene worked herself too hard or something shes pretty pious isnt she i dont really know much about her shes one of those girls that dont make much impression from a distance well as far as were concerned thats like three new girls then said darrell catherine moira and maureen wholl be headgirl you or sally said irene promptly no i dont think so said darrell i imagine it will have to be either catherine or moira after all theyve been fifthformers for ages it wouldnt be fair to put an exfourthformer over them at once no youre right said alicia gosh i hope it isnt moira then she does love to get her own way did you hear how she set all the secondformers a long poem to learn last term to go and say at monitors meeting just because one of them wrote a poem about her and nobody would own up to it every single one of them had to learn kublai khan they did howl about it yes i remember now said darrell oh well i dare say we shall manage moira all right if you dont lose your temper with her too often said irene with a sly grin darrells hot temper was well known she had tried to conquer it for terms and terms and just when she prided herself on really having got the better of it at last out it came again darrell looked ruefully at the others yes ill have to be careful i lost it really well last term didnt i alicia with that brazen young cousin of yours june i hope she behaves better this term she came to stay with us in the hols said alicia ive got three brothers you know and when june actually dared to disobey sam he gave her the choice of being spanked twenty times with her own hairbrush or running round our paddock twenty times each day and which did she choose asked everyone oh running round the paddock of course said alicia and mother was awfully surprised to see her going round and round it each day like that she thought she was training for sports or something sam stood and watched her grinning like anything so she may be better this term she can do with a lot of improvement said darrell i say what in the worlds that it was the sound of thunderous hooves out in the drive somewhere so thunderous that the noise even came round to the back of malory towers and was heard in the classroom where the five girls stood listening i know its old bill back and her brothers have brought her as usual all on horseback cried belinda rushing out of the room come along lets go into the artroom and look out of the window we can see the drive from there they were soon leaning out of the high window they saw a sight which they had already seen two or three times before and were never tired of wilhelmina called bill for short had arrived on her horse thunder and accompanying her were six of her seven brothers all on horseback too what a sight they were six wellgrown boys ranging from seventeen down to ten with bill their sister in the midst woa there now then quiet quiet thunder were here bill heres your case clippityclop clippityclop went the hooves of the seven grand horses curvetting about the broad drive hrrrrrrrumph said one of them and then all seven neighed together bill where can we let the horses drink came the deep voice of the seventeenyearold brother follow me said bill and the six brothers trotted up the drive and round a corner following the girl sitting so straight on her magnificent horse thunder gosh said alicia what a horde of brothers wheres the seventh gone into the army said sally my word i wish i had seven brothers well ive got three and thats more than enough said alicia no wonder bills more like a boy than a girl here they come again said irene belinda wheres your sketchbook do draw them all belinda had already got out her sketchbook which was always somewhere about her person her swift pencil sketched in horse after horse and the others watched in admiration oh to have a gift like belindas she could draw anyone and anything the seven horses seemed to know that bill and thunder were to be left behind they lifted their heads and whinnied softly bill leaned over and stroked the noses of those nearest to her goodbye moonlight goodbye starlight goodbye snorter goodbye sultan shes paying a lot more attention to the horses than to her brothers said alicia with a grin thats bill all over of course horsemad well her brothers are as bad said sally look yelling goodbye to thunder but not to bill off they go said darrell envying bill her brothers look at thunder trying to follow them he doesnt want to be left behind bill was left alone in the drive with the impatient thunder who thought he should go with his comrades he reared and curvetted in annoyance at being made to go the other way up the drive instead of down the six horses and brothers disappeared in a clatter of hooves and a cloud of dust bill looking rather solemn made thunder take the path to the stables she hated being parted from the many horses that her family owned but now that she had settled down well at malory towers and was allowed to bring her horse she would not have given up boardingschool for anything another clatter of hooves this time coming up the drive made bill rein in her horse and look round the five up in the artroom yelled to her bill bill here comes clarissa and shes on her horse too sure enough up the drive came a beautiful little horse with white socks tossing his pretty head and showing off clarissa carter rode him she had been a new girl the term before a plain bespectacled little thing with an ugly wire round her front teeth but now she had no wire and no spectacles and she galloped up her auburn hair flying in the wind and her green eyes shining bill bill ive brought merrylegs isnt he sweet oh do let him see thunder theyll love one another two horsemad creatures said alicia with a laugh well bill never had a friend till clarissa came so theyll have a fine time together this term talking about horses and riding them feeding them and grooming them scrubbing their hooves and brushing their tails added irene gosh those galloping hooves have given me an idea for a new tune a galloping tune like this she hummed a galloping lilting melody tirrettytirrettytirrettytoo dear old irene shes not horsemad shes musicmad said belinda putting away her sketchbook now we shall have nothing but galloping tunes for the next few weeks come on tirrettytoo and she galloped her friend out of the room at top speed tirrettytirrettytirrettytoo oh so sorry miss potts we never saw you coming suppertime all but the new girls were well settled in by the evening matron had received health certificates and pocketmoney from the lower school and health certificates but no money from the upper school who were allowed to keep their own without having to ask matron for it did irenes health certificate arrive all right asked darrell remembering how almost every term irenes certificate was mislaid sally laughed oh somebody put an envelope in irenes case marked health certificate and she thought her mother had put it there instead of sending it by post so she took it to matron of course and said here you are matron ive really remembered it at last and what was inside it asked darrell a recipe for bad memories chuckled sally i forget how it went take a cupful of reminders and a spoonful of scoldings something like that you should have seen matrons face when she saw it irene was dumbfounded of course she would be however it didnt matter because matron had got her certificate by post irenes such a scatterbrain for all her cleverness said alicia so is belinda there must be something about art and music that makes people with those gifts perfectly idiotic over ordinary things if irene can lose something she does and if belinda can forget something she forgets it do you remember how she came down to breakfast once without her blouse on theres the gong for supper said darrell thankfully im awfully hungry hope theres as super a supper as usual we always have such a good one on the first night im glad i havent got to fuss round felicity this term shes not a new girl any more she can stand on her own feet they went down into the big diningroom to supper sally absentmindedly walked towards the fourthform table and darrell pulled her back idiot do you want to sit with those kids she hissed heres the fifthform table they took their places and saw three girls already there two old fifthformers and one new girl catherine and moira nodded to them and catherine gave them a beaming smile moira didnt she was tightlipped and looked as if the cares of the whole school rested on her shoulders the new girl maureen smiled at them brightly she was a fluffy rather untidylooking girl with a big mouth a large nose and rather uneven teeth that stuck out a little and made her look rabbity im maureen little she said in a light friendly voice i hope you wont mind having me at malory towers she gave a little giggle why should weasked darrell surprised we heard your old school had closed down that was bad luck yes said maureen and looked pensive it was such a marvellous school too you should have seen the playing fields and we had two swimmingpools and we were allowed to keep our own pets well i expect youll find malory towers isnt too bad said alicia joining in oh yes said the girl smiling again and showing her rabbitteeth im sure its wonderful thats why my mother chose it she said that next to mazeley manor that was my old school you know malory towers was the best dear me that was nice of her said alicia in her smooth voice i dont seem to have heard of mazeley manor or was it the school whose girls always failed in the school cert maureen flushed oh no she said it couldnt have been why quite half of us passed i passed myself very clever of you said alicia and darrell nudged her what a pity for maureen to get on alicias wrong side so soon she was just the type that irritated the sharptongued alicia alicia winked at darrell but darrell frowned it wasnt fair to tease a new girl so soon give her a chance but maureen didnt give herself a chance i must be friendly she said to herself i must keep my own end up i must impress these girls so she chattered away in a light airy voice and didnt seem to realize that new girls should be seen and not heard it was only when the others very pointedly began to talk to one another turning away from her until she found that no one at all was listening to her that she stopped in the first form if any new girl behaved like that the firstformers would have pointed out at once that shed better keep her mouth shut before somebody sat on her but the fifthformers were not quite so crude they merely ignored her hoping she would see that she was behaving stupidly and making a bad start are we all back said darrell looking round the table ah theres mavis hows the voice mavis i hope its quite all right now mavis nodded she had a beautiful voice which she had lost for a few terms but which was now back in all its beauty she looked happy and theres marylou and daphne and ruth hallo ruth hows your twin all right you know shes been left down in fourth form said ruth itll be queer without her ive always had her no matter what school or form ive been in i hope she wont miss me too much oh shell soon find someone else to look after and speak up for just as she used to do to you said alicia you were her little shadow ruth now this term well be able to see what youre really like yourself we didnt know before oh put in maureen is ruth a twin there were twins at my old school and they were so well it simply wasnt done for a new girl to speak out of turn like this and to maureens surprise everyone at the table began talking at once so that nobody could possibly hear what she said mamzelle dupont who was at the head of the table was sorry for her she liked the fluffy type of girl and she spoke comfortingly to maureen they are excited you see at being back again you will soon be their friends nest ce pas tomorrow they will what do you call it they will take you to their chests and you will be one of them what a pity dear gwendoline isnt back yet now you would like her maureen she has golden hair like you and alicia caught part of this and winked at sally i bet gwendoline would be just the person for maureen she said she raised her voice and spoke to mamzelle whats happened to dear gwendoline mary mamzelle shes the only one not back she only came back from france today said mamzelle she comes to us tomorrow the dear child she will be able to talk to me about my beloved country we shall gobble together about it gabble mamzelle you mean said sally with a giggle oh ive been to france too said maureen delighted then you and gwendoline and mamzelle can all gobble about it together said irene nice trio youll make gobbling away about la belle france dont be an ass irene said moiras voice remember youre in the fifth form now not the fourth oh thanks most awfully for reminding us moira said alicia in her smoothest voice i say it must be frightful for you to have to live with us awful comedown to pig it with old fourthformers instead of queening it in the sixth moira and i dont mind a bit said catherine with such an air of pouring oil on troubled waters that the old fourthformers couldnt help nudging one another after all somebody has to be left down sometimes and its always a help dont you think when an old member of the form can help new ones to carry on the tradition ah зa cest bien dit said mamzelle very well said catherine but nobody else thought so hypocrite muttered alicia to irene who wants catherine to help us she couldnt teach a cat to drink milk gosh if shes going to be as pie as that i shall resign from the fifth and go up into the sixth irene did one of her explosive snorts and catherine looked astonished do tell us the joke she said with a beaming smile joke over said alicia also with a beaming smile darrell winked at sally it was easy to see that there was going to be some fun that term she glanced at moira who was frowning glumly want to collect a few more scowls for your notebook belinda said darrell softly belinda glanced at moira too and nodded she had pursued gwendoline once for a whole term collecting her scowls drawing them one after another in what the girls came to call her gwendoline collection now here was another person with a wonderful selection of scowls for belinda bill and clarissa were happily talking horses together unheedful of anyone else at the table i wonder they dont whinny to one another said alicia exasperated bill clarissa do you think youre in the stables still oh sorry said clarissa looking round with shining green eyes i forgot where i was for a minute but its so nice to be back with bill again and talk horses ah this horsetalk i do not understand it chimed in mamzelle me i would not go near a horse great stamping creatures you really must come and let thunder take a lump of sugar from the palm of your hand one day said bill with an impish grin will you mamzelle mamzelle gave a small squeal always you say that to me bill it is not kind i will not let your great horse tread on my foot with its paws hooves mamzelle hooves said bill quite shocked at mamzelle calling them paws shaking its hair all over me went on mamzelle conjuring up a fearsome picture of a stamping headshaking rearing creature shaking its mane corrected bill oh mamzelle youre awful about horses i shall drag you out to thunder and give you a lesson on all his different parts this horrible bill said mamzelle turning her eyes up to the ceiling why must i teach her french when all she wants to learn about is horses why do you laugh girls i would not make a joke about so serious a thing oh its good to be back again isnt it said darrell to sally i never laugh anywhere like i do at school never night and morning darrell found time that first evening to make sure that her young sister felicity was not being whisked off by june alicias thirteenyearold cousin in the first form to her relief she saw that felicity was arminarm with susan her friend of the term before june was standing alone on the edge of the little crowd of firstformers she had a most determined look on her face and darrell wondered what she was thinking of she is certainly planning something thought darrell well so long as she leaves felicity out of her plans she can do what she likes how i do dislike that child the fifthformers went to bed a quarter of an hour after the fourthformers it was grand having just fifteen minutes more they chattered as they undressed and speculated on all sorts of things in the coming term i shall miss having miss williams to teach us said sally who had liked the fourthform mistress very much i wonder if the dormitory door opened and a face looked in it was connie ruths twin ruth are you all right she said its queer not being with you are you managing all right did you find your connie exploded alicia what do you mean by coming into the fifth dormy when youre jolly well supposed to be in bed clear out connie stood in the doorway obstinately she was a great one for arguing i only just came to see if ruth was all right she said weve never been parted before and clear out yelled everyone and irene brandished her hairbrush fiercely almost knocking belindas eye out but still connie held her ground her eyes searched ruths face which was also wearing an obstinate look ruth began connie urgently do say something dont stand there like that i only just came to clear out said ruth and everyone stood silent in astonishment nobody had expected that ruth had been such a shadow that even when she had begun to assert herself a little the term before no one had ever thought she could possibly order connie about i know youre my twin and weve always been together said ruth in an unnecessarily loud voice but im in the fifth now and youre in the fourth you cant come tagging after a fifthformer you know that leave me alone and clear out only ruth could defeat connie and make her go connie gaped then turned and went without a word ruth sat down suddenly on her bed good for you said darrell warmly youll have to stand up for yourself a bit ruth or youll have connie pestering you again and again i know said ruth in a small voice but im im awfully fond of her you know i hated saying that but she would never take any notice of anyone else and after all i cant let her hang on to the fifth can i poor connie not poor at all said darrell and dont you believe it shes got the cheek of a dozen she wont give up easily either shell keep on trying to tag on to you and to us quite right said alicia in a voice not loud enough for ruth to hear connies so thickskinned she wants a whole lot of pummelling and shouting at before she feels or understands what were getting at ive got a sister like that in the fourth said moira unexpectedly joining in a tough nut if ever there was one shes like a rubber ball if you sit on her and squash her flat she bounces back to shape again immediately awful kid whats her name said darrell oh wait a bit is it bridget yes said moira she and connie would make a pair well lets hope connie and she will get together said alicia nice pair theyd make rub each others corners off a bit soon they were all in bed darrell was next to maureen she said good night to the new girl and to sally who was on the other side of her and shut her eyes her bed was harder than at home but she knew she would soon get used to that she threw off her eiderdown after a bit it was such a warm night she heard a sniff from the next bed gosh it cant be maureen sniffing like any new firstformer thought darrell in surprise she turned over and listened sniff sniff yes there it was again maureen what on earths the matter whispered darrell surely youre not a firstnight sniffer at your age maureens voice came shakily to darrell im always like this at first i think of mother and daddy and what theyre doing at home im sensitive you know better get over being sensitive then said darrell shortly in her experience people who went round saying that they were sensitive wanted a good shaking up and if they were lower school needed to be laughed out of it but you cant help being it if you are sniffed maureen oh i know but you can help talking about it said darrell do go to sleep i cant bear to hear you sniffing as if you wanted a hanky and havent got one maureen felt that darrell was very unkind she wished there was someone in the bed the other side of her someone more sympathetic but the bed was empty it was gwendolines and she hadnt yet come back darrell grinned to herself in the darkness if only they could wish maureen on to gwen maureen was very like gwen to look at and had the same silly weak nature apparently how marvellous if they could push her on to gwen and see what happened you wait till gwendoline mary comes back tomorrow said darrell wickedly to maureen shes just your sort shes sensitive too im sure shell understand all you feel she hates first nights still you look out for her tomorrow maureen shes just your sort i should think sally who was in the next bed listening gave a little snort of laughter how mad gwen would be to have someone else like her in the form someone who thought themselves too wonderful for words and who wanted admiration and sympathy all the time how wicked of darrell to be pushing maureen on to gwen already but how altogether suitable no more talking said moiras voice out of the darkness times up now the old fourthformers resented this sudden command moira wasnt headgirl not yet anyway nothing official had been said about it nobody said any more but there were various poohs and pishes from several beds still they were all tired and nobody except maureen really wanted to keep awake there were a few more sniffs from maureens bed and then silence irene began to snore a little she always did when she lay on her back belinda who was in the next bed leaned over and gave her a hard poke to make her turn over irene obediently shifted on to her side without even waking up belinda had got her welltrained by now connie actually appeared at the door again in the morning looking belligerent and obstinate you still there said alicia been standing there all night long i suppose wondering if ruth was having a nice beauty sleep or not theres no rule against my coming here in the morning to ask a question is there said connie dont be so beastly alicia ive only come to give ruth a pair of stockings that got into my case thanks said ruth and took them connie straightened one or two things on ruths dressingtable ruth immediately put them crooked again its no good connie she said leave me alone im in the fifth now i tell you i never thought youd crow over me if i was left behind said connie looking suddenly bewildered im not do go away said ruth in a low voice knowing that everyone in the room was intensely interested in this little battle although most of the girls were pretending not to notice darrell had managed to stop alicia from interfering let ruth manage the fight herself moira suddenly spoke will you take this book to my sister bridget she said in her abrupt voice she held out a small book shes in the fourth too came up from the third this term i expect youve spoken to her already yes i have said connie ill give her the book she took it and went out of the room without another look at ruth darrell glanced at ruth she was looking rather miserable what a shame it was that connie should force her into such a difficult position how could anyone be as thickskinned as that twin the breakfastbell went maureen gave a wail oh i say is that the bell again i was thinking i was still at mazeley manor the bell didnt go till much later i shall be late were going to hear rather a lot about mazeley manor im afraid said darrell in sallys ear as they went downstairs perhaps gwen will hear it all instead said sally thats your plan isnt it the thing is will gwen be in the fifth she failed the school cert too you know she may be kept down in the fourth with connie oh no surely not said darrell shes too old shes above the average age even of the fifth by a few months after all connies well below it so it doesnt much matter for her they asked mamzelle at breakfasttime about gwen will she be in the fifth with us said darrell yes yes said mamzelle of course it is true she failed the poor child in this terrible examination of yours but she was ill yes she had a bad heart poor gwendoline the fifthformers nudged one another gwens bad heart gwen had produced a heart that fluttered and palpitated in order to get out of doing the exam but nobody had believed in it except mamzelle and gwen had had to do the exam after all and had failed well heart or no heart apparently shes in the fifth with us said alicia dear gwendoline mary what a treat to have her back with us today miss james has good news the fifth went to their classroom just before nine oclock they rejoiced in the glorious view darrell flung the windows wide and let in the golden september air heavenly she said i hope we shall be allowed to bathe still i bet the pool down in the rocks is just perfect now maureen looked alarmed surely youre not allowed to bathe in the winter term she said why at mazeley manor we it must have been a wonderful place said alicia in her smooth voice oh yes we used to went on maureen so sad it had to shut down interrupted irene yes very sad agreed maureen delighted at this sudden interest and sympathy you see all of us were very you must find malory towers very secondrate after such a marvellous place put in belinda also sounding very sympathetic still well do our best sally assured her maureen began to feel doubtful about all these interruptions kind as they seemed perhaps she had better say no more till she had found her feet a little these girls seemed so different from the ones at dear mazeley manor whats our new formmistress miss james like said darrell to catherine and moira youve been taught by her for some terms is she all right easygoing to a point said moira then look out she changes from sweet to sour in the twinkling of an eye and its bad for you if you dont notice the changeover immediately still jimmys not a bad sort shes james when shes sour and jimmy when shes sweet explained catherine with her beaming smile actually shes rather a dear oh catherine thinks heaps of people are ratherdears and dearoldsouls and even petlambs said moira she never speaks evil of anyone do you catherine and if ever you want anything done catherine will do it for you she just loves to run around for other people catherine blushed dont be silly moira she said but a look of anxiety came into her eyes was moira pulling her leg sneering at her just a little the others didnt wonder about it they knew moira was not praising catherine she was sneering moira would probably never praise anyone wholeheartedly the girls had chosen their desks the favoured ones at the back of the room went to the two old fifthformers of course moira and catherine and to darrell and sally who had each been headgirl for a time the term before irene and belinda also had back desks there were other girls in the room now girls also in the fifth but from other towers tessa and janet and penelope katie and dora and gladys girls the north tower fifthformers knew by name and sight but not nearly as well as they knew their own tower girls of course the girls of all the towers mixed for lessons and games but were quite separate afterwards each going to their own tower for meals leisure and sleeping sssssst said someone jimmys coming and in came jimmy or miss james a tall spare woman of about fifty whose curly grey hair framed a scholarly face with kind but shrewd hazel eyes sit she said and the class sat shuffling their feet moving their chairs a little and shifting books and papers miss james waited until there was complete silence well once more i have a new class she began her shrewd eyes resting first on one girl and then on another only three of you i think were in my form last term and they for various good reasons have not gone up into the sixth but are still with me they will of course be a great help in getting the form into my ways the girls looked to see who the third old fifthformer was oh it was little janet well she was miles too young to go up into the sixth of course she had only been put into the fifth a year ago because she had passed her school certificate so absurdly early she still looked like a fourthformer thought darrell not even like a fifthformer janet looked pleased to be left down she was scared of the sixth form moira scowled she hated being left behind catherine beamed yes yes she would help all she could miss james could depend on her of course she could she tried to catch the mistresss eye but for some reason miss james steadfastly looked in the other direction catherine kept her beaming smile on for some time hopefully gazing at miss james but the mistress left the subject and began on something else catherine had to switch off the smile her cheek muscles were beginning to ache darrell is to be head of fifthform games said miss james sally is to help her you realize darrell dont you that head of fifthform games means taking on the training of some of the younger players for the lower teams of the school that will take up some time but you will have sally to help you darrell glowed how lovely to be able to pick out some of the young first and secondformers and lick them into shape for the third and fourth games teams of malory towers suppose she and sally made the teams so good that they won all their matches home and away what a record that would be darrell went off into a daydream in which she saw some wellturned out smart lowerschool teams winning match after match ill train felicity of course she thought shes quite good already i can make her first class and susans good as well and ill lick that young june into shape too my word shell have to toe the line now i shant stand any nonsense from her and theres harriet in the second form and lucy in the second too she missed the next few things that miss james said she was so lost in her dream of firstclass lacrosse teams you all worked very hard last term said miss james practically all of you in this form passed and passed well in the school cert exam those who didnt failed because of some understandable reason and will have another chance later on they will be specially coached for it and will have to leave the usual lessons of this class for a time until the exam is over alicia sighed it wouldnt be this term of course but she hated the idea of having to leave the others and have special coaching blow why did she have to have measles right in exam week last term now as you all had a hard term last term i dont intend to work you hard this term said miss james and a sigh of relief went all round the room like a small breeze i mean i shall not set you lengthy preps to do nor push you hard but there will be other things to take up your time i want the fifth to produce the christmas entertainment this year for instance that made everyone sit up produce the christmas entertainment my word that would be fun what about a play or a pantomime or a ballet all kinds of thoughts ran through the girls minds and they glanced at one another in delight you will do it all on your own except for any advice you may need from mr young the musicmaster or miss greening the elocution coach went on miss james pleased at the pleasure shown by the girls ah when they got up into the fifth how they liked to do things on their own with no interference from anyone quite right too if they didnt learn to handle affairs and stand on their own feet now they never would you will choose your own producers said miss james i should have at least two for the work will be too much for one the more you do on your own the better i and miss grayling the head will be pleased but we shall of course be glad to give you any advice or help if you need to ask for it every girl in the class at once fiercely determined not to ask one single piece of advice the christmas show whatever it was should be theirs and nobody elses it shall be the best one ever done at malory towers vowed darrell well get the parents to come and what a surprise theyll have thought sally what a chance thought alicia and her agile mind began to run over all kinds of ideas at once she longed for the first meeting if only they would make her one of the producers she could organize well she could plan and she could be more resourceful than anyone she knew she could they all longed for break so that they could discuss the ideas put into their heads by miss james irene was in the seventh heaven of delight if they did a pantomime would they let her write the music the music for a whole pantomime why that would give her more scope than she had ever had before mavis was also dreaming delightfully would she be able to do some of the singing if they did a play or a pantomime she was allowed to practise her singing properly this term and had a special singingmaster of her own who came to the school to teach her oh if only she could sing the principal songs break came at last the fifthformers rushed off in a crowd gathering in a corner of the grounds all talking at once well have to have a proper meeting said darrell oh gosh i do feel thrilled to be told we can do the christmas entertainment all on our own and to be told im games captain and responsible for the picking and training of the lowerschool kids for their teams why i shant have time for any work at all well weve learnt how to work by now said sally if we havent we never will weve got other things to learn now i suppose how to plan things on our own and carry them out and how to work together in them properly things like that oh do you suppose jimmys planned all this just to make us learn a whole lot of other things then said daphne quite likely said alicia but what does it matter if were learning something by producing a pantomime well lets learn it by all means im all for it we have to choose a committee said moira taking charge sally darrell and alicia felt a momentary annoyance they had been so used to leading everything in the fourth form that they found it difficult to recognize moiras authority still she was headgirl she had the right to take charge and she was perfectly capable of it there was no doubt about that at all the girls could all feel the impact of a hard and dominating personality in moira much the same as they felt in alicia who was also hard and strong in character but alicia had a sense of humour which was quite lacking in moira that made all the difference in the world alicia could say something biting and yet it would produce a laugh because of the way she said it she was gay and lively too which moira was not well it took all sorts to make a world and there was a place for the moiras and gwens and maureens thought darrell and for the sallies and irenes and belindas as well only theyre so much nicer to know darrell said to herself wed better choose a committee of seven or eight went on moira and well choose it in the usual way each of us writes the names of the girls theyd like to have on the committee and well put them all into a box then we take them out open them count them and see whos got the most votes well do that tonight oh i hope im on the committee thought darrell and alicia hoped the same alicia badly wanted to have a finger in this pie she felt perfectly sure she could run the whole show if only she was allowed to half an hour in the sun whens dear gwendoline mary coming back asked alicia as they all lay out in the sun after their dinner at a quarter to two that day it was so warm and sunny that it was like summer all the girls had found warm places out of doors and the grounds were full of little companies of girls happily sunning themselves gwen oh shes arriving at teatime said darrell dear gwendoline mary would you think shes what catherine would call a petlamb i could think of much more suitable names than that said belinda busy drawing mavis who had gone to sleep with her mouth open is gwendoline nice asked maureen she sounds nice to me darrell winked at alicia nice oh youll love her she said so sympathetic and ready to listen so interesting to talk to and the tales she tells about her family and her dogs and her cats well you could listen for hours maureen is she fond of sports asked maureen who quite definitely wasnt at mazeley towers we didnt do games unless we wanted to i mean they werent compulsory as they are here such a mistake i think oh gwen hates games said alicia but because shes fat she has to do them as much as possible and walk miles too poor gwendoline said maureen sympathizing deeply with the absent fifthformer we shall have a lot in common i can see has she has she a special friend do you know of course thats a silly question i know a girl like thats bound to have a special friend but i just thought you know im rather one on my own it would be so nice to find someone here who wasnt already fixed up with a companion for walks and talks let me see said alicia blinking up at the sky has gwendoline mary a friend everyone appeared to think very deeply well perhaps not a special friend said irene with a small snort of laughter let us say shes a littlefriendofalltheworld shall we ah youve just hit the nail on the head said darrell trying not to giggle i think shed like maureen dont you shell love her said belinda with the utmost conviction wake up mavis and see how beautiful you look when youre asleep beast said mavis taking a look at belindas comical sketch of her lying asleep with her mouth open maureen took a look as well thats quite a clever drawing she said i can draw too i was one of the best at mazeley manor i must show you my sketches sometime belinda theyre very much the same style as yours belinda was about to say something short and rude when irene frowned at her and then spoke in a sicklysweet tone to the unsuspecting maureen i suppose you can sing too cant you and can you compose oh i can sing said maureen pleased with all this attention yes i had special lessons at mazeley manor the singingmaster said i had a most unusual voice and ive composed quite a few songs dear dear you mustnt make me talk about myself like this she gave her silly little laugh everyone else wanted to laugh too how could anyone be so idiotic were there many girls at your last school asked sally wondering how in the world any school could turn out somebody like maureen oh no it was a very very select school said maureen they picked and chose their girls very very carefully youll have to tell gwen all these things said alicia earnestly wont she girls gwen will be so interested and dont you think it would be nice for dear gwendoline to have someone like maureen for a friend i mean i feel shes made of er finer stuff than we are and im sure gwendoline mary would appreciate that maureen could hardly believe that all these wonderful remarks applied to her she gazed round halfsuspiciously but the girls all looked at her with straight faces irene had to look away she felt certain one of her terrific snorts was coming gwens always lonely when she comes back went on alicia thens the time to talk to her maureen well tell her about you and you can make friends thank you very much said maureen basking in what she thought was universal appreciation of herself i really hardly think the girls at mazeley manor could be nicer than you irene snorted loudly and somehow turned it into a cough and a sneeze maureen looked a little suspicious again but at that moment mamzelle dupont descended on them smiling she sat down on the grass first looking for ants earwigs and beetles she was terrified of them she beamed round amicably the girls smiled back they liked the plump hottempered humorous french mistress she was not like mamzelle rougier badtempered all the time if she got into a temper she blew up certainly but it didnt last long ah you are all basketing in the sun she said much to the surprise of everyone oh you mean basking dont you mamzelle said darrell with a squeal of laughter yes yes this lovely sun said mamzelle and she wriggled her plump shoulders in enjoyment in a moment or two however she would feel afraid of getting a freckle and would retire into the shade and you ma petite maureen you are settling down here nicely are you not asked mamzelle kindly seeing maureen next to her of course you will be missing your old school what name is it now ah yes your measley manor is it not a shout of laughter deafened her oh mamzelle youre priceless almost wept belinda you always hit the nail on the head the nail what nail asked mamzelle looking all round as if she expected to see a nail suspended in the air somewhere i have hit nothing do not tease me now it is too hot she turned to maureen again they interrupt their kind old mamzelle she said smiling down at the fluffyhaired maureen i was asking you about your lovely measley manor this time it was too much maureens look of offended disgust with mamzelle and with the laughing girls made them roll on the grass in an agony of mirth mamzelle was astonished what had she said that was so funny all i ask is about this lovely she began again in bewilderment nobody stopped laughing maureen got up and walked off in a huff how hateful to laugh at such a horrid name for her old school and did mamzelle really mean to call it that was she poking fun at her too maureen seriously began to doubt if all the nice things said to her were meant oh dear said darrell sitting up and wiping the tears from her eyes youre a pet mamzelle girls in future we refer to measley manor as soon as maureen trots out her horrible soppy school again well soon cure her of that i wish gwen would hurry up and come said sally im longing to see those two together maureens so like gwen in her ways itll be like gwen looking into a mirror and seeing herself when she knows maureen now now play no treeks on maureen said mamzelle she meant tricks of course poof it is hot i shall grow a freckle on my nose i feel it i must sit in the shade poof were going to have a nice term mamzelle said darrell games plenty of them and we fifthformers are doing the christmas entertainment we shant have much time for french im afraid mйchante fille said mamzelle at once fanning violently and making herself much hotter bad girl darrell you will have plenty of time for french and no treeks no treeks this term there will be no time for treeks why dont you play a treek mamzelle asked alicia lazily we give you full permission to work as hard as you like at playing a treek on us oh yes as many tricks as you like said sally joyfully but well see through them all said mavis ah if i played you a treek it would be superbe said mamzelle pronouncing it the french way superbe magnifique merveilleuse such a treek you would never have seen before we dare you to mamzelle said alicia at once me i am not daring said mamzelle i think of a treek perhaps yes but i could not do it helas i have not your dare the bell rang for afternoon school everyone got up alicia hauled mamzelle to her feet so strongly that she almost fell over again you have too much dare she told alicia crossly always you have too much dare alicia gwendoline arrives gwendoline came back just before tea by car the news flew round dear gwendoline marys back come and see the fond farewells gwens farewells were a standing joke at malory towers there were always tears and fond embracings and injunctions to write soon that went on for ages between her and her mother and her old governess miss winter who lived with them faces lined the windows overlooking the drive gwendoline got out of the car her mother and miss winter got out too her father who was driving made no move he had got very tired of gwendoline in the holidays out come the hankies said alicia and out came gwens and her mothers and miss winters and dear me out came the hankies of all the wicked watchers at the windows above now we pat our eyes went on alicia and sure enough the eyepatting went on down below and above too as everyone sniffed and wiped their eyes irene of course gave the show away with one of her explosions the four below looked up in surprise and saw the watching girls all with hankies to their eyes mr lacy roared he held on to the wheel and laughed loudly theyre putting up as good a show for you gwen as youre putting up for them he cried the girls at the window disappeared as soon as they saw that they had been seen they felt a little uncomfortable mrs lacy might complain of their bad manners now it would be just like her mother get back into the car said gwendoline exasperated she hadnt known she was being watched at all she did so love these little farewell scenes and now this one was spoilt her mother and miss winter were almost hustled back without another tear or hug i dont like that behaviour gwendoline said mrs lacy offended at the conduct of the girls ive a good mind to write to miss grayling oh no mother said gwendoline in alarm she never liked being brought to miss graylings notice at all miss grayling had said some very horrid things to her at times its all right gwen i shant let her said her father dryly for goodness sake say goodbye now and go in and mind if i hear any nonsense about you this term youll have me to reckon with not your mother you were bad and foolish last term and you suffered for it you will suffer for it again if i hear bad reports of you on the other hand no one will be more pleased than i shall to have a good report of you and ive no doubt i shall yes daddy said gwendoline meekly how unkind you are just as were leaving gwen said mrs lacy dabbing her eyes again goodbye darling i shall miss you so gwendoline took a desperate look up at the windows gracious was mother going to begin all over again goodbye she said curtly and shut the car door immediately her father put in the clutch and the car moved off without even turning to wave gwen marched up the steps with her lacrosse stick and nightcase her trunk had been sent on in advance maureen had not seen the fond farewells she did not see gwen till teatime gwen took her case up to the dormy and was thankful to find it empty she looked at herself in the glass she wasnt fat any more well not very she decided all those hateful walks had taken away her weight and now she had to face a term with heaps of games and walks but thank goodness no swimming the teabell went gwen quickly brushed her fluffy golden hair so like maureens washed her hands pulled her tie straight and went downstairs she walked into the diningroom with the last few girls she caught sight of her form at the fifthform table they waved to her hallo heres dear gwendoline mary again had good hols you went to france didnt you lucky thing youre a day late youve missed a lot already said goodbye to your people gwendoline felt pleased to be back of course it was nice to be at home with her mother and miss winter and be waited on hand and foot and be fussed over but it was fun at school she made up her mind to be sensible and join in everything this term so she smiled round very amiably hallo everyone its nice to be back youll have to tell me all the news i only got back from france yesterday ah la belle france put in mamzelle we must have some chesttochest talks about la belle france gwen looked surprised oh you mean hearttoheart talks mamzelle yes that would be lovely gwendoline theres a new girl said alicia in a suspiciously smooth voice let me introduce her youll like her this is maureen and this is gwendoline mary a bit alike to look at arent they mamzelle cest vrai agreed mamzelle yes it is true both so golden and with big blue eyes ah yes it is a true english beauty that this gratified both gwen and maureen immensely and made them look with great interest at each other they shook hands and smiled ive kept a place for you said maureen shyly making her eyes big as she looked at gwen gwen sat down and looked to see what there was for tea she was hungry after her long carride have some of my honey said maureen eagerly we keep bees you know and we always have such a lot of honey we have hens too so we have plenty of eggs i brought some back with me i hope youll share them with me gwendoline rather liked all this dear me she must have made quite an impression on the new girl although she had only just arrived the others have been telling me all about you gushed maureen how popular you seem to be this didnt ring quite true somehow to gwendoline she hadnt known she was as popular as all that in fact though she didnt admit it frankly to herself she knew quite well she was probably the least popular of all the girls in the form maureen chattered away merrily and gwen listened not so much because she wanted to as because she was so busy tucking in at this rate thought the amused alicia gwendoline would put on more fat than games and gym and walks would take off youll be pleased to hear we havent got to work quite so hard this term gwen she told her more time for games and gym youll like that gwendoline gave alicia one of her looks as she called them alas they never impressed alicia it wasnt safe to argue with alicia or contradict or try to say something cutting alicia was always ten times as quick at answering back and a hundred times as cutting as anyone else well have the committee meeting at halfpast five announced moira that seems to be the best time youll be coming gwendoline wont you have you heard about the christmas entertainment committee yet gwendoline hadnt so she was duly enlightened she was pleased she saw herself at once in one of the chief parts of whatever play or pantomime was chosen she would loosen her sheet of golden hair what a pity it wasnt curly she would look lovely she knew she would exactly the same thoughts were going through maureens mind she too would like one of the chief parts and she too would play it with her golden hair loose she felt she would like to confide her thoughts to gwendoline when i was at mazeley manor she began belinda interrupted at once oh yes have you told gwen about measley manor maureen frowned you know its mazeley she said with dignity mamzelle just didnt know how to pronounce it thats all when she said it mamzelle caught her name mentioned she turned with her wide smile ah you want to talk about measley manor again your dear old school nest ce pas you have not yet told gwendoline about measley manor maureen saw the girls grinning and gave it up she went on talking to gwen who was astonished at all this byplay which she didnt of course understand at my old school we did a pantomime said maureen it was the sleeping beauty i had to have my hair loose of course you have to have someone with golden hair for those parts dont you gwen agreed heartily she was very proud of her golden hair and only wished she was allowed to wear it loose round her face at school as she did at home the prince was grand went on maureen i really must tell you all about the play youre so interested in plays arent you well and till long past teatime maureen went on and on interminably with her long and boring tale of what happened in the play at her last school gwendoline couldnt stop her or get rid of her maureen was just as thickskinned and slow of taking a hint as she was gwens met her match at last said darrell to sally i say look at bill and clarissa too all dressed up in riding things dont they know the committee meetings in about ten minutes sally called to them hey you two where do you think youre going to have a look at thunder and merrylegs said bill but didnt you know theres a committee meeting on almost at once said darrell exasperated no nobody told us said clarissa looking startled it wasnt up on the noticeboard well weve been talking about it ever since this morning and except for maureen and gwen who discussed goldenhaired beauties in plays weve talked about nothing else all teatime said darrell where are your ears didnt you hear a word of it not a word said bill seriously im so sorry of course well come have we time just to go and see thunder and merrylegs first we must have been talking about something else clarissa and i and not heard the rest of you you were whinnying away to each other said sally i suppose youve got horses on the brain again no dont go down to the stables now you certainly wont be back till the end of the committee if you do i know you two when you disappear into the stables youre gone for ever clarissa and bill walked off to the fifthform commonroom with a good grace perhaps there would be time afterwards to go to the stables come on said sally to darrell lets go and round up all the others im longing for this committee meeting at halfpast five the whole of the fifth form was soon collected in the north tower commonroom the girls sat on chairs lounged on the couches or lay on the floorrugs they talked and shouted and laughed moira came in and went straight to the table a big chair had been put behind it moira banged on the table with a book quiet she said the meeting is about to begin you all know what its about its to choose a committee to handle the organization of the christmas entertainment which we the fifth form are to undertake hear hear said somebodys voice moira took no notice i think the whole form should also be asked to discuss and choose what kind of entertainment we shall do she said punch and judy show called someone dont be funny said moira now first of all well get down to the business of choosing the committee i asked catherine to cut out the slips of paper to use where are they catherine she turned to where catherine was sitting next to her catherine handed her a sheaf of slips here they are i did them all as soon as you told me you wanted them and heres a box i got it out of the cupboard in the fifthform room and ive collected enough pencils for everyone to use and look all right all right said moira thats all we shall want now wholl give out the paper slips you marylou marylou was perched up on the top of a small cupboard swinging her legs she made preparations to climb down no no dont you bother marylou said catherine at once ill give them out and before anyone could stop her she was going round the room handing everyone a slip of paper and a pencil everyone got a slip asked moira look mavis hasnt got one catherine so sorry i missed you out said catherine in an apologetic voice she always apologized if she could here you are now said moira i think well have eight people on this committee because there will be a lot of work to be done we shall want someone to represent the art side for instance someone for the music side and so on i must be one of the committee as i am headgirl so you need not vote for me of course that means you need only put down seven names well i dont know that i should have voted for moira said alicia to irene in a low voice too bossy for my taste we shall all have to salute her when we meet her soon everyone was soon busy scribbling down names maureen was at a loss because she knew so few gwendoline prompted her and moira soon noticed it gwendoline dont tell maureen names to put down that simply means you have two votes instead of one i forgot that maureen is new we shall have to leave her out of this for the moment the papers were folded over and put into the box that catherine took round then whilst the rest of the girls chattered moira and catherine took out the slips jotted ticks beside the names of the girls chosen and counted them up moira rapped on the table silence please weve got the results now these are the names of the girls with most votes alicia mavis irene belinda darrell janet and sally and betty tie janet and betty were girls from other houses who were in the fifth form betty was alicias best friend as clever and witty as she was and very popular well there you are said moira as sally and betty have tied wed better have them both in making a committee of nine instead of eight ill take on the music side said irene and id like to take the art side any decorations and so on said belinda i draw very well whispered maureen to gwen i could help with that shall i say so no said gwen who couldnt draw anything and didnt particularly want this new girl to shine ill take on the costumes said janet who was extremely clever with her needle and made all her own dresses id love to help with those good said moira approvingly could i do you think i could help with the singing part of it said mavis hesitatingly i dont want to push myself forward but if theres to be any singing you know choruses and all that i could train them ive had such a lot of training myself i think id know how to set about it right thats a good idea said moira and if theres any solowork you can sing it yourself called darrell your voice is lovely now mavis flushed with pleasure oh well ill see there might not be any she said it depends what we do doesnt it that leaves alicia darrell sally and myself for general things the organization said moira who was certainly able to handle a meeting well and make it get on with things well have to work together smoothly efficiently and amicably she glanced at alicia as she spoke a quick rather hostile glance a mere flick of the eyes but alicia caught it and noted it that word amicably was meant for her all right she would be amicable just as long as moira was and not a moment longer well now that weve got the members of the committee settled well get on with the next thing said moira what kind of entertainment shall we give pantomime no a play a humorous play lets do a quiet weekend a variety show a ballet oh do lets do a ballet the last suggestion was from a girl who was a beautiful ballet dancer she was cried down no no thats too onesided we cant all dance well lets have something that everyone can be in and do something in well it had better be a pantomime then said moira we can have songs dances acting and all kinds of sideshows in that a pantomime never sticks to its story it just does what it likes after some more shouting and discussion a pantomime was decided on and for some reason or other cinderella found more favour than any other pantomime idea gwen and maureen immediately had visions of themselves as perfect cinderellas loose hair and all maureen turned to gwen how id love to act cinderella she murmured at my last school i lets see now what was your last school asked belinda at once poor maureen didnt dare to say the name she turned her back on belinda at my last school i was once cinderella she said i was a great success i gwen didnt like this kind of thing at all she began to think maureen very boring and conceited why she had been about to say what a good cinderella she would make she didnt consider that maureen with her weak silly rabbitmouthed face would make a good leading lady at all well choose cinderella for our pantomime story then said moira we will write the whole thing ourselves darrell youre good at essays you can draft it out darrell looked enormously surprised draft it out draft out a whole pantomimed she exclaimed oh i couldnt i wouldnt know how to begin youve only got to get the script of one or two other pantomimes to see how to set about it said moira can you write verse and words for songs well have to have those too darrell wished fervently she wasnt on the committee at all why this was going to be real hard work just as she thought she was going to have a nice slack term too she opened her mouth to protest but moira had already finished with her she was now speaking to irene can you get on with the music as soon as weve got the words she asked or perhaps you prefer to write the music before you get the words and have them fitted afterwards ill work in my own way thank you said irene perfectly politely but with a steady ring in her voice that said keep off where music is concerned im going to do as i like she looked straight at moira you can safely leave it to me musics my job it always has been and it always will be yes but i must know how youre going to set about it what kind of tunes youll write and so on said moira impatiently we cant leave things like that in the air youll have to as far as im concerned said irene i dont know what tunes im going to write till i hear them in my head then ill catch them and write them down and i dont know when ill hear them either so dont tell me to sit down at ten each morning and listen for them catherine tried to pour oil on troubled waters once more she loved doing that well after all when youre dealing with a genius she began you cant have rules for geniuses can you moira doesnt quite understand irene dont apologize for anything i say said moira scowling at catherine what do you mean i dont quite understand ive done this kind of thing often enough didnt i run the show last year and help to run it the year before that catherine put on a saintly expression yes of course moira dont put yourself out i shouldnt have said a word im sure irene understands she gave irene such a sweet smile that everyone felt quite sick did catherine have to make herself quite so humble the meeting had to come to an abrupt end because the supperbell went good gracious how the time flew said maureen and now we shant have time to go to the stables mourned bill dismally well call a short committee meeting tomorrow same time said moira gathering up her things well tie up any loose ends then she swept efficiently out of the room almost as if she were a mistress gosh well have to mind our ps and qs now said daphne with a comical look what have we done to have moira wished on us this term the balloon trick the first week of term always went very slowly indeed the next week slipped away faster and then the weeks began to fly but now it was still only the first week with a lot of planning and timetables to make and settlingin to be done darrell found herself very busy indeed she had to attend committee meetings for the christmas entertainment she had to read through two or three pantomime scripts and decide how to draft out her own version of cinderella she found sally an enormous help here and discovered that two heads are decidedly better than one she was also in charge of the games and had to draw up practice times for the lower school and to do a little coaching to help the games mistresses they consulted with her as to the best players to pick out for matches in the lower school and darrell enjoyed feeling important enough to argue with them about the various girls but you cant have rita she would say i know shes good but she simply wont turn out for practice shell go to pieces in a match well what do you think of christine then the games mistress would say shes so small i dont like to pick her but she runs like the wind darrell would reply and shes so keen shes just waiting for a chance yes darrell had a lot to do and she was always busy and always interested in her jobs the lower school adored her and vied to win an approving word from her felicity was very proud of her fifthform sister everyone thinks youre super she told darrell you should see the way they turn out for practice now on even the most disgusting days i say have i got a chance to get into one of the matchteams some day darrell you might tell me i can only say that if you go on as you are doing you wont be able to help getting in said darrell and felicity gave a whoop of joy june was passing and gave her a sour look she spoke to gwyneth the girl with her talk about favouritism youll see darrell choosing her young sister before anyone else and putting her into the team darrell heard and was over beside june at once june how dare you say a thing like that about a fifthformer just you wait a minute she fished out the punishment book that all the fifthformers were allowed to have and wrote down junes name in it she wrote something beside it tore it out and gave it to june there you are a little hard work will keep you quiet and teach you to guard that nasty tongue of yours june took the paper sulkily she glanced at it darrell had written learn three sonnets of shakespeares and say them to me or one of the other fifthformers before tuesday june scowled i cant do this she said ive got something to learn for alicia this week i cant do both im afraid youll have to said darrell i suppose you cheeked alicia again well we wont have it if you dont learn manners now and respect for your elders you never will you say those sonnets to me before tuesday she went off with felicity junes awful remarked felicity if only she wasnt so frightfully funny sometimes i honestly would never speak to her nor would susan but she plays such idiotic tricks shes playing one tomorrow on mamzelle dupont what is it asked darrell with interest i shouldnt have thought there were any tricks left to play on poor old mamzelle well there are and june plays them said felicity and when i see mamzelles face i laugh till i cry yes i know ive laughed till ive ached too sometimes said darrell remembering some of the jokes she and her form had played at times whats june playing at tomorrow oh darrell said felicity beginning to giggle as she thought of it shes got a kind of flat balloon arrangement well shes got four in fact and you put one under your blouse at the back and another in your front and another under your skirt at the back and the last one in front darrell chuckled go on i can guess what happens well june showed us said felicity beginning to laugh helplessly all the balloons are joined together by little tubes and theres an inflator you press to fill them and a deflator you pull out to empty them when she pressed the inflator she swelled up you see and she looked simply frightful oh dear i laughed so much i couldnt sit in my chair darrell laughed too well thats a new trick certainly i wish wed had it when we were in the first form where does june get these tricks from alicia always got them from her brothers oh june gets advertisement booklets sent her from the firms that make conjuring tricks and funny tricks said felicity i think she must spend all her pocket money on them it wouldnt be a bad idea to have a spot of conjuring in our pantomime said darrell thoughtfully alicia is awfully good at conjuring yes ill put a conjurer into the pantomime it shall be alicia if you can borrow that book or however many shes got from june id like to look through them right but i wont tell her you want it said felicity youll be mud to her now after giving her those sonnets to learn junes doing the trick tomorrow morning at twelve in french dictee darrell youre not free by any chance are you if so couldnt you come along with some message for mamzelle or something and see june swell up youll know when its happening because i expect well shriek with laughter darrell pondered she had put that period aside to get on with the draft of the pantomime until she had worked out the characters they could not be chosen so it was important to get on with it but how could she resist the chance of slipping down to see mamzelles face well ill come if i can she promised but when twelve oclock came next morning darrell was called to talk to matron about some missing socks matron always went into matters of this sort very thoroughly indeed and it was twenty minutes before darrell was free i wonder whats happened down in the first form she thought feeling rather guilty at her interest in something such babies did i wonder if the tricks been played it had june who always had to sit in one of the front desks so as to be under every mistresss eye had inflated herself very successfully indeed she did it gradually so that when mamzelle kept looking at her to see that she was getting on with the dictation she did not at first notice anything however she certainly began to seem a little on the plump side after a bit mamzelle pondered over it that child june she gets fat maybe a little fat will do her good she is too restless a truly difficult girl now fat girls are not usually difficult an interesting point she glanced at june again and got rather a shock why the child was positively bloated she stared at june fixedly one or two of the girls felt such a desire to laugh that it was agony to keep their faces straight june wrote steadily on june said mamzelle sharply are you holding your breath june looked innocently at mamzelle holding my breath she said with wide eyes no why should i but i will if you want me to mamzelle i can hold it for a long time she blew out her cheeks and held her breath the inflator worked marvellously she swelled visibly and mamzelle stared in alarm no no let out your breath june you will burst what is happening to you june let out her breath with a loud hissing noise and at the same time pulled the deflator she deflated at once and it looked exactly as if it was because she had let out her breath mamzelle was most relieved to see her become her right size again it was rather nice holding my breath like that said june foreseeing a very nice little game of holding her breath and inflating herself and letting it out and deflating at the same time to mamzelles horror she breathed in again blew out her cheeks and held her breath and visibly before mamzelles alarmed gaze she inflated till she looked really monstrous mamzelle started up from her seat never have i seen such a thing she said wildly june je vous prie i beg you do not hold your breath in this manner you will burst the whole class burst at that moment it was impossible to hold their laughter in any longer june let out her breath and deflated rapidly dont dont june gasped felicity rolling about in her chair oh dont do it again but june did and mamzelle watched wildly whilst she swelled up once more monstrous she cried june i beg of you once more do not hold your breath again see how it swells you up poor child and then something went wrong with the deflator it wouldnt work june pulled it frantically but it wouldnt deflate the fat balloons under her clothes she sat there pulling wildly at the string fastened to the deflator it came off mamzelle was almost in tears this poor june children children how can you laugh it is no laughing matter i go to get help matron must come be still june do not burst she hurried out wringing her hands june looked decidedly alarmed i say the beastly things gone wrong i cant let matron see me like this id get an awful wigging what can i do darrell had just arrived at the door at the moment that mamzelle rushed out looking frantic she had pushed by darrell without even seeing her darrell looked in at the open door she saw the monstrous june felicity saw darrell as an angel in disguise darrell the deflators gone wrong mamzelles gone to get matron quick what can we do get a pin idiot said darrell stick it into june and shell go pop and subside then youd better get her out of that arrangement quickly because matron will certainly do some exploring a pin was produced felicity dug it into the four swellings and they each went off with a loud pop june became her own size and shape at once she began to pull everything out frantically and wildly she was frightened now she got the rubber balloons out at last and put them into her desk just as footsteps were heard down the corridor darrell slipped out finding it difficult not to dissolve into laughter how she would have loved to see mamzelles face when she first saw june swelling up mamzelle was alone looking rather subdued she hurried by darrell and came to the first form she went in and gazed at june ah so you are flat now i told matron about you and she laughed at me she said it was a treek a treek what is this awful horrible abominable treek i will find it i will seek it i will hunt for it in every desk in the room ahhhhhhhh mamzelle looked so fierce as she stood there that nobody dared to say a word june began to wish she had left the balloons in her clothes if mamzelle did look in her desk she would certainly find them mamzelle found them she lifted up the lid and saw the rubber balloons at once flat and torn she picked them out and shook them in junes face ah now you can hold your breath again you bad wicked june hold your breath and listen to what i have to say you will learn for me one hundred lines of french poetry before tuesday yes one hundred lines does that make you hold your breath you bad girl it certainly did june already had two lots of english lines to learn now she had a hundred french ones to add to the lot she groaned mamzelle rummaged further in the desk she took out some booklets and looked at them new treeks old treeks treeks to play on your friends treeks to play on your enemies she read aha these i will take from you june you shall do no more treeks this term these i will confiscate and i do not think you shall have them back no she put the booklets with her books on the desk and very grim and determined went on with the french dictee the class soon recovered and longed for the last bell to go so that they might laugh once again to their hearts content mamzelle said a sharp good morning when the bell went and went off with the rubber balloons the booklets about tricks and her own books she sat down in the room she shared with miss potts the housemistress of north tower you look hot and bothered mamzelle said miss potts sympathetically ah this june she swells up like a frog under my eyes began mamzelle fiercely swelling up too then she saw miss potts astonished look and she smiled suddenly she opened her mouth and laughed she rolled in her seat and roared oh these treeks one of these days i too will play a treek it shall be superbe magnifique merveilleuse ha one day i too will play a treek in the commonroom darrell told alicia about junes idiotic trick alicia laughed its in the family isnt it i and my brothers are trickmad and now june my cousin is going the same way its a pity were in the fifth i feel it wouldnt be very dignified to play any of our tricks now darrell sighed yes i suppose youre right growingup has its drawbacks and thats one of them we have to be dignified and give up some of our silly ideas but oh alicia i wish you could have seen june all blown up honestly it was as good as any of your tricks its a pity that cousin of mine is such a hard and brazen little wretch said alicia i dont actually feel shes afraid of anything except perhaps my brother sam the odd thing is she simply adores him though hes given her some firstclass spankings and wont stand a scrap of nonsense from her when she comes to stay you cant seem to get at her somehow said darrell i mean she doesnt seem to care well shes a bit like you you know alicia though youre a lot better now alicia went rather pink all right dont rub it in i know im hard but you wont make me any better by telling me youve probably not noticed it but i have tried to be more sympathetic with fools and donkeys of course not being either yourself youve had no chance of seeing it darrell laughed she slipped her arm through alicias youre a bit of a donkey yourself she said but theres one thing about you that sticks out a mile and that is your absolute straightness and i dont feel that about june do you i feel it about my sister felicity you could trust her anywhere at any time but not june theres something sly about her as well as hard well well have to lick her into shape whilst were still at malory towers said alicia weve got two more years to do it in and then off we go to college leaving kids like june and felicity behind to carry on june arrived in the fifthform commonroom on tuesday evening to say her lines to alicia and darrell she looked very sulky the girls who were most of them busy with odd jobs such as darning making out lists rewriting work writing letters home and so on looked up as june strode into the room dont you know that a lower school kid knocks before she comes in said moira june said nothing but glowered go out knock and wait till youre told to come in ordered moira in her dictatorial voice june hesitated she detested being ordered about moira felt in her pocket for her little punishment book and june fled she didnt want any more lines i never knew anyone who so badly needed licking into shape said moira grimly little toad i know shes your cousin alicia but shes no credit to you i cant say your sister bridget is much credit to you either retorted alicia she didnt particularly want to defend june but she resented moiras high and mighty manner let her look after her own badmannered sister junes knocked twice already said catherine oughtnt we to say come in when i say so said moira do her good to wait june knocked again come in said moira and june came in red and furious she went to darrell and silently gave her the book out of which she had learnt her lines repeat them to me said darrell june gabbled them off without a single mistake darrell looked at her she really was very like alicia and she had alicias marvellous memory too no doubt it had taken june only about five minutes to memorize that long poem she went to alicia and gabbled off what she had learnt for her again with no mistake right said alicia you can go and if you dont want to spend the whole of this term learning lines try to be more civil to your elders june scowled belinda whipped out her pencil hold it she said to the surprised june yes just like that mouth down brows frowning surly expression hold it hold it i want it for my scowl book its called how to scowl and its really interesting you should see some of the scowls ive got moira and gwendoline who knew they had contributed to this unique book immediately scowled with annoyance and then straightened their faces at once in case belinda saw them blow belinda one couldnt even scowl in peace with her around june stood still scowling even more fiercely done she said at last well i wish you joy of all your scowls ill be willing to come along and offer you a good selection any time you like its an easy thing to do when any fifth former is around she stalked off feeling in her pocket for the lines she had learnt for mamzelle they hadnt really taken her very long thank goodness for a parrot memory june had only to read lines through once saying them out loud to know them others with less good memories envied her tremendously it didnt seem fair that june who tried so little could do such good work and that they who tried so hard very often only produced bad or ordinary work blow said irene suddenly putting down her pencil she had been composing a little galloping tune the one that had been in her head for some time after she had heard the galloping hooves of the horses in the drive im just nicely in the middle of this tirrettytoo tune and ive just remembered its my turn to do the flowers in the classroom i ought to go and pick them before its quite dark let me go said catherine putting down her darning ill be pleased to do it for you youre such a genius irene you just go on with your tune im only an ordinary mortal no gifts at all and its a pleasure to do what little i can she smiled her beaming smile and irene felt slightly sick everyone was getting tired of catherine and her martyrlike ways she was always putting herself out for someone offering to do the jobs nobody else wanted to do belittling herself and praising others extravagantly no thanks said irene shortly its my job and i must do it how like you to feel like that gushed catherine well im quite busy darning gwendolines stocking so if you really wouldnt like me to do the flowers for you ill but irene was gone she slammed the door and nobody except catherine minded they all felt like slamming the door themselves i do think irene might have said thank you said catherine in rather a hurt voice dont you maureen maureen felt that everyone was waiting to pounce on her if she dared to say yes irene was so very popular she was hesitating how to answer when the door opened and irene came back someones done the flowers she said yes now i come to think of it i saw clarissa doing them said mavis what on earth for demanded irene gosh i hope people arent going to run round after me doing my jobs im still perfectly capable of doing them well said darrell suddenly remembering its clarissas week idiot your week is next week you looked it up this morning gosh said irene again with a comical air of dismay im nuts i go and interrupt my own bit of composing and rush off to do a job im not supposed to do till next week anyway it gave dear catherine a chance to make one of her generous offers thats not kind of you irene said catherine flushing but never mind i do understand if i could compose like you id say nasty things sometimes i expect i do understand could you stop being forgiving and understanding long enough for me to finish my tune said irene in a dangerous voice i dont care if you understand or not all i care about at the moment is to finish this catherine put on a saintly face pressed her lips together as if stopping herself from retorting and went on darning there was a knock at the door irene groaned go away dont come in the door opened and connies face peered round is ruth here ruth can you come for a minute bridget is out here weve got rather a good idea i dont like bridget said ruth in a low voice and anyway im busy sos everyone else here but ruth ive hardly seen you this week protested connie come on out for a minute by the way ive mended your rollerskates for you theyre ready for you to use again irene groaned darrell groaned too she was trying to draft out the third act of the pantomime either tell connie to go or go yourself said irene if not ill go ill go and sit in the bathroom and take this with me perhaps ill get a few minutes peace then tirrettytirrettytoo yes i think ill go she got up connie fled thinking irene was going to row her ruth looked round apologetically but said nothing its all right said darrell softly keep connie at arms length till she leaves you in peace ruth and dont worry about it but catherine had to be silly about it of course poor connie she said i really cant help feeling sorry for her we oughtnt to be too hard on her ought we the weeks go on now the days began to slip by more quickly two weeks went three weeks and then the fourth week turned up and began to slip away too everything was going well there was no illness in the school the weather was fine so that the playingfields were in use every day and there was plenty of practice for everyone work was going well and except for the real duds nobody was doing badly five lacrosse matches had already been won by the school and darrell as games captain for the fifth was in the seventh heaven of delight she had played in two of the matches and had shot both the winning goals felicity had gone nearly mad with joy she had been able to watch darrell in both because they were home matches felicity redoubled her practices and begged darrell for all the coaching time she could spare she was reserve for the fourth schoolteam and was determined to be in it before the end of the term the plans for the christmas entertainment were going well too so far no help had been asked from either mr young the musicmaster or miss greening the elocution mistress the girls had planned everything themselves darrell had been amazed at the way she and sally had been able to grasp the planning of a big pantomime at first it had seemed a hopeless task and darrell hadnt had the faintest idea how to set about it but now having got down to it with sally having read up a few other plays and pantomimes and got the general idea she was finding that she seemed to have quite a gift for working out a new one its wonderful she said to sally i didnt know i could im loving it i say sally do you think do you possibly think i might have a sort of gift that way i never thought i had any gift at all yes said sally loyally i think you have got a gift for this kind of thing thats the best of a school like this that has so many many interests theres something for everybody and if you have got a hidden or sleeping gift youre likely to find it and be able to use it theres your way of scribbling down verse too i never knew you could do that before nor did i really said darrell she fished among her papers and pulled out a scribbled sheet can i read you this sally its the song cinderella is supposed to sing as she sits by the fire alone her sisters have gone to the ball listen by the fire i sit and dream and in the flames i see pictures of the lovely things that never come to me that never come to me ah me carriages a lovely gown a flowing silver cloak the embers move the pictures gone my dreams go up in smoke my dreams go up in smoke in smoke she stopped thats as far as ive got with that song of course i know its not awfully good and certainly not poetry only just verse but i never in my life knew i could even put things in rhyme and of course irene just gobbles them up and sets them to delicious tunes in no time yes its very good said sally you do enjoy it all too dont you i say what will your parents think when they come to the pantomime and see on the programme that darrell rivers has written the words and the songs too i dont know i dont think theyll believe it said darrell darrell was not the only member of the fifth form enjoying herself over the production of the pantomime irene was too she was setting darrels songs to exactly the right tunes and scribbling down the harmonies as if she had been composing all her life long as she very nearly had for irene was humming melodies before she was one year old the class were used to seeing irene coming along the corridor or up the stairs bumping unseeingly into them humming a new tune tumtyta tita tita tumtytoo oh sorry mavis i honestly didnt see you tumtyta titagosh did i hurt you catherine i never saw you coming oh thats quite all right said catherine gently patting irene on the arm and making her shy away at once we dont have geniuses like you every but irene was gone how she detested catherine with her humble ways and her continual air of sacrificing herself for others tumtyta tita she hummed suddenly in class and banged her hand down on the desk got it of course thats it oh sorry miss jimmy er james i mean miss james i just got carried away for a moment ive been haunted by you neednt explain said miss james with a twinkle in her eye do you think youve got that particular tune out of your system now and could concentrate say for half an hour on what the rest of the class are doing oh yes yes of course said irene still rather bemused she bent over her maths book pencil in hand miss james was amused to see one page of figures and one page of scribbled music when the book was given in both excellent for irene was almost as much a genius at maths as at music she insisted that the two things went together though this seemed unbelievable to the rest of the class maths were so dull and music so lovely the words of the pantomime progressed fast and so did the music it was essential that they should because there could be no rehearsing until there was something to rehearse belinda was busy with designs for scenery and costumes she too was extremely happy her pencil flew over the paper each evening and every moment of free time she drew everything even the pattern on cinderellas apron little janet waited eagerly as the designs grew and were passed on to her she too was eager and enthusiastic she turned out the enormous trunks of dresses and tunics and costumes of all periods used by other girls at malory towers in terms gone by how could she alter this how could she use that oh what a wonderful piece of blue velvet just right for the prince little janet had always been ingenious but now she surpassed herself she chose out all the material and stuffs she needed with unerring taste she sorted out dresses and costumes that could be altered she ran round the school pressing all the good needleworkers into her service she begged miss linnie the quiet little sewingmistress to help her by allowing some of the classes to work on the clothes and decorations i would never have thought that little mouse of a janet had it in her to blossom out like this said miss potts to mamzelle what these children can do if theyre just given a chance to do things on their own another person who was working hard though in quite a different direction was alicia alicia who never worked really hard at anything because she had good brains and didnt need to but now she had something to do that brains or no brains needed constant hard work and practice alicia was to be the demon king in the pantomime and he was to be an enchanter a conjurer who could do magic things alicia was to show her skill at conjuring and she meant to be as good a conjurer on the school stage as any conjurer in a london pantomime well i didnt dream that alicias ability for playing silly tricks and doing bits of amateur conjuring to amuse her friends would make her work as hard as this said miss peters the thirdform mistress shutting the door of one of the musicrooms softly she had heard peculiar sounds in there sounds of pantings sounds of something falling sounds of sheer exasperation and she had peeped in to see what in the world was going on alicia was there with her back to her practising a spot of juggling yes she was going to juggle as well as conjure and she had an array of coloured rings which she was throwing rapidly up into the air one after another catching them miraculously then she would miss one and click in exasperation she would have to begin all over again ah alicia had found something that didnt need only brainwork it needed patience practice deftness and then patience all over again why did i ever say id be the demon king groaned alicia picking up the rings for the twentysecond time and beginning again why did i ever agree to do conjuring and juggling i must have been mad but her pride made her go on and on if alicia did a thing it had to be done better than anybody else could possibly do it the fifth form were most intrigued by this new interest of alicias it was such fun to see her suddenly pick up a pencil rubber ruler and pen and juggle them rapidly in the air catching them deftly in one hand at the finish it was amusing to see her get up to find mamzelles fountainpen and pick it apparently out of the empty air and even more amusing to see her gravely abstract an egg from mamzelles ear alicia i will not have such a thing stormed mamzelle oh la la now you have found a cigarette in my other ear it is not nice it makes me go what do you call it duckflesh gooseflesh mamzelle said alicia with one of her wicked grins dear me has your fountainpen gone again its up in the air as usual and she reached out her hand and picked it once more from the air no wonder the class liked alicias new interest it certainly added a lot more enjoyment to lessons gwendoline mary and maureen two girls were anxiously waiting for darrell to finish the pantomime they were gwendoline and maureen each of them saw herself in the part of cinderella each of them crept away to the dormy on occasion let her golden hair loose and posed in front of the dressingtable mirrors i look exactly right for cinderella thought gwendoline mary im the type somehow i could sit pensively by the fireside and look really lovely and as the princess at the ball id be wonderful she wrote and told her mother about the coming pantomime of course we dont know yet about the characters she said most of the girls would like me to be cinderella they say i look the part i dont know what you think mother im not conceited as you know but i cant help thinking id do it rather well what does miss winter think back came two gushing letters at once one from her delighted mother one from her old governess worshipping as ever darling gwen yes of course you must be cinderella you would be absolutely right your hair would look so lovely in the firelight oh how proud i shall be to see you sitting there pensive and sad looking into and so on and so on miss winters letter was much the same both of them had apparently taken it completely for granted that gwendoline would have the chief part moira came barging into the dormy one day and discovered a startled gwendoline standing in front of her mirror her hair all round her face and a towel thrown over her shoulders for an evening cloak gosh what do you think youre doing she said in amazement washing your hair or something are you mad gwen you cant wash your hair at this time of day youre due for french in five minutes gwendoline muttered something and flung the towel back on its rack she went bright red moira was puzzled two days later moira again came rushing into the dormy to see if the windows were open this time she found maureen standing in front of her mirror her hair loose down her back in a golden sheet and one of the cubicle curtains pinned round her waist to make a train moira gaped maureen went pink and began to brush her hair as if it was a perfectly ordinary thing to be found with it loose and a curtain pinned to her waist moira found her voice what do you and gwen think youre doing parading about here with your hair loose and towels and curtains draped round you she demanded have you both gone crackers every time i come into this dormy i see you or gwen with your hair loose and things draped round you what are you up to maureen couldnt possibly tell the scornful practical moira what she was doing merely pretending to be a beautiful cinderella with a cloud of glorious hair and a long golden train to her dress but moira suddenly guessed she laughed her loud and scornful laugh oh i believe i know youre playing cinderella both of you pretending to be cinderella what a hope youve got wed never choose rabbitteeth to play cinderella and with this very cutting remark moira went out of the room laughing loudly maureen gazed at herself in the mirror and tears came to her eyes rabbitteeth how horrible of moira how frightfully cruel she couldnt help her teeth being like that or could she very guiltily maureen remembered how she had been told to wear a wire round her front teeth to force them back and she hadnt been able to get used to it and had tucked it away in her drawer at mazeley manor nobody there had said anything about it nobody had bothered mazeley manor was a freeandeasy school as maureen was so fond of saying comparing it unfavourably with malory towers and its compulsory games its inquisitive matron and determined responsible housemistresses if id been here when the dentist told me to wear that wire round my teeth matron and miss potts would both have made me do it even if i didnt want to she thought and by now id have nice teeth not stickingout and ugly and for the first time a doubt about that wonderful school mazeley manor crept into maureens mind was it so good after all to be allowed to do just as you liked to play games or not as you liked to go for walks or not at your own choice perhaps yes perhaps it was better to have to do things that were good for you whether you liked them or not till you were old enough and responsible enough to choose maureen had chosen not to wear the wire when she should have done and now she had been called rabbitteeth and she was sure she wouldnt be chosen as cinderella she did up her hair rather soberly blinking away a few more tears and trying to shut her lips over the protruding front teeth she forgot to unpin the curtain and went out of the room thinking so deeply that she didnt even feel it dragging behind her she met mamzelle at the top of the stairs tiens said mamzelle stopping in surprise que faites vous maureen what are you doing with that curtain maureen cast a horrified look at her train and rushed back to the dormy she unpinned it and put the curtain back into its place feeling rather subdued she went downstairs to find gwen gwen was getting very very tired of maureen the new girl had fastened on to her like a leech she related long and boring stories of her people her friends her old school and especially of herself she never seemed to think that gwen would like to talk too gwen sometimes broke into the middle of maureens boring speeches maureen did i ever tell you about the time i went to norway my word it was super i stayed up to dinner each night and i was only thirteen and ive never been to norway maureen would interrupt but my aunt went there last summer she sent me a whole lot of postcards ill find them to show you youll be interested to see them im sure gwen wasnt interested she was never interested in anything anyone else ever showed her in fact like maureen she wasnt interested in anything except herself the only time that maureen ever really listened to her was when she told unkind tales of the others in the form then maureen would listen with great interest i wouldnt have thought it of darrell she would say good gracious did daphne really do that oh i say fancy bill being so deceitful gwen was forced to play games and not only that but to take part in a lot of practices she was made to do gym properly and never allowed to get out of it by announcing she didnt feel too well she had to go for every walk that was planned fuming and furious it was june that enlightened maureen about all this assiduous attendance at games gym and walks she told her gleefully the history of gwens weak heart the term before gwen wanted to get out of the school cert exam so she foxed and said shed a weak heart that fluttered like a bird grinned june her mother took her home and then it was discovered gwen was pretending and back she came just in time for the exam and ever since shes been made to go in for games and gym like anything shes a humbug june had no right to say all this to a senior and maureen had no right to listen to her but like gwen she loved a bit of spiteful gossip and she stored the information up in her mind though she said nothing to gwen about it the two girls were forced to be together a great deal almost everyone else in the form had their own friend moira had no particular friend but went with catherine who was always at anyones disposal so gwen and maureen being odd ones out had to walk together and were left together very often when everyone else was doing something gwen grew to detest maureen horrid conceited selfish creature she hated the sound of her voice she tried to avoid her when she could she made excuses not to be with her but maureen wouldnt let her go gwen was the only one available to be talked to and boasted to and on occasion when she had fallen foul of miss james to be wailed to maureen thought she could draw as well as belinda or almost as well she thought she could sing beautifully and indeed she had an astonishingly powerful voice which alas continually went off the true note and was flat she was certain she could compose tunes as well as irene and she even drove darrell to distraction by offering to write a few verses for her what are we to do with this pest of a maureen complained janet one evening she comes and asks if she can help me and then if i give her the simplest thing to sew she goes and botches it up so that i have to undo it and she had the sauce to come and tell me she didnt like some of my chords in the opening chorus of cinderella snorted irene i ticked her off but she wont learn shes not wanted she wont learn shes no good shes so thickskinned that im sure a bullet would bounce off her if she was shot she wants a lesson said alicia my word if she comes and offers to show me how to juggle ill juggle her ill juggle her all down the corridor and back again and down into the garden and on to the rocks and into the pool gwens looking pretty sick these days said belinda she doesnt like having a double that clings to her like maureen does i wonder if she knows how like her maureen is in silliness and boringness and conceitedness and boastfulness and oh i say said the saintly catherine protesting arent you being rather unkind belinda belinda looked at catherine there are times to be kind and times to be unkind dear sweet catherine she said but you dont seem to know them you think youre being kind to me when you sharpen all my pencils to a pinpoint but youre not youre just being interfering i dont want all my pencils like that i keep some of them blunt on purpose and about this being unkind to maureen sometimes unkindness is a shortcut to putting something right i guess thats what maureen wants a dose of good hard commonsense administered sharply and thats what shell get if she doesnt stop this silly nonsense of hers catherine put on her martyrlike air you know best of course belinda i wouldnt dream of disagreeing with you im sorry about the pencils i just go round seeing what i can do to help thats all shall i show you how you look in your own thoughts catherine said belinda suddenly everyone listened most amused at belindas sudden outburst she was usually so very goodnatured but people like maureen gwen and catherine could be very very trying belindas pencil flew over a big sheet of paper she worked at it for five minutes then took up a pin ill pin it to the wall girls she said catherine will simply love it its the living image of her as she imagines herself she took the sheet to the wall and pinned it up the girls crowded round catherine consumed with curiosity went too it was a picture of her standing in a stainedglass window a gleaming halo round her head underneath in big bold letters belinda had written five words our blessed martyr st catherine catherine fled away from the shrieks of delighted laughter shes got what she wanted said darrell catherine come back how do you like being a saint in a stainedglass window a plot and a quarrel before that week had ended darrell was ready with the whole pantomime words and all most of the music had been written because irene almost snatched the words from darrell as she finished them quite a gilbert and sullivan said moira rather sneeringly speaking of the famous comic opera pair of the last century she was feeling rather out of things until the pantomime was written she could not produce it so she had nothing to do at the moment and moira disliked having nothing to do she liked running things organizing things and people dominating everyone laying down the law she was not a popular headgirl the fifthformers resented her dictatorial manner they disliked her lack of humour and they took as little notice of her as they could moira chafed under all this do buck up with this pantomime darrell and sally she said i wish id undertaken to write it myself now youre so slow you couldnt write it said darrell you know you couldnt you hardly ever get good marks for composition moira flushed dont be cheeky she said catherine spoke up for her using a sweet and gentle voice im sure moira only let you and sally do it to give you a chance she said im sure she could have done it very well herself there speaks our blessed martyr saint catherine put in alicia maliciously dear saint catherine she deserves the halo belinda gave her doesnt she girls catherine frowned belinda called out at once hold it catherine hold it no dont smile in that sickly sweet manner let me have that frown again catherine turned away it was too bad that she should be laughed at when all the time she was trying to be kind and selfsacrificing and really good poor catherine thought to herself she glanced at the wall blow there was yet another picture of her up there with a bigger halo than ever catherine regularly sneaked into the commonroom when it was empty and took down the pictures that belinda as regularly drew of her but always there was a fresh one it was absolutely maddening this one showed her sharpening thousands of pencils and if anyone looked carefully at the big halo they could see that it too was made of sharpened pencils set closely together its enough to make anyone furiously angry thought catherine i wonder i dont lose my temper and break out and call people names well i try to like them all but its very very difficult the fifth form decided they must deal with maureen as well as with catherine better show them both exactly where they stand before we begin rehearsing said alicia we cant be bothered by interferers and whiners and saints when once were on the job now how shall we deal with maureen the trouble with her is that shes so full of herself thinks she can do everything better than anyone else and is sure she could run the whole show said darrell shes so jolly thickskinned theres no doing anything with her shes too vain for words right said alicia well give her a real chance well tell her to draw some designs to help belinda well tell her to sing one or two songs to help mavis well tell her to compose one or two tunes to help irene and write one or two poems to help sally then well turn the whole lot down scornfully and shell know where she stands well it sounds rather drastic said marylou it does rather said sally cant we tell her to do the things and let her down not too scornfully yes we could pretend she wasnt being serious she was just pulling our legs when she brings the tunes and verses and things said darrell and we could pat her on the back and clap and laugh but not take them seriously at all if shes got any commonsense shell shut up after that if she hasnt well have to be a bit more well drastic as marylou calls it everyone was in this plot except gwen and catherine the girls were afraid one of the two might tell tales to maureen if they knew of the plan moira approved of it though she thought it not wholehearted enough she would have liked the first idea the drastic one maureen was told to submit verses tunes and designs also to learn two of the songs in case she could improve on maviss interpretation of them she was so gratified and delighted that she could hardly stammer her thanks at last at last she was coming into her own her gifts were being recognized how wonderful she rushed straight off to tell gwen gwen could hardly believe her ears she listened green with jealousy to ask maureen to do these things it was unbelievable arent you pleased gwen i can do them all better than the others cant i cried maureen her paleblue eyes shining brightly at last the others are beginning to realize that i did learn something at mazeley manor you and your measley manor said gwen turning away maureen was shocked had gwen gwen her friend actually said measley she must have misheard she took gwen by the arm chattering happily but gwen was strangely unfriendly she was so jealous that she could hardly answer a word maureen worked hard she produced two lots of verses two tunes and a variety of designs for costumes she learnt the two songs that darrell had given her going alone into a fifthform musicroom where she let her loud voice out to such an extent and so much off the note that the girls in the next musicrooms listened startled and amazed it was not only a loud voice but it was not true in pitch it kept sliding off the note and going flat like a gramophone just about to run down it made the astonished girls in the rooms nearby shiver down their spines whoever could it be yowling like that bridget moiras fourthform sister went to have a look gracious it was a fifthformer yowling in there who was it maureen little bridget grinned and went to find connie the two of them had become friends and connie was gradually leaving ruth to herself coming less and less to ask for her company the two fourthformers peered into the square of glass window set in the door of the practiceroom where maureen was singing hear that said bridget maliciously wonderful isnt it lets both go into the room next door and yowl too come on its empty now if a fifthformers allowed to do that so are we so the two of them went next door and made such a hullaballoo pretending to be a couple of operasingers that everyone in the corridor was startled only maureen lost in her loud voice soaring to higher and louder heights heard nothing her door suddenly opened and moira came in maureen shut up we can even hear you in the commonroom maureen stopped abruptly then from the next room rose more yowls moira hurried there amazed now what was going on connie stopped as soon as she saw moira but bridget who cared nothing for her sisters anger sang on vigorously altering the words of her sung at once ohhhhhhh here is moira here is sheee bridget stop that at once said moira angrily but bridget didnt stop here is sheeeee she repeated did you hear what i said shouted moira bridget stopped for breath tm not making nearly such a noise as maureen she said and anyway i keep on the note and she doesnt if a fifthformer can yowl away like that why cant we now dont you start being cheeky began moira going white with annoyance you know i wont stand that connie go out of the room i advise you not to make close friends with bridget youll only get yourself into trouble connie went scared if it had been ruth with her in trouble she would have stayed and stuck up for her but bridget was different she always stood up for herself she faced moira now thats a nice thing to tell anyone about your sister moira she said washing your dirty linen in public telling somebody im not fit to make friends with i didnt say that said moira why cant you behave yourself bridget im ashamed of you im always hearing things about you well so am i about you said bridget who is the most domineering person in the fifth you who is the most unpopular headgirl theyve ever had you who didnt go up with the old fifth form because nobody could put up with her you oh cried moira whiter still with rage youre unbearable i shall report you to miss williams yes and connie too and i shall report you every single time i find you doing something you shouldnt i know how you sneak out of your dormy at night to talk to the thirdformers i know how you get out of the jobs you ought to do i hear things too sneak said bridget it was a very ugly sight the two sisters standing there shouting at one another moira was trembling now and so was bridget moira had to keep her hands well down to her side she so badly wanted to strike her sister bridget kept well out of the way she always came off worst in a struggle there was a pause youll be sorry if you do report me about this afternoon said bridget at last very sorry i warn you go and report maureen shell expect it of the domineering moira but just remember ive teamed you youll be sorry if you report me well i shall said moira its my duty to fourthformers arent allowed in these practicerooms you know that she turned and left the room still trembling she went to find miss williams the fourthform mistress if she didnt report those two straightaway whilst she was furious she might not do it when her anger had died down miss williams was rather cool about the affair she wrote down the two fourthform names moira gave her and nodded right ill speak to them that was all moira wished she hadnt said anything she felt uncomfortable now about bridgets threats how could bridget make her sorry bridget was so very fierce sometimes and did such unaccountable things like the time when she had broken every single one of moiras dolls years ago because moira had thrown one of bridgets toys out of the window yes moira felt decidedly uncomfortable as she walked back to the commonroom bridget would certainly get back at her if she could the plot is successful maureen had been rather scared at moiras sudden arrival in the practiceroom she had heard the angry voices in the next room too when moira had left her and had been even more scared it didnt take much to scare maureen she slipped hurriedly out of the room and went off to the classroom to put the finishing touches to her designs she was to show them to the others that evening she saw gwens sour face as she walked into the commonroom with her sheaf of designs and sheets and sheets of music and verses oh maureen had been very busy if mamzelle and miss james had known how hard she had been at work they would have been most surprised neither of them had any idea that maureen had it in her to work at all what they taught at mazeley manor i really do not know miss james said to the other teachers each time she corrected maureens work selfadmiration selfesteem selfpity murmured miss williams who taught one lesson in the fifth form and had had quite enough of maureen but not selfcontrol said miss james what a school its a good thing its shut down everyone was in the commonroom waiting for maureen though neither gwen nor catherine knew the little plot that was being hatched by the rest maureen beamed round now youre going to see something she said gaily and laughed her silly little laugh it was always said at mazeley manor that i was a good allrounder dont think im boasting will you but honestly though i say it myself i can do most things maureen was surprised to hear some of the girls laughing quite hilariously youre such a joker maureen said alicia appreciatively always being really humorous this was a new idea to maureen nobody had ever called her humorous before she at once went up in her own estimation now she said ill show you the designs first this is for cinderellas ball costume ive gone back to the sixteenth century for it as you see shrieks of laughter came from everyone priceless said darrell pretending to wipe her eyes how can you think of it maureen a perfect scream said mavis holding up the crude drawing with its poor colouring what a joke i didnt know youd such a sense of humour maureen maureen was puzzled she hadnt meant the drawing to be funny at all she had thought it was beautiful she hurried on to the next one but the girls forestalled her and picked up the sheets showing them round to one another with squeals of laughter look at this one i never saw anything so funny in my life good enough for punch i say look at the barons face and what is he wearing this ones priceless gosh maureen really is a humorist isnt she then irene picked up the sheets of music hallo here are the tunes she has written i bet theyll be priceless too ill play them over she went to the commonroom piano and with a very droll expression on her face she played the tunes making them sound even sillier than they were everyone crowded round the piano laughing isnt maureen a scream she can do funny drawings and write ridiculous tunes too maureen began to feel frightened were the girls really in earnest about all this they seemed to be surely surely they couldnt really think that all her lovely work was so bad that it was funny they must be thinking it was funny on purpose perhaps they thought she meant it to be she turned to find gwen gwen would understand gwen was her friend she had told gwen everything how good she was at drawing music and singing how hard she had worked at all this how pleased she was with the results gwen was looking at her and it wasnt a nice look it was a triumphant look that said ah pride comes before a fall my girl and what a fall it was a look that said im glad about all this serves you right maureen was shocked gwen laughed loudly and joined in with the others frightfully funny priceless maureen who would have thought you could be so funny now sing said mavis and thrust one of the songs into her hand lets hear you youve such a wonderful voice havent you so welltrained im sure it must be a great joy to you sing maureen did not dare to refuse she gazed at the music with blurred eyes and sang her loud voice rose even more off the note than usual it shook with disappointment as the girls began to clap and cheer and laugh again ha ha listen to that cant she have a comic part in the play darrell and sing it shed bring the house down did you ever hear such a voice maureen stopped singing tears fell down her cheek she gave one desperate look at gwen a look begging for a word of praise but none came she turned to go out of the room catherine ran after her maureen dont take it like that the girls dont mean anything oh yes we do said darrell under her breath weve been cruel to be kind catherine would say a thing like that dont touch me cried maureen saint catherine coming all over pious and goodygoody after youve laughed at me with the rest ho saint catherine shrank back as if she had been slapped in the face nobody smiled except gwen marylou looked upset she couldnt bear scenes of any sort bill looked on stolidly she got up well im going riding she said theres half an hour of daylight left coming clarissa bills solidness and matteroffact voice made everyone feel more normal they watched bill and clarissa go out of the room well i dont somehow feel that was quite such a success as we hoped said sally actually i feel rather lowdown so do i said darrell maureen is a conceited ass of course and badly needed taking down a peg but im afraid weve taken her down more pegs than we meant to it wont hurt her said gwen in a smug voice she thinks too much of herself i cant think why shes attached herself to me all these weeks alicia couldnt resist this like calls to like dear gwen she said deep calls to deep youre as like as two peas you and maureen its been a sweet sight to see you two together you dont really mean that alicia said gwen after a surprised and hurt silence were not really alike maureen and i youve let your tongue run away with you as usual think about it dear gwendoline mary alicia advised her do you babble endlessly about your dull family and doings so does maureen do you think the world of yourself so does maureen do you think youd be the one and only person fit to be cinderella in the play so does maureen gwen sprang to her feet and pointed her finger at moira oh just because you found me with my hair down in the dormy the other day and a towel round my shoulders you went and told the others that i wanted to be cinderella well i didnt realize it until i caught maureen doing exactly the same thing said moira both of you posing with your hair loose and things draped round you alicias perfectly right youre as like as two peas you ought to be friends youre almost twins but i dont like maureen said gwen in a loud and angry tone im not surprised said alicias smooth voice a whole wealth of meaning in it you should know what shes like shouldnt you seeing that youre almost twins gwen went stamping out of the room fuming darrell drummed on the table with a pencil im not awfully pleased about all this she said in rather a small voice too much spite and malice about gwen suddenly put her head in at the door again and addressed moira ill get even with you for telling the girls about me and maureen in front of the glass she said youll see ill pay you back headgirl or no headgirl moira frowned and belinda automatically reached for her pencil a very fine scowl but darrell took the pencil away with a beseeching look not this time she said theres too much spite in this room this evening all right saint darrell said belinda and darrell had to laugh moira came over to her lets change the subject she said what about the housematches lets have a look at the kids youve put in darrell got out the lists moira as headgirl took an interest in the matches in which the fifthformers played and because she liked games she was interested too in the lowerschool players it was about the only thing that she and darrell saw eyetoeye about soon they were deep in discussion weighing up the merits of one player against another this match against wellsbrough said darrell next weeks match i mean with the fourth team playing wellsbroughs fourth team ive put young susan in and id like to put my young sister felicity in what do you think moira good gracious yes said moira shes absolutely firstclass super runs like the wind and never misses a catch she must have been practising like anything she has said darrell i just hesitated because well because shes my sister and i was a bit afraid i might be showing favouritism you know rot said moira youd be showing yourself a bad captain if you didnt stick the best kids into the team and i insist on your putting felicity in darrell laughed she was pleased oh all right seeing that you insist she said and wrote felicitys name down gosh shell be pleased hows june shaping called alicia ive seen her practising quite a bit lately turning over a new leaf do you think well not really said darrell i mean she practises a lot but when i coach her shes as offhand as ever never a word of thanks and always ready to argue i cant put her into a matchteam yet she simply doesnt understand the team spirit you know always plays for herself and not for the side yes youre right said moira ive noticed that too cant have anyone in the team who isnt willing to pull their weight darrell glanced curiously at moira how much nicer moira was over this games question than over anything else she was fair and just and interested she forgot to be domineering and opinionated what a pity she was head of the form she might have been so much nicer if she had had to knuckle down to someone else could you take the lists down for me and put them up on the sports board she said to moira ive got a whole heap of things to do still moira took the list just as catherine hurried to offer to take it ill take it said catherine who seemed to think it was only right she should be a doormat for everyone no thanks saint catherine said moira and catherine went red with humiliation she had done so much for moira been so nice to her taken such a lot of donkeywork off her shoulders and all she got was that scornful hateful name saint catherine she gave moira an unexpectedly spiteful look darrell saw it and shivered impatiently i dont like all this spitefulness going about she thought to herself it always boils up into something beastly fancy the saintly catherine giving her beloved moira such a poisonous look moira went down with the lists she pinned the list of names for the fourth team up first heading it team for wellsbrough match immediately a crowd of excited firstformers swarmed round her felicity youre in youre in yelled somebody and felicitys face glowed happily sos susan but youre not june said another voice fancy and youve been practising so hard shame oh well what do you expect darrell would be sure to put her sister in said junes voice she was bitterly disappointed but she spoke in her usual jaunty manner moira heard june apologize at once darrell shows no favouritism at all she was halfinclined to leave felicity out i insisted she should be put in apologize immediately well began june defiantly ready to argue but moira was insistent i said apologize you heard me do as youre told i apologize said june sulkily but i bet it was you who missed me out i told darrell that i wouldnt have anyone in the matchteam who didnt play for the team and not for themselves said moira curtly you dont pull your weight you practise and practise and then in a game all you want to do is to go your own way and blow the others not my idea of a good sportsman think about it june she walked off not caring in the least what the firstformers thought of her outspokenness june said nothing she looked rather queer susan thought she went up to her it was mean to say all that in front of us she began she should have what does it matter said june suddenly jaunty again do you suppose i care tuppence for moira or darrell or alicia or any of those stuckup fifthformers grand meeting a grand meeting was called to discuss the pantomime the casting of the characters and the times of rehearsal darrell had finished her writing and irene had completed the music everything was ready for rehearsal all the fifthformers attended the meeting in the north tower commonroom it was very crowded a fire burned in the big fireplace for it was now october and the nights were cold moira was in the chair catherine rather a quiet and sulky catherine not quite so free with her beaming smile was at her left hand ready to provide her with anything she wanted the committee sat on chairs on each side of the table moira banged on the table with a book and shouted for silence she got it people always automatically obeyed moira she had that kind of voice crisp and curt the meeting began darrell was called upon to explain the pantomime and the characters in it she was also asked to read the first act very flushed and excited she gave the listening fifthformers a short summary of the pantomime they listened with much approval it sounded very good then stammering a little at first darrell read the first act of the pantomime just as she had written it dialogue songs stage directions and everything there was a deep silence as she read on thats the end of the act she said at last raising her eyes halfshyly not absolutely certain if she had carried her listeners with her or not there was no doubt about that a second later the girls stamped and clapped and cheered darrell was so pleased that she felt hot with joy and had to wipe her forehead dry moira banged for silence well youve all heard what a jolly good play darrell and sally have got together she said darrell did most of it but sally was splendid too you can tell it will bring the house down if we can produce it properly whos going to produce it called betty i am said moira promptly any objections there were quite a lot of doubtful faces nobody really doubted moiras ability to produce a pantomime but they did doubt her talent for getting the best out of people she rubbed them up the wrong way so much i think it would be better to have two producers said somebody right said moira promptly she didnt mind how many there were so long as she was one of them she meant to be the real producer anyway who do you want betty betty shrieked half the fifthformers it was obviously planned moira frowned a little betty alicias laughing careless clever friend yes let betty said alicia suddenly she felt that she wouldnt be able to work happily with moira alone for long but two producers would be easier she could consult with betty all the time betty grinned round and took her place on one of the committee chairs thanks she said ill produce the goods all right now to choose the characters said moira we have more or less worked them out ill read them gwendoline and maureen held their breath was there any hope of being cinderella or even the fairygodmother or the prince moira read the list out cinderella marylou there was a gasp from marylou gwen and maureen of amazement from marylou and disappointment from the others oh i cant said marylou you can said darrell we want someone sort of patheticlooking a bit scary someone appealing and bigeyed and it has to be someone who can act and someone who can sing and youre exactly right for the part said sally thats right make your eyes big and scared marylou youre poor little cinderella to the life everyone laughed marylou had to laugh too her eyes began to shine i never thought youd choose me she said well we have said darrell you can act very well and youve a nice singing voice though its not very loud the prince mavis said moira everyone knew that already the prince had a lot of singing to do and mavis would do that wonderfully well her voice was beautiful again and irene had written some lovely tunes for her to sing to darrells words everyone clapped the baron bill said moira and there was a delighted laugh oh yes bill stamping about in ridingbreeches calling for her horse cried clarissa in delight fairygodmother louella said moira everyone looked at louella who came from south tower and had a tall slim figure golden curls and a good clear voice hurray shouted all the south tower girls glad to have someone from their tower in a good part buttons the little boots rachel went on moira rachel can act jolly well and shes had the same part before so she ought to do it well who are the ugly sisters called a voice gwens heart suddenly gave a lurch and sank down into her shoes ugly sisters suppose she had been chosen to be one she couldnt couldnt bear it she saw alicia gating at her maliciously and felt sure she had been chosen she simply couldnt bear it she got up saying she didnt feel very well and went towards the door alicia smiled she could read gwens thoughts extremely well gwen was going because she was afraid her name would be read out next as one of the ugly sisters your heart worrying you again called one of the west tower girls to gwen and everyone laughed gwen disappeared she made up her mind not to go back till the meeting was over maureen was also worried about the same thing she thought about her rabbitteeth moira might think she was made for an ugly sister why oh why hadnt she been sensible and had her teeth straightened when she had a chance she drew her upper lip over them to try and hide them ugly sisters pat and rita said moira and there was an instant roar of approval from the girls pat and rita looked round humorously they were twins and certainly not ugly but they had upturned comical noses eyes very wideset and hair that flew out in a shock they were comical good at acting and would make a splendid pair of ugly sisters thanks moira called out rita that suits us down to the ground right down to our big ugly feet demon king alicia said moira and again there was a great roar of approval led by a delighted betty moira beamed round looking quite pleasant alicias going to do juggling and conjuring as well as leap about the stage like a demon she said i cant think of anyone else who could be a demon so successfully more shrieks of approval miss james not far off wondered what in the world was happening it sounded as if about fifty thousand spectators at a football match were yelling themselves hoarse jolly good casting called somebody go on well now we come to the servants and courtiers and so on said moira that means the rest of you theres a part for everyone even though it may be small what about darrell called a voice darrells written the play and will help in the producing said moira sally will help her too they wont be in it because their hands will be full were going to ask pop if hell do the electricity part hell love it pop was the handyman of the school very much beloved and quite invaluable on these occasions it all sounds jolly good said winnie when are the rehearsals every tuesday evening and on friday evenings too for those who want an extra one said moira and the parts will be sent out to everyone tomorrow for goodness sake learn them as quickly as you can its hopeless to keep reading them when we rehearse you cant act properly like that you forgot to say that irenes done the music and belinda the decorations and janets doing the costumes said darrell no i hadnt said moira quickly i was coming to that anyway everyone knows it by the way well be glad of any help for janet in making the costumes anyone good with their needle will be welcomed janet will give out the work if youll be decent enough to ask her for it more clapping then a spate of excited talk this was going to be the best pantomime ever it would make the whole school sit up it would bring the house down theres never been a show before where the girls wrote the songs and words and music themselves said winnie my word wont the grayling open her eyes a bell went somewhere and everyone got up well be at rehearsal well learn our parts mavis what about the singing are you going to train the chorus chattering and calling they all went to their own towers darrell sighed happily and put her arm through sallys this is about the most exciting thing ive ever done in my life sally she said you know i shouldnt be surprised if i dont turn out to be a writer one of these days felicitys first match felicity came to see darrell the next day about the match with wellsbrough school she looked with bright eyes at her fifthform sister i say fancy me playing in the fourth school team i thought perhaps i might by the end of the term with luck but next week thanks awfully for putting me in darrell well actually it was moira who insisted on putting you in said darrell i wanted to and yet i just wondered if i was thinking favourably of you because you were my sister you know then moira said you must certainly go in and in you went junes awfully disappointed shes not in said felicity shes been practising like anything darrell she pretends she doesnt care but she does really i wish she wouldnt say such awful things about you fifthformers all the time she really seems to have got her knife into you its horrid shell get over it said darrell we dont lose any sleep over young june i can tell you will you be able to come and watch the wellsbrough match asked felicity eagerly oh do i shall play ever so much better if youre there yelling and cheering of course ill come said darrell and ill yell like anything so just be sure you give me something to yell for the firstformers prayed for a fine day for their match it was to be at home not away and as it was the first time they had played wellsbrough fourth team they were really excited about it the senior school smiled to see the babies so excited they remembered how they too had felt when they had the delight of playing in an important match for the very first time nice to see them so keen said moira to darrell i think ill get my lacrosse stick and go and give them a bit of coaching before dinner ive got half an hour ill fetch your stick said catherine at once in her usual doormat voice no thanks saint catherine answered moira im still able to walk to the locker and reach my own stick the day of the match dawned bright and clear a magnificent october day the trees round the playing fields shone red and brown and yellow in their autumn colours the breeze from the sea was salty and crisp all the girls rejoiced as they got up that morning and looked out of the window malory towers was so lovely on a day like this the happiest girls of course were the small firstformers excited twelveyearolds who talked to one another at the tops of their voices without stopping how they ever heard what anyone else said was a mystery miss potts the firstform mistress was lenient that morning so was mamzelle who was always excited herself when any of her classes were well so today is your match she said to the first form you will play well nestce pas you will win all the goals i shall come to watch and for the girl that wins a goal shoots a goal mamzelle said susan shoots ah yes but you have no gun to shoot a goal said mamzelle who never could learn the language of sports well well for the girl who shoots a goal i will say no french prep tomorrow but mamzelle thats not fair cried a dozen voices were not all in the match only felicity and susan and vera ah i forgot said mamzelle that is so then what shall i say say youll let us all off french prep for the rest of the week if we win called felicity no no said mamzelle shocked for one day only i said now it is understood if you win your match no french prep for you tomorrow youre a peach mamzelle called a delighted firstformer comment said mamzelle astonished you call me a peach never have i its all right mamzelle its a compliment said felicity peaches are wizard mamzelle gave it up now we will have our verbs she said page thirtyfive sil vous plaоt and no more talking the wellsbrough girls arrived at twenty past two in a big coach they were rather older than the malory towers team and seemed much bigger the malory towers girls felt a little nervous the two captains shook hands and the teams nodded and smiled at one another the games mistress blew her whistle and the teams came round her the captains tossed for ends the teams took their positions in the field felicity gripped her lacrosse stick as if it might leap from her hand if she didnt she put on a grim expression that made everyone who saw it smile her knees shook just a little how she hoped nobody could see them it was silly to be nervous in a match just the time not to be good luck whispered susan who was not far off shoot a goal felicity nodded still looking grim darrell and moira and sally were together watching most of the other fifthformers were there too because many of them helped the younger ones and were interested in their play a good sprinkling of the other forms were also there wellsbrough was a splendid school for sport and usually sent out firstclass matchteams your small sister looks pretty fierce said sally to darrell look at her she means to do and dare all right the match began the ball shot out down the field and the girls began to race after it picking it up in their nets throwing it catching it knocking it out again picking it up tackling one another and making the onlookers yell with excitement the wellsbrough team shot the first goal it went clean into the net quite impossible to stop the twelveyearold goalkeeper was very downcast one to wellsbrough felicity gritted her teeth wellsbrough had the lead now she shot a look at darrell yes there she was never taking her eyes off the ball felicity longed to do something really spectacular and make darrell dance and cheer with pride but the wellsbrough team was tough and nobody could do anything very startling always there was a wellsbrough girl ready to knock the ball out of a malory towers lacrosse net as soon as it was there and always there was a wellsbrough girl who seemed to be able to run faster than any of the home team it was maddening felicity and susan became very out of breath and panted and puffed as they tore down the field their hearts beating like pistons and then susan shot a goal it was most unexpected she was tearing down the field far from the goal with two wellsbrough girls after her and felicity running up to catch the ball if susan passed it susan took a quick glance round to see if felicity was ready to catch it a wellsbrough girl ran up beside felicity a tall girl who would probably take the ball instead of felicity if it was passed blow on the spur of the moment susan flung the ball at the distant goal it was a powerful throw and the ball flew straight the goalkeeper rushed out to catch it but she missed and the ball bounced right into the very middle of the net cheers rang out from the spectators darrell yelled too then she turned to moira a very lucky goal those far throws dont usually come off but that one did one all it was almost halftime one minute to go the ball came to felicity and she caught it deftly in her net jumping high in the air for it good yelled everyone pleased to see such a fine catch felicity sped off with it and passed to rita she didnt see a big wellsbrough girl running up to her and collided heavily over she went on the ground and felt an agonizing pain in her right ankle it was so sharp that she couldnt get up things went black around her poor felicity was horrified no no she mustnt faint not on the playingfield in the middle of the match she couldnt the whistle went for halftime felicity heaved a long shaky sigh of relief five minutes rest would her ankle be all right she wasnt going to faint after all she sat there on the grass pretending to fiddle with her lacrosse boot till she felt a little better susan came running up i say you went over with a terrific wallop did you hurt yourself twisted my ankle a little said felicity she looked very white and susan was alarmed the games mistress came up twisted your ankle lets have a look she undid the boot quickly and looked at felicitys foot pressing it and turning it its an ordinary twist she said horribly painful when it happens i know youd better come off and let your reserve play felicity was almost in tears darrell came running up has she twisted her ankle oh she often does that her right ankles a bit weak daddy always tells her to bandage it fairly tightly round the foot just here and walk on it immediately not lie up well im agreeable to that if felicity can stand on it all right and run said the mistress its up to her susan brought felicity a lemon quarter to suck she began to feel much better and colour came back into her checks she stood up testing her ankle gingerly then she smiled its all right it will be black and blue tomorrow but theres nothing really wrong in a few minutes time it will be better the games mistress bound the foot up tightly and felicity put on her boot again the foot had swollen a little but not much chewing her lemon felicity hobbled about for a minute or two feeling the foot getting better and better as she went nothing much wrong reported the games mistress a nasty twist but felicitys a determined little character and where another girl would moan and make a fuss and go off limping shes going to go on playing it wont do the foot any harm probably do it good the whistle went again after a little longer halftime to give felicity a chance to recover the girls took their places all at the opposite ends this time susan was a marvel that second half she saved felicity all she could and leapt about and ran like a mad march hare everyone cheered her felicitys foot ceased to hurt her she forgot about it she began to run again and made another wonderful catch that set all the spectators cheering she tackled a wellsbrough girl and got the ball away she ran for goal shoot yelled everyone shoot but before she could shoot the ball was knocked out of her net and a wellsbrough girl was speeding back down the field with it she passed the ball on and it was caught and passed again and shot straight at the malory towers goal save it save it yelled everyone in agony the goalkeeper stood there like a rock she made a wild slash with her lacrosse stick and miraculously caught the hard rubber ball flinging it out to a malory towers girl at once no goal no goal sang the girls in delight well saved hilda well saved looks as if its going to be a draw said moira glancing at her watch only two minutes more felicitys limping just a bit again plucky kid to run on as she did shes got the ball cried darrell clutching moira in excitement another marvellous catch my word practice does pay she catches better than anyone look shes kept it felicity was running down the field with the ball she was tackled by a wellsbrough girl dodged turned herself right round and passed to susan susan caught it and immediately passed it back to felicity seeing two of the enemy coming straight at her felicity nearly didnt catch it because it was such a high throw but by leaping like a goat she got it into the tip of her net and it ran down safely then off she went tearing down the field her face set grimly shoot yelled the girls shooooooooooot and she shot just as the stick of an enemy came crashing down to get the ball from her the ball shot out high in the air and the goalkeeper rushed out to get it she missed it and the ball bounced and ran slowly and deliberately into a corner of the goal where it lay still as if quite tired out with the game goal yelled everyone and went completely mad moira sally and darrell swung each other round in a most undignified way for fifthformers bill and clarissa did a kind of barndance together and as for the lower school they began a most deafening chant that made mamzelle put her hands to her ears at once well done felici teeeeee well done felici teeeeee the whistle went for time the teams trooped off red in the face panting laughing and happy felicity was limping a little but so happy and proud that she wouldnt have noticed if she had limped with both feet darrell thumped her on the back you got the winning goal my girl you did the trick gosh im proud of you moira thumped her too im glad we put you into the team felicity youll be there for the rest of the term youve got teamspirit all right you play for your side all the time june was just nearby she heard what moira said and felt sure she was saying it so that she might hear she turned away sick at heart she might have been playing in the match she might even have shot that winning goal but felicity had instead june couldnt go and thump felicity on the back or congratulate her she was jealous felicity was too happy to notice little things like that she went off with her team and the wellsbrough girls to a smashing tea anyone seeing the piles of sandwiches buttered and jammy buns and slices of fruit cake piled high on big dishes would think that surely it would need twenty teams to eat all that but the two teams managed it all between them quite easily what fun it all was what a noise of shouting and laughter and wholehearted merriment schools smashing thought felicity munching her fourth jammy bun super wizard halfterm rehearsals began a tuesday and a friday came and another tuesday three rehearsals already i think its going well dont you said darrell to sally little marylou knows her part already she must have slaved at learning it because cinderella has almost more to say then anyone yes and shes going to look the part exactly said sally who would ever have thought that timid little marylou who was scared even of her own shadow when she was in the lower school would be able to take the principal part in a pantomime now shows what malory towers does to you said darrell still i suppose any good boardingschool does the same things makes you stand on your own feet rubs off your corners teaches you commonsense makes you accept responsibility it depends on the person said sally with a laugh it doesnt seem to have taught dear gwendoline mary much well i suppose there must be exceptions said darrell shes about the only one thats come up the school with us who doesnt seem to have learnt anything sensible at all it was a shock when we told her she and maureen might be twins said sally she really saw herself then as others see her anyway i think she is better than she was especially since shes had to go in for games and gym properly she doesnt like being a servant in the play said darrell with one of her wide grins nor does maureen theyve neither of them got a word to say in the play and not much to do either but as they both act so badly its just as well its an awful blow to their pride said sally i say bills going to be good isnt she shes the surly baron to the life as she strides about the stage in her ridingboots and slaps her whip against her side yes the play was really going quite well the fifthformers were almost sorry that it was halfterm weekend because it meant missing a rehearsal that friday still it would be lovely to see their people again darrell had a lot to tell her parents and so had felicity felicitys ankle had certainly been black and blue the next day and she showed it off proudly to the firstformers what a marvel to shoot a goal when you had an ankle like that felicity was quite the heroine of the lower school halfterm came and went all too quickly darrells father and mother came and had to listen to two excited girls both talking at once about pantomimes and matches were rehearsing well and my words sound fine and you should see marylou as cinderella cried darrell at the top of her voice and when i shot the winning goal i simply couldnt believe it but there was such a terrific noise of cheering and shouting that i had to shouted felicity at the same time as darrell her mother smiled what a pair four of bills brothers came to see her and her mother as well all on horseback it was the boys halfterm too and bill rode off happily taking clarissa with her what a lovely way to spend halfterm thought clarissa riding all day long and having a picnic lunch and tea gwendoline watched her go jealously if she had been sensible last term she could have been clarissas friend but she hadnt been sensible and now she was stuck with that awful maureen the dreadful thing was that maureens parents couldnt come at the last moment so maureen had no one to go out with she went to tell gwen oh gwen are you taking anyone out with you my parents cant come im so bitterly disappointed gwen stared at her crossly this would happen of course now she would have to have maureen tagging about with her all day long she introduced maureen to her mother and miss winter her old governess with a very bad grace mother this is maureen her parents havent come today so i said she could come with us of course of course said mrs lacy at once as usual she was dressed in far too fussy things with veils and scarves and bits and pieces flying everywhere poor child what a shame maureen warmed to mrs lacy here was someone she could talk to easily she gave her silly little laugh oh mrs lacy its so kind of you to let me come with you its my first term here you know and really i dont know what id have done without dear gwendoline shes really been a friend in need im sure she has said mrs lacy gwendoline is always so kind no wonder she is so popular and do you know the girls say gwen and i ought to be friends because were so alike chattered maureen tucking the rug round herself in the car weve both got golden hair and blue eyes and they say weve got the same ways too arent i lucky to have found a twin this was the kind of conversation that both miss winter and mrs lacy understood and liked miss winter made quite a fuss of maureen and gwen didnt like that at all gwen hoped that maureen would say nice things about her as she was taking her out for the day but maureen didnt maureen talked about herself the whole time she described her home her family her dogs her garden all the holidays she had ever had and all the illnesses gwen couldnt get a word in and after a time she fell silent and sulked what a bore maureen is how silly how selfish and conceited thought gwen sulkily what a silly affected laugh her mother made a most terrifying remark at lunchtime she beamed round at both girls you know except that maureens teeth stick out a little you two are really very alike youve got gwens lovely way of chattering all about your doings maureen and even your laugh is the same isnt it miss winter yes they really might be sisters agreed miss winter smiling kindly at the delighted maureen their ways are exactly the same and even their voices gwen felt quite sick she could hardly eat any dinner if her mother and miss winter who really adored her honestly thought that that awful boring conceited maureen was exactly like her then she gwen must be a really appalling person too no wonder she wasnt popular no wonder the girls laughed at her that day was a really terrible one for gwen to sit by somebody who was supposed to be like her to hear her own silly laugh uttered by maureen to listen to her everlasting dull tales about herself and see her own shallow insincere smile spread over maureens face was a horrible experience i shall never forget this thought poor gwen never ill be jolly careful how i behave in future and ill alter my laugh straightaway do i really laugh like that yes i do oh i do feel so ashamed gwens very quiet said miss winter at last anything wrong gwen oh poor gwen shes so disappointed because shes not chosen for cinderella said maureen swiftly well so were you retorted gwen you thought you were going to be moira said so girls girls dont talk like that to one another said mrs lacy shocked why i quite thought gwen was to be cinderella yes you said in your letter that most of the girls wanted you to be said miss winter why didnt they choose you gwen you would have made a fine cinderella its a shame for the same reason they didnt choose maureen i suppose said gwen sulkily they didnt think we were good enough well of course i couldnt possibly expect to be chosen its only my first term said maureen quickly you did expect to be said gwen oh no gwen dear said maureen and laughed her silly laugh it grated on gwens exasperated nerves i shall go mad if you laugh that laugh again she said savagely there was a surprised silence maureen broke it by laughing again and gwen clenched her fists poor gwen said maureen honestly mrs lacy it was a shame they didnt choose her it really did upset her and when we go to rehearsals its maddening for gwen to see marylou as cinderella whilst shes only a servant and says nothing at all not a single word in the whole of the play darling said mrs lacy comfortingly to the glowering gwen im so sorry i dont like to see mothers girl sad stop it mother said gwen lets change the subject mrs lacy was very hurt she turned away from this unusually surly gwen and began to talk to maureen being extra nice to her so as to show gwen that she was very displeased with her miss winter did the same and maureen blossomed out even more under this sunshine of flattery and rapt attention poor gwen had to listen to more and more tales of maureens life and to hear her silly laugh more and more often the day came to an end at last maureen thanked mrs lacy and miss winter prettily tucked her arm into gwens and went off waving ill look after gwen for you she called back well what a charming child and what a nice friend shed make for gwen said mrs lacy driving off its a pity gwens so upset about that cinderella business maureen must have been just as disappointed yes im afraid dear gwens not taking that very bravely said miss winter never mind she has that nice child maureen to set her a good example i think we ought to ask maureen to stay for a week or two in the christmas holidays said mrs lacy it would be so nice for gwen poor gwen if she had heard all this she would have been furious she was to get a great shock when her mothers letter came telling her she had invited maureen to stay for a week in the holidays she pulled her arm away from maureens as soon as the car drove out of sight she turned on her well i hope youve enjoyed spoiling my whole day you beast telling your awful tales and laughing your awful laugh and sucking up like anything ugh but gwen they said i was so like you said maureen looking puzzled they liked me how can i be so awful if im exactly like you gwen didnt tell her it was a thing she really couldnt bear to think about the dictator the days began to fly after halfterm darrell and sally got fits of panic quite regularly whenever they thought of the pantomime being performed to the parents at the end of term well never be ready groaned darrell no we never imagined thered be so much to do said sally seriously if only everyone knew their parts like marylou and mavis said darrell louella drives me mad she forgets the words of her songs every single time i wish we hadnt chosen her to be the fairygodmother now oh shell be all right on the night said sally she was like that in the play she was in last year never knew a word till the last night and then was quite perfect well i only hope youre right groaned darrell amusing the steady sally very much darrell went down into the dumps easily over her precious pantomime sally was very good for her she refused to think anyone was hopeless and was always ready with something comforting to say alicias marvellous isnt she she said after a pause looking up from the work she was doing yes shes a born demon said darrell with a giggle i get quite scared of her sometimes the way she leaps about the stage and yells and her conjuring is miraculous so is her juggling said sally and shes practised that demonsounding voice till it really sounds quite uncanny daphne joined in with a laugh yes and when she suddenly produces it in french class the amazement on mamzelles face is too good to be true alicias a scream said darrell shell be the best in the show i think there was a little silence theres only one thing that really worries me said darrell in a low voice and thats moira shes not hitting it off with betty at all or alicia either shes bossing them too much yes she cant seem to help it said sally but its idiotic to be bossy with people like betty and alicia after all bettys coproducer and alicias a terrific help to them darrell was right to worry about moira moira was intensely keen on getting the whole pantomime perfect and made everyone work like slaves under her command the girls resented it louella purposely forgot her words in order to annoy moira bill purposely came in at the wrong side each time to make her shout and moira couldnt see that she was handling things in the wrong way she was a wonderful organizer certainly she had gone into every detail worked out every scene with darrell proved herself most ingenious and given very wise advise but she did it all in the wrong way she was aggressive and opinionated she contradicted people flatly and she found fault too much and praised too little youre a dictator moira bill informed her at one rehearsal i dont take kindly to dictators nor does anyone else here if you think you can produce a firstclass pantomime without giving a few orders and finding a few faults youre wrong said moira furiously i dont said bill mildly i never said i did but you can do all that without being a dictator you sit up there like a warlord and chivy us all along unmercifully i quite expect to be sent to prison sometimes lets get on said darrell afraid that moira was going to blow up arguing always wasted so much time well take that bit again mavis begin your song mavis sang and a silence fell what a lovely voice she had low and pure and sweet that would make the audience gasp it wasnt often that a schoolgirl had a voice like that we shall miss her when she leaves and goes to study music and singing at the college of music thought darrell maviss song came to an end and she stepped back to let buttons come on and do her bit yes rehearsals were hard work but they were fun too sally and darrell began to feel more confidence as time went on darrell surprised herself at times when she suddenly saw something wrong with the lines of the play and hurried to alter them i know just whats wrong and whats right now she thought as she scribbled new lines i adore doing this pantomime feeling its mine because i wrote it all i want to do a play next could i write one perhaps just a short one for next term shall i ever ever be a wellknown playwright gwen was a sulky actor she hated being stuck at the back in the chorus dressed as a servant with nothing to say or do by herself maureen was much more cheerful about it she drove gwen nearly mad by some of the things she said of course i dont mind having such a small insignificant part she said but its different for you gwen youve been here for years and ive not been even one term you ought to have had a good part i couldnt expect one gwen growled i shall write and tell your mother you are awfully good as a servant went on maureen i do think its so kind of her to ask me to stay wont it be fun to be together so much gwen in the hols gwen didnt answer she was beginning to be a little afraid of maureen maureen was silly and affected but she had a cunning and sly side to her nature too so had gwen of course she recognized it easily in maureen because it was in herself too that was the dreadful part of this forced friendship with maureen it was like being friends with yourself and knowing all the false silly sly things that went on in your own mind gwen did try to alter herself a bit so that she wouldnt be like maureen she stopped her silly laugh and her wide false smile she stopped talking about herself too to her enormous annoyance nobody seemed to notice it as a matter of fact they took so little notice of her at all that if she had suddenly grown a moustache and worn ridingboots they wouldnt have bothered who wanted to pay any attention to gwen she had never done anything to make herself liked or trusted so the best thing to do was to ignore her and ignore her they did though poor gwen was doing her best to be sensible and likeable now she had left it a bit too late two more weeks went by and then suddenly a row flared up at a rehearsal it began over a very silly little thing indeed as big rows often do alicia took it into her head to evolve a kind of demonchant whenever she appeared or disappeared on the stage she only thought of it a few minutes before rehearsal and hadnt time to tell darrell or sally so she thought she would just introduce the weird little chant without warning and she did she appeared with her sudden surprising leaps chanting eerily oowoola woola riminyree oowoola moira rapped loudly the rehearsal stopped alicia what on earths that its not in the script as you very well know of course i know said alicia annoyed as always by moiras unnecessarily sharp tone i hadnt time to ask darrell to put it in i only thought of it just now well we cant insert new things now said moira coldly and in any case its not for you to suggest extraordinary chants like that if wed wanted one wed have got darrell to write one in look here moira said alicia losing her temper rapidly tm not a firstformer im darrell interrupted hastily moira i think thats really a good idea of alicias what do you think betty i never thought of a chant like that for the demon but it does sound very demonlike and yes said betty anxious to go against moira and back up her friend alicia yes its a jolly fine idea well have it moira went up in smoke at once in a way that a demon king himself might have envied she stood up glowering you only say that betty because youre alicias friend and shucks said betty rudely moira went on without stopping and darrell only says it because she always backs up alicia too well im chief producer and im going to have my way over this therell be no demonchant get on with the rehearsal alicia was white im not performing any more tonight she said in a cold and angry voice youre quite stealing the performance yourself arent you moira wonderful demon queen youd make with that look on your face it was so exactly what moira did look like that there were quite a lot of guffaws alicia walked off the stage darrell was petrified sally took charge whos on next come on bill bill came on the wrong side as usual determined to flout moira too she stalked in her hands in her breeches pockets she always wore riding things when she rehearsed she said it made her feel more baronial bill you know perfectly well you dont come in that side shouted moira who also knew perfectly well that it was just bills way of showing that she sided with alicia bill stood there like a dummy go back and come in the right side ordered moira harshly no im going riding said bill quite simply and mildly just like that she walked off humming and moira heard her calling to clarissa clarissa come on im not feeling fit for acting tonight i want to do something energetic this is silly said betty everyone walking off let me take charge moira youre rubbing them up the wrong way tonight moira shoved her roughly aside she had a wicked temper when she was really roused the same kind of temper as her sister bridget who liked to smash things up if she really felt mad im going on she said between her teeth once we let things get out of hand were done well take the servants chorus the chorus came on giggling and ready to play up moira if they could they all resented her hard ways even though they admitted that she could get things done and done well moira picked on gwen and maureen at once you two youre not singing oh no youre not so dont say you were youre pretty awful every time and youd better pull your socks up now or you wont even be in the chorus ill get some thirdformers instead i say do shut up moira said betty in a low tone you know youll never do much with those two and certainly not if you go for them like that moira took not the slightest notice did you hear what i said gwen and maureen she called come out in front and sing by yourselves so that i shall see if you do know the words gwen hesitated she longed to cheek moira or walk off as bill had done but she was afraid of moiras sharp tongue very well then stop where you are and sing there said moira suddenly realizing that she couldnt very well go and drag gwen and maureen to the front by main force music irene irene looking very glum and disgusted played the servants chorus gwens reedy voice piped up and maureen mumbled the words too stop said moira and the music stopped you dont know the words and you dont know the tune and it is about the seventh rehearsal youre the worst in the whole play both of you gwen and maureen were furious at being humiliated like this in front of everyone but still they dared not answer moira back they were both little cowards when it came to anything like that they stood mute and gwen felt the usual easy tears welling up in her eyes needless to say the rehearsal was not a success everyone sighed with relief when the supperbell went moira went off scowling many of the girls sent scowls after her in imitation beast said daphne she gets worse shes worried because she has so many rehearsals to take and so much to do said darrell trying to stop the general grumbling it made things so difficult if the girls didnt come willingly and cheerfully to rehearsal it was her pantomime her masterpiece she couldnt let their resentful feelings for moira spoil it all saint darrell called betty in delight darrell grinned im no saint she said im as hot and bothered as everyone else but whats the good of messing up the show just because weve got a producer who cant keep her temper lets chuck her out suggested somebody weve got betty and theres you and sally and alicia at hand to help we dont need moira now the donkeywork is done we cant possibly chuck her out said darrell decidedly it would be mean after shes got it more or less into shape i do honestly think shes irritable because shes so interested in getting it perfect and every little thing upsets her give her another chance all right agreed everyone but only one more chance darrell the anonymous letters darrell spoke to moira rather nervously about the failure of the last rehearsal we all know youre a bit overworked because youve done so much for the show already she began oh do be quiet you sound like saint catherine said moira with a glance at the nearby catherine shes already tried to make a hundred silly excuses for me i hate people who suck up i wasnt angry because i was tired or overworked i was angry because people like alicia and bill and gwen and maureen were defiant and rude and silly and lazy and didnt back me up now you know well look moira for goodness sake be more understanding and patient next time said darrell holding tight on to her own temper she felt it suddenly rising up oh dear it would never do for two of them to get furious will you let me get on with my french or not asked moira in a dangerous voice darrell gave it up the next rehearsal was a little better but not much darrell had insisted on writing in alicias chant and moira had frowned but said very little after all the script was darrells business moira didnt find any fault with either alicia or bill this time she didnt need to both were admirable and knew their parts well bill at darrells request came on the stage from the right side and all was well but other things went wrong other people came in for criticism and blame the courtiers were ordered to sing their song four times the servants didnt bow properly or curtsy at the right moment buttons was talking when she shouldnt be moira didnt lose her temper but she was unpleasant and hard she fought to keep herself in hand she was headgirl of the fifth she was chief producer of the show she had done all the donkeywork and licked things into shape she meant to have her own way and to have things as she liked and she wasnt going to say please and thank you and smile and clap as that idiot of a betty did there was a lot more grumbling afterwards darrell and sally began to feel panicky suppose the pantomime went to pieces instead of getting perfect and then another horrid thing began it was the coming of the anonymous letters spiteful hateful letters with no name at the end only one girl in the form got them and that was moira she got the first one on a rehearsal day she slit open the envelope and read it in the commonroom she exclaimed aloud in disgust whats up said darrell moira threw the letter across to her read that she said darrell read it and was horrified this was the letter if only you knew what people really think of the headgirl of the fifth badtempered unjust bossy if you left at the end of the term it wouldnt be too soon for me what a disgusting thing said darrell in dismay who could possibly have written it its all in printed capitals to hide the writers own handwriting take no notice of it moira the only place for anonymous letters is the fire moira tossed the note into the fire and went on with her work nobody could tell if she was upset or not but everyone wondered who had written such a horrible letter the next one arrived the following day there it was on top of moiras pile of books addressed in the same printed writing she opened it unthinking so you got my first letter i hope you enjoyed it wouldnt you love to know what the girls say about you it would make your ears burn youve certainly got the distinction of being the most unpopular girl in the school but who wants that distinction certainly not me heres another of them said moira in a casual tone and gave it to darrell and sally they read it dismayed by the spite that lay behind the few lines but moira who can it be said darrell oh dear its horrible anonymous letters are always written by the lowest of the low i feel and its awful to think theres someone like that at malory towers i dont care said moira but she did care she remembered the spiteful words and worried over them in bed she worried over the rehearsals too she badly wanted them to go as well as they had done at first but poor moira always found it very difficult to give up her own opinions and ways she couldnt alter herself she expected everyone else to adapt themselves to her and they wouldnt of course dont open any more notes said sally to moira seeing her look rather white the next day you know which they are chuck them in the fire you can tell by the printing on the envelope what they are but the next one wasnt in an envelope it was stuffed in moiras lacrosse locker down in the changingroom it was actually inside her right boot she took it out and saw immediately what was written for the note this time had no envelope whats a dictator ask moira dont ask me just that and no more moira crumpled up the note fiercely this horrible letterwriter she knew just what to say to hurt moira most she told darrell she didnt really want to tell anyone but somehow she felt she must put a brave front on the matter and by telling about the letters and making them public she felt that would show the writer she didnt care she laughed as she showed darrell the note quite short this time she said but not exactly sweet oh its hateful said darrell we must find out who it is we must stop it ive never never known such a thing happen all the time ive been at malory towers poisonous malicious letters moira why arent you more upset i should be absolutely miserable if i got these even if i knew they werent true she added hurriedly you neednt add that said moira with a faint smile they are true actually more than one of you have called me a dictator you know and bossy and badtempered darrell stared at her in horror moira you wouldnt think i did it would you or sally or alicia or moira shrugged her shoulders and turned away darrell stared after her in dismay she turned to sally we must find out who it is we cant have moira suspecting everyone of us gosh what will the rehearsals be like if this kind of thing goes on the fourth note didnt get to the person it was intended for it was certainly slipped unfolded into a book on moiras desk but the book happened to be one that miss potts had lent moira about playproduction and having finished with it moira handed it back to miss potts without discovering the anonymous note inside so it was miss potts who found it it slipped out to the floor in the room she shared with mamzelle she picked it up and read it are you worrying about these notes there are plenty more to come ive got quite a few more names to call you and adjectives that will suit you how about the demon queen you look like a demon sometimes a domineering bossy scowling glowering one too at least thats how you appear to me miss potts was amazed at this note she read it over again who was it meant for she turned it over and saw a name printed on the back moira moira she said so somebody slipped it into the book i lent her an anonymous note and a particularly spiteful one who in the world is low enough to think out things like these she examined the writing it gave her no clue because all the letters were in capitals very carefully done miss potts frowned as she stood there like all decent people she thought that anonymous letterwriters were either mad or cowardly they didnt dare to say what they thought openly they had to do it secretly and loathsomely she sent for moira moira told her about the other notes have you any idea at all who sent these asked miss potts moira hesitated yes but im not sure about it so i cant say go and get darrell and sally too said miss potts thinking she could probably get more out of them this has got to be stopped once a person of this sort gets away with a thing like this theres no knowing what theyll do next sally and darrell came they read the note darrell looked sick horrible she said who has written them demanded miss potts all three girls looked away well said miss potts impatiently this is not a thing to be backward about is it dont you agree that it must be stopped oh yes said darrell well then if you have any idea who has written them tell me said miss potts i can then go and tackle them at once well you see it might be one of quite a number of people said darrell a number of people said miss potts disbelievingly are you trying to tell me that there are a number of people who hate moira enough to write her notes like this there was a silence miss potts clicked in exasperation has moira so many enemies and why i have had no complaints of her as headgirl why do you think so many people hate moira this was very awkward and most embarrassing darrell and sally didnt know what in the world to say moira came to their rescue she was pale and looked strained ill tell you who it might be miss potts she said it might be gwen it might be maureen it might even be alicia no said both sally and darrell together moira went on it might be catherine it might be it might be bridget bridget do you mean your sister in the fourth asked miss potts amazed moira nodded looking miserable she wouldnt look at sally or darrell miss potts turned to them what do you think of all this she demanded well it could be any of those except alicia said darrell alicia does feel angry with moira because of something that happened at a rehearsal but alicias not underhanded if she wanted to tell moira all those things shed say them out loud probably in front of everyone too its certainly not alicia i agree with you said miss potts we ran certainly rule out alicia that still leaves four people that moira thinks detest her enough to write these notes moira its rather dreadful to feel you have four people around you that might regard you with such bitter feelings isnt it what can you have been doing to arouse them moira said nothing she knew perfectly well why all four had cause to hate her she had sneered at gwen and maureen unmercifully and had humiliated them too on the stage at last weeks rehearsal she had called catherine a doormat and sneered too at her for her annoying selfsacrificing ways and had shoved her to one side in spite of all the hundreds of things catherine had done for her as for bridget well there never had been any love lost between the sisters bridget hated her she was sure of it and hadnt bridget threatened her not so long ago what had she said i warn you moira youll be sorry for this i team you well it might be catherine it might be gwen or maureen and it might be bridget it probably wasnt alicia because these letters came from a coward and nobody could call alicia that who did write those beastly letters and how could they ever find out things happen all sorts of things happened that week at the next rehearsal there was another flareup between alicia and moira a really bad one that ended in alicia resigning from the show betty promptly resigned too as coproducer it was a terrible blow to sally and darrell we cant do without you alicia wailed darrell well never never get a demon king like you and all your wonderful juggling and conjuring and leaping about too youll ruin the whole thing if you resign if i resign i have resigned said alicia looking calm and unruffled but inwardly seething with anger disappointment and misery at seeing darrell so upset im sorry it affects you too but im not working with moira any more and nothing in the world will make me go back into the pantomime now no not even if moira herself resigned and came and apologized darrell knew that moira would never do that she was as unbending as alicia was obstinate talk about the immovable meeting the irresistible she groaned oh alicia for my sake withdraw your resignation why its only three weeks now till the pantomime is presented i cant rewrite it and cut out your parts you come in so often darrell im honestly sorry said alicia looking harassed now but you know i never go back on my word its my pride now thats in the way nothing in the world would make me knuckle under to moira and thats what i should be doing if i withdrew my resignation darrell stared hopelessly at alicia defiant obstinate strongwilled alicia nobody could do anything with her once she had made up her mind she turned away amazed and furious to find sudden tears in her eyes but she was so bitterly disappointed her lovely pantomime and such a wonderful demon king and all that juggling and conjuring out of it now no one but alicia could do that sally went with darrell trying to comfort her she too was bitterly disappointed and sighed when she thought of all the rewriting there would be to do and another demon king to find and train in such a short time but darrell felt it most it was her first big job the first time she had tried her hand at writing something worth while and now it was spoilt moira was obstinate too she would not talk about the matter at all nor would she resign all i can say is im sorry its happened but it was alicia who blew up and resigned not me she said and not one word more would she say about it it was mamzelle who created the next excitement she sat down at her desk in miss potts room one day and announced her intention of turning it out about time too said miss potts dryly youll probably find the year before lasts exam papers there i should think i never saw such a collection of rubbish in anyones desk in my life ha miss potts you wish to be funny said mamzelle huffily no said miss potts merely truthful mamzelle snorted and took hold of about a hundred loose papers in her desk she lifted them out and they immediately fell apart and slithered all over the floor one booklet floated to miss potts feet she looked at it with interest for there was a very brightly coloured picture on the cover showing a conjurer doing tricks new tricks old tricks tricks to play on your enemies tricks to play on your friends she read out loud she glanced at mamzelle in astonishment since when did you think of taking up tricks to play she inquired i do not think of it said mamzelle depositing another hundred papers on the floor tiens here is the programme of the play the thirdformers gave six years ago what did i tell you said miss potts youll probably find the speeches made at the opening of the first term at malory towers if you look a little further into your desk do not tizz me said mamzelle i do not like being tizzed im not teasing said miss potts im quite serious i say where did you get these trick and conjuring lists from look at this one im sure its got in it all the tricks that alicia and betty ever played on you mamzelle took the booklets she was soon completely absorbed in them she chuckled she laughed she said tiens and oh la la a dozen times miss potts went on with her work she was used to mamzelles little ways mamzelle had never read anything so enthralling in all her life as these booklets that described tricks of all sorts and kinds she was completely lost in them she read of machines that could apparently saw peoples fingers in half without hurting them cigarettes with glowing ends that were not really alight ink spots and jamclots that could be placed on tablecloths to deceive annoyed mothers or teachers into thinking they were real the booklets blandly described these and a hundred others mamzelle was absolutely fascinated she came to one trick that made her laugh out loud ah now listen miss potts she began no mamzelle said miss potts sternly ive twentythree disgraceful maths papers to mark that the first form have had the nerve to give in today and i do not want to listen to your recital of childish tricks mamzelle sighed and went back to the booklets she read over again the thing that had so intrigued her there were two photographs with the description of the trick one showed a smiling man with ordinary teeth the other showed the same man with trick teeth he looked horrible mamzelle read the description over again these trick teeth are cleverly made of celluloid and are shaped to fit neatly over the wearers own teeth but project forwards and downwards and so alter the expression of the wearers face considerably as soon as he smiles giving a really terrifying and exceedingly strange appearance mamzelle studied the photographs she tried to imagine herself wearing teeth like that and suddenly flashing them at the girls with a smile ha they had dared her to do a trick on them mamzelle had a very very good mind to write for this teeth trick perhaps she would wear them at a lacrosse match out in the field or maybe take the girls for a walk and keep showing her trick teeth mamzelle shook with laughter ha so many treeks had those bad girls played on her it was time their poor old mamzelle played a treek on them too how they would be astonished how they would stare how they would laugh afterwards mamzelle scuffled about among her untidy papers and found her writingpad in her slanting french handwriting she wrote for the teeth trick and sent a cheque with the letter she was delighted she would not tell even miss potts no i will not tell her i will suddenly smile at her like this said mamzelle to herself and did a sudden fierce grin and i shall look so strange that she will start back in fright at my horrible teeth mamzelle finished the letter and then casually looked through the other trick booklets before throwing them away and it was then she came across the note it was written in capitals very carefully it was not a nice note it was headed to felicity you think youre so good at games dont you well its only because darrell favours you that youre ever put into any games everyone knows that it was not signed at all here is a nasty little note said mamzelle in disgust and tossed it to miss potts miss potts recognized the printed letters at once they were exactly the same as those on the anonymous letters sent to moira where did you get this she asked sharply i found it in this trick booklet said mamzelle startled whose is the booklet where did you get it demanded miss potts i took it from that bad little junes desk said mamzelle very interesting said miss potts she got up and went to the door she sent a girl to find moira sally and darrell they came looking surprised i think ive found the writer of those notes said miss potts but before i tackle her i want to know if shes any reason to dislike you moira its june in the first form june exclaimed everyone amazed moira looked at miss potts yes i suppose shed think she had cause to dislike me she said i ticked her off because she was cheeky about not being put into the wellsbrough match told her she had no teamspirit i also made her apologize to me for daring to say in front of me that darrell had put felicity into the match out of favouritism because she was her sister miss potts nodded thank you it is june then im afraid ill see her now send her to me will you im rather afraid this is a matter for miss grayling we are not pleased with june and it wouldnt take much to have her sent away from here this is a particularly loathsome act of hers to send out anonymous letters june came looking defiant but scared she had not been told why she was wanted june i have called you here on a very very serious matter said miss potts i find that you have been writing detestable anonymous letters dont attempt to deny it you will only make things worse your only hope is to confess honestly why did you do it june had no idea how miss potts knew all this she went white but still looked bold i suppose you mean the ones to moira she said yes i did write them and she deserved them everyone hates her thats beside the point said miss potts the point we have to keep to is that there is a girl in this school a girl in the first form who is guilty of something for which in later years she could be sent to prison a thing that as a rule rarely begins until a girl is much much older than you because it is only depraved and cowardly characters who attempt this underhand stabinthedark kind of thing she paused her eyes bored like gimlets into the petrified june we call this kind of thing poisonpen writing when the writers are grown up she went on and they are held in universal loathing and hatred considered the lowest of the low did you know that no gasped june i would not talk to you in this serious manner if there were not also other things i dislike very much in you said miss potts still in the same hard driving voice your disobedience your defiance your aggressiveness your total lack of respect for anyone you may think it is admirable and brave and grand it isnt it is the sign of a strong character gone wrong and on top of all that you have shown yourself a coward because only a coward ever writes anonymous letters junes knees were shaking miss potts saw them but she took no notice if ever anyone wanted a good shaking up it was june this matter must go to miss grayling she said come with me now you may be interested to know that it was because mamzelle found this note to felicity that i discovered who was the writer of the other letters june took a quick glance at the note to felicity i didnt give it to her she said i meant to and then i didnt i must have left it somewhere in a book our sins always find us out said miss potts solemnly always now come with me miss potts shall i be be expelled asked june a june no longer bold and brazen but a june as deflated as when her balloons had been suddenly pricked that day in class that rests with miss grayling said miss potts and she got up come with me the news went round the fifth form rapidly the letters were written by june the little beast shes gone to see miss grayling i bet shell be expelled shes no good anyway alicia listened in horror her own cousin she disliked june as much as anybody else but this was her own cousin in terrible trouble and disgrace she was very distressed its a disgrace for our whole family she thought and what will junes people say theyll never get over it if shes expelled theyll think i ought to have kept an eye on june more and perhaps i should but she really is such a little beast felicity came tearing up to the fifthform commonroom that evening she was in tears darrell she said hardly waiting to knock oh darrell junes going to be expelled she is really miss grayling told her so oh darrell i dont like her but i cant bear her to be expelled surely shes not as bad as all that everyone in the fifthform commonroom sat up with a jerk at this news expelled it was ages since anyone had been sent in disgrace from malory towers and a firstformer too alicia sat silent biting her lips her own cousin how terrible poor felicity began to sob junes got to go tomorrow miss grayling is telephoning her people tonight shes packing now this minute shes terribly terribly upset she keeps saying shes not a coward and she didnt know it was so awful she keeps on and on darrell cant you do something suppose it was me darrell wouldnt you do something the fifth form were aghast at all this they pictured june packing bewildered and frightened miss grayling must have had very bad reports of her to make her go to this length she must have thought there was no good in june at all not to give her one more chance darrell sally alicia cant you go and ask miss grayling to give her a chance cried felicity a big tear running down her nose and falling on to the carpet i tell you shes awfully upset moira had been listening with the others so it was june she looked round at gwen maureen and catherine three of the girls she had suspected it was a load off her heart that it wasnt any of them it was an even greater relief that it wasnt bridget her sister but suppose it had been it would have been bridget who was packing then bridget who would have been so awfully upset it would have been her own parents who would be so sad and miserable because a child of theirs had been expelled moira got up ill go and see miss grayling she said i wont let her expel june ill ask her to give her another chance after all ive been pretty awful myself this term and its not to be wondered at if a mere firstformer hated me and descended to writing those letters there was quite a lot of truth in them june deserves to be punished but not so badly as that she went out of the room leaving behind a deep silence felicity ran with her and actually took her hand moira squeezed it oh moira people say youre hard and unkind but youre not youre not said little felicity youre kind and generous and good and i shall tell every single person in the first form so nobody ever knew what happened between miss grayling moira and june for not one of the three ever said but the result was that june was sent to unpack her things again very subdued and thankful and that moira came back to find a commonroom full of admiration and goodwill towards her its all right said moira smiling round a little nervously junes let off shes unpacking again she wont forget this lesson in a hurry alicia spoke in a rather shaky voice thanks most awfully moira youve been most frightfully decent over this i cant ever repay you it means an awful lot to me to know that my cousin wont be expelled i er i want to apologize for resigning from the pantomime if if youll let me withdraw my resignation id like to this was a very difficult thing for alicia to do alicia who had said that nothing in the world would make her withdraw her resignation or apologize well something had made her and she was decent enough and brave enough not to shirk the awkwardness and difficulty but to say it all straight out in public everyone went suddenly mad darrell gave a squeal of delight and rushed to alicia sally thumped her on the back mavis sang loudly irene went to the piano and played a triumphant march from the pantomime bill and clarissa galloped round the room as if they were on horseback and little marylou thumped on the top of the table moira laughed suddenly what had happened to all the spite and malice and beastliness what had happened to the squabbles and quarrels and worries they were gone in an instant blown to smithereens by moiras instinctive generoushearted action in going to save june everythings right again sang mavis and marylou thumped the table in time everythings right everythings right hurray mamzelles treek certainly everything was much better now alicia went to see june and addressed a good many sound and sensible words to that much chastened and subdued firstformer it would be a long time before june forgot them if she ever did she didnt think she ever would moira was basking in a newfound admiration and liking that made her much more amenable to the others suggestions and rehearsals became a pleasure even the sulky bridget came smiling into the fifthform commonroom to say she was glad moira had saved june it makes me feel you might do the same for me moira she said well i would said moira shortly and bridget went out pleased mamzelle had been very shocked and upset about everything but it is terrible how could june do such a thing and moira moira that hard moira to go and save her like that miss potts never would i have thought that girl had a generous action in her miss potts it shocks me that i know so little of my girls oh youll get over the shock said miss potts cheerfully and youll have plenty more well well the girls have cheered up a lot the fifthformers i mean they really were a worried miserable quarrelsome crew last week i was seriously thinking of playing a trick on them to cheer them up mamzelle looked at miss potts in her desk were the trick teeth which had arrived that morning miss potts must not play a trick if a trick was to be played she mamzelle would play it ah yes to cheer up the poor girls that would be a kind act to do there was a housematch that afternoon north tower girls against west tower mamzelle decided she would appear as a spectator at the match with her teeth ah those teeth mamzelle had tried them on they might have been made for her they fitted over her own teeth but were longer and projected slightly forward they were not noticeable at all of course when she had her mouth shut but when she smiled ah how sinister she looked how strange how fierce mamzelle had shocked even herself when she had put in the extraordinary teeth and smiled at herself in the glass tiens she said and clutched her dressingtable i am a monster i am truly terrible with these teeth that afternoon she put them in carefully over her others and went downstairs to the playingfields wrapping herself up warmly in coat scarf and turban darrell saw her first and made room for her on the form she was on thank you said mamzelle and smiled at darrell darrell got a tremendous shock mamzelle had suddenly looked altogether different quite terrifying darrell stared at her but mamzelle had quickly shut her mouth the next one to get the smile was little felicity who came up with susan mamzelle smiled at her oh said felicity in sudden horror and susan stared mamzelle shut her mouth a desire to laugh was gradually working up inside her no no she must not laugh laughing spoilt tricks she did not smile for some time trying to conquer her urge to laugh miss linnie the sewingmistress passed by and nodded at mamzelle mamzelle could not resist showing her the teeth she smiled miss linnie looked amazed and horrified she walked on quickly was that really mamzelle she wondered no it must have been someone else what awful teeth mamzelle felt that she must get up and walk about it was too cold to sit and besides she so badly wanted to laugh again ah now she understood why the girls laughed so much and so helplessly when they played their mischievous tricks on her she walked along the field and met bill and clarissa they smiled at her and she smiled back bill stood still thunderstruck clarissa hadnt really noticed clarissa said bill when mamzelle had gone whats the matter with mamzelle this afternoon she looks horrible horrible how asked clarissa in great surprise well her teeth didnt you see her teeth asked bill they seem to have changed or something simply awful teeth she had long and stickingout clarissa was astonished lets walk back and smile at her again she said so back they went but mamzelle saw their inquisitive looks and was struggling against a fit of laughter she would not open her mouth to smile matron came up oh mamzelle do you know where gwen is shes darned her navy gym pants with grey wool again i want her indoors this afternoon mamzelle could not resist smiling at matron matron stared as if she couldnt believe her eyes mamzelle shut her mouth matron backed away a little looking rather alarmed gwens over there said mamzelle her extra teeth making her words sound rather thick matron looked even more alarmed at the thick voice and disappeared in a hurry mamzelle saw her address a few words to miss potts miss potts looked round for mamzelle aha thought mamzelle matron has told her i look terrible soon miss potts will come to look at my smile i shall laugh i know i shall i shall laugh without stopping soon miss potts came up eyeing mamzelle carefully she got a quick glimpse of the famous teeth then mamzelle clamped her mouth shut she would explode if she didnt keep her mouth shut she pulled her scarf across her face trying to hide her desire to laugh do you feel the cold today mamzelle asked miss potts anxiously you er you havent got toothache have you a peculiar wild sound came from mamzelle it startled miss potts considerably but actually it was only mamzelle trying to stifle a squeal of laughter she rushed away hurriedly miss potts stared after her uncomfortably what was up with mamzelle mamzelle strolled down the field by herself trying to recover she gave a few loud gulps that made two secondformers wonder if she was going to be ill poor mamzelle felt she couldnt flash her teeth at anyone for a long time for if she did she would explode like irene she decided to go in she turned her steps towards the school and then to her utter horror she saw miss grayling the head mistress bearing down on her with two parents mamzelle gave an anguished look and hurried on as fast as she could oh theres mamzelle said miss graylings pleasant voice mamzelle will you meet mrs jennings and mrs petton mamzelle was forced to go to them she lost all desire for laughter at once the trick teeth suddenly stopped being funny and became monstrosities to be got rid of at once but how she couldnt spit them into her handkerchief with people just about to shake hands with her mrs jennings held out her hand ive heard so much about you mamzelle dupont she said and what tricks the naughty girls play on you too mamzelle tried to smile without opening her mouth at all and the effect was rather peculiar a sort of suppressed snarl mrs jennings looked surprised mamzelle tried to make up for her lack of smile by shaking mrs jennings hand very vigorously indeed she did the same with mrs petton who turned out to be a talkative mother who wanted to know exactly how her daughter teresa was getting on in french she smiled gaily at mamzelle while she talked and mamzelle found it agony not to smile back she had to produce the suppressed snarl again smiling with her mouth shut and her lips firmly over her teeth miss grayling was startled by this peculiar smile she examined mamzelle closely mamzelles voice was not quite as usual either it sounded thick as if her mouth is too full of teeth thought miss grayling little knowing that she had hit on the exact truth at last the mothers went mamzelle shook hands with them most vigorously once more and was so relieved at parting from them that she forgot herself and gave them a broad smile they got a full view of the terrible teeth miss grayling too the head stared in the utmost horror what had happened to mamzelles teeth had she had her old ones out were these a new false set but how terrible they were they made her look like the wolf in the tale of red riding hood the two mothers turned their heads away quickly at the sight of the teeth they hurried off with miss grayling who hardly heard what they said she was so concerned about mamzelles teeth she determined to send for mamzelle that evening and ask her about them really she couldnt allow any of her staff to go about with teeth like that they were monstrous hideous mamzelle was so thankful to see the last of the mothers that she hurried straight into a little company of fifthformers going back to the school some to do their piano practice and some to have a lesson in elocution hallo mamzelle said mavis are you coming back to school mamzelle smiled the fifthformers got a dreadful shock they stared in silent horror the teeth had slipped a little and now looked rather like fangs they gave mamzelle a most sinister bigbadwolf look mamzelle saw their alarm and astonishment laughter surged back into her she felt it swelling up and up she gasped she gulped she roared she sank on to a bench and cried with helpless laughter she remembered matrons face and miss graylings and the faces of the two mothers the more she thought of them the more helplessly she laughed the girls stood round more alarmed than ever what was the matter with mamzelle what was this enormous joke mamzelles teeth slipped out altogether fell on to her lap and then to the ground the girls stared at them in the utmost amazement and then looked at mamzelle she now looked completely normal with just her own small teeth showing in her laughing face she laughed on and on when she saw her trick teeth lying there before her it is a treek she squeaked at last wiping her eyes with her handkerchief did you not give me a dare did you not tell me to do a treek on you i have done one with the teeth they are treek teeth oh la la i must laugh again oh my sides oh my back she swayed to and fro laughing the girls began to laugh too mamzelle rougier came up astonished to see the other french mistress laughing so much what is the matter she asked without a smile on her face irene did one of her explosions she pointed to the teeth on the ground mamzelle wore them for a trick and theyve fallen out and given the game away she went off into squeals of laughter again and the other girls joined in mamzelle rougier looked cold and disapproving i see no joke she said it is not funny teeth on the grass it is time to see the dentist when that happens she walked off and her speech and disapproving face sent everyone into fits of laughter again it was altogether a most successful afternoon for mamzelle and the treek story flew all through the school immediately mamzelle suddenly found herself extremely popular except with the staff a little undignified dont you think said miss williams not a thing to do too often mamzelle said miss potts making up her mind to remove the trick booklets from mamzelles desk at the first opportunity glad youve lost those frightful teeth said matron bluntly dont do that again without warning me mamzelle i got the shock of my life but the girls loved mamzelle for her treek and every class in the school from top to bottom worked twice as hard after she had played her truly astonishing treek a grand show the end of the term was coming near the pantomime was almost ready everything had gone smoothly since the big row as it was called moira had softened down a lot pleased by the unstinted admiration of the girls for her act in going down to the head to speak for june alicia was back as demon king as good as ever complete with eerie chant betty was back as coproducer everyone knew her part perfectly belindas scenery was almost finished she had produced all kinds of wonderful effects helped by the properties pop had out in the barn relics of other plays and pantomimes she painted fast and furiously and pop had helped to evolve a magnificent coach which they had somehow managed to adorn with gilt paint it looks marvellous said clarissa in awe i suppose merrylegs couldnt pull it belinda hed be awfully good i know i daresay but if you think im going to have thunder and merrylegs galloping about madly all over my precious stage you can think again said belinda adding a final touch of gilt to a wheel all the actors knew the songs both words and music the costumes were ready janet had done well and everyone had a costume that fitted and suited the wearer perfectly cinderella looked enchanting in her ballgown a dress whose full skirt floated out mistily glittering with hundreds of sequins patiently sewn on by the firstformers in the sewingclass the whole school was interested in the pantomime because so many of them had either helped to paint the scenery or make the props or sew the costumes they were all looking forward tremendously to the show the next week gwen and maureen looked enviously at marylou in her ballgown how they wished they could wear a frock like that how beautiful they would look catherine gazed at little marylou too she had got very fond of her marylou was gentle and timid and always grateful for anything that catherine did for her she didnt call her a doormat or laugh at her selfsacrificing ways she didnt even call her saint catherine as the others did catherine had stopped being a doormat for the form she had felt angry and sore about it but she somehow couldnt stop waiting on people and marylou didnt mind so she fussed over her and altered her frock and praised her and heard her words and altogether she made life very easy for marylou who was really very nervous about taking the principal part in the show now the days were spinning away fast friday saturday sunday monday two more days left one more day and now its the day cried darrell the next morning rushing to the window and its a heavenly day so all the parents will get down without any bother gosh i feel so excited i dont know what im doing well you certainly dont know the difference between my sponge and yours said sally taking her own sponge away from the excited darrell come on get dressed idiot weve got a lot to do today the parents arrived at teatime tea was at four the pantomime was due to begin at halfpast five and went on till halfpast seven then there came a grand supper and after that the parents went some to their homes if they were within driving distance some to hotels the tea was grand and the first and secondformers scurried about with plates and dishes helping themselves to the meringues and eclairs whenever they could the fifthformers slipped away to dress at halfpast four darrell peeped at the stage how big it looked how grand it was already set for the first scene with a great fireplace for cinderella to sit by darrell felt solemn she had written this pantomime if it was a failure she would never never write anything again and you never knew it might be a terrible flop sally came up she saw darrells solemn face and smiled its going to be a terrific success she said you just see and youll deserve it darrell you really have worked hard so have you said darrell loyally but sally knew that the creative part had all been darrells the words and the songs had all come out of darrells own imagination sally hadnt much imagination she was sensible and sturdy and stolid she admired darrell for her quick creativeness without envying her the school orchestra were in their places tuning up they had learnt all irenes music and she was going to conduct them she looked flushed and pleased are you nervous asked belinda yes now i am but at the very first stroke of my baton at the very first note of the music ill forget to be nervous i just wont be there ill be the music said irene belinda understood this remarkable statement very well and nodded gravely the actors were all dressed in their costumes marylou had on her ragged cinderella frock and looked frightened but it doesnt matter you looking pensive and scared moira told her youre just right like that cinderella to the life alicia looked simply magnificent she was dressed in a tightfitting glowing red costume that showed off her slim figure perfectly it was glittering with bright sequins her eyes glittered too she wore a pointed hood and looked positively wicked betty said and dont you drop any of your juggling rings and discover your rabbit isnt in your hat after all or something she said to alicia but alicia knew she wouldnt alicia wasnt nervous she was cocksure and confident and brillianteyed and leapt about as if she had springs in her heels shhhhhhh said somebody the orchestras beginning the audience are all coming in shhhhh the orchestra played a lively rousing tune lovely darrell peeped through the curtains and saw irene standing up conducting vigorously what did it feel like to conduct your own music just as good as it would feel to see your own play acted no doubt she shivered in excitement a bell rang behind stage the curtains were about to swing open the chorus got ready to go in the pantomime had begun when the chorus danced off the stage marylou was left by the fire as cinderella she sang and her small sweet voice caught irenes lilting melodies making everyone listen intently the baron came on bill stamping around in ridingboots roaring here and roaring there its bill shouted the delighted school and clapped so much that they held up the pantomime for a bit the two ugly sisters brought down the house too they were perfectly hideous perfectly idiotic and perfectly wonderful and how they enjoyed themselves gwen even found herself wishing she might have been one of them ugly or not it must be wonderful to have a comic part like that but gwen was only a servant in the chorus unseen and almost unheard mrs lacy hardly caught sight of her at all but for once in a way she didnt mind she was so enraptured with the pantomime then the prince came tall slender mavis looking shy and nervous until she had to sing and then what a marvel her voice broke on the startled audience like a miracle and there was not a single sound to be heard while she sang mothers found their eyes full of tears what a wonderful voice what a good thing it had come back to mavis why one day she would be a great operasinger perhaps the greatest that ever lived mavis sang on and on like a bird her voice pure and true and irene exulted in the tunes she had written so well for her there was such a storm of clapping that again the pantomime was held up encore shouted everyone encore encore darrell was trembling with excitement and joy it was a success it was a success in fact it looked like being a super success she could hardly keep still alicia was excellent she leapt on magnificently with her eerie chant oooooh said the lower school deliciously thrilled the demon king its alicia without a single mistake alicia juggled and tumbled did cartwheels and conjured as if she had been doing nothing else all her life fathers turned to one another and exclaimed in astonished admiration shes good enough to be on the london stage how on earth did she do that trick so the show went on and everyone clapped and cheered madly at the end of the first act the actors rushed to moira and darrell when the curtain came down at the end of the act are we doing all right i nearly forgot my lines isnt the audience grand oh darrell arent you proud moira were doing fine arent we arent we the second act was performed now the audience had time to appreciate the lovely costumes and marvel at them they marvelled at the scenery too and applauded the gilt coach frantically especially the lower school some of whom had helped to paint it and then at last the end came the final chorus was sung the last bow made the curtain swung back once twice three four times the audience rose to its feet cheering and shouting and stamping it was the biggest success malory towers had ever had the audience sat down a call came that grew more and more insistent author author author someone gave darrell a push go on silly theyre calling for you youre the author you wrote it all blindly darrell stepped out in front of the curtain she saw felicitys excited face somewhere she searched for her father and mother there they were clapping wildly mrs rivers found tears running down her face darrell her darrell how wonderful
