oladahn of the mountains to the kamarg where count brass his daughter yis selda his friend bowgentle the philosopher and all their people underwent siege from the hordes of the dark empire led by hawkmoons old enemy baron meliadus of kroiden so powerful had the dark empire grown that it threatened to destroy even the wellprotected province of the kamarg if that happened it would mean that meliadus would take yisselda for his own and slay slowly all the rest turning the kamarg to a waste of ash only by the mighty force released by the ancient machine of the wraithfolk which could warp whole areas of time and space were they saved by shifting into another dimension of the earth and so they found sanctuary sanctuary in some other kamarg where the evil and horror of granbretan did not exist but they knew that if ever the crystal ma chine were destroyed they would be plunged back into the chaos of their own time and space for a while they lived in joyful relief at their es cape but gradually hawkmoon began to finger his sword and wonder at the fate of his own world the high history of the runestaff chapter one the last city the grim riders spurred their battlesteeds up the muddy slopes of the hill coughing as their lungs took in the thick black smoke rising from the valley it was evening the sun was setting and their gro tesque shadows were long in the twilight it seemed that gigantic beastheaded creatures rode the horses each rider bore a banner stained by war each wore a huge beastmask of jewelled metal and heavy armour of steel brass and silver emblazoned with its wearers device battered and bloodied and each gauntleted right hand gripped a weapon on which was encrusted the remains of a hundred innocents the six horsemen reached the top of the hill and dragged their snorting mounts to a halt stabbing their banners into the earth where they flapped like the wings of birds of prey in the hot wind from the valley wolfmask turned to stare at flymask ape glanced at goat rat seemed to grin at hounda grin of triumph the beasts of the dark empire each a war lord of thousands looked beyond the valley and be yond the hills to the sea looked back at the blazing city below them where faintly they could hear the wails of the slaughtered and the tormented the sun set night fell arid the flames burned bright er reflected in the dark metal of the masks of the lords of granbretan well my lords said baron meliadus grand con stable of the order of the wolf commander of the army of conquest his deep vibrant voice booming from within his great mask well we have conquered all europe now mygel hoist skeletal archduke of londra head of which he had barely escaped with his life laughed the order of the goat veteran of the kamarg from ayeall europe not an inch of it is not ours and now great parts of the east belong to us also the goat helm nodded as if in satisfaction the ruby eyes catching the firelight flashing malignantly soon merrily growled adaz promp master of the order of the hound all the world will be ours all the barons of granbretan masters of a continent tacticians and warriors of ferocious courage and skill careless of their own lives corrupt of soul and mad of brain haters of all that was not in decay wielders of power without morality force without justice chuckled with gloomy pleasure as they watched the last euro pean city to withstand them crumble and die it had been an old city it had been called athena all said jerek nankenseen warlord of the order of the fly save the hidden kamarg and baron meliadus lost his humor then made al most as if he would strike his fellow warlord jerek nankenseens bejewelled flymask turned a little to regard meliadus and the voice from within the mask was baiting is it not enough that you have chased them away my lord baron no snarled the wolf of wolves not enough they can offer us no menace murmured baron brenal farnu of the rat helm from what our scien tists divined they exist in a dimension beyond earth in some other time or space we cannot reach them and they cannot reach us let us enjoy our triumph un marred by thoughts of hawkmoon and count brass i cannot or is it another name that haunts thee brother baron jerek nankenseen mocked the man who had been his rival in more than one amorous encounter in londra the name of the fair one yisselda is it love that moves you my lord sweet love for a moment the wolf did not reply but the hand that gripped the sword tightened as if in fury then the rich musical voice spoke and it had recovered its composure was almost light in tone vengeance baron jerek nankenseen is what moti vates me you are a most passionate man baron jerek nankenseen said dryly meliadus sheathed his sword suddenly and reached out to grasp his banner wrenching it from the earth they have insulted our kingemperor our land and myself i will have the girl for my pleasure but in no soft spirit will i take her no weak emotion will motivate me of course not murmured jerek nankenseen a hint of patronage in his voice and as for the others i will have my pleasure with them alsoin the prison vaults of londra do rian hawkmoon count brass the philosopher bow gentle the unhuman one oladahn of the bulgar moun tains and the traitor huillam davercall these shall suffer for many years that i have sworn by the rune staff there was a sound behind them they turned to peer through the flickering light and saw a canopied lit ter being borne up the hill by a dozen athenan prison ers of war who were chained to its poles in the litter lounged the unconventional shenegar trott count of sussex count shenegar almost disdained the wearing of a mask at all and as it was he wore a silver one scarcely larger than his head fashioned to resemble in caricature his own visage he belonged to no order and was tolerated by the kingemperor and his court because of his immense richness and almost superhu man courage in battleyet he gave the appearance in his jeweled robes and lazy manner of a besotted fool he even more than meliadus had the confidence such as it was of the kingemperor huon for his advice was almost always excellent he had plainly heard the last part of the exchange and spoke banteringly a dangerous oath to swear my lord baron said he softly one that could by all counts have repercus sions on he who swears it i swore the oath with that knowledge replied me liadus i shall find them count shenegar never fear i came to remind you my lords said shenegar trott that our kingemperor grows impatient to see us and hear our report that all europe is now his property i will ride for londra instantly meliadus said for there i may consult our sorcererscientists and discover a means of hunting out my foes farewell my lords he dragged at his horses reins turning the beast and galloping back down the hill watched by his peers the beastmasks moved together in the firelight his singular mentality could destroy us all whispered one what matter chuckled shenegar trott so long as all is destroyed with us the answering laughter was wild ringing from the jeweled helms it was insane laughter tinged as much with selfhatred as with hatred of the world for this was the great power of the lords of the dark empire that they valued nothing on all the earth no human quality nothing within or without them selves the spreading of conquest and desolation of terror and torment was their staple entertainment a means of employing their hours until their spans of life were ended for them warfare was merely the most satisfactory way of easing their ennui chapter two the flamingoes dance at dawn when clouds of giant scarlet flamin goes rose from their nests of reeds and wheeled through the sky in bizarre ritual dances count brass would stand on the edge of the marsh and stare over the water at the strange configurations of dark lagoons and tawny islands that seemed to him like hieroglyphs in some primeval language the ontological revelations that might exist in these patterns had always intrigued him and of late he had taken to studying the birds reeds and lagoons attempt ing to divine the key to this cryptic landscape the landscape he thought was coded in it he might find the answers to the dilemma of which even he was only halfconscious find perhaps the revelation that would tell him what he needed to know of the growing threat he felt was about to engulf him both psychically and physically the sun rose brightening the water with its pale light and count brass heard a sound turned and saw his daughter yisselda goldenhaired madonna of the lagoons an almost preternatural figure in her flowing blue gown riding bareback her white horned kamarg horse and smiling mysteriously as if she too knew some secret that he could never fully comprehend count brass sought to avoid the girl by stepping out briskly along the shore but already she was riding close to him and waving fatheryoure up early not for the first time re cently count brass nodded turned again to contemplate the waters and the reeds looked up suddenly at the dancing birds as if to catch them by surprise or by some instinctive flash of divination learn the secret of their strange almost frenetic gyrations yisselda had dismounted and now stood beside him they are not our flamingoes she said and yet theyre so like them what do you see count brass shrugged and smiled at her noth ing wheres hawkmoon at the castle hes still asleep count brass grunted clasping his great hands to gether as if in desperate prayer listening to the beat ing of the heavy wings overhead then he relaxed and took her by the arm guiding her along the bank of the lagoon its beautiful she murmured the sunrise count brass made a small gesture of impatience you dont understand he began and then paused he knew that she would never see the land scape as he saw it he had tried once to describe it to her but she had lost interest quickly had made no effort to understand the significance of the patterns he detected everywherein the water the reeds the trees the animal life that filled this kamarg in abundance as it had filled the kamarg that they had left to him it was the quintessence of order but to her it was simply pleasurable to look atsomething beau tiful to admire in fact for its wildness only bowgentle the philosopher poet ms old friend had an inkling of what he meant and even then bow gentle believed that it reflected not on the nature of the landscape but on the particular nature of count brasss mind youre exhausted disorientated bowgentle would say the ordering mechanism of the brain is working too hard so you see a pattern to existence that in fact only stems from your own weariness and distur bance count brass would dismiss this argument with a scowl don his armour of brass and ride away on his own again to the discomfort of his family and friends he had spent a long while exploring this new kamarg that was so much like his own save that there was no evidence of mankinds ever having existed here he is a man of action like myself dorian hawk moon yisseldas husband would say his mind turns inward i fear for want of some real problem with which to engage itself the real problems seem insoluble bowgentle would reply and the conversation would end as hawk moon too went off by himself his hand on the hilt of his sword there was tension in castle brass and even in the village below the folk were troubled glad of their es cape from the terror of the dark empire but not sure that they were permanently settled in this new land so like the one they had left at first when they had ar rived the land had seemed a transformed version of the kamarg its colors those of the rainbow but gradually those colors had changed to more natural ones as if their memories had imposed themselves on the land scape so that now there was little difference there were herds of horned horses and white bulls to tame scarlet flamingoes that might be trained to bear riders but at the back of the villagers minds was always the threat of the dark empire somehow finding a way through even to this retreat to hawkmoon and count brassperhaps to daverc bowgentle and oladahn toothe idea was not so threatening there were times when they would have welcomed an assault from the world they had left while count brass studied the landscape and sought to divine its secrets dorian hawkmoon would ride at speed along the lagoon trails scattering herds of bulls and horses sending the flamingoes flapping into the sky looking for an enemy one day as he rode back on a steaming horse from one of his many journeys of exploration along the shores of the violet sea sea and terrain seemed without limit he saw the flamingoes wheeling in the sky spiraling upwards on the air currents and then drifting down again it was afternoon and the flamingo dance took place only at dawn the giant birds seemed dis turbed and hawkmoon decided to investigate he spurred his horse along the winding path through the marsh until he was directly below the flamingoes saw that they wheeled above a small island covered in tall reeds he peered intently at the island and thought that he glimpsed something among the reeds a flash of red that could be a mans coat at first hawkmoon decided that it was probably a villager snaring duck but then he realized that if that had been so the man would have hailed himat least waved him away to ensure he would not disturb the fowl puzzled hawkmoon spurred his horse into the wa ter swimming it across to the island and on to the marshy ground the animals powerful body pushed back the tough reeds as it moved and again hawk moon saw a flash of red became convinced that he had seen a man ho he cried whos there he received no answer instead the reeds became more agitated as the man began to run through them without caution who are you hawkmoon cried and it came to him then that the dark empire had broken through at last that there were men hidden everywhere in the reeds ready to attack castle brass he thundered through the reeds in pursuit of the redjerkined man saw him clearly now as he flung him self into the lagoon and began to swim for the bank stop hawkmoon called but the man swam on hawkmoons horse plunged again into the water and it foamed white the man was already wading onto the opposite bank glanced back to see that hawkmoon was almost upon him turned right round and drew a bright slender sword of extraordinary length but it was not the sword that astonished hawkmoon mostit was the impression that the man had no face the whole of the head beneath the long fair dirty hair was blank hawkmoon gasped drawing his own sword was it some alien inhabitant of this world hawkmoon swung himself from his saddle sword ready as the horse clambered onto the bank stood legs astraddle facing his strange antagonist laughed suddenly as he realized the truth the man was wearing a mask of light leather the mouth and eye slits were very thin and could not be distinguished at a distance why do you laugh the masked man asked in a braying voice his sword on guard you should not laugh my friend for you are about to die who are you hawkmoon asked i know you for a boaster only i am a greater swordsman than you replied the man you had best surrender now i regret i cant accept your word on the quality of my swordsmanship or your own hawkmoon replied with a smile how is it that such a master of the blade is so poorly attired for instance with his sword he indicated the mans patched red jerkin his trousers and boots of cracked leather even his bright sword had no scabbard but had been drawn from a loop of cord attached to a rope belt on which also dangled a purse that bulged on the mans fingers were rings of obvious glass and paste and the flesh of his skin looked grey and unhealthy the body was tall but stringy halfstarved by the look of it a beggar id guess mocked hawkmoon where did you steal the sword beggar he gasped as the man thrust suddenly then with drew the movement had been incredibly rapid and hawkmoon felt a sting on his cheek put up his hand to his face and discovered that it bled shall i prick you thus to death sneered the stranger put down your heavy sword and make your self my prisoner hawkmoon laughed with real pleasure good a worthy opponent after all you do not know how much i welcome you my friend it has been too long since i heard the ring of steel in my ears and with that he lunged at the masked man his adversary deftly defended himself with a parry that somehow became a thrust which hawkmoon bare ly managed to block in time feet planted firmly in the marshy ground neither moved an inch from his position both fought skillfully and unheatedly each recognising in the other a true master of the sword they fought for an hour absolutely matched neither giving nor sustaining a wound and hawkmoon de cided on different tactics began gradually to shift back down the bank towards the water thinking that hawkmoon was retreating the masked man seemed to gam confidence and his sword moved even more rapidly than before so that hawkmoon was forced to exert all his energy to deflect it then hawkmoon pretended to slip in the mud go ing down on one knee the other sprang forward to thrust and hawkmoons blade moved rapidly the flat striking the mans wrist he yelled and the sword fell from his hand quickly hawkmoon jumped up and placed his boot upon the weapon his blade at the others throat not a trick worthy of a true swordsman grumbled the masked man i am easily bored hawkmoon replied i was be coming impatient with the game well what now your name hawkmoon said ill know that first then see your facethen know your business here then and perhaps most important discover how you came here my name you will know said the man with undis guised pride it is elvereza tozer i do know it indeed remarked the duke of koln in some surprise chapter three elvereza tozer elvereza tozer was not the man hawkmoon would have expected to meet if he had been told in advance that he was to encounter granbretans great est playwrighta writer whose work was admired throughout europe even by those who in all other ways loathed granbretan the author of king staleen the tragedy of katine and carna the last of the braldurs annala chirshil and adutf the comedy of steel and many more had not been heard of of late but hawkmoon had thought this due to the wars he would have expected tozer to have been rich in dress confident in every way poised and full of wit instead he found a man who seemed more at ease with a sword than with words a vain man something of a fool and a poppinjay dressed in rags as he propelled tozer with his own sword along the marsh trails towards castle brass hawkmoon puzzled over this apparent paradox was the man lying if so why should he claim to be of all things an eminent playmaker tozer walked along apparently undisturbed by his change of fortune whistling a jaunty tune hawkmoon paused a moment he said and reached to grasp the reins of his horse which had been following him tozer turned he still wore his mask hawkmoon had been so astonished at hearing the name that he had forgotten to order tozer to remove the leather from his face well tozer said glancing about him it is a love ly countrythough short in audiences i would gath er aye replied hawkmoon nonplussed aye he gestured towards the horse well ride pillion i think into the saddle with you master tozer tozer swung up onto the horse and hawkmoon fol lowed him taking the reins and urging the horse into a trot in this manner they rode until they came to the gates of the town passed through them and proceeded slow ly through the winding streets up the steep road to the walls of castle brass dismounting in the courtyard hawkmoon gave the horse to a groom and indicated the door to the main hall of the castle through there if you please he told tozer with a small shrug tozer sauntered through the door and bowed to the two men who stood there by the great fire which blazed in the hall hawkmoon nodded to them good morning sir bowgentledaverc i have a prisoner so i see daverc said his gaunt handsome fea tures brightening a little with interest are the war riors of granbretan at our gates again he is the only one so far as i can judge hawk moon replied he claims to be elvereza tozer indeed the ascetic bowgentles quiet eyes took on a look of curiosity the author of chirshil and adulf it is hard to believe tozers thin hand went to the mask and tugged at the thongs securing it i know you sir he said we met ten years hence when i came with my play to malaga i recall the time we discussed some poems you had recently published and which i admired bowgentle shook his head you are elvereza tozer but the mask came loose and revealed an emaciated shifty face sporting a whispy beard which did not hide a weak receding chin and which was dominated by a long thin nose the flesh of the face was unhealthy and bore the marks of a pox and i recall the facethough it was fuller then pray what has happened to you sir bowgentle asked faintly are you a refugee seeking escape from your countrymen ah tozer sighed darting bowgentle a calculating look perhaps would you have a glass of wine sir my encounter with your military friend here has left me thirsty i fear what put in daverc have you been fighting fighting to kill hawkmoon said grimly i feel that master tozer did not come to our kamarg on an errand of goodwill i found him skulking in the reeds to the south i think he comes as a spy and why should elvereza tozer greatest play wright of the world wish to spy the words were de livered by tozer in a disdainful tone that yet some how lacked conviction bowgentle bit his lip and tugged a bell rope for a servant that is for you to tell us sir huillam daverc said with some amusement in his voice he coughed ostenta tiously forgive mea slight chill i think the castle is full of drafts and id wish the same for myself tozer said if a draft could be found he looked at them expectantly a draft to help us forget the draft if you understand me a draft yes yes said bowgentle hastily and turned to the servant who had entered a jug of wine for our guest he requested and would you eat master tozer i would eat the bread of babel and the meat of marakhan tozer said dreamily tor all such fruits as fools supply are merely we can offer some cheese at this hour daverc in terrupted sardonically annala act vi scene v tozer said youll re member the scene i remember daverc nodded i always felt that section somewhat weaker than the rest subtler tozer said airily subtler the servant reentered with the wine and tozer helped himself pouring a generous amount into the goblet the concerns of literature he said are not always obvious to the common herd a hundred years from now and people will see the last act of annala not as some stupid critics have said as hastily written and poorly conceived but as the complex structure it really is i had reckoned myself as something of a writer bowgentle said but i must confess i did not see subtleties perhaps you could explain some other time tozer told him with an in souciant wave of the hand he drank off the wine and helped himself to another full goblet in the meanwhile hawkmoon said firmly per haps you could explain your presence in the kamarg after all we had thought ourselves inviolate and now you are still inviolate never fear tozer said save to myself of course by the power of my brain i pro pelled myself hither daverc sceptically rubbed his chin by the power of yourbrain how so an ancient discipline taught me by a master phi losopher who dwells in the hidden valleys of yel tozer belched and poured more wine yel is that south western province of granbretan is it not bowgentle asked aye a remote barely inhabited land peopled by a few darkbrown barbarians who live in holes in the ground after my play chirshil and adulf had in curred the displeasure of certain elements at court i deemed it wise to retire there for a while leaving my enemies to take for themselves all goods monies and mistresses i left behind what know i of petty poli tics how was i to realize that certain portions of the play seemed to reflect the intrigues then current at the court so you were disgraced hawkmoon said looking narrowly at tozer the story could be part of the mans deception morei almost lost my life but the rural exis tence near killed me as it was you met this philosopher who taught you how to travel through the dimensions then you came here seeking refuge hawkmoon studied tozers reaction to these questions noah yes said the playwright that is to say i did not know exactly where i was coming i think that you were sent here by the kingem peror to destroy us hawkmoon said i think master tozer that you are lying to us lying what is a lie what is truth tozer grinned glassily up at hawkmoon and then hiccupped truth hawkmoon replied evenly is a coarse noose about your throat i think we should hang you he fingered the dull black jewel imbedded in his fore head i am not unfamiliar with the tricks of the dark empire i have been their victim too often to risk being deceived again he looked at the others i say we should hang him now but how do we know if he is really the only one who can reach us daverc asked sensibly we can not be too hasty hawkmoon i am the only one i swear it tozer spoke ner vously now i admit good sir that i was commis sioned to come here it was that or lose my life in the prison catacombs of the great palace when i had the old mans secret i returned to londra thinking that my power would enable me to bargain with those at court who were displeased with me i wished only to be returned to my former status and know that i had an audience to write for once again however when i told them of my newfound discipline they instantly threat ened my life unless i came here and destroyed that which enabled you to enter this dimension so i cameglad i must admit to escape them i was not particularly willing to risk my skin in offending you good folk but they did not ensure in some way that you would perform the task they set you hawkmoon asked that is strange to tell you the truth tozer said downcast i do not think they altogether believed in my power i think they merely wished to test that i had it when i agreed to go and left instantly they must have been shocked not like the dark empire lords to allow such an oversight mused daverc his aquiline face frowning still if you did not win our confidence theres no reason you should have won theirs nonetheless i am not altogether convinced that you speak the truth you told them of this old man bowgentle said they will be able to learn his secret for themselves not so tozer said with a leer i told them i had struck upon the power myself in my months of soli tude no wonder they did not take you seriously daverc smiled tozer looked hurt and took another draft of wine i find it difficult to believe that you were able to travel here by exercise of your will alone bowgentle admitted are you sure you employed no other means none i like this not at all hawkmoon said darkly even if he tells the truth the lords of granbretan will wonder where he found his power by now will learn all his movements will almost certainly discover the old manand then they will have the means to come through in strength and we shall be doomed indeed these are difficult times tozer said filling his goblet yet again remember your king staleen act iv scene iiwild days wild riders and the stink of warfare across the world aha i was a vi sionary and knew it not he was now evidently drunk hawkmoon stared hard at the weakchinned drunk ard still finding it almost impossible to believe that this was the great playwright tozer you wonder at my poverty i see tozer said speaking with slurred tongue the result of a couple of lines in chirshil and adulf as i told you oh the wickedness of fate a couple of lines penned in good faith and here i am today with the threat of a noose about my gullet you remember the scene of course and the speech court and king alike corrupt act i scene i pity me sir and do not hang me a great artist destroyed by his own mighty genius this old man bowgentle said what was he like where exactly did he live the old man tozer forced more wine down his throat the old man reminded me somewhat of ioni in my comedy of steel act ii scene vi what was he like hawkmoon asked impatiently machinedevoured all his hours were given oer to that insidious circuitry and old grew he unnoticing in the service of his engines he lived only for his science you see he made the rings tozer put his hand to his mouth rings what rings daverc said swiftly i feel that you must excuse me tozer said rising in a parody of dignity for the wine has proved too rich for my empty stomach your pity if you please it was true that tozers face had taken on a greenish tinge very well bowgentle said wearily i will show you before he leaves came a new voice from near the door ask him for the ring he wears on the middle finger of his left hand the tone was slightly muffled a little sardonic hawkmoon recognized it at once and turned tozer gasped and clamped his hand over the ring what do you know of this he said who are you duke dorian here said the figure with a gesture towards hawkmoon calls me the warrior in jet and gold taller than any of them covered all in armour and helm of black and gold the mysterious warrior raised an arm and pointed a metalclad finger at tozer hand him that ring the ring is of glass nothing more it is of no value daverc said he mentioned rings is the ring then what actually transported him here tozer still hesitated his face stupid with drink and with anxiety i said that it was glass of no value by the runestaff i command thee rumbled the warrior in a terrible voice with a little nervous movement elvereza tozer drew off the ring and flung it onto the flagstones daverc stooped and caught it up inspecting it its a crystal he said not glass a familiar kind of crystal too it is of the same substance from which the device that brought you here was carved the warrior in jet and gold told him he displayed his own gauntleted hand and there on the middle finger reposed an identi cal ring and it possesses the same propertiescan transport a man through the dimensions as i thought hawkmoon said it was no mental discipline that enabled you to come here but a piece of crystal now ill hang you assuredly where did you get the ring from the manfrom mygan of llandar i swear that is the truth he has otherscan make more tozer cried do not hang me i pray you i will tell you exactly where to find the old man that we shall have to know bowgentle said thoughtfully for we shall have to get to him before the dark empire lords do we must have him and his secretsfor our security what must we journey to granbretan daverc said in some astonishment it would seem necessary hawkmoon told him chapter four flana mikosevaar at the concert flana mikosevaar countess of kanbery adjusted her mask of spun gold and glanced absently about her seeing the rest of the audi ence only as a mass of gorgeous colours the orchestra in the center of the ballroom played a wild and com plex melody one of the later works of granbretans last great musician londen johne who had died two cen turies earlier the countesss mask was that of an ornate heron its eyes facetted with a thousand fragments of rare jewels her heavy gown was of luminous brocade that changed its many colours as the light varied she was asrovak mikosevaars widow he who had died under dorian hawkmoons blade at the first battle of the kamarg the muskovian renegade who had formed the vulture legion to fight on the european mainland and whose slogan had been death to life was not mourned by flana of kanbery and she bore no grudge against his killer he had been her twelfth husband after all and the fierce insanity of the bloodlover had served her pleasure long enough before he had set off to make war on the kamarg since then she had had several lov ers and her memory of asrovak mikosevaar was as cloudy as all her other memories of men for flana was an inturned creature who barely distinguished be tween one person and another it was her habit on the whole to have husbands and lovers destroyed when they became inconvenient to her an instinct rather than any intellectual con sideration stopped her from murdering the more pow erful ones this was not to say that she was incapable of love for she could love passionately doting entirely on the object of her love but she could not sustain the emotion for long hatred was unknown to her as was loyalty she was for the most part a neutral animal re minding some of a cat and others of a spiderthough in her grace and beauty she was more reminiscent of the former and there were many who bore her hatred who planned vengeance against her for a husband stolen or a brother poisoned who would have taken that vengeance had she not been the countess of kan bery and cousin to the kingemperor huon that im mortal monarch who dwelt eternally in his womblike throne globe in the huge throne room of his palace she was the center of other attentions also since she was the only surviving kin of the monarch and certain elements at court considered that with huon destroyed she could be made queenempress and serve their in terests unaware of any plots concerning her flana of kan bery would have been unperturbed had she been told of them for she had not the faintest curiosity about the affairs of any one of her species sought only to satisfy her own obscure desires to ease the strange melan choly longing in her soul which she could not define many had wondered about her sought her favors with the sole object of unmasking her to see what they could learn in her face but her face fairskinned beautiful the cheeks slightly flushed always the eyes large and golden held a look remote and mysterious hiding far more than could any golden mask the music ceased the audience moved and the col ours became alive as the fabrics swirled and masks turned nodded gestured the delicate masks of the ladies could be seen gathering around the warlike helms of those recently returned captains of granbretans great armies the countess rose but did not move to wards them vaguely she recognised some of the helms particularly that of meliadus of the wolf order who had been her husband five years earlier and who had divorced her there too was shenegar trott lounging on heaped cushions served by naked mainland slavegirls his sil ver mask a parody of a human face and she saw the mask of the duke of lakasdeh pra flenn barely eigh teen and with ten great cities fallen to him his helm a grinning dragon head the others she thought she knew and she understood that they were all the mighti est warlords back to celebrate their victories to divide up the conquered territories between them to receive the congratulations of their emperor they laughed considerably stood proudly as the ladies flattered them all but her exhusband meliadus who appeared to avoid them and conferred instead with his brotherin law taragorm master of the palace of time and the serpentmasked baron kalan of vitall grand con stable of the order of the snake and chief scientist to the kingemperor behind her mask flana frowned remembering distantly that meliadus normally avoided taragorm chapter five taragorm and how have you fared brother taragorm asked meliadus with forced cordiality the man who had married his sister replied shortly well he wondered why meliadus should approach him thus when it was common knowledge that melia dus was profoundly jealous of taragorms having won his sisters affections the huge mask lifted a little super ciliously it was constructed of a monstrous clock of gilded and enameled brass with numerals of inlaid motherofpearl and hands of filigreed silver the box in which hung its pendulum extending to the upper part of taragorms broad chest the box was of some transparent material like glass of a bluish tint and through it could be seen the golden pendulum swing ing back and forth the whole clock was balanced by means of a complex mechanism so as to adjust to tara gorms every movement it struck the hour halfhour and quarterhour and at midday and midnight chimed the first eight bars of shenevens temporal antipathies and how continued meliadus in this same un usually ingratiating manner do the clocks of your palace fare all the ticks ticking and the tocks tocking mmm it took taragorm a moment to understand that his brotherinlaw was in fact attempting to joke he made no reply meliadus cleared bis throat kalan of the serpent mask said i hear you are ex perimenting with some machine capable of travelling through time lord taragorm as it happens i too have been experimentingwith an engine i wished to ask you brother about your experi ments meliadus said to taragorm how far ad vanced are they reasonably advanced brother you have moved through time already not personally my engine baron kalan continued implacably is capable of moving ships at enormous speeds across vast distances why we could invade any land on the globe no matter how far away when will the point be reached meliadus asked moving closer to taragorm when a man can journey into the past or future baron kalan shrugged and turned away i must re turn to my laboratories he said the kingemperor has commissioned me urgently to complete my work good day my lords good day said meliadus absently now brother you must tell me more of your workshow me per haps how far you have progressed i must taragorm replied facetiously but my work is secret brother i cannot take you to the palace of time without the permission of king huon that you must seek first surely unnecessary for me to seek such permis sion none is so great that he can act without the bless ing of our kingemperor but the matter is of extraordinary importance brother meliadus said his tone almost desperate al most wheedling our enemies have escaped us prob ably to another era of the earth they offer a threat to granbretans security you speak of that handful of ruffians whom you failed to defeat at the battle of the kamarg they were almost conqueredonly science or sor cery saved them from our vengeance no one blames me for my failure save yourself you do not blame yourself no blame to me at all from any quarter i would finish the matter thats all i would rid the empire of her enemies wheres the fault in that i have heard it whispered that your battle is more private than public that you have made foolish com promises in order to pursue a personal vendetta against those who dwell in the kamarg that is an opinion brother meliadus said re straining with difficulty his chagrin but i fear only for our empires wellbeing then tell king huon of this fear and he may then permit you to visit my palace taragorm turned away as he did so his mask beginning to boom out the hour further conversation was momentarily impossi ble meliadus made to follow him then changed his mind walking fuming from the hall surrounded now by young lords each seeking to at tract her deadly attentions countess flana mikosevaar watched baron meliadus depart by the impatient manner of his gait she assumed him to be in uneven temper then she forgot him as she returned her attention to the flatteries of her at tendants listening not to the words which were fa miliar to her but to the voices themselves which were like old favorite instruments taragorm now was conversing with shenegar trott i am to present myself to the kingemperor in the morning trott told the master of the palace of time some commission i believe that is at this moment a secret known only to himself we must keep busy lord taragorm eh indeed we must count shenegar lest boredom en gulfs us all chapter six the audience next morning meliadus waited impatiently out side the kingemperors throne room he had re quested an audience the previous evening and had been told to present himself at eleven oclock it was now twelve and the doors had not yet opened to admit him the doors towering into the dimness of the huge roof were encrusted with jewels that made up a mo saic of images of ancient things the fifty mantis masked guards who blocked them stood stock still with flamelances ready at a precise angle meliadus strode up and down before them behind him the glit tering corridors of the king emperors hallucinatory palace meliadus attempted to fight back his feelings of re sentment that the king emperor had not granted him an immediate audience after all was he not paramount warlord of europe had it not been under his direction that the armies of granbretan had conquered a conti nent had he not taken those same armies into the mid dle east and added further territories to the domain of the dark empire why should the kingemperor seek to insult him in this manner meliadus first of gran bretans warriors should have priority over all lesser mortals he suspected a plot against him from what taragorm and the others had said they judged him to be losing his grip they were fools if they did not realise the threat that hawkmoon count brass and huillam daverc offered let them escape their deserved rec koning and it would inflame others to rebel make the work of conquest less speedy surely king huon had not listened to those who spoke against him the king emperor was wise the king emperor was objective if he were not then he was unfit to rule meliadus dismissed the thought in horror at last the jewelled doors began to move open until they were wide enough to admit a single manand through this crack strode a jaunty corpulent figure shenegar trott exclaimed meliadus is it you who has kept me waiting so long trotts silver mask glinted in the light from the cor ridors my apologies baron meliadus my deep apolo gies there were many details to discuss but i am finished now a mission my dear baroni have a mission such a mission ha ha and before meliadus could tax him further on the nature of his mission he had swept away from within the throne room now issued a youth ful vibrant voice the voice of the king emperor him self you may join me now baron meliadus the mantis warriors parted their ranks and allowed the baron to pass through them and into the throne room into that gigantic hall of blazing color where hung the bright banners of granbretans five hundred noblest families which was lined on either side by a thousand statuestill mantis guards stepped baron meliadus of kroiden and abased himself ornate gallery upon ornate gallery stretched up wards and upwards to the concave ceiling of the hall the armour of the soldiers of the order of the mantis shone black and green and gold and in the distance as he rose to his feet baron meliadus saw his king emperors throne globe a white speck against the green and purple of the walls behind it walking slowly it took meliadus twenty minutes to reach the globe and once again abase himself the globe contained a sluggishly swirling liquid that was milkwhite but which was sometimes streaked with iri descent veins of bloodred and blue at the center of this fluid was curled king huon himself a wrinkled ancient immortal foetuslike creature in which the only living things seemed the eyes black sharp and malicious baron meliadus came the golden voice that had been torn from the throat of a beautiful youth to furn ish king huon with speech great majesty murmured meliadus i thank you for your graciousness in permitting this audience and for what purpose did you desire the audience baron the tone was sardonic a trifle impatient do you seek to hear us praise again your efforts in eu rope on our behalf the accomplishment is enough noble sire i seek to warn you that danger still threatens us in europe what you have not made the continent wholly ours you know that i have great emperor from one coast to the other to the very borders of muskovia and beyond few live who are not totally our slaves but i refer to those who fled us hawkmoon and his friends the same mighty king emperor you chased them away they offer us no threat while they live they threaten us noble sire for their escape could give others hope and hope we must destroy in all we conquer lest we are troubled by risings against your discipline you have dealt with risings before you are used to them we fear baron meliadus that you may be for saking your king emperors interests in favor of per sonal interests my personal interests are your interests great king emperor your interests are my personal interests they are indivisible am i not the most loyal of your servants perhaps you believe yourself to be so baron me liadus what do you mean powerful monarch we mean that your obsession with the german hawkmoon and that handful of villains he has as friends could not necessarily be in our interest they will not returnand if they should dare return why we can deal with them then we fear that it is vengeance alone which motivates you and that you have rational ised your thirst for vengeance into a belief that the whole dark empire is threatened by those you would be avenged upon no no prince of all i swear that is not so let them stay where they are meliadus deal with them only if they reappear great king they offer a potential threat to the em pire there are other powers involved who support themelse where could they have obtained the ma chine which plucked them away when we were about to destroy them i cannot offer positive evidence now but if you would let me work with taragorm to use his knowledge to discover the whereabouts of hawk moon and his companythen i will find that evidence and you will believe me we are dubious meliadus there was a grim note now in the melodious voice but if it does not inter fere with the other duties at court we intend to give you you may visit lord taragorms palace and seek his assistance in your attempts to locate your ene mies our enemies prince of all we shall see baron we shall see i thank you for your faith in me great majesty i will the audience is not ended baron meliadus for we have not yet told you of those duties we mentioned i shall be honoured to perform them noble sire you spoke of our security being in peril from the kamarg well we believe that we may be threatened from other quarters to be precise we are anxious that the east may promise us a fresh enemy that could be as powerful as the dark empire itself now this could have something to do with your own suspicions con cerning hawkmoon and his supposed allies for it is possible that we entertain representatives of those allies this day at our court great king emperor if that be so let us continue baron meliadus i apologize noble sire last night there appeared at the gates of londra two strangers who claimed to be emissaries from the empire of asiacommunista their arrival was mys teriousindicating to us that they have methods of transport unknown to us for they told us they had left their capital not two hours before it is our opinion that they have come here as we would visit others in whose territories we were interested to spy out our strength we in turn must try to gauge their power for the time must come even if it is not soon when we shall be in conflict with them doubtless our conquests in the near and middle east have become known to them and they are nervous we must discover all we can about them try to convince them that we mean them no harm try to persuade them to let us return emissaries to their domain should that prove possible we should want you meliadus to be one of those emissaries for you have greater experience of such diplomacy than any other among our servants this is disturbing news great emperor aye but we must take what advantage we can from the events you will be their guide treat them courteously try to draw them out make them expand upon the extent of their power and the size of their territories the number of warriors their monarch com mands the power of their weaponry and the capabilities of their transports this visit baron meliadus offers as you can see a much more important potential threat than any which may come from the vanished castle of count brass perhaps noble sire nocertainly baron meliadus the prehensible tongue flickered from the wrinkled mouth that is to be your most important task if you have any time to spare that can be devoted to your vendetta against dorian hawkmoon and the rest but mighty king emperor bide our instructions well meliadus do not dis appoint us the tone was one of menace the tongue touched the tiny jewel that floated near the head and the globe began to dull until it had the appearance of a solid black sphere chapter seven the emissaries baron meliadus could still not rid himself of the feeling that his king emperor had lost trust in him that king huon was deliberately finding means of curtailing his own schemes regarding the inhabitants of castle brass true the king had made a convincing case for meliaduss need to involve himself with the strange emissaries from asiacommunista had even flattered him by hinting that only meliadus could deal with the problem and would have the opportunity later of be coming not only the first warrior of europe but also paramount warlord of asiacommunista but me liaduss interest in asiacommunista was not as great as his interest in castle brassfor he felt that there was evidence for believing castle brass to be a con siderable threat to the dark empire whereas his mon arch had no evidence to suppose that asiacommunista threatened them clad in his finest mask and most sumptuous gar ments meliadus made his way through the shining cor ridors of the palace towards the hall where the previous day he had sought out his brotherinlaw taragorm now the hall was to be used for another receptionto welcome with due ceremony the visitors from the east as the king emperors deputy baron meliadus should have considered himself fully honoured for it gave him prestige second only to king huons but even this knowledge did not entirely ease his vengeful mind he entered the hall to the sound of fanfares from the galleries that ran around the walls all the noblest of granbretan were assembled here their finery splendid and dazzling the emissaries from asiacommunista had not yet been announced baron meliadus walked to the dais on which were placed three golden thrones mounted the steps and seated himself on the throne in the middle the sea of nobles bowed before him and the hall was silent in anticipation meliadus himself had not yet met the emissaries captain viel phong of the order of the mantis had been their escort up to now meliadus looked about the hall noting the presence of taragorm of flana countess of kanbery of adaz promp and mygel hoist of jerek nankenseen and brenal farnu he was puzzled for a moment wonder ing what was wrong then he realised that of all the great warrior nobles only shenegar trott was missing he remembered that the fat count had spoken of a mission had he left to fulfill it already why had not he meliadus been informed of trotts expedition were they keeping secrets from him had he truly lost the trust of his king emperor his brain in turmoil meliadus turned as the fanfares sounded again and the doors of the hall opened to admit two incredibly garbed figures automatically meliadus rose to greet them aston ished at the sight of them for they were barbaric and grotesquegiants of over seven feet high walking stiffly like automatons were they indeed human he wondered it had not occurred to him that they would not be were these some monstrous creation of the tragic millenium were the folk of asiacommunista not men at all like the people of granbretan they wore masks he assumed those constructions on their shoulders were masks so that it was impossible to tell if human faces were within them they were tall things roughly oblong in shape of brightly painted leather in blues greens yellows and reds swirling patterns on which had been painted devil featuresglaring eyes and teethfilled mouths bulky fur cloaks hung to the ground and their clothes were leather painted to trav esty human limbs and organs reminding meliadus of the coloured sketches he had once seen in a medical text the herald announced them the lord kominsar kaow shalang gatt heredi tary representative of the president emperor long mang shen of asiacommunista and prince elect of the hordes of the sun the first of the emissaries stepped forward his fur cloak drifting back to reveal shoulders that were at least four feet in width the sleeves of his coat of bulky multicolored silk his right hand holding a staff of gemencrusted gold that might have been the rune staff itself the care he took of it the lord kominsar orkai heong phoon heredi tary representative of the president emperor jong mang shen of asiacommunista and prince elect of the hordes of the sun the second man stepped forward similarly garbed but without a staff i welcome the noble emissaries of the president em peror jong mang shen and let them know that all granbretan is at their disposal to do with as they wish meliadus spread his arms wide the man with the staff paused before the dais and began to speak in a strange lilting accent as if the language of granbretan and indeed all europe and the near east was not native to him we thank you most graciously for your welcome and would beg to know what mighty man addresses us i am the baron meliadus of kroiden grand con stable of the order of the wolf paramount warlord of europe deputy to the immortal king emperor huon the eighteenth ruler of granbretan of europe and all the realms of the middle sea grand constable of the order of the mantis controller of destinies mold er of histories feared and powerful prince of all i greet you as he would greet you speak as he would speak act in accord with all his wishes for you must know that being immortal he cannot leave the mystic throne globe which preserves him and which is pro tected by the thousand who guard him night and day meliadus thought it best to dwell for a moment upon the invulnerability of the king emperor to im press the visitors should it have occurred to them that an attempt on king huons life was impossible me liadus indicated the twin thrones on either side of him i ask yoube seated be entertained the two grotesque creatures mounted the steps and with some difficulty placed themselves in the golden chairs there would be no banquet for the people of granbretan regarded eating on the whole as a per sonal matter for it could necessitate the removal of their masks and the horror of displaying their naked faces only thrice a year did they shed in public their masks and garments in the security of the throne room itself where they would indulge in a weeklong orgy before the greedy eyes of king huon taking part in disgusting and bloody ceremonies with names exist ing only in the languages of their various orders and which were never referred to save upon those three occasions baron meliadus clapped his hands for the entertain ments to begin the courtiers parted like a curtain and took their places on the two sides of the hall then on came the acrobats and the tumblers the harlequins pierrots and columbines while wild music sounded from the gallery above human pyramids swayed bent and suddenly collapsed to reform again in even more complex assemblages clowns capered and played upon one another the dangerous jokes that were expected of them while the acrobats and tumblers cavorted around them at incredible speeds walking on wires stretched between the galleries performing on trapezes sus pended high above all the heads of the audience flana of kanbery did not watch the tumblers and failed to see any humour in the actions of the clowns instead she turned her beautiful heron mask in the di rection of the strangers and regarded them with what was for her unusual curiosity thinking dimly that she would like to know them better for they offered the possibility of a unique diversion particularly if as she suspected they were not entirely manlike meliadus who could not rid himself of the suspicion that he was being prejudiced against by his king and plotted against by his fellow nobles made a mighty at tempt to be civil to the visitors when he wished he could impress strangers as he had once impressed count brass with his dignity his wit and his manli ness but this night it was an effort and he feared that the effort could be detected in his tone do you find the entertainment to your liking my lords of asiacommunista he would sayand be met with a slight inclination of the huge heads are the clowns not amusingand there would be a movement of the hand from kaow shalang gatt who bore the golden staffor such skill we brought those con jurers from our territories in italiaand those tumblers were once the property of a duke of krahkovyou must have entertainers of equal skill at your own em perors court and the other called orkai heong phoon would move his body in its seat as if in dis comfort the result was to increase baron meliaduss sense of impatience make him feel that these peculiar creatures somehow judged themselves above him or were bored by his attempts at civility and it became more and more difficult for him to continue the light conversation that was the only conversation possible while the music played at length he rose and clapped his hands enough of this dismiss these entertainers let us have more exotic sport and he relaxed a trifle as the sexual gym nasts entered the hall and began to perform for the delight of the depraved appetites of the dark empire he chuckled recognizing some of the performers pointing them out to his guests theres one who was a prince of magyariaand those two the twins were the sisters of a king in turkia i captured the blonde one there myselfand the stallion you seein a bulgarian stable many of them i personally trained but though the entertainment relaxed the tortured nerves of baron meliadus of kroiden the emissaries of the president emperor jong mang shen seemed as unmoved and as taciturn as ever at last the performance was over and the entertain ers retired baron meliadus much refreshed wondering if the creatures were of flesh and blood at all gave the order for the ball to commence now gentlemen said he rising shall we circulate about the floor so that you may meet those who have assembled to honour you and be honoured by you moving stiffly the emissaries of asiacommunista followed baron meliadus towering over the heads of even the tallest in the hall would you dance asked the baron we do not dance i regret said kaow shalang gatt tonelessly and since etiquette demanded that the guests dance before the others could no dancing was done meliadus fumed what did king huon expect of him how could he deal with these automata do you not have dances in asiacommunista he said his voice trembling with suppressed anger not of the sort i suppose you to prefer replied or kai heong phoon and though there was no inflection in his voice again baron meliadus was given to think that such activities were beneath the dignity of the asiacommunistan nobles it was becoming he thought grimly exceedingly difficult to remain polite toward these proud strangers meliadus was not used to sup pressing his feelings where mere foreigners were con cerned and he promised himself the pleasure of dealing with these two in particular should he be given the privilege of leading any army that conquered the far east baron meliadus paused before adaz promp who bowed to the two guests may i present one of our mightiest warlords the count adaz promp grand constable of the order of the hound prince of parye and protector of munchein commander of ten thou sand the ornate dogmask inclined itself again count adaz led the force that helped us conquer all the european mainland in two years when we had allowed for twenty meliadus said his hounds are in vincible the baron flatters me said adaz promp i am sure you have mightier legions in asiacommunista my lords perhaps i do not know your army sounds as fierce as our dragonhounds kaow shalang gatt said dragonhounds and what are they meliadus en quired remembering at last what his king had desired him to do you have none in granbretan perhaps we call them by another name could you describe them kaow shalang gatt made a movement with his staff they are about twice the height of a manone of our menwith seventy teeth that are like ivory razors they are very hairy and have claws like a cats we use them to hunt those reptiles we have not yet trained for war i see meliadus murmured thinking that such war beasts would require special tactics to defeat and how many such dragonhounds have you trained for battle a good number said his guest they moved on meeting other nobles and their lad ies and each was prepared with a question such as adaz promp had asked to give meliadus the oppor tunity of extracting information from the emissaries but it became plain that although they were willing to indicate that their forces and weaponry were mighty they were too cautious to provide details as to numbers and capacity meliadus realised that it would take more than one evening to gather that sort of information and he had the feeling that it would be hard to get it at all your science must be very sophisticated he said as they moved through the throng more advanced than ours perhaps perhaps said orkai heong phoon but i know so little of your science it would be interesting to compare such things indeed it would agreed meliadus i heard for in stance that your flying machine brought you several thousand miles in a very short space of time it was not a flying machine said orkai heong phoon no then how we call it an earth chariotit moves through the ground and how is it propelled what moves the earth away from it we are not scientists put in kaow shalang gatt we do not pretend to understand the workings of our machines we leave such things to the lowlier castes baron meliadus feeling slighted again came to a halt before the beautiful heron mask of the countess flana mikosevaar he announced her and she curtsied you are very tall she said in her throaty murmur yes very tall baron meliadus attempted to move on embarrassed by the countess as he had halfsuspected he would be he had only introduced her to fill the silence following the visitors last remark but flana reached and touched orkai heong phoons shoulder and your shoulders are very broad she said the emissary made no reply but stood stock still had she insulted him meliadus wondered he would have felt some satisfac tion if she had he did not expect the asiacommunistan to complain for he realised it was as much in the mans interests to remain on good terms with gran bretans nobles as it was in granbretans interests at this stage to remain on good terms with them may i entertain you in some way asked flana gesturing vaguely thank you but i can think of nothing at this mo ment said the man and they moved on astonished flana watched them continue their progress she had never been rejected thus before and she was intrigued she decided to explore these pos sibilities further when she could find a suitable time they were odd these taciturn creatures with their stiff movements they were like men of metal she thought could anything she wondered produce a human emo tion in them their great masks of painted leather swayed above the heads of the crowd as meliadus introduced them to jerek nankenseen and his lady the duchess falmoliva nankenseen who in her youth had ridden to battle with her husband and when the tour was completed baron meliadus returned to his golden throne wondering with increased frustration where his rival shenegar trott had disap peared to and why king huon should have deigned not to trust him with the information of trotts move ments he wanted urgently to rid himself of his charges and hurry to taragorms laboratories to discover what progress the master of the palace of time had made and whether there was any possibility of discovering the whereabouts in time or space of the hated castle brass chapter eight meliadus at the palace of time early next morning after an unsatisfactory night in which he had given up sleep and failed to find pleasure baron meliadus left to visit taragorm at the palace of time in londra there were few open streets houses pal aces warehouses and barracks were all connected by enclosed passages which in the richer sections of the city were of bright colours as if the walls were made of enamelled glass or in the poorer sections of oily dark stone meliadus was borne through these passages in a curtained litter by a dozen girl slaves all naked and with rouged bodies the only kind of slaves meliadus would have to serve him his intention was to visit taragorm before those boorish nobles of asiacommu nista were awake it could be of course that they did represent a nation helping hawkmoon and the rest but he had no proof if his hopes of taragorms discov eries were realised he might gain that proof present it to king huon vindicate himself and perhaps too rid himself of the troublesome task of playing host to the emissaries the passages widened and strange sounds began to be hearddull booms and regular mechanical noises meliadus knew that he heard taragorms clocks as he neared the entrance to the palace of time the noise became deafening as a thousand gigantic pendu lums swung at a thousand different rates as machinery whirred and shifted as jacks struck bells and gongs and cymbals mechanical birds cried and mechanical voices spoke it was an incredibly confusing din for al though the palace contained some several thousand clocks of differing sizes it was itself a gigantic clock the chief regulator for the rest and above all the other sounds came the slow ponderous echoing clack of the massive escapement lever far above near the roof and the hissing of the monstrous pendulum as it swung through the air in the hall of the pendulum where taragorm conducted most of his experiments meliaduss litter arrived at last before a relatively small set of bronze doors and mechanical men sprang forward to block the way a mechanical voice cutting through the din of the clocks to demand who visits lord taragorm at the palace of tune baron meliadus his brotherinlaw with the per mission of the king emperor replied the baron forced to shout the doors remained closed for a good deal longer meliadus thought than they should have done then opened slowly to admit the litter now they passed into a hall with curved walls of metal like the base of a clock and the noise increased the hall was full of ticks and clacks and whirrs and booms and thumps and swishes and clangs and had not the barons head been encased in its wolfhelm he would have pressed his hands to his ears as it was he began to be convinced that shortly he would become deaf they passed through this hall into another swathed in tapestries inevitably representing in highly formal ised design a hundred different timekeeping devices which muffled the worst of the noise here the girl slaves lowered the litter and baron meliadus pushed back the curtains with gauntleted hands and stood there to await the coming of his brotherinlaw again he had to wait an unconscionable time before the man appeared stepping sedately through the doors at the far end of the hall his huge clock mask nodding it is early brother said taragorm i regret i kept you waiting but i had not breakfasted meliadus reflected that taragorm had never had a decent regard for the niceties of etiquette then he snapped my apologies brother but i was anxious to see your work i am flattered this way brother taragorm turned and left through the door he had entered meliadus close on his heels through more tapestried passages they moved until at last taragorm pressed his weight against the bar locking a huge door the door opened and the air was suddenly full of the sound of a great wind the noise of a gigantic drum sounding a painfully slow beat automatically meliadus looked up and saw the pen dulum hurtling through the air above himits bob fifty tons of brass fashioned in the form of an ornate blazing sun creating a draft that fluttered all the tap estries in the halls behind them and raised meliaduss cloak like a pair of heavy silken wings the pendulum supplied the wind and the hidden escapement lever high above supplied the sound like a drum across the vast hall of the pendulum was stretched an array of machines in various stages of construction of bench es containing laboratory equipment of instruments of brass and bronze and silver of clouds of fine golden wires of webs of jewelled thread of timekeeping in strumentswaterclocks pendulum movements lever movements ball movements watches chronometers orreries astrolabes leafclocks skeleton clocks table clocks sun dialsand working on all these were tara gorms slaves scientists and engineers captured from a score of nations many of them the finest of their lands even as meliadus watched there would come a flash of purple light from one part of the hall a shower of green sparks from another a gout of scarlet smoke from elsewhere he saw a black machine crumble to dust and its attendant cough tumble forward into the dust and vanish and what was that came a laconic voice from nearby meliadus turned to see that kalan of vitall chief scientist to the kingemperor was also visiting taragorm an experiment in accelerated time said taragorm we can create the process but we cannot control it nothing so far has worked see there he pointed to a large ovoid machine of yellow glassy substance that creates the opposite effect and again unfortu nately cannot be controlled as yet the man you see beside it he indicated what meliadus had taken to be a lifelike statue some mechanical figure from a clock being repaired has been frozen thus for weeks and what of travelling through time meliadus said over there taragorm replied you see the set of silver boxes each of those houses an instrument we have created that can hurl an object through tune either back or forthwe are not sure for what dis tances living things however suffer much when undergoing the same journey few of the slaves or animals we have used have lived and none have not suffered considerable agonies and deformities if only we had believed tozer kalan said per haps then we might have discovered the secret of trav elling through time we should not have made such a joke of himbut really i could not believe that that scribbling buffoon had truly discovered the secret whats that what meliadus had heard nothing of tozer tozer the playwright i thought him dead what did he know of time travel he reappeared trying to reinstate himself in the king emperors graces with a story that he had learned how to journey through time from an old man in the westa mental trick he said we brought him here laughingly asked him to prove the truth of his words by travelling through time whereupon baron melia dus he vanished youyou made no effort to hold him it was impossible to believe him taragorm put in would you have i would have been more careful in testing him it was in his interest to return we thought besides brother we were not clutching at straws what do you mean by thatbrother retorted me liadus i mean that we are working in the spirit of pure scientific research whereas you require immediate re sults in order to continue your vendetta against castle brass i brother am a warriora man of action it does not suit me to sit about and play with toys or brood over books honour satisfied baron meliadus re turned his attention to the subject of tozer you say the playwright learned the secret from an old man in the west so he said replied kalan but i think he was lying he told us it was a mental trick he had devel oped but we did not think him capable of such disci pline still the fact remains he faded and vanished be fore our eyes why was i not told of this meliadus moaned in frustration you were still on the mainland when it took place taragorm pointed out besides we did not think it was of interest to a man of action like yourself but his knowledge could have clarified your work meliadus said you seem so casual about having lost the opportunity taragorm shrugged what can we do about it now we are progressing little by little somewhere there was a bang a man screamed and a mauve and orange flash illuminated the room and we shall soon have tamed time as we are taming space in a thousand years perhaps snorted meliadus the westan old man in the west we must lo cate him what is his name tozer told us only that he was called mygana sorcerer of considerable wisdom but as i said i be lieve he was lying after all whats in the west save desolation nothing has lived there but malformed creatures since the tragic millenium we must go there meliadus said we must leave no stone unturned no chance overlooked ill not journey to those bleak mountains on a wild goose chase said kalan with a shudder i have my work to do here fitting my new engines into ships ships to enable us to conquer the rest of the world as swiftly as we conquered europe besides i thought you too had responsibilities at home baron meliadusour visi tors damn the visitors they cost me precious time soon i shall be able to offer you all the time you require brother taragorm told him give us a little while bah i can learn nothing here your crumbling boxes and exploding machines make spectacular sights but they are useless to me play your games brother as you please ill bid you good morning feeling relieved that he no longer had to be polite to his hated brotherinlaw meliadus turned and stalked out of the hall of the pendulum through the tapestried corridors and halls back to his litter he flung himself into it grunted for the girls to bear him away as he was borne back to ms own palace meliadus considered the new information at the first opportunity he would rid himself of his charges and journey to the west to see if he could re trace tozers steps and discover the old man who held not only the secret of time but also the means of his at last exacting his full vengeance upon castle brass chapter nine interlude at castle brass at castle brass in the courtyard count brass and oladahn of the bulgar mountains straddled their horned horses and rode out through the redroofed town and away to the fens as was their habit now every morning count brass had lost some of his brooding manner and had begun to desire company again since the visit of the warrior in jet and gold elvereza tozer was held captive in a suite of rooms in one of the towers and had seemed content when bowgentle had given him supplies of paper pens and ink and told him to earn his keep with a play promis ing him an appreciative if small audience i wonder how hawkmoon fares he said as they rode together in pleasurable companionship i regret that i did not draw the straw which would have en abled me to accompany him i too said oladahn daverc was lucky a shame there were only two rings that could be usedtozers and the warriors if they return with the rest then well all be able to make war on the dark empire it was a dangerous idea friend oladahn to sug gest as the warrior suggested they visit granbretan itself and try to discover mygan of llandar in yel i have heard it said that it is often safer to dwell in the lions lair than outside it oladahn said safer still to live in a land where there are no lions count brass retorted with a small quirk of his lips well i hope the lion does not devour them that is all count brass said oladahn frowning it may be perverse of me but i still envy him his opportunity i have a feeling that we shall not long have to put up with this inaction count brass said guiding his horse along the narrow track between the reeds for it seems to me that our security is threatened from not one quarter but many it is not a possibility that worries me overmuch said oladahn but i fear for yisselda bowgentle and the ordinary folk of the town for they have no relish for the sort of activity we enjoy the two men rode on to the sea enjoying the soli tude and at the same tune yearning for the din and the action of battle count brass began to wonder if itwere not worth smashing the crystal device that was their security plunging castle brass back into the world they had left and making a fight of it even though there was no chance of defeating the hordes of the dark empire chapter ten the sights of londra the ornithopters wings thrashed at the air as the flying machine hovered over the spires of londra it was a large machine built to carry four or five people and its metal bulk gleamed with scrollwork and baroque designs meliadus bent his head over the side and pointed downward his guests leaned forward also barely po lite it seemed that their tall heavy masks would fall from their shoulders if they leaned any further there you see the palace of king huon where you are staying meliadus said indicating the crazy mag nificence of his king emperors domicile it towered above all the other buildings and was set apart from them in the very center of the city unlike most other buildings it could not be reached by a series of corri dors its four towers glowing with a light of deep gold were even now above their heads though they sat in the ornithopter well above the tops of the other build ings its tiers were thick with basreliefs depicting all manner of dark activities beloved of the empire gi gantic and grotesque statues were placed on corners of parapets seeming about to topple into the courtyards far far below the palace was blotched with every imaginable colour and all the colours clashed in such a way as to make the eye ache in a matter of seconds the palace of time said meliadus indicating the superbly ornamented palace that was also a giant clock and then my own palace this was brooding black faced with silver the river you see is of course the river tayme the river was thick with traffic its bloodred waters bore barges of bronze ebony and teak ships emblazoned with precious metal and semi precious jewels with huge white sails on which designs had been sewn or printed further to your left said baron meliadus deeply resenting this silly task is our hanging tower you will see that it appears to hang from the sky and is not rooted upon the ground this was the result of an ex periment of one of our sorcerers who managed to raise the tower a few feet but could raise it no further then it appeared he could not recall it to earthso it has remained thus ever since he showed them the quays where the great garnet burnished battleships of granbretan dispensed their stolen goods the quarter of the unmasked where lived the scum of the city the dome of the huge theatre where once tozers plays had been performed the temple of the wolf headquarters of his own order with a monstrous and grotesque stone wolf head domi nating the curve of the roof and the various other tem ples with similarly grotesque beast heads carved in stone and weighing many tons for a dull day they flew over the city stopping only to refuel the ornithopter and change pilots with melia dus growing hourly impatient he showed them all the wonders that filled that ancient and unpleasant city seeking as his king emperor had demanded to im press the visitors with the dark empires might as evening came and the setting sun stained the city with unhealthy shades baron meliadus sighed with re lief and instructed the pilot to direct the ornithopter to the landing stage on the roof of the palace it landed with a great flurry of metal wings a wheezing and a clattering and the two emissaries climbed stiffly out like the machine they remained semblances of natural life they walked to the hooded entrance of the palace and moved down the winding ramp until they were at last again in the corridors of shifting light to be met by their guard of honor six highranking warriors of the order of the mantis their insect masks reflecting the brightness from the walls who escorted them back to their own chambers where they would rest and eat leaving them at the door of their apartments baron meliadus bowed and hurried away having promised that tomorrow they should discuss matters of science and compare the progress of asiacommunista with the achievements of granbretan flinging himself through the hallucinatory passages he almost bowled over the king emperors relative flana countess of kanbery my lord he paused made to pass her stopped my lady my apologies you are in a hurry my lord i am flana you are in uneven temper it seems my temper is poor you would console yourself i have business to attend to business should be conducted with a cool head my lord perhaps if you would cool your passion he started to continue his progress then stopped again he had experienced flanas methods of consola tion before perhaps she was right perhaps he did need her on the other hand he needed to make prep arations for his expedition to the west as soon as the emissaries had departed still they would be here for some days at least also the previous night had proved unsatisfactory and his morale was low at least he could prove himself a lover perhaps he said again this time more thought fully then let us make haste to my apartments my lord said she with a trace of eagerness with mounting interest meliadus took her arm ah flana he murmured ah flana chapter eleven thoughts of the countess flana flanas motives in seeking the company of me liadus had been mixed for it was not the baron in whom she was chiefly interested but in his charges the two stifflimbed giants from the east she asked him about them as they lay in their sweat in her enormous bed and he confided his frustrations his hatred of his task and his hatred of the emis saries told her of his real ambition which was to avenge himself of his enemies the slayers of her hus band the inhabitants of castle brass told her of his discovery that tozer had found an old man in the west in the forgotten province of yel who might have the secret of reaching his foes and he murmured of his fears that he was losing his power his prestige though he knew he should not speak such secret thoughts to flana of all women and that the king emperor was these days trusting others such as shenegar trott with the knowledge that he once only gave to meliadus oh flana he said shortly before he fell into a moody sleep if you were queen together we could fulfill our empires mightiest destiny but flana scarcely heard him was scarcely think ing merely lay there and moved her heavy body from time to time for meliadus had failed to ease the aching in her soul had barely eased the craving in her loins and her mind was on the emissaries who lay sleeping only two tiers above her head at length she rose from the bed leaving meliadus snoring and moaning in his sleep and dressed herself again in gown and mask and slipped from her room to glide along the corridors up the ramps until she came at last to the doors that were guarded by the man tis warriors the insect masks turned questioningly you know who i am said she they did know and they withdrew from the doors she chose one and pressed it open entering the excit ing darkness of the emissaries apartments ft chapter twelve a revelation moonlight alone illuminated the room fall ing on a bed in which a figure stirred showing her the discarded ornaments armor and mask of the man who lay there she moved closer my lord she whispered suddenly the figure shot up in the bed and she saw his startled face saw his hands fly up to cover his fea tures and she gasped in recognition i know you who are you he leapt from beneath the silken sheets naked in the moonlight ran forward to seize her a woman aye purred she and you are a man she laughed softly not a giant at all though of goodly height your mask and armor made you seem more than a foot taller what do you want i sought to entertain you sirand be entertained but i am disappointed for i believed you to be other than human now i know you to be the man i saw in the throne room two years agothe man meliadus brought before the kingemperor so you were there that day his grip tightened on her and his hand rose to yank off her mask and cover her mouth she nibbled the fingers stroked the muscles of the other arm the hand on her mouth relaxed who are you he whispered do others know i am flana mikosevaar countess of kanbery none suspects you daring german and i will not call in the guards if that is what you expect for i have no interest in politics and no sympathy with meliadus indeed i am grateful to you for you rid me of a trou blesome spouse you are mikosevaars widow i am and you i knew immediately by the black jewel in your forehead which you sought to hide when i entered you are duke dorian hawkmoon von koln here in disguise no doubt to learn the secrets of your enemies i believe i shall have to kill you madam i have no intention of betraying you duke dorian at least not at once i came to offer myself for your pleasure that is all you have rid me of my mask she turned her golden eyes upward to regard his hand some face now you may rid me of the rest of my garb madam he said hoarsely i cannot i am mar ried she laughed as am ii have been married count less times there was sweat on his forehead as he returned her gaze and his muscles tensed madamii can not there was a sound and they both turned the door separating the apartments opened and there stood a gaunt goodlooking man who coughed a little ostentatiously and then bowed he too was com pletely naked my friend madam said huillam daverc is of a somewhat rigid moral disposition however if i can assist she moved toward him looking him up and down you seem a healthy fellow she said he turned his eyes away ah madam it is kind of you to say so but i am not not a well man on the other hand he reached out and took her shoulder guiding her into his chamber i will do what little i can to please you before this failing heart gives up on me the door closed leaving hawkmoon trembling he sat on the edge of his bed cursing himself for not having slept in his cumbersome disguise but the exhausting tour of the day had made him dispense with caution of that kind when the warrior in jet and gold had put the plan to them it had seemed un necessarily dangerous the logic had been sound enoughthey must discover if the old man from yel had been found before they went off searching for him in western granbretan but now it seemed their chances of getting such information were dashed the guards must have seen the countess enter even if they killed her or imprisoned her the guards would suspect something they were in a city that was to a man totally dedicated to their destruction they had no allies and there was no possible hope of escape once their real identities became known hawkmoon racked his brains for a plan that would at least enable them to flee the city before it became alerted but all seemed hopeless hawkmoon began to pile on his heavy robes and ar mour the only weapon he had was the golden baton which the warrior had given him to complete the im pression of a noble dignitary from asiacommunista he hefted it wishing he had a sword pacing the room he continued to try to think of a feasible plan of escape but nothing came he was still pacing when morning came and huillam daverc put his head through the door and grinned good morning hawkmoon have you had no rest man i sympathize neither have i the countess is a demanding creature however i am glad to see you ready for a journey we must hurry what do you mean daverc i have tried all night to conceive a plan but i can think of nothing i have been questioning flana of kanbery and she has told me everything we need to know for meliadus apparently has confided much in her she has also agreed to help us escape how her private ornithopter it is ours for the taking can you trust her we must listenmeliadus has not yet had time to seek out mygan of llandar by good fortune it was our arrival kept him here but he knows of him knows at least that tozer learned his secret from an old man in the westand means to find him we have the chance to find mygan first we can go part of the way by flanas ornithopter which i will fly and continue the rest of the journey on foot but we are weaponlesswithout proper clothes weapons and clothes i can obtain from flana masks also she has a thousand trophies of past con quests in her chambers we must go to her chambers now no we must wait for her to return here why because my friend meliadus may still be sleeping in her apartments have patience we are in luck pray that it will hold not much later flana returned took off her mask and kissed daverc almost hesitantly as a young girl might kiss a lover her features seemed softer and her eyes less haunted as if she had found some quality in davercs lovemaking that she had not experienced be forepossibly gentleness which was not a quality of the men of granbretan he is gone she said and i have half a mind huillam to keep you here for myself for many years i have contained a need which i could not express never satisfy you have come close to satisfying it he bent and kissed her lightly on the lips and his voice seemed sincere when he said and you too flana have given me something he straightened stiffly having donned his heavy builtup garments he placed his tall mask upon his head come we must hurry before the palace wakes hawkmoon followed davercs example donning his own helmet and once again the two resembled strange halfhuman creatures the emissaries from asiacommunista now flana led them from the apartments past the mantis guards who fell in behind them and through the twisting shining corridors until her own apartments were reached they ordered the guards to remain out side they will report that they followed us here daverc said you will be suspected flana she doffed her heron mask and smiled no she said and crossed the deep carpet to a polished chest set with diamonds she raised the lid and took out a long pipe at the end of which was a soft bulb this bulb contains a poison spray she said once inhaled the poison turns the victim mad so that he runs wild and berserk before dying the guards will run through many corridors before they perish i have used it be fore it always works she spoke so sweetly of murder that hawkmoon was forced to shudder all i need do you see she continued is to push the hollow rod through the keyhole and squeeze the bulb she placed the apparatus on the lid of the chest and led them through several splendid eccentrically fur nished rooms until they came to a chamber with a huge window that looked out onto a broad balcony there on the balcony its wings neatly folded fash ioned to resemble a beautiful scarlet and silver heron was flanas ornithopter she hurried to another part of the room and drew back a curtain there in a great pile was her booty clothes masks and weapons of all her departed lovers and husbands take what you need she murmured and hurry hawkmoon selected a doublet of blue velvet hose of black doeskin a swordbelt of brocaded leather which held a long beautifully balanced blade and a poignard for his mask he took one of his slain ene mysasrovaak mikosevaarsglowering vulture masks daverc dressed himself in a suit of deep yellow with a cloak of lustrous blue boots of deerhide and a blade similar to hawkmoons he too took a vulture mask reasoning that two of the same order would be likely to be travelling together now they looked truly great nobles of granbretan flana opened the window and they stepped out into the cold foggy morning farewell whispered flana i must get back to the guards farewell huillam daverc i hope we shall meet again i hope so also flana replied daverc with un usual gentleness of tone farewell he climbed into the cockpit of the ornithopter and started the motor hawkmoon hastily got in behind him the things wings began to beat at the air and with a clatter of metal it rose into the gloomy sky of londra turning west chapter thirteen king huons displeasure many emotions conflicted in baron melia dus as he entered the throne room of his king em peror abased himself and began the long trudge toward the throne globe the white fluid of the globe surged more agitatedly than usual alarming the baron he was at once furious that the emissaries had disappeared nervous of his monarchs wrath anxious to pursue his quest for the old man who could give him the means of reaching castle brass also he feared lest he lose his power and his pride and the king had been known to do it be fore be banished to the quarter of the unmasked his nervous fingers brushed his wolfhelm and his step fal tered as he neared the throne globe and looked anx iously up at the foetuslike shape of his monarch great king emperor it is your servant meliadus he fell to his knees and bowed to the ground servant you have not served us very well melia dus i am sorry noble majesty but but but i could have no knowledge that they planned to leave last night returning by the means with which they came it should have been your business to sense their plans meliadus sense sense their plans mighty monarch your instinct is failing you meliadus once it was exactyou acted according to its dictates now your silly plans for vengeance fill your brain and being and make you blind to all else meliadus those emis saries slew six of my best guards how they killed them i know notperhaps a mental spell of some landbut kill them they did somehow leaving the palace and returning to whatever machine brought them here they have discovered much about us and we meliadus have discovered virtually nothing about them we know a little of their military equipment do we men can lie you know meliadus we are displeased with you we charged you to perform a duty and you performed it only partially and without your full attention you spent time at taragorms pal ace left the emissaries to their own devices when you should have been entertaining them you are a fool meliadus a fool sire i it is your stupid obsession with that handful of outlaws who dwell in castle brass is it the girl you de sire is that why you seek them with such singleminded ness i fear they threaten the empire noble sire so does asiacommunista threaten our empire baron meliaduswith real swords and real armies and real ships that can travel through the earth baron you must forget your vendetta against castle brass or we warn you you had best be wary of our displeasure but sire we have warned you baron meliadus put castle brass from your mind instead try to learn all you can of the emissaries discover where their machine met them how they managed to leave the city redeem yourself in our eyes baron meliadusrestore your self to your old prestige aye sire baron meliadus said through gritted teeth controlling his anger and chagrin the audience is at an end meliadus thank you said meliadus blood pounding in his head sire he backed away from the throne globe he turned on his heel and began to pace the long hall he reached the jewelled doors pushed past the guards and strode down the gleaming corridors of shift ing light on he marched and on his pace rapid and his movements stiff his hand white on the hilt of his sword which it gripped tightly he paced until he had reached the great reception hall of the palace where waited the nobles craving audience with the king emperor descended the steps that led to the gates opening on the outer worlds signed for his girls to come forward with his litter clambered into it and dumped himself heavily on its cushions and allowed himself to be borne back to his black and silver palace now he hated his king emperor now he loathed the creature who had humiliated him so thwarted him so insulted him so king huon was a fool not to realise the potential danger offered by castle brass such a fool was not fit to reign not fit to command slaves let alone baron meliadus grand constable of the order of the wolf meliadus would not listen to king huons stupid orders would do what he thought best and if the king emperor objected then he would defy him a little later meliadus left his palace on horseback he rode at the head of twenty men twenty hand picked men whom he could trust to follow him any whereeven to yel chapter fourteen the wastes of yel the countess flanas ornithopter dropped closer and closer to the ground its belly brushing the tops of tall pines its wings narrowly missing becom ing entangled with the branches of birches until at last it landed on the wiry heather beyond the forest the day was cold and a sharp wind whistled across the heath biting through their flimsy costumes shivering they clambered from the flying machine and looked warily about them no one was in sight daverc reached into his jerkin and produced a scrap of thin leather on which a map was scrawled he pointed we go in that direction now we must get the ornithopter into the woods and hide it why cannot we leave it the chances of anyone finding it for a day or so are slim hawkmoon said but daverc spoke seriously i do not wish any harm to come to countess flana hawkmoon if the machine were discovered it could be ill for her come and so they tugged and shoved at the metal ma chine until it was in the pinewood and thickly covered with brash it had borne them as far as it could until its fuel gave out they had not expected it to carry them the whole way to yel now they must continue on foot for four days they walked through woods and across heaths the terrain gradually becoming less and less fertile as they neared the borders of yel then one day hawkmoon paused and pointed look davercthe mountains of yel and there they were in the distance their purple peaks in cloud the plain and the foothills beneath them all tawny yellow rock it was a wild beautiful landscape such as hawk moon had never seen before he gasped so there are some sights in granbre tan not entirely offensive to the eye daverc aye it is pretty daverc agreed but daunting also we have to find mygan there somewhere judging by the map llandar is still many miles into those mountains then let us press on hawkmoon adjusted his sword belt we had a small advantage over meliadus to begin with but it is possible that even now he is on his way to yel in hot quest of mygan daverc stood on one leg and ruefully rubbed his foot true but i fear these boots will not last the distance i picked them from pride for their prettiness not for their sturdiness i am learning my mistake hawkmoon clapped him on the shoulder ive heard wild ponies roam these parts pray we find a couple we can tame but no wild ponies could be found and the yellow ground was hard and rocky and the sky above became full of a livid radiance hawkmoon and daverc began to realise why the folk of granbretan were so super stitious of this region for there did seem to be some thing unnatural about both land and sky at last the mountains were entered seen close to these were also of a yellowish color though with streaks of dark red and green all glassy and grim strangelooking beasts skittered away from their path as they clambered on over jagged rocks and peculiar manlike creatures with hairy bodies topped by completely hairless heads measuring less than a foot high regarded them from cover they were once men those creatures daverc said their ancestors dwelt in these parts but the tragic millenium did its work here well how do you know this hawkmoon asked him i have read my books it was in yel worse than any other part of granbretan that the tragic millenniums effects were felt that is why it is so desolate for peo ple will not come here any longer save tozerand the old man mygan of llandar ayeif tozer spoke the truth we could still be on a wild goose chase hawkmoon but meliadus had the same story perhaps tozer is merely a consistent liar it was close to nightfall when the mountain creatures came scuttling from their caves high above and at tacked hawkmoon and daverc they were covered in oily fur with the beaks of birds and the claws of cats huge eyes blazing beaks parting to reveal teeth emitting a horrible hissing sound there were three females and about six males as far as they could tell in the semidarkness hawkmoon drew his sword adjusting his vulture mask as he would adjust an ordinary helm and set his back to a wall of rock daverc took up a position beside him then the beasts were on them hawkmoon slashed at the first carving a long bloody scar across its chest it recoiled with a shriek a second was taken by daverc stabbed through the heart hawkmoon neatly slit the throat of a third but a fourths claws were gripping his left arm he struggled muscles straining as he tried to turn his dagger upward to stab the creatures wrist while mean while he slashed at one trying to take him from the other side hawkmoon coughed and felt nauseous for the beasts stank horribly he at last wrenched his hand round and dug the point of his dagger into its forearm it grunted and let go instantly hawkmoon drove the blade of the dagger deep into one staring eye and left the weapon there as he turned to deal with the next creature it was dark now and hard to make out how many of the beasts were left daverc was holding his own shouting filthy insults at the creatures as his blade moved rapidly this way and that hawkmoons foot slipped on blood and he staggered catching the small of his back on a spur of rock with a hiss another beaked beast was on him clutching him in a bearlike grip pinning both arms to his sides the beak snapping at his face and closing with a snap on the vulture visor hawkmoon sweated to break the grip tore his head from the mask leaving it in the creatures beak wrenched the things arms apart and punched it heavily in the chest it staggered in surprise not realising that the vulture mask had not been part of hawkmoons body quickly hawkmoon drove ms sword into its heart and turned to assist daverc who had two of the things on him hawkmoon lopped ones head completely from its shoulders and was about to attack the next when it re leased daverc and screamed rushing off into the night clutching part of his jerkin they had accounted for all but one of their disgust ing attackers daverc was panting wounded slightly in the chest where the claws had ripped his jerkin away hawkmoon ripped up a piece of his cloak and padded the wound no great harm done said daverc he yanked off his battered vulture mask and flung it away those came in useful but ill wear mine no longer since i see youve discarded yours that jewel in your forehead is unmistakable so theres no point in my continuing to disguise myself he grinned i told you the tragic millenium had produced some ugly creatures friend hawkmoon i believe you smiled hawkmoon come we had best find a place to camp for the night tozer marked a safe resting spot on his map bring it out into the star light so we can read it daverc reached into his jerkin and then his jaw dropped in horror oh hawkmoon we are not so lucky why so my friend that section of my jerkin the creature carried off contained the pocket in which i had the map supplied by tozer we are lost hawkmoon hawkmoon cursed sheathed his sword and frowned theres nothing for it he said we must trail the beast it was slightly wounded and might have left a trail of blood perhaps it has dropped the map on its way back to its lair failing that we shall have to follow it all the way to where it lives and find a means of getting back our map when we arrive daverc frowned is it worth it can we not remem ber where we are bound not well enough come daverc hawkmoon began to clamber over the sharp rocks in the direction in which the creature had disappeared and daverc came reluctantly after him luckily the sky was clear and the moon bright and hawkmoon at last saw some gleaming patches on the rocks that must have been blood a bit further on he saw more patches this way daverc he called his mend sighed shrugged and followed the search went on until dawn when hawkmoon lost the trail and shook his head they were high up on a mountain slope with a good view of two valleys be low them he ran his hand through his blond hair and he sighed no sign of the thing and yet i was sure now we are worse off daverc said absently rubbing his weary eyes no mapand no longer even on our original trail i am sorry daverc i thought it the best plan hawkmoons shoulders sagged then suddenly he brightened and pointed there i saw something moving come on and he was sprinting along the shelf of rock to disappear from davercs sight daverc heard a shout of surprise and then a sud den silence the frenchman drew his sword and followed after his friend wondering what he had met with then he saw the source of hawkmoons amaze ment there far below in a valley was a city all made of metal with shiny surfaces of red gold orange blue and green with curving metal roadways and sharp metal towers it was plain to see even from here that the city was deserted and falling to pieces with rusting walls and adornments hawkmoon stood looking down at it he pointed there was their remaining antagonist of the night be fore sliding down the rocky sides of the mountain to ward the city that must be where he lives hawkmoon said i like not to follow him down there daverc murmured there could be poison airthe air that makes your flesh crumple from your face that causes vomiting and death the poison air does not exist any more daverc and you know it it only lasts for a while and then disappears surely there has been no poison air here for centuries he began to clamber down the mountain in pursuit of his foe who still clutched the piece of jerkin containing tozers map oh very well groaned daverc lets seek death together and once again he began to follow in his friends wake you are a wild impatient gentleman duke von koln while loose stones rattled down and made the crea ture they pursued run all the faster towards the city hawkmoon and daverc gave chase as best they could for they were unused to mountainous terrain and davercs boots were almost in shreds they saw the beast enter the shadows of the metal city and disappear a few moments later they too had reached the city and looked up in some trepidation at the huge metal structures that loomed into the sky creating menac ing shadows below hawkmoon noticed some more bloodstains and threaded his way between the struts and pylons of the city peering with difficulty in the murky light and then suddenly there was a clicking sound a hissing sound a peculiar land of subdued growl and the creature was upon him its claws about his throat digging deeper and deeper he felt one pierce then another he whipped up his own hands and tried to prise the clawed fingers away felt the beak snap at the back of his neck then there was a wild shriek and a yell and the claws released his throat hawkmoon staggered round to see daverc sword in hand looking down at the body of the beaked beast the disgusting creature had no brains said daverc lightly what a fool it was to attack you and leave me free to slay it from behind he extended his arm and delicately skewered the missing piece of cloth that had fallen from the dead things claw heres our map as good as ever hawkmoon wiped blood from his throat the claws had not pierced too deeply the poor thing he said no softness now hawkmoon you know how it alarms me to hear you speaking thus remember the creatures attacked us i wonder why there should be no shortage of their natural prey in these mountainsthere are all kinds of edible creatures why feast on us either we were the nearest meat they saw daverc suggested looking about him at the lattice of metal everywhere or else they have learned to hate men daverc resheathed his sword with a flourish and began to make his way through the forest of metal struts that supported the towers and streets of the city above them refuse lay everywhere and there were bits of dead animals offal rotting unidentifiable stuff lets explore this city while were here daverc said climbing up one girder we could sleep here hawkmoon consulted the map its marked he said halapandurs its name not too far to the east of where our mysterious philosopher has his cavern how far about a days march in these mountains lets rest here and press on tomorrow daverc suggested hawkmoon frowned for a moment then he shrugged very well he too began to clamber up through the girders until they reached one of the strange curving metal streets well strike out for yonder tower suggested daverc they began to walk along the gently sloping ramp towards a tower that gleamed turquoise and sultry scarlet in the sunshine chapter fifteen the deserted cavern at the base of the tower was a small door that had been driven inwards as if by the punching of a giant fist clambering through the aperture hawk moon and daverc tried to peer through the gloom to see what the tower contained there said hawkmoon a stairwayor some thing very like one they stumbled over rubble and discovered that it was not a stairway leading up into the higher parts of the tower but a ramp not unlike the ramps that con nected one building to another in the city itself from what ive read this place was built only shortly before the tragic millenium daverc told hawkmoon as they continued up the ramp it was a city wholly given over to scientistsa research city i believe they called it every kind of scientist came here from all parts of the world the idea was that new discoveries would be made by crossfertilisation if my memory serves me the legends say that many strange inventions were created here though most of their secrets are now completely lost up they went until the ramp led them onto a wide platform which was completely surrounded by win dows of glass most of the windows were cracked or completely blown out but from this platform it was possible to see the whole of the rest of the city almost certainly this was used to view the goings off all over halapandur hawkmoon said he looked about him everywhere were the remains of instru ments whose function he could not recognize they bore the stamp of things prehistoric all in dull plain cases with austere characters engraved on them to tally unlike the baroque decoration and flowing num erals and letters of modern times some sort of room controlling the functions of the rest of halapandur daverc pursed his lips and pointed ayyou can observe its uses at once look hawkmoon some distance away on the opposite side of the city from the one they had entered could be seen a line of horsemen in the helmets and armour of dark empire troops they could make out no details from this height my guess is that meliadus leads them hawkmoon said fingering his sword he cannot know exactly where mygan is but he can have discovered that tozer was in this city at some time and hell have trackers with him wholl soon discover mygans cave we cannot afford to rest here now daverc we must press on at once daverc nodded a shame he stooped and picked up a small object he had seen on the floor plac ing it in his tattered jerkin i think i recognise this what is it it could be one of the charges used for the old guns they used daverc said if so it will be useful but you have no old gun one does not always need one said daverc mysteriously they ran back down the ramp to the entrance of the tower risking being seen by the dark empire war riors they dashed along the large outer ramps as fast as they could then swung back again down the girders and out of sight i dont think we were seen daverc said come onwe go this way for mygans lair they began to race up the side of the mountain slithering and sliding in their anxiety to reach the old sorcerer before meliadus night came but they moved on they were starving for they had eaten practically nothing since they had set out for llandar valley and they were beginning to weaken but they struggled on and just before dawn came to the valley marked on the map the valley where the sorcerer mygan was said to live hawkmoon began to smile those dark empire riders will have camped for the night almost certainly well have time to see mygan get his crystals and be away before they ever arrive lets hope so said daverc thinking privately that hawkmoon needed rest for his eyes were a little fever ish but he followed him down to the valley and con sulted the map up there he said thats where mygans caves supposed to be but i see nothing the map has it halfway up yonder cliff said hawkmoon let us climb up and see they crossed the floor of the valley leaping over a small clear stream that ran down a fissure in the rock the length of the valley here there were indeed signs of man for there was a path down to the river and a wooden apparatus that had evidently been used for drawing up water from the stream they followed the path to the side of the cliff now they found old worn handholds in the rock they had not been carved recently but had been there it appeared for ages well before mygan had been born they began to climb the going was difficult but at last they reached a ledge of rock on which a huge boulder stood and there behind the boulder was the dark entrance to a cavern hawkmoon went forward eager to enter but daverc put a cautionary hand on his shoulder best take care he said and drew his sword an old man cannot harm us hawkmoon said you are tired my friend and exhausted other wise you would realise that an old man of the wisdom tozer claimed for him will possibly have weapons which could harm us he has no liking for men from what tozer said and there is no reason why he should think us anything more than enemies hawkmoon nodded drew his own blade and then advanced the cavern was dark and seemingly empty but then they saw a glimmer of light from the back approach ing the source of this light they discovered a sharp bend in the cavern rounding the bend they saw that the first cavern led on to a second much larger this was fitted up with all sorts of things instruments of the kind they had seen in halapandur a couple of cots cooking mate rials chemical equipment and much more the source of the light was a globe in the center of the cave mygan called daverc but there was no reply they searched the cave wondering if there was yet another extension but found nothing he has gone hawkmoon said in desperation his nervous fingers rubbing at the black jewel in his fore head gone daverc and who knows where per haps after tozer left him he decided that it was no longer safe to remain and has moved on i think not daverc said he would have taken some of this stuff with him would he not he looked around the cave and that cot looks recently slept in there is no dust anywhere mygan has probably gone off on some local expedition and will be back soon we must wait for him and what of meliadusif that was meliadus we saw we must simply hope he moves slowly on the trail and takes some time to discover this cave if hes as eager as you said flana told you then hell not be far behind us hawkmoon pointed out he went to a bench on which there were various dishes of meat vegetables and herbs helping himself greedily daverc followed his example well rest here and wait daverc said it is all we can do now my friend a day passed and a night and hawkmoon hourly grew impatient as the old man did not return suppose he has been captured he suggested to daverc suppose meliadus found him wandering in the mountains if so then meliadus is bound to bring him back here and we shall win the old mans gratitude by res cuing him from the baron daverc replied with forced cheerfulness there were twenty men we saw armed with flame lances if i was not mistaken we cannot take twenty daverc you are in low spirits hawkmoon we have taken twenty beforemore aye hawkmoon agreed but it was plain that the journey had taken much out of him perhaps too the deception at the court of king huon had been a great er strain on him than on daverc for daverc ap peared to relish deception of that kind at length hawkmoon strode to the outer cave and onto the ledge beyond some instinct seemed to draw him out for he looked into the valley and saw them now it was close enough to be sure the leader of the men was indeed baron meliadus his ornate wolf mask glinted ferociously as it turned up and saw hawkmoon at the instant hawkmoon looked down the great roaring voice echoed through the moun tains it was a voice full of mingled rage and triumph the voice of a wolf that has scented its prey hawkmoon came the cry hawkmoon meliadus flung himself from ms saddle and began to scale the cliff hawkmoon behind him came his wellarmed men and hawk moon knew there was little chance of fighting them all off he called back into the cavern davercmelia dus is here quickly man hell trap us in these caves we must reach the top of the cliff daverc came running from the cavern buckling on his sword belt glanced down thought for a moment then nodded hawkmoon ran to the face of the cliff seeking handholds on the rough surface hauling him self upward a flamelance beam splashed against the rock close to his hand singeing the hairs on his wrist another landed beneath him but he climbed on perhaps at the top of the cliff he could stand and make a fight but he needed to protect his life and davercs for as long as possible for the security of castle brass could depend on it haaawkmoooon came the echoing cry of the vengeful meliadus haaaawkmoooooon hawkmoon climbed on scraping his hands on the rock gashing his leg but not pausing taking incredi ble risks as he clambered up the cliff face daverc close behind him at last they reached the top and saw a plateau stretching away from them if they attempted to cross it the flamelances were bound to cut them down now hawkmoon said grimly drawing his sword we stand and fight daverc grinned at last i thought you were los ing your nerve my friend they glanced over the edge of the cliff and saw that baron meliadus had reached the ledge by mygans cavern and was darting in sending his men on ahead in pursuit of his two hated foes doubtless he hoped to find some of the others thereoladahn count brass or even perhaps yisselda whom hawkmoon knew was loved by the baron however much he refused to admit it soon the first of the wolf warriors had reached the cliff and hawkmoon delivered a jarring kick to his helmet he did not fall however but reached out and clutched hawkmoons foot either trying to drag him self back to safety or drag hawkmoon with him over the cliff daverc sprang forward stabbing the man in the shoulder he grunted released the grip on hawkmoon sought to grasp a spur of rock on the cliff edge missed and tumbled backwards arms flailing to yell one long yell all the way to the floor of the valley far far be low but now others were clambering over the edge daverc engaged one while hawkmoon suddenly found himself with two to contend with back and forth along the edge of the cliff they fought the valley hundreds of feet below them hawkmoon took one in the throat between helm and gorget neatly skewered another through the belly where his armour did not reach but two more quickly took their place they fought for an hour thus keeping back as many as they could from gaining the top of the cliff engaging with their swords those they could not dissuade from getting to the top then they were surrounded the swords pressing in on them like the teeth of some gigantic shark until their throats were threatened by a band of blades and meliaduss voice came from somewhere full of gloat ing malice surrender gentlemen or youll be butch ered i promise hawkmoon and daverc lowered their swords glancing hopelessly at each other they both knew that meliadus hated them with a terrible consuming hatred now they were his prison ers in his own land there was no possibility of escape meliadus seemed to realize this too for he cocked his wolf mask on one side and chuckled i do not know how you came to granbretan hawk moon and daverc but i do know you now for a pair of fools were you too seeking the old man why i wonder you already have what he has perhaps he has other things said hawkmoon deliberately attempting to obscure the matter as much as possible for the less meliadus knew the more chance they had of deceiving him other things you mean he has other devices use ful to the empire thanks for telling me hawkmoon the old man himself will doubtless be more specific the old man has left meliadus said daverc smoothly we warned him you might be coming left eh if thats the case youll know where he has gone sir huillam not i said daverc looking peeved as the war riors bound him and hawkmoon together and tied a noose under their arms well see meliadus chuckled again i appreciate the excuse you offer me to begin a little torture here and now a soupcon of vengeance for the moment well explore the full possibilities when we return to my palace then too perhaps ill have the old man and his secret of travelling through the dimensions privately he told himself that he was bound in this way to reinstate himself with the king emperor and achieve huons forgiveness for leaving the city without permission his gauntleted hand reached out to stroke hawk moons face almost lovingly ah hawkmoonsoon you shall feel my punishment soon hawkmoon shuddered to the roots of his being then spat full into the grinning wolf mask meliadus recoiled hand going up to mask then sweeping out and striking hawkmoon across the mouth he growled in rage another moment of anguish for that hawkmoon and those moments i promise you will seem to last for aeons hawkmoon turned his head away in disgust and pain was thrust roughly forward by the guards and pushed together with sir huillam daverc over the edge of the cliff the rope around their bodies stopped them from falling far but they were lowered ungently to the ledge and meliadus joined them shortly i must still find the old man said the baron i suspect hes lurking somewhere hereabouts well leave you well bound in the cavern put a couple of guards at the entrance just in case you somehow free yourselves from your bonds and set off to look for him there is no escape for you now hawkmoon none for you either daverc you are both mine at last drag them inside bind them with all the rope you can find rememberguard them well for they are meliaduss playthings he watched as they were trussed and dragged into the nearer cavern meliadus placed three men at the en trance of the cavern and began to clamber back down the cliff in high spirits it would not be much longer he promised himself before all his enemies were in his power all their secrets had been tortured from them and then the king emperor would know that he had spoken the truth and if the king emperor did not think well of him what matter meliadus had plans to right that error also chapter sixteen mygan of llandar night fell outside the cavern and hawkmoon and daverc lay in the shadow cast by the light from the second cave the broad backs of the guards filled the entrance and the ropes of their bonds were tightbound and con siderable hawkmoon tried to struggle but his movements were virtually restricted to moving his mouth his eyes and his neck a little daverc was in a similar posi tion well my friend we were not cautious enough daverc said with as light a tone as he could muster no hawkmoon agreed starvation and weariness makes fools of even the wisest of men we have only ourselves to blame we deserve our suffering daverc said somewhat doubtfully but do our friends we must think of escape hawkmoon no matter how hopeless it seems hawkmoon sighed aye if meliadus should suc ceed in reaching castle brass he shuddered it seemed to him from his brief encounter with the granbretanian nobleman that meliadus was even more deranged than previously was it his defeat several times by hawkmoon and the folk of castle brass was it the thwarting of his victory when castle brass had been spirited away hawkmoon could not guess he only knew that his old enemy seemed less in control of his mind than earlier there was no telling what he would do in such an unbalanced condition hawkmoon turned his head frowning thinking he had heard a noise from within the far cavern from where he lay he could see a little of the lighted cave he craned his neck hearing the sound again daverc murmured very softly so that the guards should not hear there is someone in there ill swear and then a shadow fell across them and they stared up into the face of a tall old man with a great rugged face that seemed carved from stone and a mane of white hair that helped his leonine appearance the old man frowned looking the bound men up and down he pursed his lips and looked out to where the three guards stood at attention looked back at hawkmoon and daverc he said nothing simply folded his arms across his chest hawkmoon saw that there were crystal rings on his fingersall but the little finger of the left hand bore rings even the thumbs this must be mygan of llandar but how had he got into the cave a secret entrance hawkmoon looked at him desperately mouthing his pleas for help the giant smiled again and bent forward a little so that he could hear hawkmoons whisper please sir if you be mygan of llandar know that we are friends to youprisoners of your enemies and how do i know you speak truth said mygan also in a whisper one of the guards stirred outside beginning to turn doubtless sensing something mygan withdrew into the cavern the guard grunted what are you two muttering about discussing what the baron will do with ye eh well you cant imagine what entertainments hes got fixed up for you hawkmoon hawkmoon made no reply when the guard had turned back chuckling mygan bent closer again youre hawkmoon youve heard of me something if youre hawkmoon you may be speak ing the truth for though i be of granbretan i hold no brief for the lords who rule in londra but how do you know who my enemies are baron meliadus of kroiden has learned of the secret you imparted to tozer who was your guest here not long ago imparted he wheedled it from me stole one of my rings when i slept used it to escape wanted to ingratiate himself with his masters in londra i gath er you are right tozer told them of a power boasted that it was a mental attribute demonstrated his power and turned up in the kamarg doubtless by accident he had no conception of how to use the ring properly so we gathered i believe you hawkmoon and i fear this melia dus youll free us so that we can attempt to escape from here protect you against him i doubt if i need your protection mygan disappeared from hawkmoons view what does he plan i wonder said daverc who had deliberately remained silent until now hawkmoon shook his head mygan reappeared with a long knife in his hand he stretched out and began slicing through hawkmoons bonds until at last the duke von koln was able to free himself keeping a wary eye on the guards outside hand me the knife he whispered and took it from mygans hand he began cutting away davercs ropes from outside they heard voices baron meliadus is returning one of the guards said he sounds in an evil temper hawkmoon darted an anxious glance at daverc and they sprang up alerted by the movement one of the guards turned crying out in surprise the two men darted forward hawkmoons hand stopped the guard from drawing his sword davercs arm went round anothers throat and drew his sword for him the sword rose and fell even before the guard could scream while hawkmoon wrestled with the first guard daverc engaged the third the clang of swords be gan to sound in the air and they heard meliaduss shout of surprise hawkmoon threw his opponent to the ground and placed a knee in his groin drew the dagger that was still sheathed at his side prised back the mask and struck the man in the throat meanwhile daverc had despatched his man stood panting over the corpse mygan called from the back of the cavern i see you wear crystal rings like those i have do you know how to control them we know only how to return to the kamarg a turn to the left aye well hawkmoon i would help you you must turn the crystals first to the right and then to the left repeat the movement six times and then the great bulk of meliadus loomed in the entrance to the cavern oh hawkmoonyou plague me still the old man seize him the rest of meliaduss warriors began to surge into the cavern daverc and hawkmoon fell back before them desperately fighting the old man shouted in fury trespassers back he rushed forward with his long knife raised no cried hawkmoon myganlet us do the blade work keep away you are defenceless against such as these but mygan did not retreat hawkmoon tried to reach him saw him go down before a blow from a wolf sword struck out at the one who had struck mygan the cavern was in confusion as they retreated back into the inner cave the sound of the swords echoed counterpointed by meliaduss enraged shouts hawkmoon dragged the wounded mygan back to the second cave warding off the blows that fell upon them both now hawkmoon faced the singing blade of meliadus himself who swung his sword twohanded hawkmoon felt a numbing shock in his left shoul der felt blood begin to soak his sleeve he parried a further blow then struck back taking meliadus in the arm the baron groaned and staggered now daverc called hawkmoon now mygan turn the crystals it is our only hope of escape he turned the crystal in his ring first to the right and then to the left then six times more to right and left meliadus growled and came at him again hawkmoon raised his sword to block the blow and then meliadus had vanished so had the cavern so had his friends he stood alone upon a plain that stretched flat in all directions it was noon for a huge sun hung in the sky the plain was of turf of a kind that grew close to the ground and the smell it gave off reminded hawkmoon of spring where was he had mygan tricked him where were the others then the figure of mygan of llandar began to materialize close by lying on the turf and clutching at his worst wound he was covered in a dozen sword cuts his leonine face pale and twisted with pain hawk moon sheathed his sword and sprang towards him mygan ah im dying i fear hawkmoon but at least ive served in the shaping of your destiny the rune staff my destiny what do you mean and what of the runestaff ive heard so much of that mysterious artifact and yet no one will tell me exactly how it concerns me youll learn when its time meanwhile suddenly daverc appeared staring around him in astonishment the things work thank the runestaff for that id thought us all surely slain youyou must seek mygan began to cough blood spurted from between his teeth falling down his chin hawkmoon cradled his head in his arms do not try to speak mygan you are badly wounded we must find help perhaps if we returned to castle brass mygan shook his head you cannot cannot return but why the rings worked to bring us here a turn to the left no once you have shifted in this way the rings must be reset how shall we set them i will not tell you will not you mean cannot no it was my intention to bring you through space to this land where you must fulfill part of your destiny you must seekah ah the pain you have tricked us old man said daverc you wish us to play some role in a scheme of your own but you are dying we cannot help you now tell us how to return to castle brass and we shall get someone to doctor you it was no selfish whim that instructed me to bring you here it was knowledge of history i have travelled to many places visited many eras by means of the rings i know much i know what you serve hawk moon and i know that the time has come for you to venture here where hawkmoon said desperately in what time have you deposited us what is the land called it seems to consist entirely of this flat plain but mygan was coughing blood again and it was plain that death was close take my rings he said breathing with difficulty they could be useful but seek first narleen and the sword of the dawnthat lies to your south then turn north when thats done and seek the city of dnark and the runestaff he coughed again then his body shook with a great spasm and life fled him hawkmoon looked up at daverc the runestaff are we then in asiacommunista where the thing is supposed to dwell it would be ironic considering our earlier ruse said daverc dabbing with his kerchief at a wound on his leg perhaps that is where we are i care not we are away from that boorish meliadus and his blood thirsty pack the sun above is warm save for our wounds we are considerably better off than we might have been looking about him hawkmoon sighed i am not sure if taragorms experiments are successful he could find a way through to our kamarg i would rather be there than here he fingered his ring i won der daverc put out his hand no hawkmoon do not tamper with it im inclined to believe the old man besides he seemed welldisposed toward you he must have meant you well probably he intended to tell you where this was give you more explicit directions as to how to reach the placespresuming they were placeshe spoke of if we try to work the rings now theres no telling where well find ourselvespossibly even back in that unpleasant company we left in mygans cave hawkmoon nodded perhaps youre wise daverc but what do we do now first we do as mygan said and remove his rings then we head southto that placewhat did he call it narleen it could be a person a thing south at any rate we go to find out if this narleen be place person or thing come he bent beside the corpse of mygan of llandar and began to strip the crystal rings from his fingers from what i saw of his cavern its almost certain that he found these in the city of halapandur that equipment he had in his cave evidently came from there these must have been one of the inventions of those people before the onset of the tragic millenium but hawkmoon was barely listening to him instead he was pointing out across the plain look the wind was blowing up in the distance something gigantic and reddish pur ple came rolling emitting lightnings book two as the champion eternal served the rune staff so had mygan of llandar and the philosopher of yel had seen fit to deposit hawkmoon in a strange unfriendly land giving him little information in order as he saw it to further the runestaffs cause so many destinies were interlinked nowthe kamargs with granbretans granbretans with asiacommunista asiacommunistass with ama rehkhawkmoons with davercs davercs with flanas flanas with meliaduss meliaduss with king huons king huons with shenegar trotts shenegar trotts with hawkmoons and all this on only one of earths many planesso many destinies weaving to gether to do the runestaffs work which was begun when meliadus swore upon the runestaff his great oath of vengeance against the inhabitants of castle brass and thus set the pattern of events paradoxes and iro nies were all apparent in the fabric would become in creasingly clearer to those whose fates were woven into it and while hawkmoon wondered where he was placed in time or space king huons scientists per fected more powerful war machines that helped the armies of the dark empire spread faster and further across the globe to stain the map with blood the high history of the runestaff chapter one zhenakteng hawkmoon and daverc watched the strange sphere approach and then wearily drew their swords they were in rags their bodies all bloody their faces pale with the strain of the fight and there was little hope in their eyes ah i could do with the amulets power now said hawkmoon of the red amulet which on the war riors advice he had left behind at castle brass daverc smiled wanly i could do with some ordin ary mortal energy he said still we must do our best duke dorian he straightened his shoulders the thundering sphere came closer bouncing over the turf it was a huge thing full of flashing colors and there was no question of swords being useful against it it rolled to a halt with a dying growling noise and stopped close by towering over them then it began to hum and a split appeared at its centre widening out until it seemed the sphere would split in two from it appeared white delicate smoke drifting in a cloud to the ground the cloud now began to disperse and a tall well proportioned figure was revealed his long fair hair held from his eyes by a silver coronet his bronzed body clad in a short divided kilt of light brown color he appeared to have no weapons hawkmoon looked at him warily who are you he said what do you want the occupant of the sphere smiled thats a ques tion i should ask you he said in a peculiar accent you have been in a fight i seeand one of your number is dead he seems old to have been a war rior who are you hawkmoon asked again you are singleminded warrior i am zhenakteng of the family of teng tell me who you fought here was it the charki the name means nothing we fought no one here daverc said we are travellers those we fought are a great distance away now we came here fleeing them and yet your wounds look fresh you will ac company me back to tengkampp that is your city we do not have cities come we can help you dress your wounds perhaps even revive your friend impossible he is dead we can revive the dead as often as not the hand some man said airily will you come with me hawkmoon shrugged why not he and daverc lifted the body of mygan between them and advanced towards the sphere zhenakteng leading the way they saw that the interior of the sphere was in fact a cabin in which several men could sit comfort ably doubtless the thing was a familiar form of trans port here for zhenakteng made no effort to help them leaving them to work out for themselves where they should sit and how they should position them selves he waved his hand over the control board of the sphere and the crack in the side began to seal itself then they were off rolling smoothly over the turf at a fantastic speed seeing dimly the landscape they passed the plain stretched on and on never once did they see trees or rocks or hills or rivers hawkmoon began to wonder if it were not in fact artificialor had been artificially levelled at some time in the past zhenakteng had his eyes pressed close to an in strument through which presumably he could see his way his hands were on a lever attached to a wheel which he swung in one direction or another from time to time doubtless steering the strange vehicle once they passed at a distance a group of moving objects that they could not define through the shifting walls of the sphere hawkmoon pointed them out charki zhenakteng said with luck they will not attack they seemed to be grey things the color of dark stone but with many legs and waving protuberances hawkmoon could not decide whether they were crea tures or machines or neither an hour passed and at last the sphere began to slow we are nearing tengkampp zhenakteng said a little later the sphere rolled to a halt and the bronzed man leant back sighing with relief good he said i found what i set out looking for that force of charki is feeding in a southwesterly direction and should not come too close to tengkampp what are the charki daverc asked gasping as he moved and his wounds began to hurt again the charki are our enemies creatures created to destroy human life zhenakteng replied they feed from above ground sucking up energy from the hidden kampps of our people he touched a lever and with a jolt the globe began to descend into the ground the earth seemed to swallow them up and then close above them the globe continued to descend for a few moments and then stopped a bright light came on suddenly and they saw they were in a small under ground chamber barely large enough to hold the sphere tengkampp said zhenakteng laconically touch ing a stud in the control panel which caused the sphere to split again they descended to the floor of the chamber carry ing mygan with them ducking to pass tinder an arch way and emerge in another chamber where men dressed similarly to zhenakteng hurried forward presumably to service the sphere this way the tall man said leading them into a cubicle which began to spin slowly hawkmoon and daverc leant against the sides of the cubicle feeling dizzy but at last the experience was over and zhenak teng led them out into a richly carpeted room full of simple comfortable looking furniture these are my apartments he said ill send now for the medical members of my family who may be able to help your friend excuse me he disappeared into another room a little later he came back smiling my brothers will be here soon i hope so said daverc fastidiously ive never been greatly fond of the company of corpses it will not be long come let us go into another room where refreshment awaits you they left the body of mygan behind and entered a room where trays of food and drink seemed to drift unsupported in the air above piled cushions following zhenaktengs example they seated them selves on the cushions and helped themselves to the food it was delicious and they found themselves eat ing tremendous quantities of it as they ate two men of a similar appearance to zhenakteng entered the room it is too late said one of them to zhenakteng i am sorry brother but we cannot revive the old man the wounds and the time involved zhenakteng looked apologetically at daverc and hawkmoon thereyou have lost your comrade for good i fear then perhaps you can give him a good departure said daverc almost relieved of course we shall do what is necessary the other two withdrew for about halfanhour and then returned just as hawkmoon and daverc finished eating the first man introduced himself as bralanteng and the second announced himself as poladteng they were both brothers to zhenakteng and practitioners of medicine they inspected hawkmoons and davercs wounds and applied dressings very short ly the two men began to feel improved now you must tell me how you came to the land of the kampps zhenakteng said we have few strang ers on our plain because of the charki you must tell me of events in the other parts of the world i am not sure that you would understand the an swer to your first enquiry hawkmoon told him or that we can help you with news of our world and he explained as best he could how they had come here and where their world was zhenakteng listened with careful attention aye he said you are right i can understand little of what you tell me i have never heard of any europe or granbretan and the device you describe is not known to our science but i believe you how else could you have turned up so suddenly in the land of kampps what are the kampps daverc asked you said they were not cities so they are not they are family houses belonging to one clan in our case the underground house be longs to the teng family other nearby families are the ohn the sek and the neng years ago there were moremany morebut the charki found them and destroyed them and what are the charki hawkmoon put it the charki are our ageold enemies they were created by those who once sought to destroy the houses of the plain that enemy destroyed himself ultimately with some kind of explosive experiment but his crea turesthe charkicontinue to wander the plain they have unwholesome means of defeating us so that they may feed off our lifeenergy zhenakteng shuddered they feed off your lifeenergy daverc said with a frown what is that whatever gives us lifewhatever life is they take it and leave us drained useless dying slowly unable to move hawkmoon began another question then changed his mind evidently the subject was painful to zhenak teng instead he asked and what is this plain it does not seem natural to me it is not it was the site of our landing fields for we of the one hundred families were once mighty and powerfuluntil the coming of he who created the charki he wanted our artifacts and our sources of power for himself he was called zhenadarvronken sai and he brought the charki with him from the east their vocation being entirely to destroy the families and destroy them they did save for the handful that still survives but gradually through the centuries the charki sniff them out you seem to have no hope said daverc almost accusingly we are merely realistic zhenakteng replied with out rancour tomorrow we should like to be on our way said hawkmoon have you mapssomething that will help us reach narleen i have a mapthough it is crude narleen used to be a great trading city on the coast that was centuries ago i do not know what it might be today zhenakteng rose i will show you to the room i have had prepared for you there you may sleep to night and begin your long journey in the morning chapter two the charki hawkmoon awoke to the sounds of battle he wondered for a moment if he had dreamed and he was back in the cave and daverc was still engaged with baron meliadus he sprang from his bed reaching for the sword that lay on a nearby stool with his tat tered clothes he was in the room where zhenakteng had left them the previous night and on the other bed daverc was awake his features startled hawkmoon began to struggle into his clothes from behind the door came yells the clash of swords strange whining sounds and moans when he was dressed he went swiftly to the door and opened it a crack he was astonished the bronzed handsome folk of tengkampp were busily at work trying to destroy one anotherand it was not swords after all that were making the clashing sound but meat cleavers iron bars and a weird collection of domestic and scientific tools utilised as weapons snarls bestial and alarming were on all faces and foam flecked lips while eyes stared madly the same insanity possessed them all dark blue smoke began to pour along the corridor there was a stink hawkmoon could not define the sound of smashing glass and torn metal by the runestaff daverc he gasped they seem possessed a knot of battling men suddenly pressed against the door pushing it inwards and hawkmoon found himself in the middle of them he pushed them back sprang aside none attacked him or daverc they continued to butcher one another as if unaware of the spectators this way hawkmoon said and left the room sword in hand he coughed as the blue smoke entered his lungs and stung his eyes everywhere was ruin corpses lay thick in the corridor together they struggled along the passages until they reached zhenaktengs apartments the door was locked frantically hawkmoon beat upon it with the pommel of his blade zhenakteng it is hawkmoon and daverc are you within there was a movement from the other side of the door then it sprang open and zhenakteng his eyes wild with terror beckoned them in then hastily closed and locked the door again the charki he said there must have been an other pack roaming elsewhere i have failed in my duty they took us by surprise we are doomed i see no monsters daverc said your kinsmen fight among themselves ayethats the charkis way of defeating us they emit wavesmental rays of some descriptionthat turn us mad make us see enemies in our closest friends and brothers and while we fight they enter our kampp they will soon be here the blue smokewhat is that daverc asked nothing to do with the charki it comes from our smashed generators we have no power now even if we could rally from somewhere above came terrible thumps and crashes that shook the room the charki murmured zhenakteng soon their rays will reach me even me why have they not reached you already hawk moon demanded some of us are more able to resist them you plain ly do not suffer from them at all others are quickly overcome can we not escape hawkmoon glanced about the room the sphere we came in too late too late daverc grasped zhenakteng by the shoulder come man we can escape if were quick you can drive the sphere i must die with my familythe family i helped destroy zhenakteng was barely recognisable as the selfcontained civilised man they had spoken to the day before all the spirit had left him already his eyes were glazed and it seemed to hawkmoon that soon the man would succumb to the strange power of the charki he came to a decision raised his sword and struck swiftly the pommel connected with the base of zhenaktengs skull and he collapsed now daverc hawkmoon said grimly lets get him to the sphere hurry coughing as the blue smoke grew thicker they stumbled from the room and into the passages carry ing zhenaktengs unconscious body between them hawkmoon remembered the way to the place where they had left the sphere and directed daverc now the whole passage shook alarmingly until they were forced to stop to keep their balance then the wall its crumbling howled daverc stag gering back quickly hawkmoonthe other way we must get to the sphere hawkmoon called back we must go on now pieces of the ceiling began to fall and a grey stonelike creature crept through the crack in the wall and into the passage on the end of the creature was what resembled a sucker such as an octopus would possess moving like a mouth seeking to kiss them hawkmoon shuddered in horror and stabbed at the thing with his sword it recoiled then pouting a little as if only a trifle offended by his gesture and willing to make friends it advanced again this time hawkmoon chopped at it and there was a grunt and a shrill hiss from the other side of the room the creature seemed surprised that something was re sisting it heaving zhenakteng onto his shoulder hawkmoon struck another blow at the tentacle then leapt over it and began to race down the crumbling passage come on daverc to the sphere daverc skipped over the wounded tentacle and followed now the wall gave way altogether and it re vealed a mass of waving arms a pulsing head and a face that was a parody of human features grinning a placatory idiots grin it wants us to pet it daverc cried with grim humor as he avoided a reaching tentacle would you hurt its feelings so hawkmoon hawkmoon was busily opening the door that led to the chamber of the sphere zhenakteng who lay on the floor near him was beginning to moan and clutch his head hawkmoon got the door open hefted zhenakteng onto his shoulder again and passed through into the chamber where the sphere lay no noise came from it now and its colours were muted but it was opened sufficient to admit them hawkmoon climbed the ladder and dumped zhenak teng in the control seat as daverc joined him get this thing moving he told zhenakteng or well all be devoured by the charki you see there he pointed with his sword to the giant thing that was squeezing its way through the door of the chamber several tentacles crept up the sides of the sphere towards them one touched zhenakteng lightly on the shoulder and he moaned hawkmoon yelled and chopped at it it flopped to the floor but others were now waving all around him and had fastened on the bronzed man who seemed to accept the touch with complete passivity hawkmoon and daverc screamed at him to get the sphere moving while they hacked desperately at the dozens of waving limbs hawkmoon reached out with his left hand to grasp the back of zhenaktengs neck close the sphere zhenakteng close the sphere with a jerky movement zhenakteng obeyed de pressing a stud which made the sphere murmur and hum and begin to glow with all kinds of colours the tentacles tried to resist the steady motion of the walls as the aperture closed three leapt through davercs defense and fastened themselves on zhenak teng who groaned and went limp again hawkmoon slashed at the tentacles as the sphere finally closed and began to rise upwards one by one the tentacles disappeared as the sphere rose and hawkmoon sighed in relief he turned to the bronzed man we are free but zhenakteng stared dully ahead of him his arms limp at his sides it is no good he said slowly it has taken my life and he slumped to one side falling to the floor hawkmoon bent beside him putting his hand to the mans chest to feel his heartbeat he shuddered in hor ror hes cold davercincredibly cold and does he live the frenchman asked hawkmoon shook his head he is entirely dead the sphere was still rising rapidly and hawkmoon sprang to the controls looking at them in despair not knowing one instrument from another not daring to touch anything lest they descend again to where the charki feasted on the life energy of the people of tengkampp suddenly they were in the open air and bounding over the turf hawkmoon seated himself in the control seat and took the lever as he had seen zhenakteng take it the day before gingerly he pushed it to one side and had the satisfaction of seeing the sphere be gin to roll in that direction i think i can steer it he told his friend but how one stops it or opens it that i cannot guess as long as we are leaving those monsters behind i am not entirely depressed daverc said with a smile turn the thing to the south hawkmoon at least we will be going in the direction we intended hawkmoon did as daverc suggested and for hours they rolled over the flat plain until at length a forest came in sight it will be interesting said daverc when hawk moon pointed out the trees to him to see how the sphere behaves when it reaches the trees it was plainly not designed for such terrain chapter three the sayou river the sphere struck the trees with a great sound of snapping wood and tortured metal daverc and hawkmoon found themselves flung to the far side of the control chamber keeping company with the unpleasantly cold corpse of zhenakteng next they were flung upwards then sideways and had not the walls of the sphere been well padded they would have died of broken bones at last the sphere rolled to a halt rocked for a few moments then suddenly split apart tumbling hawk moon and daverc to the ground daverc groaned what an unnecessary experience for one as weak as myself hawkmoon grinned partly at his friends drollery partly in relief well he said we have escaped more easily than id dared hope rise up daverc we must strike on strike for the south i think a rest is called for daverc said stretching and looking up at the green branches of the trees sun slanted through them turning the forest to emerald and gold there was the sharp scent of pine and the earthier scent of the birch and from a branch above them a squirrel looked down its bright black eyes sardonic behind them the wreckage of the sphere lay amongst tangled roots and branches several small trees had been torn up and others snapped hawkmoon realised that their escape had been very lucky indeed he be gan to shake now with reaction and understood the sense of davercs words he sat down on a grassy hill ock averting his eyes from the wreck and the corpse of zhenakteng that could just be seen to one side of the sphere daverc lay down nearby and rolled over onto his back from within his tattered jerkin he drew a tightly wadded piece of parchment the map that zhenakteng had given him shortly before they retired the night before daverc opened the parchment and studied it it showed the plain in considerable detail marked the various kampps of zhenaktengs people and what appeared to be the hunting trails of the charki against most of the sites of the underground dwellings were crosses presumably showing which the charki had destroyed he pointed to a spot near the corner of the map here he said heres the forestand just to the north here is marked a riverthe sayou this arrow points south to narleen from what i can gather the river will lead us to the city hawkmoon nodded then lets head for the river when were recovered the sooner we reach narleen the betterfor there at least we may discover where we are in space and time it was unlucky that the charki should have attacked when they did by questioning zhenakteng longer we might have been able to learn from him where we were they slept in the peace of the forest for an hour or more then rose up adjusted their worn gear and ragged clothes and set off towards the north and the river as they progressed the undergrowth grew thicker and the trees more dense and the hills on which the trees clung became steeper so that by evening they were weary and in illtemper barely speaking to one another hawkmoon sorted through the few objects in the purse on his belt found a tinder box of ornate design they walked on for another halfhour until they came to a stream that fed a pool set between high banks on three sides beside this was a small clearing and hawk moon said well spend the night here daverc for i cannot continue any longer daverc nodded and flung himself down beside the pool drinking greedily the clear water it looks deep he said rising and wiping his lips hawkmoon was building a fire and did not reply soon he had a good blaze going we should perhaps hunt for game daverc said lazily i am becoming hungry do you know anything of forest lore hawkmoon some said hawkmoon but i am not hungry daverc and with that he lay down and went to sleep it was night it was cold and hawkmoon was sud denly awakened by a terrified yell from ms friend he was up instantly staring in the direction daverc pointed sword leaping from his scabbard he gasped in horror at what he saw rising from the waters of the pool water rushing from its huge sides was a reptilian creature with blaz ing eyes and scales as black as the night only its mouth which now gaped wide contained the white ness of pointed teeth with a great slopping sound it was heaving itself through the water toward them hawkmoon staggered back feeling dwarfed by the monster its head darted down and forward its jaws snapping inches from his face its loathsome breath al most asphyxiating him run hawkmoon run yelled daverc and to gether they began to stumble back into the woods but the creature was out of the water now and giv ing chase from its throat came a terrible croaking noise that seemed to fill the forest hawkmoon and daverc clutched at one anothers hands to keep to gether as they stumbled through the undergrowth al most blind in the blackness of the night again the croaking noise and this tune a long soft tongue whistled like a whip through the air and en circled davercs waist daverc screamed he slashed at the tongue with his blade hawkmoon yelled and sprang forward stabbing out at the black thing with all his might while hang ing to davercs hand and holding his ground as best he could inexorably the tongue drew them towards the gap ing mouth of the waterbeast hawkmoon could see that it was hopeless to try to save daverc in this way he let go of davercs hand and leapt to one side slash ing at the thick black tongue then he took his sword in both hands raised it above his head and chopped down with all his strength the beast croaked again and the ground shook but the tongue parted slowly and foul blood gushed from it then there came a hideous cry and the trees began to part and snap as the waterthing lumbered at them hawkmoon grabbed daverc and hauled him to his feet pushing aside the sticky flesh of the severed tongue thanks daverc panted as they ran im begin ning to dislike this land hawkmoonit seems more full of perils than our own crunching and croaking and crying out with in sensate rage the thing from the pool pursued them its nearly on us again shouted hawkmoon we cant escape it they turned peering through the blackness all they could see now were the two blazing black eyes of the creature hawkmoon hefted his sword in his hand get ting its balance theres only one chance he called and flung his sword straight at the malevolent orbs there was another croaking scream and a great threshing sound amongst the trees then the blazing orbs disappeared and they heard the beast crashing away back to the pool hawkmoon gasped with relief i didnt kill it but it doubtless decided we were not the easy prey it originally took us for come daverc lets get to that river as soon as we can i want to leave this forest be hind and what makes you think the river is any less perilous daverc asked him sardonically as they be gan to move through the forest again taking their di rection from the side of the trees on which moss grew two days later they broke out of the forest and stood on the sides of a hill that went steeply down to a valley through which a broad river flowed it was with out doubt the river sayou they were covered in filth unshaven their clothes ragged to the point of disintegration hawkmoon had only a dagger for a weapon and daverc at last rid of his torn jerkin was naked to the waist they ran down the hill stumbling over roots struck by branches careless of any discomfort in their haste to reach the river where the river would take them they knew not they wished only to leave the forest and its dangers though they had encountered nothing as dreadful as the creature from the pool they had seen other mon sters from a distance discovered the spoor of more they flung themselves into the water and began to wash the mud and filth from their bodies grinning at one another ah sweet water exclaimed daverc you lead to towns and cities and civilisation i care not what that civilisation offers usit will be more familiar and even more welcome than the worst this dirty natural place presents to us hawkmoon smiled not entirely sharing davercs sentiments but understanding his feelings well build a raft he said were lucky that the current flows south all we need do daverc is let the current bear us to our goal and you can fish hawkmoonget us tasty meals im not used to the simple fare weve lived on the past two daysberries and roots ugh ill teach you how to fish too daverc the ex perience might be useful to you if you find yourself in a similar situation in the future and hawkmoon laughed slapping his friend on the back chapter four valjon of starvel four days later the raft had borne them many miles down the great river forests no longer lined the banks but instead there were gentle hills and seas of wild corn on both sides of them hawkmoon and daverc lived off the fat fish they caught in the river together with corn and fruit found on the banks and they became more relaxed as the raft drifted on toward narleen they had the appearance of shipwrecked sailors with their ragged clothes and beards that grew thicker daily but their eyes no longer had the wild look of hunger and exposure and they were in better spirits than they had been it was late in the afternoon of the fourth day that they saw the ship coming up behind them and leapt to their feet waving to attract its attention perhaps the ship is from narleen cried hawk moon perhaps theyll let us work a passage to the city the ship was highprowed made of wood painted with rich colours principally it was red with gold yellow and blue scrollwork along its sides although rigged like a twomasted schooner it also possessed oars which were now being used to propel it toward them it flew a hundred brightly colored flags and the men on its decks wore clothes to match the ship struck her oars and pulled alongside a heavily bearded face peered down at them who are you travellersstrangers in these partscan we sign aboard to work our passage to narleen daverc asked the bearded man laughed aye that you can come up gentlemen a rope ladder was thrown down and hawkmoon and daverc climbed gratefully up it to stand on the ornamental deck of the ship this is the river wind the bearded man told them heard of her i told youwere strangers said hawkmoon aye well shes owned by valjon of starvel youve heard of him no doubt no said daverc but were grateful to him for sending a ship our way he smiled now my friend what do you say to our working our passage to nar leen well if youve no money none wed best find out from valjon himself what he wants done with you the bearded man escorted them up the deck to the poop where a thin man pale and in black stood brooding not looking at them lord valjon said the bearded man what is it ganak the two we took aboard theyve no money wish to work their passage they say why then let them ganak if thats what they de sire valjon smiled wanly he did not look directly at hawkmoon and daverc and his melancholy eyes continued to stare out over the river with a wave of his hand he dismissed them hawkmoon felt uncomfortable looked about him all the crew were looking on silently faint smiles on their faces whats the joke joke ganak said theres none now gentle men would you pull an oar to get you to narleen if thats the work that will get us to the city said daverc with some reluctance it looks somewhat strenuous work hawkmoon said but its not too far to narleen if our map was in order show us to our oars friend ganak ganak took them along the deck until they reached the catwalk between the rowers here hawkmoon was shocked when he saw the condition of the oarsmen all looked halfstarved and filthy i dont understand he began ganak laughed why you will soon what are these rowers daverc asked in dismay they are slaves gentlemenand slaves you are too we take nothing aboard the river wind that will not profit us and since you have no money and ran som seems unlikely why well make you slaves to work our oars for us get down there daverc drew his sword and hawkmoon his dagger but ganak sprang back signalling to his crewmen come lads teach them new tricks for they seem not to understand what slaves must do behind them along the catwalk clambered a great weight of sailors all with bright blades in their hands while another mass of men came at their front daverc and hawkmoon prepared to die taking a good quantity of the sailors with them but then from above a figure came hurtling down a rope from the crosstrees to strike once twice upon their heads with a hardwood club and knock them into the oarpits the figure grinned and bounced on the catwalk putting away his club ganak laughed and clapped him on the shoulder good work orindo that tricks always the best one and saves much spilt blood others sprang down to relieve the stunned men of their weapons and rope their wrists to an oar when hawkmoon awoke he and daverc sat side by side on a hard bench and orindo was swinging his legs from the catwalk above them he was a boy of perhaps sixteen a cocky smile on his face he called back to someone above whom they could not see theyre awake we can start moving now back to narleen he winked at hawkmoon and daverc commence gentlemen he said commence rowing if you please he seemed to be imitating a voice he had heard youre lucky he added were going downstream your first work will be easy hawkmoon gave a mock bow over his oar thank you young man we appreciate your concern ill give you further advice from time to time for thats my kindly nature said orindo springing up gathering his red and blue coat about him and bounc ing along the catwalk ganaks face peered down next he prodded at hawkmoons shoulder with a sharp boathook pull well friend or youll feel the bite of this in your bowels ganak disappeared the other rowers bent to their task and hawkmoon and daverc were forced to follow suit for the best part of a day they pulled with the stink of their own and others bodies in their nostrils with a bowl of slops to eat at midday the work was back breaking though it was a sign of what upstream row ing was like when the other slaves murmured with gratitude for the ease of their task at night they lay over their oars barely able to eat their second bowl of nauseating mess which was if anything worse than the first hawkmoon and daverc were too weary to talk but made some attempt to rid themselves of their bonds it was impossible for they were too weak to get free of such tightly knotted ropes next morning ganaks voice awoke them all port rowers get pulling come on you scum that means you gentlemen pull pull theres a prize in sight and if we miss it youll suffer the lord valjons wrath the emaciated bodies of the other rowers instantly became active at this threat and hawkmoon and daverc bent their backs with them hauling the huge boat round against the current from above were the sounds of footfalls as men rushed about preparing the ship for battle ganaks voice roared from the poop as he issued instructions in the name of his master the lord valjon hawkmoon thought he would die with the effort of rowing felt his heart pound and his muscles creak with the agony of the exertion fit he might be but this ef fort was unusual placing strain on parts of his body that had never had to take such strain before he was covered in sweat and his hair was pasted to his face his mouth open as he gasped for breath oh hawkmoon panted daverc thiswas notmeant tobemy rolein life but hawkmoon could not reply for the pain in his chest and arms there was now a sharp jarring as the boat met an other and ganak yelled port rowers drop oars hawkmoon and the others obeyed instantly and slumped over their oars as the sounds of battle com menced above there was the noise of swords of men in agony of killing and of dying but it seemed only like a distant dream to hawkmoon he felt that if he continued to row in lord valjons galley he would shortly perish then suddenly he heard a guttural cry above him and felt a great weight fall upon him the thing strug gled crawled over his head and fell in front of him it was a brutish looking sailor his body covered in red hair there was a large cutlass sticking from the mid dle of his body he gasped quivered then died the knife falling from his hand hawkmoon stared at the corpse dully for a while until ms brain began to work he extended his feet and found he could touch the fallen knife gradually with several pauses he drew it towards him until it was under his bench exhausted he again fell over his oar meanwhile the sounds of fighting died down and hawkmoon was recalled to reality by the smell of burning timber looked about him in panic then real ised the truth its the other ship thats burning daverc told him were aboard a pirate friend hawkmoon he smiled sardonically what an unworthy occupation and my health so frail hawkmoon reflected with some selfjudgement that daverc seemed to be reacting better to their situation than was he he drew a deep breath and straightened bis shoul ders as best he could i have a knife he began in a whisper but daverc nodded rapidly i know i saw you youre not in such bad condi tion after all hawkmoon said rest tonight until just before dawn then well escape aye agreed daverc save as much strength as we can courage hawkmoonwell soon be free men again for the rest of the day they pulled rapidly down river pausing only at noon for their bowl of slops once ganak squatted on the catwalk and tickled hawkmoons shoulder with his boathook another day and youll have your desire well be docking at starvel tomorrow and whats starvel croaked hawkmoon ganak looked at him astonished you must be from far away if youve not heard of starvel its part of narleenthe most favored part the walled city where the great princes of the river dwelland of whom lord valjon is the greatest are they all pirates asked daverc careful stranger ganak said frowning we help ourselves by right to whatevers on the river the river belongs to lord valjon and his peers he straightened up and strode away they rowed on until nightfall and then at ganaks order ceased their work hawkmoon had found the work easier now that his muscles and body had become used to it but he was still tired we must sleep in shifts he murmured to daverc as they ate their slops you first then i daverc nodded and slumped down almost instant ly the night grew cold and hawkmoon could barely stop from falling asleep he heard the first watch sounded then the second with relief he nudged at daverc until he was awake daverc grunted and hawkmoon was instantly asleep remembering davercs words by dawn with luck they would be free then would come the difficult partof leaving the ship unseen he awoke feeling strangely light in the body and realised with mounting spirits that his hands were free of the oars daverc must have worked in the night it was almost dawn he turned to his friend who grinned at him and winked ready daverc murmured aye replied hawkmoon with a great sigh he looked with envy at the long knife daverc held if i had a weapon he said i would repay ganak for a few indignities no time for that now daverc pointed out we must escape as silently as possible cautiously they rose up from the benches and poked their heads up over the catwalk at the far end a sailor stood on watch and on the poop deck above this man stood lord valjon his posture brooding and ab stracted his pale face staring into the darkness of the river night the sailors back was towards them valjon did not seem about to turn the two men heaved themselves onto the catwalk making stealthily for the prow but it was then that valjons sepulchral voice sounded whats this two slaves escaping hawkmoon shuddered the mans instinct was un canny for it was plain he had not seen them perhaps had only heard them for a moment his voice though deep and quiet somehow carried the length of the ship the sailor on watch wheeled and yelled lord valjons deathly pale face also glared at them from below decks several sailors appeared blocking their way to the side they wheeled and hawkmoon ran toward the poop and lord valjon the sailor drew his cutlass struck at him but hawkmoon was desper ate and could not be stopped he ducked beneath the blow grasped the man by the waist and heaved him up hurling him to the deck where he lay winded hawk moon picked up the unwieldy blade and struck off the mans head then he turned to stare at lord val jon the pirate lord seemed undisturbed by the closeness of danger he continued to glare back at hawkmoon from his pale bleak eyes you are a fool he said slowly for i am the lord valjon and i am dorian hawkmoon duke von koln i have fought and defeated the dark lords of granbre tan i have resisted their most powerful magic as this stone in my skull testifies i do not fear you lord val jon the pirate then fear those murmured valjon pointing a bony finger behind hawkmoon hawkmoon spun on his heel and saw a great num ber of sailors bearing down on him and daverc and daverc was armed only with a knife hawkmoon flung him the cutlass hold them off daverc and he leapt for the poop grasped the rail and hauled himself over it as lord valjon an expres sion of mild surprise on his face took a step or two backward hawkmoon advanced toward him hands out stretched from under his loose robe valjon drew a slim blade which he pointed at hawkmoon making no attempt to attack but continuing to back away slave murmured lord valjon his grim features baffled slave im no slave as youll discover hawkmoon ducked past the blade and tried to grab the strange pirate captain valjon stepped aside swiftly still keep ing the long sword before him evidently hawkmoons attack on him was unpre cedented for valjon hardly knew what to do he had been disturbed from some brooding trance and stared at hawkmoon as if he were not real hawkmoon leapt again avoiding the extended sword again valjon sidestepped below daverc had his back to the poop deck was just able to hold off the sailors who crammed the nar row catwalk he called to hawkmoon hurry up with your business friend hawkmoon or ill have a dozen skewers in me before long hawkmoon aimed a blow at valjons face felt his fist connect with cold dry flesh saw the mans head snap back and the sword fall from his hand hawk moon swept up the sword admiring its balance and heaved the unconscious valjon to his feet directing the sword at his vitals back scum or your master dies in astonishment the sailors began to move away leaving three of their number dead at davercs feet ganak came hurrying up behind them he was wear ing only a kilt a naked cutlass in his hand his jaw dropped when he saw hawkmoon now daverc perhaps youd care to join me hawkmoon spoke almost merrily daverc circled the poop and climbed the ladder to the deck he grinned at hawkmoon good work friend well wait until dawn hawkmoon called and then youll guide this ship to the shore when thats done and were free perhaps ill let your master live ganak scowled you are a fool to handle lord valjon thus know you not that he is the most powerful river prince in starvel i know nothing of your starvel friend but i have dared the dangers of granbretan have ventured into the dark empires very heart and i doubt if you can offer dangers more sophisticated than theirs fear is an emotion i rarely feel ganak but mark you thisi would be revenged on you your days are numbered ganak laughed your luck makes you stupid slave vengeancetaking will be the lord valjons preroga tive dawn was already beginning to lighten the horizon hawkmoon ignored ganaks jibe it seemed a century before the sun finally rose and began to dapple the distant trees of the riverbank they were anchored close to the left bank of the river not far from a small cove that could just be made out about half a mile away give the order to row ganak hawkmoon called make for the left shore ganak scowled and made no effort to obey hawkmoons arm encircled valjons throat the man was beginning to blink awake hawkmoon tapped his stomach with his sword ganak i could make valjon die slowly suddenly from the throat of the pirate lord there came a tiny ironic chuckle die slowly he said die slowly hawkmoon stared at him puzzled ayei know where best to strike to give you the maximum time and maximum pain adying valjon made no other sound merely stood passive ly with his throat still gripped by hawkmoons arm now ganak give the instructions daverc called ganak took a deep breath rowers he cried and began to issue orders the oars creaked the backs of the oarsmen bent and slowly the ship began to ride toward the left bank of the wide sayou river hawkmoon watched ganak closely for fear the man would attempt to trick them but ganak did not move merely scowled as the bank came closer and closer hawkmoon be gan to relax they were almost free on land they could avoid any pursuit by the sailors who would any way be reluctant to leave their ship then he heard daverc yell and point upward he stared up to see a figure come whizzing down a rope above his head it was the boy orindo a hardwood club in his hand a wild grin on his lips hawkmoon released valjon and raised his arms to protect himself unable to do the obvious thing which was to use his blade to strike orindo as he descended the club fell heavily on his arm and he staggered back daverc rushed forward and grasped orindo round the waist imprisoning his arms valjon suddenly swiftfooted darted down the com panionway screaming a strange wordless scream daverc pushed orindo after him with an oath taken by the same trick twice hawkmoon we deserve to die for that growling sailors led by ganak were coming up the companionway now hawkmoon struck out at ganak but the bearded sailor blocked the blow aiming a huge swing at hawkmoons legs hawkmoon was forced to leap back and then ganak scuttled up to the poop and faced him a sneering grin on his lips now slave well see how you fight a man ganak said i do not see a man hawkmoon replied only some kind of beast he laughed as ganak struck at him again he thrust swiftly with the marvellously balanced sword he had taken from valjon back and forth across the deck they fought while daverc managed to hold the others at bay ganak was a master swordsman but his cutlass was no match for the shining sword of the pirate lord hawkmoon took him in the shoulder with a darting thrust reeled back as the cutlass collided with the hilt of his blade feeling the weapon almost fall from his hand recovered himself to thrust again and wound ganak in the left arm the bearded man howled like an animal and came on with renewed ferocity hawkmoon thrust again this time piercing ganaks right arm blood drenched both brawny arms and hawkmoon was unwounded ganak flung himself at hawkmoon again now in a kind of fierce panic hawkmoons next thrust was to the heart to put ganak out of further misery the point of the blade bit through flesh scraped against bone and the life was gone from ganak but now the other sailors had forced daverc back and he was surrounded hacking about him with the cutlass hawkmoon left the corpse of ganak and leapt forward taking one in the throat and another under the ribs before they were aware of his presence back to back now hawkmoon and daverc held off the sailors but it seemed they must soon expire for more were running to join their comrades soon the poop was heaped with corpses and hawk moon and daverc were covered with cuts from a dozen blades their bodies all bloody still they fought hawkmoon caught a glimpse of the lord valjon stand ing by the mainmast watching from out of his deepset eyes staring fixedly at him as if he wished to have a clear impression of his face for the rest of his life if need be hawkmoon shuddered then returned his full atten tion to the attacking seamen the flat of a cutlass caught him a blow on the head and he reeled against daverc sending his friend offbalance together they collapsed to the deck struggled to rise up still fight ing hawkmoon took one man in the stomach struck anothers lowering face with his fist heaved himself to his knees then suddenly the sailors stepped back their eyes fixed to port hawkmoon sprang up daverc with him the sailors were watching in concern as a new ship came swimming from the cove its white schooner rigged sails billowing with the fresh breeze from the south its rich black and deep blue paint trimmed with gold all agleaming in the early morning sunshine its sides lined with armed men a rival pirate no doubt daverc said and used his advantage to cut down the nearest sailor and run for the rail of the poop hawkmoon followed his ex ample and with backs pressed against the rail they fought on though half their enemies were running down the companionway to present themselves to lord valjon for his orders a voice called across the water but it was too far away for the words to be clear somehow in the confusion hawkmoon heard val jons deep worldweary voice speak a single word a word containing much loathing the word was bewchard then the sailors were upon them again and hawk moon felt a cutlass nick his face turned blazing eyes on his attacker and thrust out his sword to catch him through the mouth driving the sharp blade upwards for the brain hearing the man scream a long horrible scream as he died hawkmoon felt no mercy yanked his sword back and stabbed another in the heart and thus they fought while the black and midnight blue schooner sailed closer and closer for a moment hawkmoon wondered if the ship would be friend or foe then there was no more time for wondering as the vengeful sailors pressed in their heavy cutlasses rising and falling chapter five pahl bewchard as the black and blue ship crashed alongside hawkmoon heard valjons voice calling forget the slaves forget them stand by to hold off bewchards dogs the remaining sailors backed warily away from the panting hawkmoon and daverc hawkmoon made a thrust at them that sent them away faster but he had not the energy to pursue them for the moment they watched as sailors all dressed in jerkins and hose that matched the paint of the ship came sailing on ropes to land on the deck of the river wind they were armed with heavy waraxes and sabres and fought with a precision that the pirates could not imitate though they did their best to rally hawkmoon looked for lord valjon but he had dis appearedprobably below decks he turned to daverc well weve done our share of bloodletting this day my friend what say you to a less lethal actionwe could free the poor wretches at the oars and with that he leapt the poop rail to land on the catwalk and lean down to slash the knotted ropes binding the slaves to their oars they looked up in surprise not realising most of them what hawkmoon and daverc were doing for them youre free hawkmoon told them free daverc repeated take our advice and leave the ship while you can for theres no knowing how the battle will go the slaves stood up stretching their aching limbs and then one by one they hauled themselves to the side of the ship and began to slide into the water daverc watched them go with a grin a shame we cant help those on the other side he said why not asked hawkmoon indicating a hatch let into the side under the catwalk if im not mis taken this leads under the deck he put his back to the side of the ship and kicked at the hatch several kicks and it sprang open they entered the darkness and crept under the boards hear ing the sounds of fighting immediately above them daverc paused slicing open a bundle with his muchblunted blade jewels poured out of the bundle their loot he said no time for that now hawkmoon warned but daverc was grinning i didnt plan to keep it he told his friend but id hate valjon to escape with it if the fight goes well for him look and he indicated a large circular object set into the bottom of the hold if im not mis taken this will let a little of the river into the ship hawkmoon nodded while you work on that ill make haste to free the slaves he left daverc to his task and reached the far hatch stripping out the pegs holding it in position the hatch burst inwards bringing two struggling men with it one wore the uniform of the attacking ship the other was a pirate with a quick movement hawkmoon despatched the pirate the uniformed man looked at him in surprise youre one of the men we saw fighting on the poop deck hawkmoon nodded whats your ship its bewchards ship replied the man wiping his forehead he spoke as if the name were sufficient ex planation and who is bewchard the uniformed man laughed why hes valjons sworn enemy if thats what you need to know he saw you fighting he was impressed by your swords manship so he should have been grinned hawkmoon for i fought my best today and why not i was fighting for my life that often makes excellent swordsmen of us all agreed the man im culardand your friend if youre valjons foe best warn your comrades then said hawkmoon were sinking the shiplook he pointed through the dimness to where daverc was wrestling with the cir cular bung culard nodded swiftly and ducked out into the slave pit again ill see you after this is over friend he called as he left if we live hawkmoon followed him creeping along the aisle to cut the slaves bonds above him the men of bewchards ship seemed to be driving valjons pirates back hawkmoon felt the ship move suddenly saw daverc come hastily out of the hatch i think wed best make for the shore said the frenchman with a smile jerking his thumb at the slaves who were disappearing over the side follow our friends example hawkmoon nodded ive warned bewchards men of whats happening weve repaid valjon now i think he tucked valjons sword under his arm ill try not to lose this bladeits the finest ive ever used such a blade would make an outstanding swordsman of any one he clambered up to the side and saw that bewchards men had driven the pirate sailors back to the other side of the ship but were now withdrawing culard had evidently spread the news water was bubbling through the hatch the ship would not last long afloat hawkmoon turned and looked back there was barely space between the ships to swim the best method of escape would be to cross the deck of bewchards schooner he informed daverc of his plan his friend nodded and they poised themselves on the rail leaping out to land on the deck of the other ship there were no rowers present and hawkmoon real ized that bewchards oarsmen must be free men part of the fighting complement of the ship this it seemed to him was a more sensible schemeless waste ful than the use of slaves it also gave him cause to pause and as he paused a voice called from the river wind hey my friend you with the black gem in your forehead have you plans for scuttling my ship too hawkmoon turned and saw a good looking young man dressed all in black leather with a highcollared bloodstained blue cloak thrown back from his shoul ders a sword in one hand and an axe in the other raising his sword to him from the rail of the doomed galley were on our way called hawkmoon your ships safe from us stay a moment the blackclad man leapt up and balanced himself on the river winds rail id like to thank you for doing half our work for us reluctantly hawkmoon waited until the man had leapt back to his own ship and approached them along the deck im pahl bewchard and the ships mine he said ive waited many weeks to catch the river wind might not have done so had you not taken on the best part of the crew and given me tune to sneak out of the cove aye said hawkmoon well i want no further part in a quarrel between pirates you do me a disservice sir bewchard replied easily for im sworn to rid the river of the pirate lords of starvel i am their fiercest enemy bewchards men were swarming back into their own ship cutting loose the mooring ropes as they came the river wind swung round in the current her stern now below the waterline some of the pirates leapt overboard but there was no sign of valjon where did their leader escape to daverc asked studying the ship hes like a rat bewchard answered doubtless he slipped away as soon as it was plain the day was lost for him you have helped me greatly gentlemen for valjon is the worst of the pirates i am grateful and daverc never at a loss where courtesy and his own interests were concerned replied and we are grateful to you captain bewchardfor arriving when things were lost for us the debt is settled he smiled pleasantly bewchard inclined his head thank you however if i may make a somewhat direct statement you seem in need of something to aid your recovery both of you are wounded your clothes are plainly not what you as gentlemen would normally choose to wear i mean in short that i would be honoured if you would ac cept the hospitality of my ships galley such as it is and the hospitality of my mansion when we dock hawkmoon frowned thoughtfully he had taken a liking to the young captain and where do you plan to dock sir in narleen replied bewchard where i live we were in fact travelling to narleen before we were trapped by valjon hawkmoon began then you must certainly travel with me if i can be of assistance thank you captain bewchard hawkmoon said we should appreciate your aid in reaching narleen and perhaps on the way you would be able to supply us with some information which we lack willingly bewchard gestured toward a door set beneath the poop deck my cabin is this way gentle men chapter six narleen through the portholes of captain bewchards cabin they saw the spray fly as the ship flung itself downriver under full sail if we should meet a couple of pirates bewchard told them we should have little chance that is why we make such speed the cook brought in the last of the dishes and laid it before them there were several kinds of meat fish and vegetables fruit and wine hawkmoon ate as spar ingly as possible unable to resist at least a sample of everything on the table but aware that his stomach might not yet be ready for such rich food this is a celebration meal bewchard told them cheerfully for i have been hunting valjon for months who is valjon hawkmoon asked between munches he seems a strange individual unlike any pirate i ever imagined daverc put in he is a pirate by tradition bewchard told them his ancestors have always been pirates preying on the river traffic for centuries for a long time the mer chants paid huge taxes to the lords of starvel but some years ago they began to resist and valjon re taliated then a group of us decided to build fighting ships like the pirates and attack them on the water i command such a ship a merchant by trade i have turned to more military pursuits until narleen is free of valjon and his like and how are you faring asked hawkmoon it is hard to say valjon and the other lords are still impregnable in their walled citystarvel is a city within a city within narleenand so far we have only been able to curb their piracy a little as yet there has been no major test of strength for either side you say valjon is a pirate by tradition daverc began aye his ancestors came to narleen many hundreds of years ago they were powerful and we were rela tively weak legend says that valjons ancestor batach gerandiun had sorcery to aid him they built the wall around starvel the quarter of the city they took for themselves and have been there ever since and how does valjon answer you when you attack his ships as we saw today hawkmoon took a long draft of wine he retaliates with every possible means but we are beginning to make them warier of venturing onto the river these days there is still much to do i would slay valjon if i could that would break the power of the whole pirate community i am sure but he always escapes he has an instinct for dangeris always able to avoid it even before it threatens i wish you luck in finding him hawkmoon said captain bewchard know you anything of a blade called the sword of the dawnwe were told that we should find it in narleen bewchard looked surprised aye ive heard of it it is connected with the legend i told you ofcon cerning valjons ancestor batach gerandiun batachs sorcerous power was said to be contained in the blade batach has become a god sincethe pirates have deified him and worship him at their temple which is named after himthe temple of batach gerandiun they are a superstitious breed those pirates their minds and manners are often unfathomable to the prac tical merchant kind like myself and where is the blade daverc asked why it is the sword the pirates worship in the temple it represents their power to them as well as batachs do you seek to make the blade your own then gentlemen i do not began hawkmoon but daverc interrupted smoothly we do captain we have a relativea very wise scholar from the northwho heard of the blade and wished to inspect it he sent us here to see if it could be bought bewchard laughed heartily it could be bought my friendswith the blood of half a million fighting men the pirates would fight to the last man to defend the sword of the dawn they value it above all other things hawkmoon felt his spirits sink had the dying my gan sent them on an impossible quest ah well daverc shrugged philosophically then we must hope that you eventually defeat valjon and the others and put their property up for auction bewchard smiled that day will not come in my life time it will take many years before valjon is finally defeated he rose from his table excuse me for a few moments i must see how things are on deck he left the cabin with a brief courteous bow when he had gone hawkmoon frowned what now daverc we are stranded in this strange land unable to get that which we sought he took mygans rings from his pouch and jingled them on the palm of his hand there were eleven there now for he and daverc had taken their own off we are lucky to have these still perhaps we should use themleap at random into the dimensions in the hope of finding a way back to our kamarg daverc snorted we might find ourselves suddenly at king huons court or in peril of our lives from some monster i say we go to narleen and spend some time theresee just how difficult it will be to obtain the pirate sword he took something from his own pouch until you spoke i had forgotten that i possessed this little thing he held it up it was the charge from one of the guns used in the city of halapandur and what significance has that daverc hawk moon asked as i told you hawkmoonit could prove useful to us without a gun without a gun nodded daverc as the frenchman replaced the charge in his pouch pahl bewchard came back through the door he was smiling less than an hour my friendsand we shall be berthing in narleen he told them i think you will like our city then he added with a grin at least that part which is not inhabited by the pirate lords hawkmoon and daverc stood on the deck of bew chards ship and watched as it was skillfully brought into harbor the sun was hot in a clear blue sky mak ing the city shine the buildings were for the most part quite low rarely more than four stories but they were richly decorated with rococo designs that seemed very old all the colours were muted weathered but none theless still clear much wood was used in the construc tion of the housespillars balconies and frontages were all of carved woodbut some had painted metal railings and even doors the quayside was crowded with crates and bales which were being loaded or unloaded onto the myriad ships crowding the harbor men worked with derricks to swing them into hatches or onto the quays hauled them along gangplanks sweating in the heat of the day stripped to the waist everywhere was noise and bustle which bewchard seemed to relish as he escorted hawkmoon and daverc down the gangplank of his schooner and through the crowd which had begun to gather bewchard was greeted on all sides how did you fare captain did you find valjon have you lost many men at last bewchard paused laughing goodhumoured ly well fellow citizens of narleen he shouted i must tell you i see or you shall not let us pass aye we sank valjons ship there was a gasp from the crowd and then silence bewchard sprang up onto a packing case and raised his arms we sank valjons ship the river windbut it would have likely escaped us altogether had it not been for my two companions here daverc glanced at hawkmoon in embarrassment the citizens stared at the two in surprise as if unable to believe that two such ragged starvelings could be anything but lowly slaves these two are your heroes not i bewchard con tinued singlehanded they resisted the whole pirate crew killed ganak valjons lieutenant and made the ship easy prey to our attack then they scuttled the river wind there was a great cheer now from the crowd know their names citizens of narleen remember them as friends of this city and deny them nothing they are dorian hawkmoon of the black jewel and huillam daverc you have not seen braver souls nor finer swordsmen hawkmoon was genuinely embarrassed by all this and frowned up at bewchard trying to signal that he should stop and what of valjon called a member of the crowd is he dead he escaped us bewchard replied regretfully he ran like a rat but we shall have his head one day or he yours bewchard the speaker was a richly dressed man who had pushed forward all you have done is anger him for years i paid my river taxes to valjons men and they let me ply the river in peace now you and your like say pay no taxes and i do not but i know no peace these days cannot sleep with out fear of what valjon will do valjon is bound to retaliate and it might not be only you on whom he takes his vengeance what of the rest of usthose who want peace of mind and not glory you endanger us all bewchard laughed it was you veroneeg if im not mistaken who first began to complain about the pi rates said you could not stand the high levies they demanded supported us when we formed the league to fight valjon well veroneeg we are fighting him and it is hard but we shall win never fear the crowd cheered again but this time the cheer was a little more ragged and the people were beginning to disperse valjon will take his vengeance bewchard vero neeg repeated your days are numbered there are rumours that the pirate lords are gathering their strength that they have only been playing with us up to now they could raze narleen if they wished destroy the source of their livelihood that would be foolish of them bewchard shrugged as if to dis miss the middleaged merchant foolish perhapsas foolish as your actions wheezed veroneeg but make them hate us enough and their hatred might cause them to forget that it is we who feed them bewchard smiled and shook his head you should retire veroneeg the rigours of merchant life are too much for you the crowd had almost completely vanished now and there were looks of anxiety on many of the faces which only lately had been cheering the heroes bewchard jumped down from the box and put his arms around his companions shoulders come my friends lets listen no longer to poor old veroneeg he would make any triumph sour with his gloomy prat tling lets to my mansion and see if we can find you raiment more befitting gentlementhen tomorrow we can go about the city and buy new outfits for you both he led them through the teeming streets of narleen streets that wound an apparently logicless course that were narrow and smelling of a million mingled odors that were crowded with sailors and swordsmen and merchants and quay workers old women pretty girls stallkeepers selling their wares and riders picking their way among those on foot he led them over the cob bles up a steep hill and out into a square with one side clear of houses and there was the sea bewchard paused for a moment to stare at the sea it sparkled in the sunlight daverc gestured toward it you trade beyond that ocean bewchard unpinned his heavy cloak and threw it over his arm he opened the collar of his shirt and shook his head smiling nobody knows what lies beyond the seaprobably nothing no we trade along the coast for about two or three hundred miles in each direction this area is thick with rich cities that did not suffer too badly the effects of the tragic mil lenium i see and what do you call this continent is it as we suspect asiacommunista bewchard frowned i have not heard it called that though im no scholar i have heard it called variously yarshai amarehk and nishtay he shrugged i am not even sure where it lies in relation to the legendary continents said to exist elsewhere in the world amarehk hawkmoon exclaimed but i had al ways thought it the legendary home of superhuman creatures and i had thought the runestaff in asiacommunis ta daverc laughed it does not do friend hawk moon to place too much faith in legends perhaps after all the runestaff does not exist hawkmoon nodded perhaps bewchard was frowning the runestafflegends what do you speak of gentlemen a point this scholar we mentioned made daverc said hastily it would be boring to explain bewchard shrugged i hate to be bored my friends he said diplomatically and led them on through the streets they were now beyond the trading part of the city and on a hill in which the houses were much richer and less crowded together high walls surrounded gar dens that could be seen to contain flowering trees and fountains it was outside the gates of one such walled house that bewchard at last stopped welcome to my mansion my good friends he rapped on the gate a covered grille was opened and eyes peered at them then the gate was pulled wide and a servant bowed to bewchard welcome home master was the voyage successful your sister awaits you very successful per ahaso jeleana is here to greet us you will like jeleana my friends chapter severn the blaze jeleana was beautiful a young ravenhaired girl with a vivacious manner that instantly captivated daverc at dinner that night he fluted with her and was delighted when she cheerfully responded bewchard smiled to see them play so wittily but hawkmoon found it hard to watch them for he was reminded painfully of his own yisselda his wife who waited for him thousands of miles across the sea and perhaps hundreds of years across tune for he had no way of knowing if the crystal rings had brought him only through space bewchard seemed to detect a melancholy look in hawkmoons eye and sought to cheer him up with jokes and anecdotes concerning some of his lighter and more amusing encounters while fighting the pirates of starvel hawkmoon responded bravely but he still could not rid his mind of thoughts of his beloved girl count brasss daughter and how she fared had taragorm perfected his machines for travelling through time had meliadus found another means of reaching castle brass the more the evening wore on the less able hawk moon was to continue a light conversation at length he rose and bowed politely i do apologise captain bewchard he murmured but i am very weary the time spent in the galleythe fighting today jeleana bewchard and huillam daverc did not notice him rise for they were engrossed with one an other bewchard stood up quickly a look of concern on his handsome face of course i apologise master hawk moon for my thoughtlessness hawkmoon smiled wanly you have not been thoughtless captain your hospitality is magnificent however bewchards hand made a movement toward the bell pull but before he could summon a servant there came a sudden banging on the door enter bewchard commanded the servant who had admitted them to the garden earlier that day stood panting in the doorway cap tain bewchard there is a fire at the quaysidea ship is burning a ship which ship your ship captainthe one you came home in to day instantly bewchard was making for the door hawk moon and daverc following rapidly behind him je leana behind them a carriage per he ordered hurry man within moments an enclosed carriage drawn by four horses was brought round to the front of the house and bewchard climbed in waiting impatiently for hawkmoon and daverc to join mm jeleana tried to enter but he shook his head no jeleana we do not know what is happening on the quays wait here then they were off bumping over the cobbles at an alarming rate making for the dockside the narrow streets were lit with torches stuck in brackets attached to the sides of houses and the car riage flung a black shadow on the walls as it passed bumping and crashing through the streets at last the quayside was reached illuminated by more than torches for in the harbour a schooner blazed everywhere was confusion as masters of ves sels arrived to bully their men aboard their own craft and move them away from bewchards schooner for fear that they too would be set afire bewchard leapt from the carriage closely followed by hawkmoon and daverc he ran for the quayside elbowing his way through the crowd but once by the water he paused and hung his head its hopeless he murmured in despair shes gone this could only have been valjons work veroneeg his face sweating and red in the glare from the burning ship burst from the crowd you see bewchardvaljon is taking his vengeance i warned you they turned at the sound of galloping hooves saw a rider rein in his horse close by bewchard the man cried pahl bewchard who claims to have sunk the river wind bewchard looked up i am bewchard who are you the rider was clad in bizarre finery and in his left hand he clutched a scroll which he brandished i am valjons manhis messenger he threw the scroll toward bewchard who let it lie where it had fallen what is it bewchard said between gritted teeth it is a bill bewchard a bill for fifty men and forty slaves for a ship and all furnishings plus twentyfive thousand smaygars worth of treasure valjon too can play the merchant game bewchard glared at the messenger the light from the blazing ship sent shadows flickering across his face he spurned the scroll with his foot kicking it into the debrisfilled water you seek to frighten me with this melodrama i see he said firmly well tell valjon i do not intend to pay his bill and that i am not frightened tell him if he wishes to play the merchant gamethat he and his greedy ancestors owe the people of narleen con siderably more than the amount on his bill i will con tinue to reclaim that debt the rider opened his mouth as if to speak then changed his mind spat on the cobbles and wheeled his horse about galloping away into the darkness he will kill you now bewchard said veroneeg almost triumphantly he will kill you i hope he real ises that not all of us are as foolish as you and i hope that we are not all as foolish as you veroneeg answered bewchard contemptuously if valjon is threatening me it means that i have suc ceededpartially at leastin unnerving him he stalked toward his carriage and stood aside while hawkmoon and daverc climbed in then he entered slammed the door and tapped with the hilt of his sword on the roof signalling the driver to return to the man sion are you sure that valjon is as weak as you sug gest hawkmoon asked hesitantly bewchard smiled at him grimly i am sure that he is stronger than i suggest stronger perhaps than veroneeg thinks my own opin ion is that valjon is still somewhat surprised that we have had the temerity to attack his ship as we did today that he has not yet marshalled all his resources but it would not do to tell veroneeg that would it my friend hawkmoon looked at bewchard admiringly you have much courage captain desperation possibly friend hawkmoon hawkmoon nodded i know what you mean i think the rest of the return journey was made in thought ful silence at the mansion the garden gate was open and they drove straight into the drive at the mam door to the house jeleana awaited them palefaced are you unharmed pahl she asked as he de scended from the carriage of course replied bewchard you seem unduly frightened jeleana she turned and walked back into the house back in to the dining room where their supper still lay on the table itit was not the burning ship that made me thus she told him trembling she looked at her brother then at daverc lastly at hawkmoon her eyes were wide we had a visitor while you were gone a visitor who was it bewchard asked putting his arm around her shaking shoulders hehe came alone she began and what is so remarkable about a visitor coming alone where is he now it was valjon pahllord valjon of starvel him self he she put her hand to her face he stroked my facehe looked at me from those bleak inhuman eyes of his he spoke in that voice and what did he say hawkmoon asked sudden ly his tone grim what did he say lady jeleana again her eyes went from one to the other to re turn to hawkmoon he said that he is merely playing with pahl that he is too proud to spend all his time and strength in pursuing a vendetta against him that unless pahl pro claims in the city square tomorrow that he will cease bothering the pirate lords pahl will be punished in a way that will be suitable to his particular misdemeanor he said that he expects to hear that the proclamation has been made by midday tomorrow bewchard frowned he came here to my own house to display his contempt for me i suppose the burning of the ship was just a demonstrationand a diversion to get me to the quayside he spoke to you jeleana to show that he can reach my nearest and most beloved whenever he chooses bewchard sighed there is no question now that he not only threatens my life but the lives of those close to me it is a trick that i should have expecteddid halfexpect yet he looked up at hawkmoon his eyes suddenly tired perhaps i have been a fool after all master hawk moon perhaps veroneeg was right i cannot fight valjonnot while he fights from the security of starvel i have no weapons such as those he employs against me i cannot advise you said hawkmoon quietly but i can offer you my servicesand davercs herein your struggle should you wish to continue it bewchard looked directly into hawkmoons face then and he laughed straightening his shoulders you do not advise me dorian hawkmoon of the black jewel but you do indicate to me what i should think of myself if i refused the aid of two such swords men as yourself ayeill fight on indeed tomorrow i shall spend relaxing ignoring valjons warning you jeleana i will have guarded here i will send for our father and ask him to bring his guards to protect you hawkmoon daverc and myselfwhywell shop tomorrow he indicated the borrowed clothes that the two men wore i promised you new suitsand a good sheath i think master hawkmoon for your borrowed swordvaljons sword we will be casual tomorrow we will show valjonand more important the people of this citythat we are not frightened by valjons threats daverc nodded soberly it is the only way i think if the spirit of your fellow citizens is not to be de stroyed he said then even if you die you die a heroand inspire those who follow you i hope i do not die bewchard smiled for i have a great love for life still we shall see my friends chapter eight the walls of starvel next day dawned as hot as the previous day and pahl bewchard sauntered out with his friends as they moved through the streets of narleen it was plain that many already knew of valjons ultimatum and were wondering what bewchard would do bewchard did nothing nothing but smile at all he met kiss the hands of a few ladies greet a couple of acquaintances leading hawkmoon and daverc toward the centre of the town where he had recommended a good outfitter that the outfitters shop was barely a stones throw from the walls of starvel suited bewchards purpose after midday he said we shall visit the out fitters but before then we will take lunch at a tavern i can vouch for it lies close to the central square and many of our leading citizens drink there we shall be seen to be relaxed and untroubled we will talk of small things and not mention valjons threats at all no matter how many efforts are made to bring the subject up you are asking a great deal captain bewchard daverc pointed out perhaps bewchard answered but i have a feel ing that much hangs on this days eventsmore than i understand at this moment i am gambling on those eventsfor it could be that the day could mean victory or defeat for me hawkmoon nodded but made no comment he too sensed something in the air and could not question bewchards instinct the tavern was visited food eaten wine drunk and they pretended not to notice that they were the centre of attention cleverly avoiding all attempts to quiz them on what they intended to do about valjons ulti matum the hour of noon came and went and bewchard sat and chatted with his friends for a further hour before rising putting down his wine cup and saying now gentlemen this outfitter i mentioned the streets were unusually lacking in crowds as they walked casually through them getting closer and closer to the middle of the city but there were many curtains that moved as they passed many faces seen at windows and bewchard grinned as if relishing the sit uation we are the only actors on the stage today my friends he said we must play our parts well then at last hawkmoon saw his first glimpse of the walls of starvel they rose above the rooftops white and proud and enigmatic seemingly without gates there are a few small gates bewchard told hawk moon but they are rarely used instead they have huge underground waterways and docks these of course lead directly to the river bewchard led them into a sidestreet and indicated a sign about halfway down there my friendstheres our outfitter they entered the shop crammed with bales of cloth with heaps of cloaks and jerkins and britches swords and daggers of all description fine harness helmets hats boots belts and everything else that a man could possibly want to wear the owner of the shop was serving another customer as they entered the owner was a middleaged man wellbuilt and genial with a red face and pure white hair he smiled at bewchard and the customer turneda youth whose eyes widened when he saw the three standing in the doorway of the shop the youth muttered something and made to leave you do not want the sword master the outfitter asked in surprise i would drop my price by half a smaygar but not more another time pyahr another time answered the youth hurriedly bowed swiftly to bewchard and left the shop who was that asked hawkmoon with a smile veroneegs son if i remember right bewchard re plied he laughed he has inherited his fathers cowardice pyahr came up good afternoon captain bewchard i had not expected to see you here today you did not make the announcement no pyahr i did not pyahr smiled i had a feeling you wouldnt cap tain however you are in considerable danger now valjon will have to pursue the matter will he not he will have to try pyahr he will try soon captain he will waste no tune are you sure it is wise to come so close to the walls of starvel i have to show that i am not afraid of valjon bewchard answered besides why should i change my plans for him i promised my friends here that they could choose clothing from the finest outfitter in nar leen and i am not a man to forget a promise like that pyahr smiled and made a dismissive gesture with his hand i wish you luck captain now gentleman what do you see that you like hawkmoon picked up a cloak of rich scarlet finger ing its golden clasp i see much that i like you have a fine shop master pyahr while bewchard chatted with the shopkeeper hawk moon and daverc wandered slowly around the shop picking out a shirt here and a pair of boots there two hours passed before they had finally made up their minds why do you not go into my dressing rooms and try on the clothes pyahr suggested i think you have chosen well gentlemen hawkmoon and daverc retired into the dressing rooms hawkmoon had a shirt of silk in a deep laven der shade a jerkin of soft lightcolored brushed leath er a scarf of purple and fine flaring britches that were also of silk and a purple that matched the scarf which he knotted about his neck these britches he tucked into boots of the same leather as the jerkin which he left unbuttoned he drew a wide leather belt about his waist and then clasped a cloak of deep blue over his shoulders daverc had taken for himself a scarlet shut and matching britches a jerkin of shining black leather and boots that were also of black leather and reached almost to his knees over this he drew a cloak of stiff silk colored deep purple he was reaching for his sword belt when there came a shout from the shop hawkmoon parted the curtains of the dressing room the shop was suddenly full of menevidently pi rates from starvel they had surrounded bewchard who had not had time to draw his sword hawkmoon wheeled and picked up his sword from the pile of discarded clothing rushing into the shop to collide with pyahr who was staggering back blood pumping from his throat even now the pirates were backing out of the shop and bewchard could not even be seen hawkmoon stabbed a pirate directly in the heart defended himself from anothers thrust do not try to fight us snarled the pirate who had tried to stab him we want only bewchard then you must kill us before you take him cried daverc who had joined hawkmoon bewchard goes to find his punishment for insulting our lord valjon the pirate told him and slashed at him daverc leapt back bringing his sword up in a flickering movement that knocked the pirates blade from his hand the man snarled hurling the dagger that was in his other hand but daverc deflected this also thrusting out to take the man in the throat now half the pirates had detached themselves from their fellows and advanced on hawkmoon and daverc who were pressed backward into the shop theyre escaping with bewchard hawkmoon said desperately we must aid him he thrust savagely at his attackers trying to cut his way through them to go to bewchards assistance but then he heard daverc yell from behind him more of themcoming through the back exit that was the last he heard before he felt a sword hilt slam against the base of his skull and he fell for ward onto a heap of shirts he awoke feeling smothered and rolled over onto his back it was getting dark inside the shop and it was strangely silent now he staggered up his sword still in his hand the first thing he saw was pyahrs corpse sprawled near the cur tains of the dressing room the second thing he saw was what seemed to be davercs corpse lying stretched across the bale of orange cloth blood covering most of his features hawkmoon went to his friend put his hand inside his jerkin and with relief heard his heart beating like him it seemed daverc had only been stunned doubt less the pirates had left them behind intentionally want ing someone to tell the citizens of narleen what befell those who like pahl bewchard offended the lord val jon hawkmoon stumbled to the back of the shop and found a pitcher of water he carried it back to where his friend lay and put the pitcher to davercs lips then he tore off a strip from the bale of cloth and bathed the face the blood had come from a broad but shallow cut across the temple daverc began to stir opened his eyes and looked directly into hawkmoons bewchard he said we must rescue him hawk moon hawkmoon nodded bleakly aye but he is in star vel by now no one knows that but us daverc said rising stiffly to a sitting position if we could rescue him and bring him back then tell the city the story think what that would do for the citizens morale very well said hawkmoon we shall pay a visit to starveland pray that bewchard still lives he sheathed his sword we must climb those walls some how daverc we shall need equipment doubtless well find all we want in this shop daverc replied come let us move swiftly it is already nightfall hawkmoon fingered the black jewel set in his fore head his thoughts went again to yisselda to count brass oladahn and bowgentle wondering about their fate his whole impulse was to forget about bewchard forget about mygans instructions the legendary sword of the dawn and the equally legendary runestaff to steal one of the ships from the harbour and set off across the sea to try to find his beloved but then he sighed and straightened his back they could not leave bewchard to his fate they must try to rescue him or die he thought of the walls of starvel that lay so close perhaps no one had tried to scale them before for they were very steep and doubtless wellguarded per haps it could be done however they would have to try chapter nine the temple of batach gerandiun each with more than a score of daggers stuck in their belts hawkmoon and daverc began to scale the walls of starvel hawkmoon went first wrapping cloth around the hilt of a dagger and then searching for a crack in the stone into which to insert the point tap it gently into place praying that no one above would hear him and that the dagger would hold slowly they ascended the wall testing the daggers as they went once hawkmoon felt a blade begin to give beneath his foot clung to the dagger he had just in serted above his head as he felt that too begin to work loose a hundred feet below was the street desperate ly he took another dagger from his belt and hunted for a crack in the stone found one and plunged the blade in it held while the dagger supporting his foot fell away he heard a thin clatter as it landed in the street now he hung unable to move up or down as daverc tried to insert another dagger into the crack at last he succeeded and hawkmoon breathed with relief they were near the top of the wall now only a few more feet to goand no idea what awaited either on the wall or beyond it perhaps their efforts were useless perhaps bewchard was already dead there was no point in thinking such thoughts now hawkmoon went even more cautiously as he reached the top he heard a footfall above him and knew that a guard was passing he paused in his work only one more dagger and he would be able to gain the top of the wall he glanced down saw davercs face grim in the moonlight the footfalls died away and he con tinued tapping in the dagger then just as he was heaving himself upwards the footsteps came back moving much more rapidly than before hawkmoon looked updirectly into the face of a startled pirate instantly hawkmoon risked everything sprang for the top of the wall grasped it as the man drew his blade flung himself upwards and struck with all his might at the mans legs the pirate gasped tried to regain his balance and then fell soundlessly breathing rapidly hawkmoon reached down and helped daverc to the top of the wall running along it now came two more guards hawkmoon rose drew his sword and prepared to meet them metal clashed on metal as daverc and hawkmoon engaged the two pirates the exchange was short for the two companions had little time to waste and were desperate almost as one their blades struck for the hearts of the pirate guards sank into flesh and were withdrawn almost as one the guards collapsed and lay still hawkmoon and daverc glanced up and down the length of the wall it seemed that they had not yet been detected by others hawkmoon pointed to a stairway leading down to the ground daverc nodded and they made their way toward it descending softly and as rapidly as they dared hoping no one would come up it was dark and quiet below it seemed a city of the dead far away in the center of starvel a beacon gleamed butelsewhere all was in darkness save for a little light that escaped from the shutters of windows or through cracks in doors as they drew nearer to the ground they heard a few sounds from the housesof coarse laughter and roister ing once a door opened showing a crowded drunken scene inside and a pirate staggered drunkenly out curs ing something falling flat on his face on the cobbles the door closed the pirate did not stir the buildings of starvel were simpler than those be yond the wall they did not have the rich decoration of narleen and if hawkmoon had not known better he would have thought that starvel was the poorer city but bewchard had told him that the pirates only dis played their wealth on their ships their backs and in the mysterious temple of batach gerandiun where the sword of the dawn was said to hang they crept into the streets swords ready even as suming bewchard was still alive they had no idea where he was being held prisoner but something drew them towards the beacon in the center of the city then when they were quite close to the light the sonorous boom of a drum suddenly filled the air echo ing through the dark empty streets then they heard the tramp of feet the clatter of horses hooves nearby whats that hissed daverc he peered cautiously around a building and then rapidly withdrew his head theyre coming towards us he said get back torchlight began to flicker and huge shadows swam into the street ahead of them hawkmoon and daverc backed away into the darkness watching as a proces sion began to file past it was led by valjon himself his pale face stark and rigid his eyes staring straight ahead of him as he rode a black horse through the streets towards the place where the beacon burned behind him were drummers beating out a slow monotonous rhythm and behind them another group of armed horsemen all richly clad these must be the other lords of starvel their faces too were set and they sat in their saddles as stiffly as statues but it was that which came behind these pirate lords which caught the watchers main attention it was bewchard his arms and legs were stretched out on a great frame of whalebone fixed upright upon a wheeled plat form drawn by six horses led by liveried pirates he was pale and his naked body was covered in sweat he was evidently in great pain but his lips were pressed grimly together on his torso strange symbols had been painted and there were similar markings on his cheeks his muscles strained as he struggled to free himself from the cords biting into his ankles and wrists but he was securely bound as daverc made a movement to spring forward hawkmoon restrained him no he whispered fol low them we might have a better chance to save him later they let the rest of the procession pass and then crept after it it moved slowly on until it entered a wide square lit by a great beacon glowing over the doorway of a tall building of strange asymmetrical architecture which seemed to have been formed naturally out of some glassy volcanic stuff it was an ominous con struction the temple of batach gerandiun without ques tion hawkmoon murmured i wonder why they take him there let us find out daverc said as the procession filed into the temple together they darted across the square and crouched in the shadows near the door it was half open apparently no attempt had been made to guard it perhaps the pirates believed that no one would dare enter such a place unless it was their right looking about him to see if they were observed hawkmoon crept toward the door and pushed it slowly open he was in a dark passage from round a corner came a reddish glow and the sound of chanting daverc close behind him hawkmoon began to move down the corridor hawkmoon paused before he reached the corner a strange smell was in his nostrils a disgusting smell that was at once familiar and unfamiliar he shuddered and took a step back davercs face wrinkled in nau sea ughwhat is it hawkmoon shook his head something about it the smell of blood perhaps yet not just blood davercs eyes were wide as he looked at hawk moon it seemed that he was about to suggest that they go no further then he squared his shoulders and took a stronger grip on his sword he pulled off the scarf around his throat and pressed it to nose and lips in an ostentatious gesture reminding hawkmoon much more of davercs normal self and making him grin but he followed davercs action and unwound his own scarf and placed it to his face then they moved forward again turning the corner of the passage the light grew brighter a rosy radiance not unlike the color of fresh blood it emanated from a doorway at the far end of the corridor seeming to pulse to the rhythm of the chanting which now grew louder and held a note of terrible menace the stench too grew worse as they advanced once a figure crossed the space from which the pulsing radiance poured hawkmoon and daverc stood stock still but were unseen the silhouette van ished and they continued to advance just as the stench assailed their nostrils so the chant ing began to offend their ears there was something weirdly offkey about it something that grated on their nerves with their eyes halfblinded by the rosy light it seemed that all their senses were under attack at once but still they pressed on until they stood only a foot or two from the entrance they stared and they shuddered the hall was roughly circular but with a roof whose height varied enormously in this it resembled the out ward appearance of the building seeming to be less artificial than organic rising and falling in a purely arbitrary way as far as hawkmoon could tell all the glassy walls reflected the rosy radiance so that the whole scene was stained red the light came from a place high in the roof and it drew hawkmoons wincing gaze upward he recognised it immediately recognised the thing hanging there dominating the hall it was without doubt the thing that with his dying breath mygan had sent him here to find the sword of the dawn whispered daverc the foul thing can have no part in our destinies surely hawkmoons face was grim he shrugged that is not what we are here to take he is what we have come for and he pointed below the sword were stretched a dozen figures all on the whalebone frames arranged in a semicircle not all the men and women on the frames were alive but most were dying daverc turned his face away from the sight but then his expression one of purest horror forced him self to look back again by the runestaff he gasped its barbaric veins had been cut in the naked bodies and from those veins the lifeblood pumped slowly the wretched on the bone frames were being bled to death those who lived had faces twisted in anguish and their struggles weakened gradually as their blood dripped dripped into the pit below them a pit that had been carved from the obsidian rock it was a pit too in which things moved rising to the surface to lap at the fresh blood as it fell then darting down again dark shapes moving in the deep pool of blood how deep was the pool how many thousands had died to fill it what peculiar properties did the pool contain so that the blood did not congeal around the pool were clustered the pirate lords of starvel chanting and swaying their faces lifted up to the sword of the dawn immediately below the sword his body straining on the frame bewchard hung there was a knife in valjons hand and there could be no doubting the use he intended to make of it bew chard stared down at him with loathing and said some thing hawkmoon could not hear the knife glistened as if already wet with blood the chanting grew louder and valjons hollow tones could be heard through it sword of the dawn in which the spirit of our god and ancestor dwells sword of the dawn which made batach gerandiun invincible and won us all we have sword of the dawn which makes the dead come alive causes the living to remain living which draws its light from the lifeblood of men sword of the dawn ac cept this our latest sacrifice and continue to know that you shall be worshipped for all time while you stay in the temple of batach gerandiun then starvel shall never fall take this thing this enemy of ours this up start take this pahl bewchard of that coarse caste who call themselves merchants bewchard spoke again his lips writhing but his voice could not be heard above the hysterical chanting of the other pirate lords the knife began to move toward bewchards body and hawkmoon could not restrain himself the battle cry of his ancestors came automatically to his lips and he screamed the wild birdcry and voiced the words hawkmoon hawkmoon and he dashed forward at the gathered ghouls at the noisome pit and its terrible denizens the frames on which the dead and dying were stretched below the shining awesome sword hawkmoon hawkmoon the pirate lords turned their chanting over val jons eyes widened in rage and he cast back his robe to reveal a sword that was the twin to the one hawkmoon carried he cast the knife into the pit of blood and drew his blade fool it is a truth that no stranger who enters batachs temple ever leaves until his body is drained of its blood it is your body will bleed tonight valjon cried hawkmoon and he struck at his enemy but suddenly there were twenty men blocking his way to valjon twenty blades against his one he lashed at them in fury his throat clogged with the dreadful stench his eyes dazzled by the light from the sword catching glimpses of bewchard struggling in his bonds he stabbed and a man died he slashed and another staggered back into the pit to be dragged down by whatever dwelt there he hacked and another pi rate lost a hand daverc too did well and they held the pirates at bay for a while it seemed their fury would carry them through all the pirates to bewchard and save him hawkmoon hacked his way into the group and man aged to reach the edge of the terrible bloodfilled pit tried to cut bewchards bonds while he fought off the pirates at the same time but then his foot slipped on the edge of the pool and he sank into it up to his ankle he felt something touch his foot something sinuous and disgusting withdrew as fast as he could and found his arms clutched by pirates he flung back his head and called i am sorry bewchardi was impetuousbut there was no time no time you should not have followed me bewchard cried in misery now you too shall suffer my fate and feed the monsters of the pit oh you should not have fol lowed me hawkmoon chapter ten a friend from the shadows i am afraid friend bewchard that your gener osity was wasted on us even in this predicament daverc could not resist the irony he and hawkmoon were spreadeagled on either side of bewchard two of the dead sacrificial victims had been cut down and they had replaced them below the black things rose and dived restlessly in the pool of blood above the light from the sword of the dawn cast a red glow throughout the hall cast a glow upon the upturned expectant faces of the pirate lords upon valjons face as his brooding eyes stared with a kind of triumph at their stripped bodies which like bewchards had been daubed with peculiar symbols there were strange plopping noises below as the creatures in the pit swam about in the blood waiting no doubt for the fresh blood to fall into their pool hawkmoon shuddered and barely restrained himself from vomiting his head ached and his limbs felt weak and incredibly painful he thought of yisselda of his home and his efforts to wage war on the dark empire now he would never see his wife again never breathe the air of the kamarg never aid in the downfall of granbretan should that time ever come and he had lost all that in a vain effort to save a stranger a man he hardly knew whose fight was remote and unimportant compared with the fight against the dark empire now it was too late to consider those things for he was going to die he would die in a terrible way bled like a pig feeling his strength ebbing from him with every pulse of his heart valjon smiled you do not call out a bold battlecry now my slave friend you seem silent have you nothing to ask me would you not beg for your lifebeg to be made my slave again would you not apologise for sinking my ship for killing my men for insulting me hawkmoon spat at him valjon gave a slight shrug i wait for a new knife when that is brought and properly blessed then i shall slit your veins here and there making sure that you die very slowly that you will be able to see your blood feeding the ones below your bloodless corpses will be sent to the mayor of narleenbewchards uncle if im not mistakenas evidence that we of star vel do not expect to be disobeyed a pirate came through the hall and kneeled at val jons feet offering him a long sharp knife valjon ac cepted it and the pirate backed away valjon now murmured words over the knife looking often up at the sword of the dawn then he took the knife in his right hand and raised it until its tip was al most touching hawkmoons groin now we shall begin again said valjon and slowly he started to chant the litany hawkmoon had heard earlier hawkmoon tasted bile in his mouth as he tried to break free of the cords that bound him the words droned on the chanting rose in volume and in hysteri cal pitch sword of the dawn which makes the dead come alive causes the living to remain living the tip of the knife stroked hawkmoons thigh which draws its light from the lifeblood of men absently hawkmoon wondered if indeed the rosy sword did derive its light in some peculiar way from blood the knife touched his knee and he shuddered again cursing at valjon struggling wildly in the bonds know that you shall be worshipped for all time suddenly valjon paused in his chanting and gasped looking beyond hawkmoon to a spot above his head hawkmoon craned his neck back and gasped too the sword of the dawn was descending from the roof it came slowly and then hawkmoon could see that it hung in a land of web of metallic ropesand there was something else in the web nowthe figure of a man the man wore a long helmet that hid all his face his armour and trappings were all black and golden and at his side he bore a huge broadsword hawkmoon could not believe it he recognised the manif man it was the warrior in jet and gold he cried at your service said a sardonic voice from within the helm valjon snarled with rage and flung the knife at the warrior in jet and gold it clattered on his armour and fell into the pool the warrior hung by one gauntleted hand to the pommel of the sword of the dawn and carefully cut at the thongs holding hawkmoons wrists youyou desecrate our most holy object valjon said unbelievingly why are you not punished our god batach gerandiun will have his vengeance the sword is his it contains his spirit i know better said the warrior the sword is hawkmoons the runestaff saw fit once to use your ancestor batach gerandiun for its purposes giving him power over this rosy blade but now you have lost the power and hawkmoon here has it i do not understand you valjon said baffled and who are you where do you come from are youcould you bebatach gerandiun i could be murmured the warrior i could be many things many men hawkmoon prayed that the warrior would be fin ished in time valjon would not remain so dazed for ever he clung to the frame as his wrists came free took the knife the warrior handed him began gingerly to cut at the thongs binding his ankles valjon shook his head this is impossible a nightmare he turned to his fellow pirates do you see it toothe man who hangs from our sword they nodded dumbly one of them began to run back towards the entrance of the hall ill fetch men men to aid us hawkmoon sprang thensprang for the nearest pi rate lord and grasped him by the throat the man cried out tried to wrench hawkmoons hands away but hawkmoon bent back his head until the neck snapped swiftly drew the sword from the corpses scabbard and let the body drop there he stood naked in the glow from the great sword while the warrior in jet and gold cut at the bonds of his friends valjon backed away his eyes disbelieving it can not be it cannot be now daverc swung down to stand beside hawk moon then bewchard joined him both were unarmed and naked nonplussed by their leaders indecision the other pi rates made no move behind the naked trio the war rior in jet and gold swung on the great sword drag ging it nearer to the floor valjon screamed and grabbed for the blade wrench ing it from its web of metal it is mine it is mine by right the warrior in jet and gold shook his head it is hawkmoons by right valjon clutched the sword to him he shall not have it destroy them now men were rushing into the hall bearing brands and the pirate lords drew their swords began to ad vance on the four who stood by the pool the warrior in jet and gold drew his own great blade and swept it before him like a scythe driving the pirates back kill ing several take up their swords he told bewchard and daverc now we must fight bewchard and daverc did as the warrior instructed and following behind him pushed forward but now it seemed that a thousand men filled the hall they had gleaming eyes which lusted for their lives you must take that sword from valjon hawk moon shouted the warrior above the din of battle take itor we shall all perish again they were pressed back to the edge of the bloody pit and behind them there came a slobbering sound hawkmoon darted a look into the pit and cried out in horror they are rising from the pool and now the creatures swam toward the edge and hawkmoon saw that they were like the tentacled crea ture they had encountered in the forest but smaller evidently they were of the same breed brought here centuries before by valjons ancestors gradually adapt ing from an environment of water to an environment of human blood he felt a tentacle touch his naked flesh and he shud dered in cold terror the peril at his back gave him extra strength and he drove with all his might at the pirates seeking out valjon who stood nearby clutching at the sword of the dawn which engulfed him in its weird red radiance seeing his danger valjon moved his hand to the hilt of the sword called out something and waited expec tantly but what he expected to happen did not occur and he gasped running at hawkmoon with the sword raised high hawkmoon sidestepped blocked the blow and stag gered halfblinded by the light valjon screamed and swung the rosy sword again hawkmoon ducked be neath the swing and brought his own blade in catch ing valjon in the shoulder with a great bewildered cry valjon struck again and again his blow was avoided by the naked man valjon paused studying hawkmoons face his ex pression one of mingled terror and astonishment how can it be he murmured how can it be hawkmoon laughed then do not ask me valjon for all this is as much a mystery to me as it is to you but i was told to take your sword and take it i shall and with that he aimed another thrust at valjon which the pirate lord deflected with a sweeping motion of the sword of the dawn now valjons back was toward the pit and hawk moon saw that the things blood streaming down their scaly sides were beginning to crawl onto the floor hawkmoon drove the pirate lord further and further toward the dreadful creatures he saw a tentacle reach out and catch valjons leg heard the man scream in fear and try to hack at the tentacle with his blade hawkmoon stepped forward then aimed a blow at valjons face with his fist and with his other hand wrenched the sword from the pirate lords hand then he watched grimly as valjon was dragged slow ly into the pool valjon stretched out his hands to hawkmoon save meplease save me hawkmoon but hawkmoons eyes were bleak and he did noth ing simply stood with his hands on the pommel of the sword of the dawn as valjon was dragged closer and closer to the pit of blood valjon said nothing further but covered his face with his hands as first one leg and then the other was drawn into the pool there came a long despairing scream and valjon disappeared beneath the surface of the pool hawkmoon turned now hefting the heavy sword and marvelling at the light which shone from it he took it in both hands and looked to see how his friends were faring they stood in a tight group fighting off scores of enemies and it was plain that they would have been overwhelmed by now had it not been for the fact that the pool was disgorging its terrible contents the warrior saw that he had the blade and cried out something but hawkmoon could not hear it he was forced to bring the sword up to defend himself as a knot of pirates came at him drove them back and cut through them in an effort to join his friends the things from the pit were crowding the edge now slithering over the floor and hawkmoon realised that their position was virtually hopeless for they were trapped between a horde of swordsmen on one hand and the creatures of the pool on the other again the warrior in jet and gold tried to cry out but still hawkmoon could not hear him he battled on desperately trying to reach the warrior hacking off a head here a limb there and slowly coming closer and closer to his mysterious ally the warriors voice sounded again and this time hawkmoon heard the words call for them he boomed call for the legion of the dawn hawkmoon or were lost hawkmoon frowned what do you mean it is your right to command the legion summon them in the name of the runestaff man summon them hawkmoon parried a thrust and cut down the man who attacked him the blades light seemed to be fad ing but it could have been that it was now in competi tion with the scores of torches blazing in the hall call for your men hawkmoon cried the warrior in jet and gold desperately hawkmoon shrugged and disbelievingly cried out i summon the legion of the dawn nothing happened hawkmoon had expected noth ing he had no faith in legends as he had said before but then he noticed that the pirates were screaming and that new figures had appeared from nowhere strange figures who blazed with rosy light who struck about them ferociously chopping down the pirates hawkmoon drew a deep breath and wondered at the sight the newcomers were dressed in highly ornamental armor somehow reminiscent of a past age they were armed with lances decorated with tufts of dyed hair with huge notched clubs covered with ornate carvings and they howled and shouted and killed with incredi ble ferocity driving many pirates from the hall within moments their bodies were brown their faces covered in paint from which huge black eyes stared and from their throats came a strange moaning dirge the pirates fought back desperately striking down the shining warriors but as a man died his body would vanish and a new warrior would appear from no where hawkmoon tried to see where they came from but he was never able to do sohe would turn his head and when he looked back a new warrior would be standing there panting hawkmoon joined his friends the naked bodies of bewchard and daverc were cut in a dozen places but not badly they stood and watched as the legion of the dawn slaughtered the pirates these are the soldiers who serve the sword said the warrior in jet and gold with them because it then suited the runestaffs scheme of things valjons ancestor made himself feared throughout narleen and its surrounds but now the sword turns against val jons people to take from them what it gave them hawkmoon felt something touch his ankle turned and shouted in horror the things from the pit i had forgotten them he hacked at the tentacle instantly there were a dozen of the shining warriors between him and the monsters the tufted lances rose and fell the clubs battered and the monsters tried to re treat but the soldiers of the dawn would not let them retreat they surrounded them stabbing and hacking until all that remained was a black mess staining the floor of the hall it is done bewchard said incredulously we are the victors the power of starvel is broken at last he stooped and picked up a brand come friend hawk moon let us lead your ghostly warriors forward into the city let us kill all we find let us burn aye hawkmoon began but the warrior in jet and gold shook his head noit is not for killing pirates that the legion is yours hawkmoon it is yours so that you may do the runestaffs work hawkmoon hesitated the warrior placed a hand on bewchards shoulder now that most of the pirate lords are dead and valjon destroyed there will be nothing to stop you and your men returning to starvel to finish the work we began tonight but hawkmoon and his blade are needed for greater things he must leave soon hawkmoon felt anger come then i am grateful to you warrior in jet and gold for what you have done to aid me but i would remind you that i would not be here at all had it not been for your schemings and those of dead mygan of llandar i need to return hometo castle brass and my beloved i am my own man warrior i will decide my fate and then the warrior in jet and gold laughed you are still an innocent dorian hawkmoon you are the runestaffs man believe me you thought you came to this temple merely to help a friend who needed you but it is the runestaffs way to work thus you would not have dared the pirate lords had you simply been trying to get the sword of the dawn in whose legend you did not believe but you did dare them to rescue bewchard here the web the runestaff weaves is a complicated web men are never aware of the pur poses of their actions where the runestaff is concerned now you must continue on the second part of your mission in amarehk you must journey northyou can go round the coast for bewchard i am sure will lend you a shipand find dnark the city of the great good ones who will need your aid there you will find proof that the runestaff exists i am not interested in mysteries warrior i want to know what has become of my wife and friends tell medo we exist in the same era aye said the warrior this time is concurrent with the time you left in europe but as you know castle brass exists elsewhere i know that hawkmoon frowned thoughtfully well warrior perhaps i will agree to take bewchards ship and go on to dnark perhaps the warrior nodded come he said let us leave this unclean place and make our way back to narleen there we can discuss with bewchard the matter of a ship bewchard smiled anything hawkmoon that i have is yours for you have done much for me and the whole of my city you saved my life and you were responsible for destroying narleens ageold enemies you may have twenty ships if you wish them hawkmoon was thinking deeply he had it in mind to deceive the warrior in jet and gold chapter eleven the parting bewchard escorted them next afternoon to the quayside the citizens were celebrating a force of soldiers had invaded starvel and routed out every last pirate bewchard put his hand on hawkmoons arm i wish that you would stay friend hawkmoon we shall be having celebrations for a week yetand you and your friends should be here it will be sad for me cele brating without your companyfor you are the true heroes of narleen not i we were lucky captain bewchard it was our good fortune that our fates were linked you are rid of your enemiesand we have obtained that which we sought hawkmoon smiled we must leave now bewchard nodded if you must you must he looked frankly at hawkmoon and grinned i do not suppose that you still believe i am entirely convinced by your story of a scholar relative interested in that sword you now wear hawkmoon laughed nobut on the other hand captain i can give you no better story i do not know why i had to find the sword he patted the scab bard that now held the sword of the dawn the war rior in jet and gold here says that it is all part of a larger destiny yet i am an unwilling slave to that destiny all i seek is a little love a little peace and to be revenged upon those who have ravaged my home land yet here i am on a continent thousands of miles away from where i desire to be off to seek another legendary objectand reluctantly perhaps we shall all understand these matters in time bewchard looked at him seriously i think you serve a great purpose hawkmoon i think your destiny is a noble one hawkmoon laughed and yet i do not pine for a noble destinymerely a secure one perhaps said bewchard my friend my best ship is prepared for you and wellprovisioned narleens finest sailors have begged to sail with you and now man her good luck in your quest hawkmoonand you too daverc daverc coughed into his hand if hawkmoon is an unwilling servant of this greater destiny then what does that make me a great fool perhaps i am unwell i have a chronically poor constitution and yet find my self dragged about the world in the service of this mythical runestaff still it kills time i suppose hawkmoon smiled then turned almost anxiously to mount the gangplank of the ship the warrior in jet and gold moved impatiently dnark hawkmoon he said you must seek the runestaff itself in dnark aye said hawkmoon i heard you warrior the sword of the dawn is needed in dnark con tinued the warrior in jet and gold and you are needed to wield it then i shall do as you desire warrior hawkmoon replied lightly do you sail with us i have other matters to attend to we shall meet again doubtless doubtless daverc coughed and raised his hand then fare well warrior thanks for your aid thank you for yours replied the warrior enig matically hawkmoon gave the order for the gangplank to be raised and the oars to be unshipped soon the ship was pulling out of the bay and into the open sea hawkmoon watched the figures of bew chard and the warrior in jet and gold become smaller and smaller and smaller and then he turned and smiled at daverc well daverc do you know where we are going to dnark i take it daverc replied innocently to europe daverc i care not for this destiny i wish to see my wife again we are going to sail across the sea davercfor europe there we may use our rings to take us back to castle brass i would see yis selda again daverc said nothing merely turned his head to look upward as the white sails billowed and the ship began to gather speed what do you say to that daverc hawkmoon asked with a grin slapping his friend on the back daverc shrugged i say that it would be a welcome rest to spend some time in castle brass again there is something about your tone friend some thing a trifle sardonic hawkmoon frowned what is it daverc gave him a sidelong glance that matched his tone maybe i am not as sure as you hawkmoon that this ship will find its way to europe perhaps i have a greater respect for the runestaff you believe in such legends why amarehk was supposed to be a place of godlike people it was far from that eh i think you insist on the runestaffs nonexistence too much i think your anxiety to see yisselda must in fluence you considerably possibly daverc stared out to sea time will tell us how strong the runestaff is hawkmoon gave him a puzzled look before he shrugged walking away down the deck daverc smiled shaking his head as he watched his friend then he turned his attention to the sails wondering privately if he would ever see castle brass again this ends the third volume in the high history of the runestaff
