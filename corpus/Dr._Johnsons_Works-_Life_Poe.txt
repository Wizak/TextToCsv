dr johnsons works life poems and tales volume volume the first mdcccxxv advertisement it may be asserted without a partial panegyric of the object of our praise that the works of no single author in the wide range of british literature not excepting perhaps even addison contain a richer and more varied fund of rational entertainment and sound instruction than those of dr johnson a correct edition of his works must therefore be an acceptable contribution to the mass of national literature that the present edition has perhaps fairer claims on public approbation than most preceding ones we feel ourselves justified in asserting without envious detraction of those who have gone before us it has been our wish and diligent endeavour to give as accurate a text as possible to which we have subjoined notes where elucidation seemed to be required they have been collected with care and will prove our impartiality by their occasional censures of the faults and failings of the writer whose works it is our office to illustrate and our more common and more grateful task to praise though being diffused over a wide space they appear less numerous than they really are it has been our incessant care to abstain from that method of redundant annotation which tends to display the ingenuity or mental resources of an editor much more than to illustrate the original writer notes have been chiefly introduced for the purpose of guarding our readers against some political sophisms or to correct some hasty error but happily in the writings to which we have devoted our time and attention the chaff and dross lie so open to view and are so easily separated from purer matter that a hint is sufficient to protect the most incautious from harm accordingly in our notes and prefaces we have confined ourselves to simple and succinct histories of the respective works under consideration and have avoided as much as might be a burdensome repetition of criticisms or anecdotes in almost every persons possession or an idle pointing out of beauties which none could fail to recognise the length of time that has elapsed since the writings of johnson were first published has amply developed their intrinsic merits and destroyed the personal and party prejudices which assail a living author but the years have been too few to render the customs and manners alluded to so obsolete as to require much illustrative researcha it may be satisfactory to subjoin that care has been exercised in every thing that we have advanced and that when we have erred it has been on the side of caution all the usually received works of dr johnson together with murphys essay on his life and genius are comprised in this edition in pursuance of our plan of brevity we shall not here give a list of his minor and unacknowledged productions but refer our readers to boswell a new amended and enlarged edition of whose interesting and picturesque memoirs we purpose speedily to present to the public after the style and manner of the present work one very important addition however we conceive that we have made in publishing the whole of his sermons it has been hitherto the practice to give one or two with a cursory notice that johnsons theological knowledge was scanty or unworthy of his general fame we have acted under a very different impression for though johnson was not nor pretended to be a polemical or controversial divine he well knew how to apply to the right regulation of our moral conduct the lessons of that christianity which was not promulged for a sect but for mankind which sought not a distinctive garb in the philosophers grove nor secluded itself in the hermits cell but entered without reserve every walk of life and sympathized with all the instinctive feelings of our common nature this high privilege of our religion johnson felt and to the diffusion of its practical not of its theoretical advantages he applied the energies of his heart and mind and with what success we leave to every candid reader to pronounce in conclusion we would express a hope that we shall not inaptly commence a series of oxford english classics with the works of one whose writings have so enlarged and embellished the science of moral evidence which has long constituted a characteristic feature in the literary discipline of this university the science of mind and its progress as recorded by history or unfolded by biography was johnsons favourite study and is still the main object of pursuit in the place whose system and institutions he so warmly praised and to which he ever professed himself so deeply indebted if the terseness of attic simplicity has been desiderated by some in the pages of johnson they undeniably display the depth of thought the weight of argument the insight into mind and morals which are to be found in their native dignity only in the compositions of those older writers with whose spirit he was so richly imbued in this place then where those models which johnson admired and imitated are still upheld as the only sure guides to sound learning his writings can never be laid aside unread and neglected oxford june a see a remark on

when the works of a great writer who has bequeathed to posterity a lasting legacy are presented to the world it is naturally expected that some account of his life should accompany the edition the reader wishes to know as much as possible of the author the circumstances that attended him the features of his private character his conversation and the means by which he arose to eminence become the favourite objects of inquiry curiosity is excited and the admirer of his works is eager to know his private opinions his course of study the particularities of his conduct and above all whether he pursued the wisdom which he recommends and practised the virtue which his writings inspire a principle of gratitude is awakened in every generous mind for the entertainment and instruction which genius and diligence have provided for the world men of refined and sensible tempers are ready to pay their tribute of praise and even to form a posthumous friendship with the author in reviewing the life of such a writer there is besides a rule of justice to which the public have an undoubted claim fond admiration and partial friendship should not be suffered to represent his virtues with exaggeration nor should malignity be allowed under a specious disguise to magnify mere defects the usual failings of human nature into vice or gross deformity the lights and shades of the character should be given and if this be done with a strict regard to truth a just estimate of dr johnson will afford a lesson perhaps as valuable as the moral doctrine that speaks with energy in every page of his works the present writer enjoyed the conversation and friendship of that excellent man more than thirty years he thought it an honour to be so connected and to this hour he reflects on his loss with regret but regret he knows has secret bribes by which the judgment may be influenced and partial affection may be carried beyond the bounds of truth in the present case however nothing needs to be disguised and exaggerated praise is unnecessary it is an observation of the younger pliny in his epistle to his friend tacitus that history ought never to magnify matters of fact because worthy actions require nothing but the truth nam nec historia debet egredi veritatem et honeste factis veritas sufficit this rule the present biographer promises shall guide his pen throughout the following narrative it may be said the death of dr johnson kept the public mind in agitation beyond all former example no literary character ever excited so much attention and when the press has teemed with anecdotes apophthegms essays and publications of every kind what occasion now for a new tract on the same threadbare subject the plain truth shall be the answer the proprietors of johnsons works thought the life which they prefixed to their former edition too unwieldy for republication the prodigious variety of foreign matter introduced into that performance seemed to overload the memory of dr johnson and in the account of his own life to leave him hardly visible they wished to have a more concise and for that reason perhaps a more satisfactory account such as may exhibit a just picture of the man and keep him the principal figure in the foreground of his own picture to comply with that request is the design of this essay which the writer undertakes with a trembling hand he has no discoveries no secret anecdotes no occasional controversy no sudden flashes of wit and humour no private conversation and no new facts to embellish his work every thing has been gleaned dr johnson said of himself i am not uncandid nor severe i sometimes say more than i mean in jest and people are apt to think me seriousa the exercise of that privilege which is enjoyed by every man in society has not been allowed to him his fame has given importance even to trifles and the zeal of his friends has brought every thing to light what should be related and what should not has been published without distinction dicenda tacenda locuti every thing that fell from him has been caught with eagerness by his admirers who as he says in one of his letters have acted with the diligence of spies upon his conduct to some of them the following lines in mallets poem on verbal criticism are not inapplicable such that grave bird in northern seas is found whose name a dutchman only knows to sound whereer the king of fish moves on before this humble friend attends from shore to shore with eye still earnest and with bill inclined he picks up what his patron drops behind with those choice cates his palate to regale and is the careful tibbald of a whale after so many essays and volumes of johnsoniana what remains for the present writer perhaps what has not been attempted a short yet full a faithful yet temperate history of dr johnson samuel johnson was born at lichfield september o sb his father michael johnson was a bookseller in that city a man of large athletic make and violent passions wrongheaded positive and at times afflicted with a degree of melancholy little short of madness his mother was sister to dr ford a practising physician and father of cornelius ford generally known by the name of parson ford the same who is represented near the punchbowl in hogarths midnight modern conversation in the life of fenton johnson says that his abilities instead of furnishing convivial merriment to the voluptuous and dissolute might have enabled him to excel among the virtuous and the wise being chaplain to the earl of chesterfield he wished to attend that nobleman on his embassy to the hague colley cibber has recorded the anecdote you should go said the witty peer if to your many vices you would add one more pray my lord what is that hypocrisy my dear doctor johnson had a younger brother named nathaniel who died at the age of twentyseven or twentyeight michael johnson the father was chosen in the year under bailiff of lichfield and in the year he served the office of the senior bailiff he had a brother of the name of andrew who for some years kept the ring at smithfield appropriated to wrestlers and boxers our author used to say that he was never thrown or conquered michael the father died december at the age of seventysix his mother at eightynine of a gradual decay in the year of the family nothing more can be related worthy of notice johnson did not delight in talking of his relations there is little pleasure he said to mrs piozzi in relating the anecdotes of beggary johnson derived from his parents or from an unwholesome nurse the distemper called the kings evil the jacobites at that time believed in the efficacy of the royal touch and accordingly mrs johnson presented her son when two years old before queen anne who for the first time performed that office and communicated to her young patient all the healing virtue in her powerc he was afterwards cut for that scrophulous humour and the under part of his face was seamed and disfigured by the operation it is supposed that this disease deprived him of the sight of his left eye and also impaired his hearing at eight years old he was placed under mr hawkins at the free school in lichfield where he was not remarkable for diligence or regular application whatever he read his tenacious memory made his own in the fields with his schoolfellows he talked more to himself than with his companions in when he was about sixteen years old he went on a visit to his cousin cornelius ford who detained him for some months and in the mean time assisted him in the classics the general direction for his studies which he then received he related to mrs piozzi obtain says ford some general principles of every science he who can talk only on one subject or act only in one department is seldom wanted and perhaps never wished for while the man of general knowledge can often benefit and always please this advice johnson seems to have pursued with a good inclination his reading was always desultory seldom resting on any particular author but rambling from one book to another and by hasty snatches hoarding up a variety of knowledge it may be proper in this place to mention another general rule laid down by ford for johnsons future conduct you will make your way the more easily in the world as you are contented to dispute no mans claim to conversation excellence they will therefore more willingly allow your pretensions as a writer but says mrs piozzi the features of peculiarity which mark a character to all succeeding generations are slow in coming to their growth that ingenious lady adds with her usual vivacity can one on such an occasion forbear recollecting the predictions of boileaus father who said stroking the head of the young satirist this little man has too much wit but he will never speak ill of any one on johnsons return from cornelius ford mr hunter then master of the free school at lichfield refused to receive him again on that foundation at this distance of time what his reasons were it is vain to inquire but to refuse assistance to a lad of promising genius must be pronounced harsh and illiberal it did not however stop the progress of the young students education he was placed at another school at stourbridge in worcestershire under the care of mr wentworth having gone through the rudiments of classic literature he returned to his fathers house and was probably intended for the trade of a bookseller he has been heard to say that he could bind a book at the end of two years being then about nineteen he went to assist the studies of a young gentleman of the name of corbet to the university of oxford and on the st of october both were entered of pembroke college corbet as a gentlemancommoner and johnson as a commoner the college tutor mr jordan was a man of no genius and johnson it seems shewed an early contempt of mean abilities in one or two instances behaving with insolence to that gentleman of his general conduct at the university there are no particulars that merit attention except the translation of popes messiah which was a college exercise imposed upon him as a task by mr jordan corbet left the university in about two years and johnsons salary ceased he was by consequence straitened in his circumstances but he still remained at college mr jordan the tutor went off to a living and was succeeded by dr adams who afterwards became head of the college and was esteemed through life for his learning his talents and his amiable character johnson grew more regular in his attendance ethics theology and classic literature were his favourite studies he discovered notwithstanding early symptoms of that wandering disposition of mind which adhered to him to the end of his life his reading was by fits and starts undirected to any particular science general philology agreeably to his cousin fords advice was the object of his ambition he received at that time an early impression of piety and a taste for the best authors ancient and modern it may notwithstanding be questioned whether except his bible he ever read a book entirely through late in life if any man praised a book in his presence he was sure to ask did you read it through if the answer was in the affirmative he did not seem willing to believe it he continued at the university till the want of pecuniary supplies obliged him to quit the place he obtained however the assistance of a friend and returning in a short time was able to complete a residence of three years the history of his exploits at oxford he used to say was best known to dr taylor and dr adams wonders are told of his memory and indeed all who knew him late in life can witness that he retained that faculty in the greatest vigour from the university johnson returned to lichfield his father died soon after december and the whole receipt out of his effects as appeared by a memorandum in the sons handwriting dated th of june was no more than twenty poundsd in this exigence determined that poverty should neither depress his spirits nor warp his integrity he became undermaster of a grammar school at market bosworth in leicestershire that resource however did not last long disgusted by the pride of sir wolstan dixie the patron of that little seminary he left the place in discontent and ever after spoke of it with abhorrence in he went on a visit to mr hector who had been his schoolfellow and was then a surgeon at birmingham lodging at the house of warren a bookseller at that place johnson translated a voyage to abyssinia written by jerome lobo a portuguese missionary this was the first literary work from the pen of dr johnson his friend hector was occasionally his amanuensis the work was probably undertaken at the desire of warren the bookseller and was printed at birmingham but it appears in the literary magazine or history of the works of the learned for march that it was published by bettesworth and hitch paternoster row it contains a narrative of the endeavours of a company of missionaries to convert the people of abyssinia to the church of rome in the preface to this work johnson observes that the portuguese traveller contrary to the general view of his countrymen has amused his readers with no romantick absurdities or incredible fictions he appears by his modest and unaffected narration to have described things as he saw them to have copied nature from the life and to have consulted his senses not his imagination he meets with no basilisks that destroy with their eyes his crocodiles devour their prey without tears and his cataracts fall from the rock without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants the reader will here find no regions cursed with irremediable barrenness or blessed with spontaneous fecundity no perpetual gloom or unceasing sunshine nor are the nations here described either void of all sense of humanity or consummate in all private and social virtues here are no hottentots without religion polity or articulate language no chinese perfectly polite and completely skilled in all sciences he will discover what will always be discovered by a diligent and impartial inquirer that wherever human nature is to be found there is a mixture of vice and virtue a contest of passion and reason and that the creator doth not appear partial in his distributions but has balanced in most countries their particular inconveniencies by particular favours we have here an early specimen of johnsons manner the vein of thinking and the frame of the sentences are manifestly his we see the infant hercules the translation of lobos narrative has been reprinted lately in a separate volume with some other tracts of dr johnsons and therefore forms no part of this edition but a compendious account of so interesting a work as father lobos discovery of the head of the nile will not it is imagined be unacceptable to the reader father lobo the portuguese missionary embarked in in the same fleet with the count vidigueira who was appointed by the king of portugal viceroy of the indies they arrived at goa and in january father lobo set out on the mission to abyssinia two of the jesuits sent on the same commission were murdered in their attempt to penetrate into that empire lobo had better success he surmounted all difficulties and made his way into the heart of the country then follows a description of abyssinia formerly the largest empire of which we have an account in history it extended from the red sea to the kingdom of congo and from egypt to the indian sea containing no less than forty provinces at the time of lobos mission it was not much larger than spain consisting then but of five kingdoms of which part was entirely subject to the emperour and part paid him a tribute as an acknowledgment the provinces were inhabited by moors pagans jews and christians the last was in lobos time the established and reigning religion the diversity of people and religion is the reason why the kingdom was under different forms of government with laws and customs extremely various some of the people neither sowed their lands nor improved them by any kind of culture living upon milk and flesh and like the arabs encamping without any settled habitation in some places they practised no rites of worship though they believed that in the regions above there dwells a being that governs the world this deity they call in their language oul the christianity professed by the people in some parts is so corrupted with superstitions errours and heresies and so mingled with ceremonies borrowed from the jews that little besides the name of christianity is to be found among them the abyssins cannot properly be said to have either cities or houses they live in tents or cottages made of straw or clay very rarely building with stone their villages or towns consist of these huts yet even of such villages they have but few because the grandees the viceroys and the emperour himself are always in camp that they may be prepared upon the most sudden alarm to meet every emergence in a country which is engaged every year either in foreign wars or intestine commotions aethiopia produces very near the same kinds of provision as portugal though by the extreme laziness of the inhabitants in a much less quantity what the ancients imagined of the torrid zone being a part of the world uninhabitable is so far from being true that the climate is very temperate the blacks have better features than in other countries and are not without wit and ingenuity their apprehension is quick and their judgment sound there are in this climate two harvests in the year one in winter which lasts through the months of july august and september the other in the spring they have in the greatest plenty raisins peaches pomegranates sugarcanes and some figs most of these are ripe about lent which the abyssins keep with great strictness the animals of the country are the lion the elephant the rhinoceros the unicorn horses mules oxen and cows without number they have a very particular custom which obliges every man that has a thousand cows to save every year one days milk of all his herd and make a bath with it for his relations this they do so many days in each year as they have thousands of cattle so that to express how rich a man is they tell you he bathes so many times of the river nile which has furnished so much controversy we have a full and clear description it is called by the natives abavi the father of water it rises in sacala a province of the kingdom of goiama the most fertile and agreeable part of the abyssinian dominions on the eastern side of the country on the declivity of a mountain whose descent is so easy that it seems a beautiful plain is that source of the nile which has been sought after at so much expense and labour this spring or rather these two springs are two holes each about two feet diameter a stones cast distant from each other one of them is about five feet and a half in depth lobo was not able to sink his plummet lower perhaps because it was stopped by roots the whole place being full of trees a line of ten feet did not reach the bottom of the other these springs are supposed by the abyssins to be the vents of a great subterraneous lake at a small distance to the south is a village called guix through which you ascend to the top of the mountain where there is a little hill which the idolatrous agaci hold in great veneration their priest calls them together to this place once a year and every one sacrifices a cow or more according to the different degrees of wealth and devotion hence we have sufficient proof that these nations always paid adoration to the deity of this famous river as to the course of the nile its waters after their first rise run towards the east about the length of a musketshot then turning northward continue hidden in the grass and weeds for about a quarter of a league when they reappear amongst a quantity of rocks the nile from its source proceeds with so inconsiderable a current that it is in danger of being dried up by the hot season but soon receiving an increase from the gemma the keltu the bransa and the other smaller rivers it expands to such a breadth in the plains of boad which is not above three days journey from its source that a musketball will scarcely fly from one bank to the other here it begins to run northward winding however a little to the east for the space of nine or ten leagues and then enters the somuchtalkedof lake of dambia flowing with such violent rapidity that its waters may be distinguished through the whole passage which is no less than six leagues here begins the greatness of the nile fifteen miles farther in the land of alata it rushes precipitately from the top of a high rock and forms one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world lobo says he passed under it without being wet and resting himself for the sake of the coolness was charmed with a thousand delightful rainbows which the sunbeams painted on the water in all their shining and lively colourse the fall of this mighty stream from so great a height makes a noise that may be heard at a considerable distance but it was not found that the neighbouring inhabitants were deaf after the cataract the nile collects its scattered stream among the rocks which are so near each other that in lobos time a bridge of beams on which the whole imperial army passed was laid over them sultan sequed has since built a stone bridge of one arch in the same place for which purpose he procured masons from india here the river alters its course and passes through various kingdoms such as amhara olaca choaa damot and the kingdom of goiama and after various windings returns within a short days journey of its spring to pursue it through all its mazes and accompany it round the kingdom of goiama is a journey of twentynine days from abyssinia the river passes into the countries of fazulo and ombarca two vast regions little known inhabited by nations entirely different from the abyssins their hair like that of the other blacks in those regions is short and curled in the year rassela christos lieutenantgeneral to sultan sequed entered those kingdoms in a hostile manner but not being able to get intelligence returned without attempting any thing as the empire of abyssinia terminates at these descents lobo followed the course of the nile no farther leaving it to rage over barbarous kingdoms and convey wealth and plenty into aegypt which owes to the annual inundations of this river its envied fertilityf lobo knows nothing of the nile in the rest of its passage except that it receives great increase from many other rivers has several cataracts like that already described and that few fish are to be found in it that scarcity is to be attributed to the riverhorse and the crocodile which destroy the weaker inhabitants of the river something likewise must be imputed to the cataracts where fish cannot fall without being killed lobo adds that neither he nor any with whom he conversed about the crocodile ever saw him weep and therefore all that hath been said about his tears must be ranked among the fables invented for the amusement of children as to the causes of the inundations of the nile lobo observes that many an idle hypothesis has been framed some theorists ascribe it to the high winds that stop the current and force the water above its banks others pretend a subterraneous communication between the ocean and the nile and that the sea when violently agitated swells the river many are of opinion that this mighty flood proceeds from the melting of the snow on the mountains of aethiopia but so much snow and such prodigious heat are never met with in the same region lobo never saw snow in abyssinia except on mount semen in the kingdom of tigre very remote from the nile and on namara which is indeed nor far distant but where there never falls snow enough to wet when dissolved the foot of the mountain to the immense labours of the portuguese mankind is indebted for the knowledge of the real cause of these inundations so great and so regular by them we are informed that abyssinia where the nile rises is full of mountains and in its natural situation is much higher than aegypt that in the winter from june to september no day is without rain that the nile receives in its course all the rivers brooks and torrents that fall from those mountains and by necessary consequence swelling above its banks fills the plains of aegypt with inundations which come regularly about the month of july or three weeks after the beginning of the rainy season in aethiopia the different degrees of this flood are such certain indications of the fruitfulness or sterility of the ensuing year that it is publickly proclaimed at cairo how much the water hath gained during the night such is the account of the nile and its inundations which it is hoped will not be deemed an improper or tedious digression especially as the whole is an extract from johnsons translation he is all the time the actor in the scene and in his own words relates the story having finished this work he returned in february to his native city and in the month of august following published proposals for printing by subscription the latin poems of politian with the history of latin poetry from the aera of petrarch to the time of politian and also the life of politian to be added by the editor samuel johnson the book to be printed in thirty octavo sheets price five shillings it is to be regretted that this project failed for want of encouragement johnson it seems differed from boileau voltaire and dalembert who had taken upon them to proscribe all modern efforts to write with elegance in a dead language for a decision pronounced in so high a tone no good reason can be assigned the interests of learning require that the diction of greece and rome should be cultivated with care and he who can write a language with correctness will be most likely to understand its idiom its grammar and its peculiar graces of style what man of taste would willingly forego the pleasure of reading vida fracastorius sannazaro strada and others down to the late elegant productions of bishop lowth the history which johnson proposed to himself would beyond all question have been a valuable addition to the history of letters but his project failed his next expedient was to offer his assistance to cave the original projector of the gentlemans magazine for this purpose he sent his proposals in a letter offering on reasonable terms occasionally to fill some pages with poems and inscriptions never printed before with fugitive pieces that deserved to be revived and critical remarks on authors ancient and modern cave agreed to retain him as a correspondent and contributor to the magazine what the conditions were cannot now be known but certainly they were not sufficient to hinder johnson from casting his eyes about him in quest of other employment accordingly in he made overtures to the reverend mr budworth master of a grammar school at brerewood in staffordshire to become his assistant this proposition did not succeed mr budworth apprehended that the involuntary motions to which johnsons nerves were subject might make him an object of ridicule with his scholars and by consequence lessen their respect for their master another mode of advancing himself presented itself about this time mrs porter the widow of a mercer in birmingham admired his talents it is said that she had about eight hundred pounds and that sum to a person in johnsons circumstances was an affluent fortune a marriage took place and to turn his wifes money to the best advantage he projected the scheme of an academy for education gilbert walmsley at that time registrar of the ecclesiastical court of the bishop of lichfield was distinguished by his erudition and the politeness of his manners he was the friend of johnson and by his weight and influence endeavoured to promote his interest the celebrated garrick whose father captain garrick lived at lichfield was placed in the new seminary of education by that gentlemans advice garrick was then about eighteen years old an accession of seven or eight pupils was the most that could be obtained though notice was given by a public advertisementg that at edial near lichfield in staffordshire young gentlemen are boarded and taught the latin and greek languages by samuel johnson the undertaking proved abortive johnson having now abandoned all hopes of promoting his fortune in the country determined to become an adventurer in the world at large his young pupil garrick had formed the same resolution and accordingly in march they arrived in london together two such candidates for fame perhaps never before that day entered the metropolis together their stock of money was soon exhausted in his visionary project of an academy johnson had probably wasted his wifes substance and garricks father had little more than his halfpay the two fellowtravellers had the world before them and each was to choose his road to fortune and to fame they brought with them genius and powers of mind peculiarly formed by nature for the different vocations to which each of them felt himself inclined they acted from the impulse of young minds even then meditating great things and with courage anticipating success their friend mr walmsley by a letter to the reverend mr colson who it seems was a great mathematician exerted his good offices in their favour he gave notice of their intended journey davy garrick he said will be with you next week and johnson to try his fate with a tragedy and to get himself employed in some translation either from the latin or french johnson is a very good scholar and a poet and i have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedywriter if it should be in your way i doubt not but you will be ready to recommend and assist your countrymen of mr walmsleys merit and the excellence of his character johnson has left a beautiful testimonial at the end of the life of edmund smith it is reasonable to conclude that a mathematician absorbed in abstract speculations was not able to find a sphere of action for two men who were to be the architects of their own fortune in three or four years afterwards garrick came forth with talents that astonished the public he began his career at goodmans fields and there monstratus fatis vespasianus he chose a lucrative profession and consequently soon emerged from all his difficulties johnson was left to toil in the humble walks of literature a tragedy as appears by walmsleys letter was the whole of his stock this most probably was irene but if then finished it was doomed to wait for a more happy period it was offered to fleetwood and rejected johnson looked round him for employment having while he remained in the country corresponded with cave under a feigned name he now thought it time to make himself known to a man whom he considered as a patron of literature cave had announced by public advertisement a prize of fifty pounds for the best poem on life death judgment heaven and hell and this circumstance diffused an idea of his liberality johnson became connected with him in business and in a close and intimate acquaintance of caves character it is unnecessary to say any thing in this place as johnson was afterwards the biographer of his first and most useful patron to be engaged in the translation of some important book was still the object which johnson had in view for this purpose he proposed to give the history of the council of trent with copious notes then lately added to a french edition twelve sheets of this work were printed for which johnson received fortynine pounds as appears by his receipt in the possession of mr nichols the compiler of that entertaining and useful work the gentlemans magazine johnsons translation was never completed a like design was offered to the public under the patronage of dr zachary pearce and by that contention both attempts were frustrated johnson had been commended by pope for the translation of the messiah into latin verse but he knew no approach to so eminent a man with one however who was connected with pope he became acquainted at st johns gate and that person was no other than the wellknown richard savage whose life was afterwards written by johnson with great elegance and a depth of moral reflection savage was a man of considerable talents his address his various accomplishments and above all the peculiarity of his misfortunes recommended him to johnsons notice they became united in the closest intimacy both had great parts and they were equally under the pressure of want sympathy joined them in a league of friendship johnson has been often heard to relate that he and savage walked round grosvenor square till four in the morning in the course of their conversation reforming the world dethroning princes establishing new forms of government and giving laws to the several states of europe till fatigued at length with their legislative office they began to feel the want of refreshment but could not muster up more than fourpencehalfpenny savage it is true had many vices but vice could never strike its roots in a mind like johnsons seasoned early with religion and the principles of moral rectitude his first prayer was composed in the year he had not at that time renounced the use of wine and no doubt occasionally enjoyed his friend and his bottle the love of late hours which followed him through life was perhaps originally contracted in company with savage however that may be their connexion was not of long duration in the year savage was reduced to the last distress mr pope in a letter to him expressed his concern for the miserable withdrawing of his pension after the death of the queen and gave him hopes that in a short time he should find himself supplied with a competence without any dependance on those little creatures whom we are pleased to call the great the scheme proposed to him was that he should retire to swansea in wales and receive an allowance of fifty pounds a year to be raised by subscription pope was to pay twenty pounds this plan though finally established took more than a year before it was carried into execution in the mean time the intended retreat of savage called to johnsons mind the third satire of juvenal in which that poet takes leave of a friend who was withdrawing himself from all the vices of rome struck with this idea he wrote that wellknown poem called london the first lines manifestly point to savage though grief and fondness in my breast rebel when injurd thales bids the town farewell yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend i praise the hermit but regret the friend resolvd at length from vice and london far to breathe in distant fields a purer air and fixd on cambrias solitary shore give to st david one true briton more johnson at that time lodged at greenwich he there fixes the scene and takes leave of his friend who he says in his life parted from him with tears in his eyes the poem when finished was offered to cave it happened however that the late mr dodsley was the purchaser at the price of ten guineas it was published in and pope we are told said the author whoever he is will not be long concealed alluding to the passage in terence ubi ubi est diu celari non potest notwithstanding that prediction it does not appear that besides the copymoney any advantage accrued to the author of a poem written with the elegance and energy of pope johnson in august went with all the fame of his poetry to offer himself a candidate for the mastership of the school at appleby in leicestershire the statutes of the place required that the person chosen should be a master of arts to remove this objection the then lord gower was induced to write to a friend in order to obtain for johnson a masters degree in the university of dublin by the recommendation of dr swift the letter was printed in one of the magazines and was as follows sir mr samuel johnson author of london a satire and some other poetical pieces is a native of this county and much respected by some worthy gentlemen in the neighbourhood who are trustees of a charityschool now vacant the certain salary of which is sixty pounds per year of which they are desirous to make him master but unfortunately he is not capable of receiving their bounty which would make him happy for life by not being a master of arts which by the statutes of the school the master of it must be now these gentlemen do me the honour to think that i have interest enough in you to prevail upon you to write to dean swift to persuade the university of dublin to send a diploma to me constituting this poor man master of arts in their university they highly extol the mans learning and probity and will not be persuaded that the university will make any difficulty of conferring such a favour upon a stranger if he is recommended by the dean they say he is not afraid of the strictest examination though he is of so long a journey and yet he will venture it if the dean thinks it necessary choosing rather to die upon the road than to be starved to death in translating for booksellers which has been his only subsistence for some time past i fear there is more difficulty in this affair than these goodnatured gentlemen apprehend especially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the eleventh of next month if you see this matter in the same light that it appears to me i hope you will burn this and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing but if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked i am sure your humanity and propensity to relieve merit in distress will incline you to serve the poor man without my adding any more to the trouble i have already given you than assuring you that i am with great truth sir your faithful humble servant trentham aug st gower this scheme miscarried there is reason to think that swift declined to meddle in the business and to that circumstance johnsons known dislike of swift has been often imputed it is mortifying to pursue a man of merit through all his difficulties and yet this narrative must be through many following years the history of genius and virtue struggling with adversity having lost the school at appleby johnson was thrown back on the metropolis bred to no profession without relations friends or interest he was condemned to drudgery in the service of cave his only patron in november was published a translation of crousazs examen of popes essay on man containing a succinct view of the system of the fatalists and a confutation of their opinions with an illustration of the doctrine of free will and an enquiry what view mr pope might have in touching upon the leibnitzian philosophy and fatalism by mr crousaz professor of philosophy and mathematics at lausanne this translation has been generally thought a production of johnsons pen but it is now known that mrs elizabeth carter has acknowledged it to be one of her early performances it is certain however that johnson was eager to promote the publication he considered the foreign philosopher as a man zealous in the cause of religion and with him he was willing to join against the system of the fatalists and the doctrine of leibnitz it is well known that warburton wrote a vindication of mr pope but there is reason to think that johnson conceived an early prejudice against the essay on man and what once took root in a mind like his was not easily eradicated his letter to cave on this subject is still extant and may well justify sir john hawkins who inferred that johnson was the translator of crousaz the conclusion of the letter is remarkable i am yours impransus if by that latin word was meant that he had not dined because he wanted the means who can read it even at this hour without an aching heart with a mind naturally vigorous and quickened by necessity johnson formed a multiplicity of projects but most of them proved abortive a number of small tracts issued from his pen with wonderful rapidity such as marmor norfolciense or an essay on an ancient prophetical inscription in monkish rhyme discovered at lynn in norfolk by probus britannicus this was a pamphlet against sir robert walpole according to sir john hawkins a warrant was issued to apprehend the author who retired with his wife to an obscure lodging near lambeth marsh and there eluded the search of the messengers but this story has no foundation in truth johnson was never known to mention such an incident in his life and mr steele late of the treasury caused diligent search to be made at the proper offices and no trace of such a proceeding could be found in the same year the lord chamberlain prohibited the representation of a tragedy called gustavus vasa by henry brooke under the mask of irony johnson published a vindication of the licenser from the malicious and scandalous aspersions of mr brooke of these two pieces sir john hawkins says they have neither learning nor wit nor a single ray of that genius which has since blazed forth but as they have been lately reprinted the reader who wishes to gratify his curiosity is referred to the fourteenth volume of johnsons works published by stockdaleh the lives of boerhaave blake barratier father paul and others were about that time printed in the gentlemans magazine the subscription of fifty pounds a year for savage was completed and in july johnson parted with the companion of his midnight hours never to see him more the separation was perhaps an advantage to him who wanted to make a right use of his time and even then beheld with selfreproach the waste occasioned by dissipation his abstinence from wine and strong liquors began soon after the departure of savage what habits he contracted in the course of that acquaintance cannot now be known the ambition of excelling in conversation and that pride of victory which at times disgraced a man of johnsons genius were perhaps native blemishes a fierce spirit of independence even in the midst of poverty may be seen in savage and if not thence transfused by johnson into his own manners it may at least be supposed to have gained strength from the example before him during that connexion there was if we believe sir john hawkins a short separation between our author and his wife but a reconciliation soon took place johnson loved her and showed his affection in various modes of gallantry which garrick used to render ridiculous by his mimicry the affectation of soft and fashionable airs did not become an unwieldy figure his admiration was received by the wife with the flutter of an antiquated coquette and both it is well known furnished matter for the lively genius of garrick it is a mortifying reflection that johnson with a store of learning and extraordinary talents was not able at the age of thirty to force his way to the favour of the public slow rises worth by poverty depressd he was still as he says himself to provide for the day that was passing over him he saw cave involved in a state of warfare with the numerous competitors at that time struggling with the gentlemans magazine and gratitude for such supplies as johnson received dictated a latin ode on the subject of that contention the first lines urbane nullis fesse laboribus urbane nullis victe calumniis put one in mind of casimirs ode to pope urban urbane regum maxime maxime urbane vatum the polish poet was probably at that time in the hands of a man who had meditated the history of the latin poets guthrie the historian had from july composed the parliamentary speeches for the magazine but from the beginning of the session which opened on the th of november johnson succeeded to that department and continued it from that time to the debate on spirituous liquors which happened in the house of lords in february the eloquence the force of argument and the splendor of language displayed in the several speeches are well known and universally admired that johnson was the author of the debates during that period was not generally known but the secret transpired several years afterwards and was avowed by himself on the following occasion mr wedderburne now lord loughboroughi dr johnson dr francis the translator of horace the present writer and others dined with the late mr foote an important debate towards the end of sir robert walpoles administration being mentioned dr francis observed that mr pitts speech on that occasion was the best he had ever read he added that he had employed eight years of his life in the study of demosthenes and finished a translation of that celebrated orator with all the decorations of style and language within the reach of his capacity but he had met with nothing equal to the speech above mentioned many of the company remembered the debate and some passages were cited with the approbation and applause of all present during the ardour of conversation johnson remained silent as soon as the warmth of praise subsided he opened with these words that speech i wrote in a garret in exeter street the company was struck with astonishment after staring at each other in silent amaze dr francis asked how that speech could be written by him sir said johnson i wrote it in exeter street i never had been in the gallery of the house of commons but once cave had interest with the doorkeepers he and the persons employed under him gained admittance they brought away the subject of discussion the names of the speakers the side they took and the order in which they rose together with notes of the arguments advanced in the course of the debate the whole was afterwards communicated to me and i composed the speeches in the form which they now have in the parliamentary debates to this discovery dr francis made answer then sir you have exceeded demosthenes himself for to say that you have exceeded franciss demosthenes would be saying nothing the rest of the company bestowed lavish encomiums on johnson one in particular praised his impartiality observing that he dealt out reason and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties that is not quite true said johnson i saved appearances tolerably well but i took care that the whig dogs should not have the best of it the sale of the magazine was greatly increased by the parliamentary debates which were continued by johnson till the month of march from that time the magazine was conducted by dr hawkesworth in osborne the bookseller who kept a shop in grays inn purchased the earl of oxfords library at the price of thirteen thousand pounds he projected a catalogue in five octavo volumes at five shillings each johnson was employed in that painful drudgery he was likewise to collect all such small tracts as were in any degree worth preserving in order to reprint and publish the whole in a collection called the harleian miscellany the catalogue was completed and the miscellany in was published in eight quarto volumes in this business johnson was a daylabourer for immediate subsistence not unlike gustavus vasa working in the mines of dalecarlia what wilcox a bookseller of eminence in the strand said to johnson on his first arrival in town was now almost confirmed he lent our author five guineas and then asked him how do you mean to earn your livelihood in this town by my literary labours was the answer wilcox staring at him shook his head by your literary labours you had better buy a porters knot johnson used to tell this anecdote to mr nichols but he said wilcox was one of my best friends and he meant well in fact johnson while employed in grays inn may be said to have carried a porters knot he paused occasionally to peruse the book that came to his hand osborne thought that such curiosity tended to nothing but delay and objected to it with all the pride and insolence of a man who knew that he paid daily wages in the dispute that of course ensued osborne with that roughness which was natural to him enforced his argument by giving the lie johnson seized a folio and knocked the bookseller down this story has been related as an instance of johnsons ferocity but merit cannot always take the spurns of the unworthy with a patient spiritk that the history of an author must be found in his works is in general a true observation and was never more apparent than in the present narrative every aera of johnsons life is fixed by his writings in he published the life of savage and then projected a new edition of shakespeare as a prelude to that design he published in miscellaneous observations on the tragedy of macbeth with remarks on sir thomas hanmers edition to which were prefixed proposals for a new edition of shakespeare with a specimen of this pamphlet warburton in the preface to shakespeare has given his opinion as to all those things which have been published under the title of essays remarks observations c on shakespeare if you except some critical notes on macbeth given as a specimen of a projected edition and written as appears by a man of parts and genius the rest are absolutely below a serious notice but the attention of the public was not excited there was no friend to promote a subscription and the project died to revive at a future day a new undertaking however was soon after proposed namely an english dictionary upon an enlarged plan several of the most opulent booksellers had meditated a work of this kind and the agreement was soon adjusted between the parties emboldened by this connexion johnson thought of a better habitation than he had hitherto known he had lodged with his wife in courts and alleys about the strand but now for the purpose of carrying on his arduous undertaking and to be nearer his printer and friend mr strahan he ventured to take a house in gough square fleet street he was told that the earl of chesterfield was a friend to his undertaking and in consequence of that intelligence he published in the plan of a dictionary of the english language addressed to the right honourable philip dormer earl of chesterfield one of his majestys principal secretaries of state mr whitehead afterwards poet laureate undertook to convey the manuscript to his lordship the consequence was an invitation from lord chesterfield to the author a stronger contrast of characters could not be brought together the nobleman celebrated for his wit and all the graces of polite behaviour the author conscious of his own merit towering in idea above all competition versed in scholastic logic but a stranger to the arts of polite conversation uncouth vehement and vociferous the coalition was too unnatural johnson expected a maecenas and was disappointed no patronage no assistance followed visits were repeated but the reception was not cordial johnson one day was left a full hour waiting in an antichamber till a gentleman should retire and leave his lordship at leisure this was the famous colley cibber johnson saw him go and fired with indignation rushed out of the housel what lord chesterfield thought of his visitor may be seen in a passage in one of that noblemans letters to his sonm there is a man whose moral character deep learning and superior parts i acknowledge admire and respect but whom it is so impossible for me to love that i am almost in a fever whenever i am in his company his figure without being deformed seems made to disgrace or ridicule the common structure of the human body his legs and arms are never in the position which according to the situation of his body they ought to be in but constantly employed in committing acts of hostility upon the graces he throws any where but down his throat whatever he means to drink and mangles what he means to carve inattentive to all the regards of social life he mistimes and misplaces every thing he disputes with heat indiscriminately mindless of the rank character and situation of those with whom he disputes absolutely ignorant of the several gradations of familiarity and respect he is exactly the same to his superiors his equals and his inferiors and therefore by a necessary consequence is absurd to two of the three is it possible to love such a man no the utmost i can do for him is to consider him a respectable hottentot such was the idea entertained by lord chesterfield after the incident of colley cibber johnson never repeated his visits in his high and decisive tone he has been often heard to say lord chesterfield is a wit among lords and a lord among wits in the course of the year garrick in conjunction with lacy became patentee of drury lane playhouse for the opening of the theatre at the usual time johnson wrote for his friend the wellknown prologue which to say no more of it may at least be placed on a level with popes to the tragedy of cato the playhouse being now under garricks direction johnson thought the opportunity fair to think of his tragedy of irene which was his whole stock on his first arrival in town in the year that play was accordingly put into rehearsal in january as a precursor to prepare the way and to awaken the public attention the vanity of human wishes a poem in imitation of the tenth satire of juvenal by the author of london was published in the same month in the gentlemans magazine for february we find that the tragedy of irene was acted at drury lane on monday february the th and from that time without interruption to monday february the th being in all thirteen nights since that time it has not been exhibited on any stage irene may be added to some other plays in our language which have lost their place in the theatre but continue to please in the closet during the representation of this piece johnson attended every night behind the scenes conceiving that his character as an author required some ornament for his person he chose upon that occasion to decorate himself with a handsome waistcoat and a goldlaced hat the late mr topham beauclerc who had a great deal of that humour which pleases the more for seeming undesigned used to give a pleasant description of this greenroom finery as related by the author himself but said johnson with great gravity i soon laid aside my goldlaced hat lest it should make me proud the amount of the three benefit nights for the tragedy of irene it is to be feared was not very considerable as the profit that stimulating motive never invited the author to another dramatic attempt some years afterwards when the present writer was intimate with garrick and knew johnson to be in distress he asked the manager why he did not produce another tragedy for his lichfield friend garricks answer was remarkable when johnson writes tragedy declamation roars and passion sleeps when shakespeare wrote he dipped his pen in his own heart there may perhaps be a degree of sameness in this regular way of tracing an author from one work to another and the reader may feel the effect of a tedious monotony but in the life of johnson there are no other landmarks he was now forty years old and had mixed but little with the world he followed no profession transacted no business and was a stranger to what is called a town life we are now arrived at the brightest period he had hitherto known his name broke out upon mankind with a degree of lustre that promised a triumph over all his difficulties the life of savage was admired as a beautiful and instructive piece of biography the two imitations of juvenal were thought to rival even the excellence of pope and the tragedy of irene though uninteresting on the stage was universally admired in the closet for the propriety of the sentiments the richness of the language and the general harmony of the whole composition his fame was widely diffused and he had made his agreement with the booksellers for his english dictionary at the sum of fifteen hundred guineas a part of which was to be from time to time advanced in proportion to the progress of the work this was a certain fund for his support without being obliged to write fugitive pieces for the petty supplies of the day accordingly we find that in he established a club consisting of ten in number at horsemans in ivy lane on every tuesday evening this is the first scene of social life to which johnson can be traced out of his own house the members of this little society were samuel johnson dr salter father of the late master of the charter house dr hawkesworth mr ryland a merchant mr payne a bookseller in paternoster row mr samuel dyer a learned young man dr william mghie a scotch physician dr edmund barker a young physician dr bathurst another young physician and sir john hawkins this list is given by sir john as it should seem with no other view than to draw a spiteful and malevolent character of almost every one of them mr dyer whom sir john says he loved with the affection of a brother meets with the harshest treatment because it was his maxim that to live in peace with mankind and in a temper to do good offices was the most essential part of our duty that notion of moral goodness gave umbrage to sir john hawkins and drew down upon the memory of his friend the bitterest imputations mr dyer however was admired and loved through life he was a man of literature johnson loved to enter with him into a discussion of metaphysical moral and critical subjects in those conflicts exercising his talents and according to his custom always contending for victory dr bathurst was the person on whom johnson fixed his affection he hardly ever spoke of him without tears in his eyes it was from him who was a native of jamaica that johnson received into his service frankn the black servant whom on account of his master he valued to the end of his life at the time of instituting the club in ivy lane johnson had projected the rambler the title was most probably suggested by the wanderer a poem which he mentions with the warmest praise in the life of savage with the same spirit of independence with which he wished to live it was now his pride to write he communicated his plan to none of his friends he desired no assistance relying entirely on his own fund and the protection of the divine being which he implored in a solemn form of prayer composed by himself for the occasion having formed a resolution to undertake a work that might be of use and honour to his country he thought with milton that this was not to be obtained but by devout prayer to that eternal spirit that can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and send out his seraphim with the hallowed fire of his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases having invoked the special protection of heaven and by that act of piety fortified his mind he began the great work of the rambler the first number was published on tuesday march the th and from that time was continued regularly every tuesday and saturday for the space of two years when it finally closed on saturday march as it began with motives of piety so it appears that the same religious spirit glowed with unabating ardour to the last his conclusion is the essays professedly serious if i have been able to execute my own intentions will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of christianity without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity of the present age i therefore look back on this part of my work with pleasure which no man shall diminish or augment i shall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause if i can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue and confidence to truth the whole number of essays amounted to two hundred and eight addisons in the spectator are more in number but not half in point of quantity addison was not bound to publish on stated days he could watch the ebb and flow of his genius and send his paper to the press when his own taste was satisfied johnsons case was very different he wrote singly and alone in the whole progress of the work he did not receive more than ten essays this was a scanty contribution for the rest the author has described his situation he that condemns himself to compose on a stated day will often bring to his task an attention dissipated a memory embarrassed an imagination overwhelmed a mind distracted with anxieties a body languishing with disease he will labour on a barren topick till it is too late to change it or in the ardour of invention diffuse his thoughts into wild exuberance which the pressing hour of publication cannot suffer judgment to examine or reduce of this excellent production the number sold on each day did not amount to five hundred of course the bookseller who paid the author four guineas a week did not carry on a successful trade his generosity and perseverance deserve to be commended and happily when the collection appeared in volumes were amply rewarded johnson lived to see his labours nourish in a tenth edition his posterity as an ingenious french writer has said on a similar occasion began in his lifetime in the beginning of soon after the rambler was set on foot johnson was induced by the arts of a vile impostor to lend his assistance during a temporary delusion to a fraud not to be paralleled in the annals of literatureo one lauder a native of scotland who had been a teacher in the university of edinburgh had conceived a mortal antipathy to the name and character of milton his reason was because the prayer of pamela in sir philip sidneys arcadia was as he supposed maliciously inserted by the great poet in an edition of the eikn basilike in order to fix an imputation of impiety on the memory of the murdered king fired with resentment and willing to reap the profits of a gross imposition this man collected from several latin poets such as masenius the jesuit staphorstius a dutch divine beza and others all such passages as bore any kind of resemblance to different places in the paradise lost and these he published from time to time in the gentlemans magazine with occasional interpolations of lines which he himself translated from milton the public credulity swallowed all with eagerness and milton was supposed to be guilty of plagiarism from inferior modern writers the fraud succeeded so well that lauder collected the whole into a volume and advertised it under the title of an essay on miltons use and imitation of the moderns in his paradise lost dedicated to the universities of oxford and cambridge while the book was in the press the proofsheets were shown to johnson at the ivy lane club by payne the bookseller who was one of the members no man in that society was in possession of the authors from whom lauder professed to make his extracts the charge was believed and the contriver of it found his way to johnson who is represented by sir john hawkins not indeed as an accomplice in the fraud but through motives of malignity to milton delighting in the detection and exulting that the poets reputation would suffer by the discovery more malice to a deceased friend cannot well be imagined hawkins adds that he wished well to the argument must be inferred from the preface which indubitably was written by him the preface it is well known was written by johnson and for that reason is inserted in this edition but if johnson approved of the argument it was no longer than while he believed it founded in truth let us advert to his own words in that very preface among the inquiries to which the ardour of criticism has naturally given occasion none is more obscure in itself or more worthy of rational curiosity than a retrospection of the progress of this mighty genius in the construction of his work a view of the fabrick gradually rising perhaps from small beginnings till its foundation rests in the centre and its turrets sparkle in the skies to trace back the structure through all its varieties to the simplicity of the first plan to find what was projected whence the scheme was taken how it was improved by what assistance it was executed and from what stores the materials were collected whether its founder dug them from the quarries of nature or demolished other buildings to embellish his own these were the motives that induced johnson to assist lauder with a preface and are not these the motives of a critic and a scholar what reader of taste what man of real knowledge would not think his time well employed in an enquiry so curious so interesting and instructive if lauders facts were really true who would not be glad without the smallest tincture of malevolence to receive real information it is painful to be thus obliged to vindicate a man who in his heart towered above the petty arts of fraud and imposition against an injudicious biographer who undertook to be his editor and the protector of his memory another writer dr towers in an essay on the life and character of dr johnson seems to countenance this calumny he says it can hardly be doubted but that johnsons aversion to miltons politics was the cause of that alacrity with which he joined with lauder in his infamous attack on our great epic poet and which induced him to assist in that transaction these words would seem to describe an accomplice were they not immediately followed by an express declaration that johnson was unacquainted with the imposture dr towers adds it seems to have been by way of making some compensation to the memory of milton for the share he had in the attack of lauder that johnson wrote the prologue spoken by garrick at drury lane theatre on the performance of the masque of comus for the benefit of miltons granddaughter dr towers is not free from prejudice but as shakespeare has it he begets a temperance to give it smoothness he is therefore entitled to a dispassionate answer when johnson wrote the prologue it does appear that he was aware of the malignant artifices practised by lauder in the postscript to johnsons preface a subscription is proposed for relieving the granddaughter of the author of paradise lost dr towers will agree that this shows johnsons alacrity in doing good that alacrity showed itself again in the letter printed in the european magazine january and there said to have appeared originally in the general advertiser th april by which the public were invited to embrace the opportunity of paying a just regard to the illustrious dead united with the pleasure of doing good to the living the letter adds to assist industrious indigence struggling with distress and debilitated by age is a display of virtue and an acquisition of happiness and honour whoever therefore would be thought capable of pleasure in reading the works of our incomparable milton and not so destitute of gratitude as to refuse to lay out a trifle in a rational and elegant entertainment for the benefit of his living remains for the exercise of their own virtue the increase of their reputation and the consciousness of doing good should appear at drury lane theatre tomorrow april when comus will be performed for the benefit of mrs elizabeth foster granddaughter to the author and the only surviving branch of his family nota bene there will be a new prologue on the occasion written by the author of irene and spoken by mr garrick the man who had thus exerted himself to serve the granddaughter cannot be supposed to have entertained personal malice to the grandfather it is true that the malevolence of lauder as well as the impostures of archibald bower were fully detected by the labours in the cause of truth of the reverend dr douglas the late lord bishop of salisbury diram qui contudit hydram notaque fatali portenta labore subegit but the pamphlet entitled milton vindicated from the charge of plagiarism brought against him by mr lauder and lauder himself convicted of several forgeries and gross impositions on the public by john douglas ma rector of eaton constantine salop was not published till the year in that work p dr douglas says it is to be hoped nay it is expected that the elegant and nervous writer whose judicious sentiments and inimitable style point out the author of lauders preface and postcript will no longer allow a man to plume himself with his feathers who appears so little to have deserved his assistance an assistance which i am persuaded would never have been communicated had there been the least suspicion of those facts which i have been the instrument of conveying to the world we have here a contemporary testimony to the integrity of dr johnson throughout the whole of that vile transaction what was the consequence of the requisition made by dr douglas johnson whose ruling passion may be said to be the love of truth convinced lauder that it would be more for his interest to make a full confession of his guilt than to stand forth the convicted champion of a lie and for this purpose he drew up in the strongest terms a recantation in a letter to the reverend mr douglas which lauder signed and published in the year that piece will remain a lasting memorial of the abhorrence with which johnson beheld a violation of truth mr nichols whose attachment to his illustrious friend was unwearied showed him in a book called remarks on johnsons life of milton in which the affair of lauder was renewed with virulence and a poetical scale in the literary magazine when johnson had ceased to write in that collection was urged as an additional proof of deliberate malice he read the libellous passage with attention and instantly wrote on the margin in the business of lauder i was deceived partly by thinking the man too frantick to be fraudulent of the poetical scale quoted from the magazine i am not the author i fancy it was put in after i had quitted that work for i not only did not write it but i do not remember it as a critic and a scholar johnson was willing to receive what numbers at the time believed to be true information when he found that the whole was a forgery he renounced all connexion with the author in march he felt a severe stroke of affliction in the death of his wife the last number of the rambler as already mentioned was on the th of that month the loss of mrs johnson was then approaching and probably was the cause that put an end to those admirable periodical essays it appears that she died on the th of march in a memorandum at the foot of the prayers and meditations that is called her dying day she was buried at bromley under the care of dr hawkesworth johnson placed a latin inscription on her tomb in which he celebrated her beauty with the singularity of his prayers for his deceased wife from that time to the end of his days the world is sufficiently acquainted on easter day nd april his memorandum says thought on tetty poor dear tetty with my eyes full went to church after sermon i recommended tetty in a prayer by herself and my father mother brother and bathurst in another i did it only once so far as it might be lawful for me in a prayer january the day on which his mother was buried he commends as far as may be lawful her soul to god imploring for her whatever is most beneficial to her in her present state in this habit he persevered to the end of his days the reverend mr strahan the editor of the prayers and meditations observes that johnson on some occasions prays that the almighty may have had mercy on his wife and mr thrale evidently supposing their sentence to have been already passed in the divine mind and by consequence proving that he had no belief in a state of purgatory and no reason for praying for the dead that could impeach the sincerity of his profession as a protestant mr strahan adds that in praying for the regretted tenants of the grave johnson conformed to a practice which has been retained by many learned members of the established church though the liturgy no longer admits it if where the tree falleth there it shall be if our state at the close of life is to be the measure of our final sentence then prayers for the dead being visibly fruitless can be regarded only as the vain oblations of superstition but of all superstitions this perhaps is one of the least unamiable and most incident to a good mind if our sensations of kindness be intense those whom we have revered and loved death cannot wholly seclude from our concern it is true for the reason just mentioned such evidences of our surviving affection may be thought ill judged but surely they are generous and some natural tenderness is due even to a superstition which thus originates in piety and benevolence these sentences extracted from the reverend mr strahans preface if they are not a full justification are at least a beautiful apology it will not be improper to add what johnson himself has said on the subject being asked by mr boswellp what he thought of purgatory as believed by the roman catholicks his answer was it is a very harmless doctrine they are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society of blessed spirits and therefore that god is graciously pleased to allow a middle state where they may be purified by certain degrees of suffering you see there is nothing unreasonable in this and if it be once established that there are souls in purgatory it is as proper to pray for them as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life this was dr johnsons guess into futurity and to guess is the utmost that man can do shadows clouds and darkness rest upon it mrs johnson left a daughter lucy porter by her first husband she had contracted a friendship with mrs anne williams the daughter of zachary williams a physician of eminence in south wales who had devoted more than thirty years of a long life to the study of the longitude and was thought to have made great advances towards that important discovery his letters to lord halifax and the lords of the admiralty partly corrected and partly written by dr johnson are still extant in the hands of mr nicholsq we there find dr williams in the eightythird year of his age stating that he had prepared an instrument which might be called an epitome or miniature of the terraqueous globe showing with the assistance of tables constructed by himself the variations of the magnetic needle and ascertaining the longitude for the safety of navigation it appears that this scheme had been referred to sir isaac newton but that great philosopher excusing himself on account of his advanced age all applications were useless till when the subject was referred by order of lord anson to dr bradley the celebrated professor of astronomy his report was unfavourabler though it allows that a considerable progress had been made dr williams after all his labour and expense died in a short time after a melancholy instance of unrewarded merit his daughter possessed uncommon talents and though blind had an alacrity of mind that made her conversation agreeable and even desirable to relieve and appease melancholy reflexions johnson took her home to his house in gough square in garrick gave her a benefit play which produced two hundred pounds in she published by subscription a quarto volume of miscellanies and increased her little stock to three hundred pounds that fund with johnsons protection supported her through the remainder of her life during the two years in which the rambler was carried on the dictionary proceeded by slow degrees in may having composed a prayer preparatory to his return from tears and sorrow to the duties of life he resumed his grand design and went on with vigour giving however occasional assistance to his friend dr hawkesworth in the adventurer which began soon after the rambler was laid aside some of the most valuable essays in that collection were from the pen of johnson the dictionary was completed towards the end of and cave being then no more it was a mortification to the author of that noble addition to our language that his old friend did not live to see the triumph of his labours in may that great work was published johnson was desirous that it should come from one who had obtained academical honours and for that purpose his friend the rev thos warton obtained for him in the preceding month of february a diploma for a masters degree from the university of oxford garrick on the publication of the dictionary wrote the following lines talk of war with a briton hell boldly advance that one english soldier can beat ten of france would we alter the boast from the sword to the pen our odds are still greater still greater our men in the deep mines of science though frenchmen may toil can their strength be compard to locke newton or boyle let them rally their heroes send forth all their powers their versemen and prosemen then match them with ours first shakespeare and milton like gods in the fight have put their whole drama and epic to flight in satires epistles and odes would they cope their numbers retreat before dryden and pope and johnson well armd like a hero of yore has beat forty french and will beat forty more it is perhaps needless to mention that forty was the number of the french academy at the time when their dictionary was published to settle their language in the course of the winter preceding this grand publication the late earl of chesterfield gave two essays in the periodical paper called the world dated november and december to prepare the public for so important a work the original plan addressed to his lordship in the year is there mentioned in terms of the highest praise and this was understood at the time to be a courtly way of soliciting a dedication of the dictionary to himself johnson treated this civility with disdain he said to garrick and others i have sailed a long and painful voyage round the world of the english language and does he now send out two cockboats to tow me into harbour he had said in the last number of the rambler that having laboured to maintain the dignity of virtue i will not now degrade it by the meanness of dedication such a man when he had finished his dictionary not as he says himself in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academick bowers but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow and without the patronage of the great was not likely to be caught by the lure thrown out by lord chesterfield he had in vain sought the patronage of that nobleman and his pride exasperated by disappointment drew from him the following letter dated in the month of february to the right honourable the earl of chesterfield my lord i have been lately informed by the proprietors of the world that two papers in which my dictionary is recommended to the publick were written by your lordship to be so distinguished is an honour which being very little accustomed to favours from the great i know not well how to receive or in what terms to acknowledge when upon some slight encouragement i first visited your lordship i was overpowered like the rest of mankind by the enchantment of your address and could not forbear to wish that i might boast myself le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre that i might obtain that regard for which i saw the world contending but i found my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it when i had once addressed your lordship in publick i had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can possess i had done all that i could and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected be it ever so little seven years my lord have now passed since i waited in your outward room or was repulsed from your door during which time i have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain and have brought it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance one word of encouragement or one smile of favour such treatment i did not expect for i never had a patron before the shepherd in virgil grew acquainted with love and found him a native of the rocks is not a patron my lord one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help the notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours had it been early had been kind but it has been delayed till i am indifferent and cannot enjoy it till i am solitary and cannot impart it till i am known and do not want it i hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit has been received or to be unwilling that the publick should consider me as owing that to a patron which providence has enabled me to do for myself having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learning i shall not be disappointed though i should conclude it if less be possible with less for i have been long wakened from that dream of hope in which i once boasted myself with so much exultation my lord your lordships most humble and most obedient servant samuel johnson it is said upon good authority that johnson once received from lord chesterfield the sum of ten pounds it were to be wished that the secret had never transpired it was mean to receive it and meaner to give it it may be imagined that for johnsons ferocity as it has been called there was some foundation in his finances and as his dictionary was brought to a conclusion that money was now to flow in upon him the reverse was the case for his subsistence during the progress of the work he had received at different times the amount of his contract and when his receipts were produced to him at a tavern dinner given by the booksellers it appeared that he had been paid a hundred pounds and upwards more than his due the author of a book called lexiphaness written by a mr campbell a scotchman and purser of a man of war endeavoured to blast his laurels but in vain the world applauded and johnson never replied abuse he said is often of service there is nothing so dangerous to an author as silence his name like a shittlecock transcribers note sic must be beat backward and forward or it falls to the ground lexiphanes professed to be an imitation of the pleasant manner of lucian but humour was not the talent of the writer of lexiphanes as dryden says he had too much horseplay in his raillery it was in the summer that the present writer became acquainted with dr johnson the cause of his first visit is related by mrs piozzi nearly in the following manner mr murphy being engaged in a periodical paper the grays inn journal was at a friends house in the country and not being disposed to lose pleasure for business wished to content his bookseller by some unstudied essay he therefore took up a french journal littraire and translating something he liked sent it away to town time however discovered that he translated from the french a rambler which had been taken from the english without acknowledgment upon this discovery mr murphy thought it right to make his excuses to dr johnson he went next day and found him covered with soot like a chimneysweeper in a little room as if he had been acting lungs in the alchemist making ether this being told by mr murphy in company come come said dr johnson the story is black enough but it was a happy day that brought you first to my house after this first visit the author of this narrative by degrees grew intimate with dr johnson the first striking sentence that he heard from him was in a few days after the publication of lord bolingbrokes posthumous works mr garrick asked him if he had seen them yes i have seen them what do you think of them think of them he made a long pause and then replied think of them a scoundrel and a coward a scoundrel who spent his life in charging a gun against christianity and a coward who was afraid of hearing the report of his own gun but left half a crown to a hungry scotchman to draw the trigger after his death his mind at this time strained and overlaboured by constant exertion called for an interval of repose and indolence but indolence was the time of danger it was then that his spirits not employed abroad turned with inward hostility against himself his reflections on his own life and conduct were always severe and wishing to be immaculate he destroyed his own peace by unnecessary scruples he tells us that when he surveyed his past life he discovered nothing but a barren waste of time with some disorders of body and disturbances of mind very near to madness his life he says from his earliest years was wasted in a morning bed and his reigning sin was a general sluggishness to which he was always inclined and in part of his life almost compelled by morbid melancholy and weariness of mind this was his constitutional malady derived perhaps from his father who was at times overcast with a gloom that bordered on insanity when to this it is added that johnson about the age of twenty drew up a description of his infirmities for dr swinfen at that time an eminent physician in staffordshire and received an answer to his letter importing that the symptoms indicated a future privation of reason who can wonder that he was troubled with melancholy and dejection of spirit an apprehension of the worst calamity that can befall human nature hung over him all the rest of his life like the sword of the tyrant suspended over his guest in his sixtieth year he had a mind to write the history of his melancholy but he desisted not knowing whether it would not too much disturb him in a latin poem however to which he has prefixed as a title greek gnothi seauton he has left a picture of himself drawn with as much truth and as firm a hand as can be seen in the portraits of hogarth or sir joshua reynolds the learned reader will find the original poem in this volume and it is hoped that a translation or rather imitation of so curious a piece will not be improper in this place know yourself after revising

must i in slow decline to mute inglorious ease old age resign or bold ambition kindling in my breast attempt some arduous task or were it best brooding oer lexicons to pass the day and in that labour drudge my life away such is the picture for which dr johnson sat to himself he gives the prominent features of his character his lassitude his morbid melancholy his love of fame his dejection his tavernparties and his wandering reveries vacuae mala somnia mentis about which so much has been written all are painted in miniature but in vivid colours by his own hand his idea of writing more dictionaries was not merely said in verse mr hamilton who was at that time an eminent printer and well acquainted with dr johnson remembers that he engaged in a commercial dictionary and as appears by the receipts in his possession was paid his price for several sheets but he soon relinquished the undertaking it is probable that he found himself not sufficiently versed in that branch of knowledge he was again reduced to the expedient of short compositions for the supply of the day the writer of this narrative has now before him a letter in dr johnsons handwriting which shows the distress and melancholy situation of the man who had written the rambler and finished the great work of his dictionary the letter is directed to mr richardson the author of clarissa and is as follows sir i am obliged to entreat your assistance i am now under an arrest for five pounds eighteen shillings mr strahan from whom i should have received the necessary help in this case is not at home and i am afraid of not finding mr millar if you will be so good as to send me this sum i will very gratefully repay you and add it to all former obligations i am sir your most obedient and most humble servant samuel johnson gough square march in the margin of this letter there is a memorandum in these words march sent six guineas witness wm richardson for the honour of an admired writer it is to be regretted that we do not find a more liberal entry to his friend in distress he sent eight shillings more than was wanted had an incident of this kind occurred in one of his romances richardson would have known how to grace his hero but in fictitious scenes generosity costs the writer nothing about this time johnson contributed several papers to a periodical miscellany called the visiter from motives which are highly honourable to him a compassionate regard for the late mr christopher smart the criticism on popes epitaphs appeared in that work in a short time after he became a reviewer in the literary magazine under the auspices of the late mr newbery a man of a projecting head good taste and great industry this employment engrossed but little of johnsons time he resigned himself to indolence took no exercise rose about two and then received the visits of his friends authors long since forgotten waited on him as their oracle and he gave responses in the chair of criticism he listened to the complaints the schemes and the hopes and fears of a crowd of inferior writers who he said in the words of roger ascham lived men knew not how and died obscure men marked not when he believed that he could give a better history of grub street than any man living his house was filled with a succession of visitors till four or five in the evening during the whole time he presided at his teatable tea was his favourite beverage and when the late jonas hanway pronounced his anathema against the use of tea johnson rose in defence of his habitual practice declaring himself in that article a hardened sinner who had for years diluted his meals with the infusion of that fascinating plant whose teakettle had no time to cool who with tea solaced the midnight hour and with tea welcomed the morning the proposal for a new edition of shakespeare which had formerly miscarried was resumed in the year the booksellers readily agreed to his terms and subscriptiontickets were issued out for undertaking this work money he confessed was the inciting motive his friends exerted themselves to promote his interest and in the mean time he engaged in a new periodical production called the idler the first number appeared on saturday april and the last april the profits of this work and the subscriptions for the new edition of shakespeare were the means by which he supported himself for four or five years in was published rasselas prince of abissinia his translation of lobos voyage to abissinia seems to have pointed out that country for the scene of action and rassela christos the general of sultan sequed mentioned in that work most probably suggested the name of the prince the author wanted to set out on a journey to lichfield in order to pay the last offices of filial piety to his mother who at the age of ninety was then near her dissolution but money was necessary mr johnston a bookseller who has long since left off business gave one hundred pounds for the copy with this supply johnson set out for lichfield but did not arrive in time to close the eyes of a parent whom he loved he attended the funeral which as appears among his memorandums was on the rd of january johnson now found it necessary to retrench his expenses he gave up his house in gough square mrs williams went into lodgings he retired to grays inn and soon removed to chambers in the inner temple lane where he lived in poverty total idleness and the pride of literature magni stat nominis umbra mr fitzherbert the father of lord st helens the present minister at madrid a man distinguished through life for his benevolence and other amiable qualities used to say that he paid a morning visit to johnson intending from his chambers to send a letter into the city but to his great surprise he found an author by profession without pen ink or paper the present bishop of salisbury was also among those who endeavoured by constant attention to sooth the cares of a mind which he knew to be afflicted with gloomy apprehensions at one of the parties made at his house boscovich the jesuit who had then lately introduced the newtonian philosophy at rome and after publishing an elegant latin poem on the subject was made a fellow of the royal society was one of the company invited to meet dr johnson the conversation at first was mostly in french johnson though thoroughly versed in that language and a professed admirer of boileau and la bruyre did not understand its pronunciation nor could he speak it himself with propriety for the rest of the evening the talk was in latin boscovich had a ready current flow of that flimsy phraseology with which a priest may travel through italy spain and germany johnson scorned what he called colloquial barbarisms it was his pride to speak his best he went on after a little practice with as much facility as if it was his native tongue one sentence this writer well remembers observing that fontenelle at first opposed the newtonian philosophy and embraced it afterwards his words were fontinellus ni fallor in extrema senectute fuit transfuga ad castra newtoniana we have now travelled through that part of dr johnsons life which was a perpetual struggle with difficulties halcyon days are now to open upon him in the month of may his majesty to reward literary merit signified his pleasure to grant to johnson a pension of three hundred pounds a year the earl of bute was minister lord loughborough who perhaps was originally a mover in the business had authority to mention it he was well acquainted with johnson but having heard much of his independent spirit and of the downfal of osborne the bookseller he did not know but his benevolence might be rewarded with a folio on his head he desired the author of these memoirs to undertake the task this writer thought the opportunity of doing so much good the most happy incident in his life he went without delay to the chambers in the inner temple lane which in fact were the abode of wretchedness by slow and studied approaches the message was disclosed johnson made a long pause he asked if it was seriously intended he fell into a profound meditation and his own definition of a pensioner occurred to him he was told that he at least did not come within the definition he desired to meet next day and dine at the mitre tavern at that meeting he gave up all his scruples on the following day lord loughborough conducted him to the earl of bute the conversation that passed was in the evening related to this writer by dr johnson he expressed his sense of his majestys bounty and thought himself the more highly honoured as the favour was not bestowed on him for having dipped his pen in faction no sir said lord bute it is not offered to you for having dipped your pen in faction nor with a design that you ever should sir john hawkins will have it that after this interview johnson was often pressed to wait on lord bute but with a sullen spirit refused to comply however that be johnson was never heard to utter a disrespectful word of that nobleman the writer of this essay remembers a circumstance which may throw some light on this subject the late dr rose of chiswick whom johnson loved and respected contended for the preeminence of the scotch writers and fergusons book on civil society then on the eve of publication he said would give the laurel to north britain alas what can he do upon that subject said johnson aristotle polybius grotius puffendorf and burlemaqui have reaped in that field before him he will treat it said dr rose in a new manner a new manner buckinger had no hands and he wrote his name with his toes at charing cross for half a crown a piece that was a new manner of writing dr rose replied if that will not satisfy you i will name a writer whom you must allow to be the best in the kingdom who is that the earl of bute when he wrote an order for your pension there sir said johnson you have me in the toil to lord bute i must allow whatever praise you claim for him ingratitude was no part of johnsons character being now in the possession of a regular income johnson left his chambers in the temple and once more became master of a house in johnsons court fleet street dr levet his friend and physician in ordinaryu paid his daily visits with assiduity made tea all the morning talked what he had to say and did not expect an answer mrs williams had her apartment in the house and entertained her benefactor with more enlarged conversation chymistry was a part of johnsons amusement for this love of experimental philosophy sir john hawkins thinks an apology necessary he tells us with great gravity that curiosity was the only object in view not an intention to grow suddenly rich by the philosophers stone or the transmutation of metals to enlarge this circle johnson once more had recourse to a literary club this was at the turks head in gerard street soho on every tuesday evening through the year the members were besides himself the right honourable edmund burke sir joshua reynolds dr nugent dr goldsmith the late mr topham beauclerc mr langton mr chamier sir j hawkins and some others johnsons affection for sir joshua was founded on a long acquaintance and a thorough knowledge of the virtuous and amiable qualities of that excellent artist he delighted in the conversation of mr burke he met him for the first time at mr garricks several years ago on the next day he said i suppose murphy you are proud of your countryman cum talis sit utinam noster esset from that time his constant observation was that a man of sense could not meet mr burke by accident under a gateway to avoid a shower without being convinced that he was the first man in england johnson felt not only kindness but zeal and ardour for his friends he did every thing in his power to advance the reputation of dr goldsmith he loved him though he knew his failings and particularly the leaven of envy which corroded the mind of that elegant writer and made him impatient without disguise of the praises bestowed on any person whatever of this infirmity which marked goldsmiths character johnson gave a remarkable instance it happened that he went with sir joshua reynolds and goldsmith to see the fantoccini which were exhibited some years ago in or near the haymarket they admired the curious mechanism by which the puppets were made to walk the stage draw a chair to the table sit down write a letter and perform a variety of other actions with such dexterity that though natures journeymen made the men they imitated humanity to the astonishment of the spectator the entertainment being over the three friends retired to a tavern johnson and sir joshua talked with pleasure of what they had seen and says johnson in a tone of admiration how the little fellow brandished his spontoon there is nothing in it replied goldsmith starting up with impatience give me a spontoon i can do it as well myself enjoying his amusements at his weekly club and happy in a state of independence johnson gained in the year another resource which contributed more than any thing else to exempt him from the solicitudes of life he was introduced to the late mr thrale and his family mrs piozzi has related the fact and it is therefore needless to repeat it in this place the author of this narrative looks back to the share he had in that business with selfcongratulation since he knows the tenderness which from that time soothed johnsons cares at streatham and prolonged a valuable life the subscribers to shakespeare began to despair of ever seeing the promised edition to acquit himself of this obligation he went to work unwillingly but proceeded with vigour in the month of october shakespeare was published and in a short time after the university of dublin sent over a diploma in honourable terms creating him a doctor of laws oxford in eight or ten years afterwards followed the example and till then johnson never assumed the title of doctor in his constitution seemed to be in a rapid decline and that morbid melancholy which often clouded his understanding came upon him with a deeper gloom than ever mr and mrs thrale paid him a visit in this situation and found him on his knees with dr delap the rector of lewes in sussex beseeching god to continue to him the use of his understanding mr thrale took him to his house at streatham and johnson from that time became a constant resident in the family he went occasionally to the club in gerard street but his headquarters were fixed at streatham an apartment was fitted up for him and the library was greatly enlarged parties were constantly invited from town and johnson was every day at an elegant table with select and polished company whatever could be devised by mr and mrs thrale to promote the happiness and establish the health of their guest was studiously performed from that time to the end of mr thrales life johnson accompanied the family in all their summer excursions to brighthelmstone to wales and to paris it is but justice to mr thrale to say that a more ingenuous frame of mind no man possessed his education at oxford gave him the habits of a gentleman his amiable temper recommended his conversation and the goodness of his heart made him a sincere friend that he was the patron of johnson is an honour to his memory in petty disputes with contemporary writers or the wits of the age johnson was seldom entangled a single incident of that kind may not be unworthy of notice since it happened with a man of great celebrity in his time a number of friends dined with garrick on a christmas day foote was then in ireland it was said at table that the modern aristophanes so foote was called had been horsewhipped by a dublin apothecary for mimicking him on the stage i wonder said garrick that any man should show so much resentment to foote he has a patent for such liberties nobody ever thought it worth his while to quarrel with him in london i am glad said johnson to find that the man is rising in the world the expression was afterwards repeated to foote who in return gave out that he would produce the caliban of literature on the stage being informed of this design johnson sent word to foote that the theatre being intended for the reformation of vice he would step from the boxes on the stage and correct him before the audience foote knew the intrepidity of his antagonist and abandoned the design no ill will ensued johnson used to say that for broadfaced mirth foote had not his equal dr johnsons fame excited the curiosity of the king his majesty expressed a desire to see a man of whom extraordinary things were said accordingly the librarian at buckingham house invited johnson to see that elegant collection of books at the same time giving a hint of what was intended his majesty entered the room and among other things asked the author if he meant to give the world any more of his compositions johnson answered that he thought he had written enough and i should think so too replied his majesty if you had not written so well though johnson thought he had written enough his genius even in spite of bodily sluggishness could not lie still in we find him entering the lists as a political writer the flame of discord that blazed throughout the nation on the expulsion of mr wilkes and the final determination of the house of commons that mr luttrell was duly elected by two hundred and six votes against eleven hundred and fortythree spread a general spirit of discontent to allay the tumult dr johnson published the false alarm mrs piozzi informs us that this pamphlet was written at her house between eight oclock on wednesday night and twelve on thursday night this celerity has appeared wonderful to many and some have doubted the truth it may however be placed within the bounds of probability johnson has observed that there are different methods of composition virgil was used to pour out a great number of verses in the morning and pass the day in retrenching the exuberances and correcting inaccuracies and it was popes custom to write his first thoughts in his first words and gradually to amplify decorate rectify and refine them others employ at once memory and invention and with little intermediate use of the pen form and polish large masses by continued meditation and write their productions only when in their opinion they have completed them this last was johnsons method he never took his pen in hand till he had well weighed his subject and grasped in his mind the sentiments the train of argument and the arrangement of the whole as he often thought aloud he had perhaps talked it over to himself this may account for that rapidity with which in general he despatched his sheets to the press without being at the trouble of a fair copy whatever may be the logic or eloquence of the false alarm the house of commons have since erased the resolution from the journals but whether they have not left materials for a future controversy may be made a question in he published another tract on the subject of falkland islands the design was to show the impropriety of going to war with spain for an island thrown aside from human use stormy in winter and barren in summer for this work it is apparent that materials were furnished by direction of the minister at the approach of the general election in he wrote a short discourse called the patriot not with any visible application to mr wilkes but to teach the people to reject the leaders of opposition who called themselves patriots in he undertook a pamphlet of more importance namely taxation no tyranny in answer to the resolutions and address of the american congress the scope of the argument was that distant colonies which had in their assemblies a legislature of their own were notwithstanding liable to be taxed in a british parliament where they had neither peers in one house nor representatives in the other he was of opinion that this country was strong enough to enforce obedience when an englishman he says is told that the americans shoot up like the hydra he naturally considers how the hydra was destroyed the event has shown how much he and the minister of that day were mistaken the account of the tour to the western islands of scotland which was undertaken in the autumn of in company with mr boswell was not published till some time in the year this book has been variously received by some extolled for the elegance of the narrative and the depth of observation on life and manners by others as much condemned as a work of avowed hostility to the scotch nation the praise was beyond all question fairly deserved and the censure on due examination will appear hasty and ill founded that johnson entertained some prejudices against the scotch must not be dissembled it is true as mr boswell says that he thought their success in england exceeded their proportion of real merit and he could not but see in them that nationality which no liberalminded scotsman will deny the author of these memoirs well remembers that johnson one day asked him have you observed the difference between your own country impudence and scotch impudence the answer being in the negative then i will tell you said johnson the impudence of an irishman is the impudence of a fly that buzzes about you and you put it away but it returns again and flutters and teases you the impudence of a scotsman is the impudence of a leech that fixes and sucks your blood upon another occasion this writer went with him into the shop of davies the bookseller in russell street covent garden davies came running to him almost out of breath with joy the scots gentleman is come sir his principal wish is to see you he is now in the back parlour well well ill see the gentleman said johnson he walked towards the room mr boswell was the person this writer followed with no small curiosity i find said mr boswell that i am come to london at a bad time when great popular prejudice has gone forth against us north britons but when i am talking to you i am talking to a large and liberal mind and you know that i cannot help coming from scotland sir said johnson no more can the rest of your countrymenx he had other reasons that helped to alienate him from the natives of scotland being a cordial wellwisher to the constitution in church and state he did not think that calvin and john knox were proper founders of a national religion he made however a wide distinction between the dissenters of scotland and the separatists of england to the former he imputed no disaffection no want of loyalty their soldiers and their officers had shed their blood with zeal and courage in the service of great britain and the people he used to say were content with their own established modes of worship without wishing in the present age to give any disturbance to the church of england this he was at all times ready to admit and therefore declared that whenever he found a scotchman to whom an englishman was as a scotchman that scotchman should be as an englishman to him in this surely there was no rancour no malevolence the dissenters on this side the tweed appeared to him in a different light their religion he frequently said was too worldly too political too restless and ambitious the doctrine of cashiering kings and erecting on the ruins of the constitution a new form of government which lately issued from their pulpits he always thought was under a calm disguise the principle that lay lurking in their hearts he knew that a wild democracy had overturned kings lords and commons and that a set of republican fanatics who would not bow at the name of jesus had taken possession of all the livings and all the parishes in the kingdom that those scenes of horror might never be renewed was the ardent wish of dr johnson and though he apprehended no danger from scotland it is probable that his dislike of calvinism mingled sometimes with his reflections on the natives of that country the association of ideas could not be easily broken but it is well known that he loved and respected many gentlemen from that part of the island dr robertsons history of scotland and dr beatties essays were subjects of his constant praise mr boswell dr rose of chiswick andrew millar mr hamilton the printer and the late mr strahan were among his most intimate friends many others might be added to the list he scorned to enter scotland as a spy though hawkins his biographer and the professing defender of his fame allowed himself leave to represent him in that ignoble character he went into scotland to survey men and manners antiquities fossils and minerals were not within his province he did not visit that country to settle the station of roman camps or the spot where galgacus fought the last battle for public liberty the people their customs and the progress of literature were his objects the civilities which he received in the course of his tour have been repaid with grateful acknowledgment and generally with great elegance of expression his crime is that he found the country bare of trees and he has stated the fact this mr boswell in his tour to the hebrides has told us was resented by his countrymen with anger inflamed to rancour but he admits that there are few trees on the east side of scotland mr pennant in his tour says that in some parts of the eastern side of the country he saw several large plantations of pine planted by gentlemen near their seats and in this respect such a laudable spirit prevails that in another halfcentury it never shall be said to spy the nakedness of the land are you come johnson could not wait for that halfcentury and therefore mentioned things as he found them if in any thing he has been mistaken he has made a fair apology in the last paragraph of his book avowing with candour that he may have been surprised by modes of life and appearances of nature that are familiar to men of wider survey and more varied conversation novelty and ignorance must always be reciprocal and he is conscious that his thoughts on national manners are the thoughts of one who has seen but little the poems of ossian made a part of johnsons inquiry during his residence in scotland and the hebrides on his return to england november a storm seemed to be gathering over his head but the cloud never burst and the thunder never fell ossian it is well known was presented to the public as a translation from the erse but that this was a fraud johnson declared without hesitation the erse he says was always oral only and never a written language the welsh and the irish were more cultivated in erse there was not in the world a single manuscript a hundred years old martin who in the last century published an account of the western islands mentions irish but never erse manuscripts to be found in the islands in his time the bards could not read if they could they might probably have written but the bard was a barbarian among barbarians and knowing nothing himself lived with others that knew no more if there is a manuscript from which the translation was made in what age was it written and where is it if it was collected from oral recitation it could only be in detached parts and scattered fragments the whole is too long to be remembered who put it together in its present form for these and such like reasons johnson calls the whole an imposture he adds the editor or author never could show the original nor can it be shown by any other to revenge reasonable incredulity by refusing evidence is a degree of insolence with which the world is not yet acquainted and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt this reasoning carries with it great weight it roused the resentment of mr macpherson he sent a threatening letter to the author and johnson answered him in the rough phrase of stern defiance the two heroes frowned at a distance but never came to action in the year the misfortunes of dr dodd excited his compassion he wrote a speech for that unhappy man when called up to receive judgment of death besides two petitions one to the king and another to the queen and a sermon to be preached by dodd to the convicts in newgate it may appear trifling to add that about the same time he wrote a prologue to the comedy of a word to the wise written by hugh kelly the play some years before had been damned by a party on the first night it was revived for the benefit of the authors widow mrs piozzi relates that when johnson was rallied for these exertions so close to one another his answer was when they come to me with a dying parson and a dead staymaker what can a man do we come now to the last of his literary labours at the request of the booksellers he undertook the lives of the poets the first publication was in and the whole was completed in in a memorandum of that year he says some time in march he finished the lives of the poets which he wrote in his usual way dilatorily and hastily unwilling to work yet working with vigour and haste in another place he hopes they are written in such a manner as may tend to the promotion of piety that the history of so many men who in their different degrees made themselves conspicuous in their time was not written recently after their deaths seems to be an omission that does no honour to the republic of letters their contemporaries in general looked on with calm indifference and suffered wit and genius to vanish out of the world in total silence unregarded and unlamented was there no friend to pay the tribute of a tear no just observer of life to record the virtues of the deceased was even envy silent it seemed to have been agreed that if an authors works survived the history of the man was to give no moral lesson to afterages if tradition told us that ben jonson went to the devil tavern that shakespeare stole deer and held the stirrup at playhouse doors that dryden frequented buttons coffeehouse curiosity was lulled asleep and biography forgot the best part of her function which is to instruct mankind by examples taken from the school of life this task remained for dr johnson when years had rolled away when the channels of information were for the most part choked up and little remained besides doubtful anecdote uncertain tradition and vague report nunc situs informis premit et deserta vetustas the value of biography has been better understood in other ages and in other countries tacitus informs us that to record the lives and characters of illustrious men was the practice of the roman authors in the early periods of the republic in france the example has been followed fontenelle dalembert and monsieur thomas have left models in this kind of composition they have embalmed the dead but it is true that they had incitements and advantages even at a distant day which could not by any diligence be obtained by dr johnson the wits of france had ample materials they lived in a nation of critics who had at heart the honour done to their country by their poets their heroes and their philosophers they had besides an academy of belleslettres where genius was cultivated refined and encouraged they had the tracts the essays and dissertations which remain in the memoirs of the academy and they had the speeches of the several members delivered at their first admission to a seat in that learned assembly in those speeches the new academician did ample justice to the memory of his predecessor and though his harangue was decorated with the colours of eloquence and was for that reason called panegyric yet being pronounced before qualified judges who knew the talents the conduct and morals of the deceased the speaker could not with propriety wander into the regions of fiction the truth was known before it was adorned the academy saw the marble before the artist polished it but this country has had no academy of literature the public mind for centuries has been engrossed by party and faction by the madness of many for the gain of a few by civil wars religious dissensions trade and commerce and the arts of accumulating wealth amidst such attentions who can wonder that cold praise has been often the only reward of merit in this country dr nathaniel hodges who like the good bishop of marseilles drew purer breath amidst the contagion of the plague in london and during the whole time continued in the city administering medical assistance was suffered as johnson used to relate with tears in his eyes to die for debt in a gaol in this country the man who brought the new river to london was ruined by that noble project and in this country otway died for want on tower hill butler the great author of hudibras whose name can only die with the english language was left to languish in poverty the particulars of his life almost unknown and scarce a vestige of him left except his immortal poem had there been an academy of literature the lives at least of those celebrated persons would have been written for the benefit of posterity swift it seems had the idea of such an institution and proposed it to lord oxford but whig and tory were more important objects it is needless to dissemble that dr johnson in the life of roscommon talks of the inutility of such a project in this country he says an academy could be expected to do but little if an academicians place were profitable it would be given by interest if attendance were gratuitous it would be rarely paid and no man would endure the least disgust unanimity is impossible and debate would separate the assembly to this it may be sufficient to answer that the royal society has not been dissolved by sullen disgust and the modern academy at somerset house has already performed much and promises more unanimity is not necessary to such an assembly on the contrary by difference of opinion and collision of sentiment the cause of literature would thrive and flourish the true principles of criticism the secret of fine writing the investigation of antiquities and other interesting subjects might occasion a clash of opinions but in that contention truth would receive illustration and the essays of the several members would supply the memoirs of the academy but says dr johnson suppose the philological decree made and promulgated what would be its authority in absolute government there is sometimes a general reverence paid to all that has the sanction of power the countenance of greatness how little this is the state of our country needs not to be told the edicts of an english academy would probably be read by many only that they may be sure to disobey them the present manners of the nation would deride authority and therefore nothing is left but that every writer should criticise himself this surely is not conclusive it is by the standard of the best writers that every man settles for himself his plan of legitimate composition and since the authority of superior genius is acknowledged that authority which the individual obtains would not be lessened by an association with others of distinguished ability it may therefore be inferred that an academy of literature would be an establishment highly useful and an honour to literature in such an institution profitable places would not be wanted vatis avarus haud facile est animus and the minister who shall find leisure from party and faction to carry such a scheme into execution will in all probability be respected by posterity as the maecenas of letters we now take leave of dr johnson as an author four volumes of his lives of the poets were published in and the work was completed in should biography fall again into disuse there will not always be a johnson to look back through a century and give a body of critical and moral instruction in april he lost his friend mr thrale his own words in his diary will best tell that melancholy event on wednesday the th of april was buried my dear friend mr thrale who died on wednesday the th and with him were buried many of my hopes and pleasures about five i think on wednesday morning he expired i felt almost the last flutter of his pulse and looked for the last time upon the face that for fifteen years before had never been turned upon me but with respect and benignity farewell may god that delighteth in mercy have had mercy on thee i had constantly prayed for him before his death the decease of him from whose friendship i had obtained many opportunities of amusement and to whom i turned my thoughts as to a refuge from misfortunes has left me heavy but my business is with myself from the close of his last work the malady that persecuted him through life came upon him with alarming severity and his constitution declined apace in his old friend levet expired without warning and without a groan events like these reminded johnson of his own mortality he continued his visits to mrs thrale at streatham to the th day of october when having first composed a prayer for the happiness of a family with whom he had for many years enjoyed the pleasures and comforts of life he removed to his own house in town he says he was up early in the morning and read fortuitously in the gospel which was his parting use of the library the merit of the family is manifested by the sense he had of it and we see his heart overflowing with gratitude he leaves the place with regret and casts a lingering look behind the few remaining occurrences may be soon despatched in the month of june johnson had a paralytic stroke which affected his speech only he wrote to dr taylor of westminster and to his friend mr allen the printer who lived at the next door dr brocklesby arrived in a short time and by his care and that of dr heberden johnson soon recovered during his illness the writer of this narrative visited him and found him reading dr watsons chymistry articulating with difficulty he said from this book he who knows nothing may learn a great deal and he who knows will be pleased to find his knowledge recalled to his mind in a manner highly pleasing in the month of august he set out for lichfield on a visit to mrs lucy porter the daughter of his wife by her first husband and in his way back paid his respects to dr adams at oxford mrs williams died at his house in bolt court in the month of september during his absence this was another shock to a mind like his ever agitated by the thoughts of futurity the contemplation of his own approaching end was constantly before his eyes and the prospect of death he declared was terrible for many years when he was not disposed to enter into the conversation going forward whoever sat near his chair might hear him repeating from shakespeare aye but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods and from milton who would lose for fear of pain this intellectual being by the death of mrs williams he was left in a state of destitution with nobody but frank his black servant to sooth his anxious moments in november he was swelled from head to foot with a dropsy dr brocklesby with that benevolence with which he always assists his friends paid his visits with assiduity the medicines prescribed were so efficacious that in a few days johnson while he was offering up his prayers was suddenly obliged to rise and in the course of the day discharged twenty pints of water johnson being eased of his dropsy began to entertain hopes that the vigour of his constitution was not entirely broken for the sake of conversing with his friends he established a conversation club to meet on every wednesday evening and to serve a man whom he had known in mr thrales household for many years the place was fixed at his house in essex street near the temple to answer the malignant remarks of sir john hawkins on this subject were a wretched waste of time professing to be johnsons friend that biographer has raised more objections to his character than all the enemies to that excellent man sir john had a root of bitterness that put rancours in the vessel of his peace fielding he says was the inventor of a cant phrase goodness of heart which means little more than the virtue of a horse or a dog he should have known that kind affections are the essence of virtue they are the will of god implanted in our nature to aid and strengthen moral obligation they incite to action a sense of benevolence is no less necessary than a sense of duty good affections are an ornament not only to an author but to his writings he who shows himself upon a cold scent for opportunities to bark and snarl throughout a volume of six hundred pages may if he will pretend to moralise but goodness of heart or to use that politer phrase the virtue of a horse or a dog would redound more to his honour but sir john is no more our business is with johnson the members of his club were respectable for their rank their talents and their literature they attended with punctuality till about midsummer when with some appearance of health johnson went into derbyshire and thence to lichfield while he was in that part of the world his friends in town were labouring for his benefit the air of a more southern climate they thought might prolong a valuable life but a pension of three hundred pounds a year was a slender fund for a travelling valetudinarian and it was not then known that he had saved a moderate sum of money mr boswell and sir joshua reynolds undertook to solicit the patronage of the chancellor with lord thurlow while he was at the bar johnson was well acquainted he was often heard to say thurlow is a man of such vigour of mind that i never knew i was to meet him but i was going to say i was afraid but that would not be true for i never was afraid of any man but i never knew that i was to meet thurlow but i knew i had something to encounter the chancellor undertook to recommend johnsons case but without success to protract if possible the days of a man whom he respected he offered to advance the sum of five hundred pounds being informed of this at lichfield johnson wrote the following letter my lord after a long and not inattentive observation of mankind the generosity of your lordships offer raises in me not less wonder than gratitude bounty so liberally bestowed i should gladly receive if my condition made it necessary for to such a mind who would not be proud to own his obligations but it has pleased god to restore me to so great a measure of health that if i should now appropriate so much of a fortune destined to do good i could not escape from myself the charge of advancing a false claim my journey to the continent though i once thought it necessary was never much encouraged by my physicians and i was very desirous that your lordship should be told it by sir joshua reynolds as an event very uncertain for if i grew much better i should not be willing if much worse i should not be able to migrate your lordship was first solicited without my knowledge but when i was told that you were pleased to honour me with your patronage i did not expect to hear of a refusal yet as i have had no long time to brood hopes and have not rioted in imaginary opulence this cold reception has been scarce a disappointment and from your lordships kindness i have received a benefit which only men like you are able to bestow i shall now live mihi carior with a higher opinion of my own merit i am my lord your lordships most obliged most grateful and most humble servant samuel johnson september we have in this instance the exertion of two congenial minds one with a generous impulse relieving merit in distress and the other by gratitude and dignity of sentiment rising to an equal elevation it seems however that greatness of mind is not confined to greatness of rank dr brocklesby was not content to assist with his medical art he resolved to minister to his patients mind and pluck from his memory the sorrow which the late refusal from a high quarter might occasion to enable him to visit the south of france in pursuit of health he offered from his own funds an annuity of one hundred pounds payable quarterly this was a sweet oblivious antidote but it was not accepted for the reasons assigned to the chancellor the proposal however will do honour to dr brocklesby as long as liberal sentiment shall be ranked among the social virtues in the month of october we find dr johnson corresponding with mr nichols the intelligent compiler of the gentlemans magazine and in the languor of sickness still desirous to contribute all in his power to the advancement of science and useful knowledge he says in a letter to that gentleman dated lichfield october that he should be glad to give so skilful a lover of antiquities any information he adds at ashbourne where i had very little company i had the luck to borrow mr bowyers life a book so full of contemporary history that a literary man must find some of his old friends i thought that i could now and then have told you some hints worth your notice we perhaps may talk a life over i hope we shall be much together you must now be to me what you were before and what dear mr allen was besides he was taken unexpectedly away but i think he was a very good man i have made very little progress in recovery i am very weak and very sleepless but i live on and hope in that languid condition he arrived on the th of november at his house in bolt court there to end his days he laboured with the dropsy and an asthma he was attended by dr heberden dr warren dr brocklesby dr butter and mr cruikshank the eminent surgeon eternity presented to his mind an awful prospect and with as much virtue as perhaps ever is the lot of man he shuddered at the thought of his dissolution his friends awakened the comfortable reflection of a wellspent life and as his end drew near they had the satisfaction of seeing him composed and even cheerful insomuch that he was able in the course of his restless nights to make translations of greek epigrams from the anthologia and to compose a latin epitaph for his father his mother and his brother nathaniel he meditated at the same time a latin inscription to the memory of garrick but his vigour was exhausted his love of literature was a passion that stuck to his last sand seven days before his death he wrote the following letter to his friend mr nichols sir the late learned mr swinton of oxford having one day remarked that one man meaning i suppose no man but himself could assign all the parts of the ancient universal history to their proper authors at the request of sir robert chambers or myself gave the account which i now transmit to you in his own hand being willing that of so great a work the history should be known and that each writer should receive his due proportion of praise from posterity i recommend to you to preserve this scrap of literary intelligence in mr swintons own hand or to deposit it in the museumy that the veracity of this account may never be doubted i am sir your most humble servant sam johnson dec mr swinton the history of the carthaginians numidians mauritanians gaetulians garamantes melanogaetulians nigritae cyrenaica marmarica regio syrtica turks tartars and moguls indians chinese the dissertation on the peopling of america the dissertation on the independency of the arabs the cosmogony and a small part of the history immediately following by mr sale to the birth of abraham chiefly by mr shelvock history of the jews gauls and spaniards by mr psalmanazai xenophons retreat by the same history of the persians and the constantinopolitan empire by dr campbell history of the romans by mr bowerz on the morning of december dr johnson requested to see mr nichols a few days before he had borrowed some of the early volumes of the magazine with a professed intention to point out the pieces which he had written in that collection the books lay on the table with many leaves doubled down and in particular those which contained his share in the parliamentary debates such was the goodness of johnsons heart that he then declared that those debates were the only parts of his writings which gave him any compunction but that at the time he wrote them he had no conception that he was imposing upon the world though they were frequently written from very slender materials and often from none at all the mere coinage of his own imagination he added that he never wrote any part of his work with equal velocity three columns of the magazine in an hour he said was no uncommon effort which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity in one day in particular and that not a very long one he wrote twelve pages more in quantity than ever he wrote at any other time except in the life of savage of which fortyeight pages in octavo were the production of one long day including a part of the night in the course of the conversation he asked whether any of the family of faden the printer were living being told that the geographer near charing cross was fadens son he said after a short pause i borrowed a guinea of his father near thirty years ago be so good as to take this and pay it for me wishing to discharge every duty and every obligation johnson recollected another debt of ten pounds which he had borrowed from his friend mr hamilton the printer about twenty years before he sent the money to mr hamilton at his house in bedford row with an apology for the length of time the reverend mr strahan was the bearer of the message about four or five days before johnson breathed his last mr sastres whom dr johnson esteemed and mentioned in his will entered the room during his illness dr johnson as soon as he saw him stretched forth his hand and in a tone of lamentation called out jam moriturus but the love of life was still an active principle feeling himself swelled with the dropsy he conceived that by incisions in his legs the water might be discharged mr cruikshank apprehended that a mortification might be the consequence but to appease a distempered fancy he gently lanced the surface johnson cried out deeper deeper i want length of life and you are afraid of giving me pain which i do not value on the th of december the reverend mr strahan drew his will by which after a few legacies the residue amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds was bequeathed to frank the black servant formerly consigned to the testator by his friend dr bathurst the history of a deathbed is painful mr strahan informs us that the strength of religion prevailed against the infirmity of nature and his foreboding dread of the divine justice subsided into a pious trust and humble hope of mercy at the throne of grace on monday the th day of december the last of his existence on this side the grave the desire of life returned with all its former vehemence he still imagined that by puncturing his legs relief might be obtained at eight in the morning he tried the experiment but no water followed in an hour or two after he fell into a doze and about seven in the evening expired without a groan on the th of the month his remains with due solemnities and a numerous attendance of his friends were buried in westminster abbey near the foot of shakespeares monument and close to the grave of the late mr garrick the funeral service was read by his friend dr taylor a black marble over his grave has the following inscription samuel johnson lld obiit xiii die decembris anno domini mdcclxxxiv aetatis suae lxxv if we now look back as from an eminence to view the scenes of life and the literary labours in which dr johnson was engaged we may be able to delineate the features of the man and to form an estimate of his genius as a man dr johnson stands displayed in open daylight nothing remains undiscovered whatever he said is known and without allowing him the usual privilege of hazarding sentiments and advancing positions for mere amusement or the pleasure of discussion criticism has endeavoured to make him answerable for what perhaps he never seriously thought his diary which has been printed discovers still more we have before us the very heart of the man with all his inward consciousness and yet neither in the open paths of life nor in his secret recesses has any one vice been discovered we see him reviewing every year of his life and severely censuring himself for not keeping resolutions which morbid melancholy and other bodily infirmities rendered impracticable we see him for every little defect imposing on himself voluntary penance going through the day with only one cup of tea without milk and to the last amidst paroxysms and remissions of illness forming plans of study and resolutions to amend his lifeaa many of his scruples may be called weaknesses but they are the weaknesses of a good a pious and most excellent man his person it is well known was large and unwieldy his nerves were affected by that disorder for which at two years of age he was presented to the royal touch his head shook and involuntary motions made it uncertain that his legs and arms would even at a teatable remain in their proper place a person of lord chesterfields delicacy might in his company be in a fever he would sometimes of his own accord do things inconsistent with the established modes of behaviour sitting at table with the celebrated mrs cholmondeley who exerted herself to circulate the subscription for shakespeare he took hold of her hand in the middle of dinner and held it close to his eye wondering at the delicacy and whiteness till with a smile she asked will he give it to me again when he has done with it the exteriors of politeness did not belong to johnson even that civility which proceeds or ought to proceed from the mind was sometimes violated his morbid melancholy had an effect on his temper his passions were irritable and the pride of science as well as of a fierce independent spirit inflamed him on some occasions above all bounds of moderation though not in the shade of academic bowers he led a scholastic life and the habit of pronouncing decisions to his friends and visitors gave him a dictatorial manner which was much enforced by a voice naturally loud and often overstretched metaphysical discussion moral theory systems of religion and anecdotes of literature were his favourite topics general history had little of his regard biography was his delight the proper study of mankind is man sooner than hear of the punic war he would be rude to the person that introduced the subject johnson was born a logician one of those to whom only books of logic are said to be of use in consequence of his skill in that art he loved argumentation no man thought more profoundly nor with such acute discernment a fallacy could not stand before him it was sure to be refuted by strength of reasoning and a precision both in idea and expression almost unequalled when he chose by apt illustration to place the argument of his adversary in a ludicrous light one was almost inclined to think ridicule the test of truth he was surprised to be told but it is certainly true that with great powers of mind wit and humour were his shining talents that he often argued for the sake of triumph over his adversary cannot be dissembled dr rose of chiswick has been heard to tell of a friend of his who thanked him for introducing him to dr johnson as he had been convinced in the course of a long dispute that an opinion which he had embraced as a settled truth was no better than a vulgar error this being reported to johnson nay said he do not let him be thankful for he was right and i was wrong like his uncle andrew in the ring at smithfield johnson in a circle of disputants was determined neither to be thrown nor conquered notwithstanding all his piety selfgovernment or the command of his passions in conversation does not seem to have been among his attainments whenever he thought the contention was for superiority he has been known to break out with violence and even ferocity when the fray was over he generally softened into repentance and by conciliating measures took care that no animosity should be left rankling in the breast of his antagonist of this defect he seems to have been conscious in a letter to mrs thrale he says poor baretti do not quarrel with him to neglect him a little will be sufficient he means only to be frank and manly and independent and perhaps as you say a little wise to be frank he thinks is to be cynical and to be independent is to be rude forgive him dearest lady the rather because of his misbehaviour i am afraid he learned part of me i hope to set him hereafter a better example for his own intolerant and overbearing spirit he apologized by observing that it had done some good obscenity and impiety were repressed in his company it was late in life before he had the habit of mixing otherwise than occasionally with polite company at mr thrales he saw a constant succession of wellaccomplished visiters in that society he began to wear off the rugged points of his own character he saw the advantages of mutual civility and endeavoured to profit by the models before him he aimed at what has been called by swift the lesser morals and by cicero minores virtutes his endeavour though new and late gave pleasure to all his acquaintance men were glad to see that he was willing to be communicative on equal terms and reciprocal complacence the time was then expected when he was to cease being what george garrick brother to the celebrated actor called him the first time he heard him converse a tremendous companion he certainly wished to be polite and even thought himself so but his civility still retained something uncouth and harsh his manners took a milder tone but the endeavour was too palpably seen he laboured even in trifles he was a giant gaining a purchase to lift a feather it is observed by the younger pliny that in the confines of virtue and great qualities there are generally vices of an opposite nature in dr johnson not one ingredient can take the name of vice from his attainments in literature grew the pride of knowledge and from his powers of reasoning the love of disputation and the vain glory of superior vigour his piety in some instances bordered on superstition he was willing to believe in preternatural agency and thought it not more strange that there should be evil spirits than evil men even the question about second sight held him in suspense second sight mr pennant tells us is a power of seeing images impressed on the organs of sight by the power of fancy or on the fancy by the disordered spirits operating on the mind it is the faculty of seeing spectres or visions which represent an event actually passing at a distance or likely to happen at a future day in a gentleman the last who was supposed to be possessed of this faculty had a boat at sea in a tempestuous night and being anxious for his freight suddenly started up and said his men would be drowned for he had seen them pass before him with wet garments and dropping locks the event corresponded with his disordered fancy and thus continues mr pennant a distempered imagination clouded with anxiety may make an impression on the spirits as persons restless and troubled with indignation see various forms and figures while they lie awake in bed this is what dr johnson was not willing to reject he wished for some positive proof of communications with another world his benevolence embraced the whole race of man and yet was tinctured with particular prejudices he was pleased with the minister in the isle of skie and loved him so much that he began to wish him not a presbyterian to that body of dissenters his zeal for the established church made him in some degree an adversary and his attachment to a mixed and limited monarchy led him to declare open war against what he called a sullen republican he would rather praise a man of oxford than of cambridge he disliked a whig and loved a tory these were the shades of his character which it has been the business of certain partywriters to represent in the darkest colours since virtue or moral goodness consists in a just conformity of our actions to the relations in which we stand to the supreme being and to our fellowcreatures where shall we find a man who has been or endeavoured to be more diligent in the discharge of those essential duties his first prayer was composed in he continued those fervent ejaculations of piety to the end of his life in his meditations we see him scrutinizing himself with severity and aiming at perfection unattainable by man his duty to his neighbour consisted in universal benevolence and a constant aim at the production of happiness who was more sincere and steady in his friendships it has been said that there was no real affection between him and garrick on the part of the latter there might be some corrosions of jealousy the character of prospero in the rambler no was beyond all question occasioned by garricks ostentatious display of furniture and dresden china it was surely fair to take from this incident a hint for a moral essay and though no more was intended garrick we are told remembered it with uneasiness he was also hurt that his lichfield friend did not think so highly of his dramatic art as the rest of the world the fact was johnson could not see the passions as they rose and chased one another in the varied features of that expressive face and by his own manner of reciting verses which was wonderfully impressive he plainly showed that he thought there was too much of artificial tone and measured cadence in the declamation of the theatre the present writer well remembers being in conversation with dr johnson near the side of the scenes during the tragedy of king lear when garrick came off the stage he said you two talk so loud you destroy all my feelings prithee replied johnson do not talk of feelings punch has no feelings this seems to have been his settled opinion admirable as garricks imitation of nature always was johnson thought it no better than mere mimickry yet it is certain that he esteemed and loved garrick that he dwelt with pleasure on his praise and used to declare that he deserved his great success because on all applications for charity he gave more than was asked after garricks death he never talked of him without a tear in his eye he offered if mrs garrick would desire it of him to be the editor of his works and the historian of his lifebb it has been mentioned that on his deathbed he thought of writing a latin inscription to the memory of his friend numbers are still living who know these facts and still remember with gratitude the friendship which he showed to them with unaltered affection for a number of years his humanity and generosity in proportion to his slender income were unbounded it has been truly said that the lame the blind and the sorrowful found in his house a sure retreat a strict adherence to truth he considered as a sacred obligation insomuch that in relating the most minute anecdote he would not allow himself the smallest addition to embellish his story the late mr tyers who knew dr johnson intimately observed that he always talked as if he was talking upon oath after a long acquaintance with this excellent man and an attentive retrospect to his whole conduct such is the light in which he appears to the writer of this essay the following lines of horace may be deemed his picture in miniature iracundior est paulo minus aptus acutis naribus horum hominum rideri possit eo quod rusticius tonso toga defluit et male laxus in pede calceus haeret at est bonus ut melior vir non alius quisquam at tibi amicus at ingenium ingens inculto latet hoc sub corpore your friend is passionate perhaps unfit for the brisk petulance of modern wit his hair illcut his robe that awkward flows or his large shoes to raillery expose the man you love yet is he not possessd of virtues with which very few are blest while underneath this rude uncouth disguise a genius of extensive knowledge lies franciss hor book i sat it remains to give a review of johnsons works and this it is imagined will not be unwelcome to the reader like milton and addison he seems to have been fond of his latin poetry those compositions show that he was an early scholar but his verses have not the graceful ease that gave so much suavity to the poems of addison the translation of the messiah labours under two disadvantages it is first to be compared with popes inimitable performance and afterwards with the pollio of virgil it may appear trifling to remark that he has made the letter o in the word virgo long and short in the same line virgo virgo parit but the translation has great merit and some admirable lines in the odes there is a sweet flexibility particularly to his worthy friend dr lawrence on himself at the theatre march the ode in the isle of skie and that to mrs thrale from the same place his english poetry is such as leaves room to think if he had devoted himself to the muses that he would have been the rival of pope his first production in this kind was london a poem in imitation of the third satire of juvenal the vices of the metropolis are placed in the room of ancient manners the author had heated his mind with the ardour of juvenal and having the skill to polish his numbers he became a sharp accuser of the times the vanity of human wishes is an imitation of the tenth satire of the same author though it is translated by dryden johnsons imitation approaches nearest to the spirit of the original the subject is taken from the alcibiades of plato and has an intermixture of the sentiments of socrates concerning the object of prayers offered up to the deity the general proposition is that good and evil are so little understood by mankind that their wishes when granted are always destructive this is exemplified in a variety of instances such as riches statepreferment eloquence military glory long life and the advantages of form and beauty juvenals conclusion is worthy of a christian poet and such a pen as johnsons let us he says leave it to the gods to judge what is fittest for us man is dearer to his creator than to himself if we must pray for special favour let it be for a sound mind in a sound body let us pray for fortitude that we may think the labours of hercules and all his sufferings preferable to a life of luxury and the soft repose of sardanapalus this is a blessing within the reach of every man this we can give ourselves it is virtue and virtue only that can make us happy in the translation the zeal of the christian conspired with the warmth and energy of the poet but juvenal is not eclipsed for the various characters in the original the reader is pleased in the english poem to meet with cardinal wolsey buckingham stabbed by felton lord strafford clarendon charles the twelfth of sweden and for tully and demosthenes lydiat galileo and archbishop laud it is owing to johnsons delight in biography that the name of lydiat is called forth from obscurity it may therefore not be useless to tell that lydiat was a learned divine and mathematician in the beginning of the last century he attacked the doctrine of aristotle and scaliger and wrote a number of sermons on the harmony of the evangelists with all his merit he lay in the prison of bocardo at oxford till bishop usher laud and others paid his debts he petitioned charles the first to be sent to ethiopia to procure manuscripts having spoken in favour of monarchy and bishops he was plundered by the puritans and twice carried away a prisoner from his rectory he died very poor in the tragedy of irene is founded on a passage in knolless history of the turks an author highly commended in the rambler no an incident in the life of mahomet the great first emperor of the turks is the hinge on which the fable is made to move the substance of the story is shortly this in mahomet laid siege to constantinople and having reduced the place became enamoured of a fair greek whose name was irene the sultan invited her to embrace the law of the prophet and to grace his throne enraged at this intended marriage the janizaries formed a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor to avert the impending danger mahomet in a full assembly of the grandees catching with one hand as knolles relates it the fair greek by the hair of her head and drawing his falchion with the other he at one blow struck off her head to the great terror of them all and having so done said unto them now by this judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or not the story is simple and it remained for the author to amplify it with proper episodes and give it complication and variety the catastrophe is changed and horror gives place to terror and pity but after all the fable is cold and languid there is not throughout the piece a single situation to excite curiosity and raise a conflict of passions the diction is nervous rich and elegant but splendid language and melodious numbers will make a fine poem not a tragedy the sentiments are beautiful always happily expressed but seldom appropriated to the character and generally too philosophic what johnson has said of the tragedy of cato may be applied to irene it is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a representation of natural affections nothing excites or assuages emotion the events are expected without solicitude and are remembered without joy or sorrow of the agents we have no care we consider not what they are doing nor what they are suffering we wish only to know what they have to say it is unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy the following speech in the mouth of a turk who is supposed to have heard of the british constitution has been often selected from the numberless beauties with which irene abounds if there be any land as fame reports where common laws restrain the prince and subject a happy land where circulating power flows through each member of th embodied state sure not unconscious of the mighty blessing her grateful sons shine bright with evry virtue untainted with the lust of innovation sure all unite to hold her league of rule unbroken as the sacred chain of nature that links the jarring elements in peace these are british sentiments above forty years ago they found an echo in the breast of applauding audiences and to this hour they are the voice of the people in defiance of the metaphysics and the new lights of certain politicians who would gladly find their private advantage in the disasters of their country a race of men quibus nulla ex honesto spes the prologue to irene is written with elegance and in a peculiar style shows the literary pride and lofty spirit of the author the epilogue we are told in a late publication was written by sir william yonge this is a new discovery but by no means probable when the appendages to a dramatic performance are not assigned to a friend or an unknown hand or a person of fashion they are always supposed to be written by the author of the play it is to be wished however that the epilogue in question could be transferred to any other writer it is the worst jeu desprit that ever fell from johnsons pencc an account of the various pieces contained in this edition such as miscellaneous tracts and philological dissertations would lead beyond the intended limits of this essay it will suffice to say that they are the productions of a man who never wanted decorations of language and always taught his reader to think the life of the late king of prussia as far as it extends is a model of the biographical style the review of the origin of evil was perhaps written with asperity but the angry epitaph which it provoked from soame jenyns was an illtimed resentment unworthy of the genius of that amiable author the rambler may be considered as johnsons great work it was the basis of that high reputation which went on increasing to the end of his days the circulation of those periodical essays was not at first equal to their merit they had not like the spectators the art of charming by variety and indeed how could it be expected the wits of queen annes reign sent their contributions to the spectator and johnson stood alone a stagecoach says sir richard steele must go forward on stated days whether there are passengers or not so it was with the rambler every tuesday and saturday for two years in this collection johnson is the great moral teacher of his countrymen his essays form a body of ethics the observations on life and manners are acute and instructive and the papers professedly critical serve to promote the cause of literature it must however be acknowledged that a settled gloom hangs over the authors mind and all the essays except eight or ten coming from the same fountainhead no wonder that they have the raciness of the soil from which they sprang of this uniformity johnson was sensible he used to say that if he had joined a friend or two who would have been able to intermix papers of a sprightly turn the collection would have been more miscellaneous and by consequence more agreeable to the generality of readers this he used to illustrate by repeating two beautiful stanzas from his own ode to cave or sylvanus urban non ulla musis pagina gratior quam quae severis ludicra jungere novit fatigatamque nugis utilibus recreare mentem texente nymphis serta lycoride rosae ruborem sic viola adjuvat iramista sic iris refulget aethereis variata fucis it is remarkable that the pomp of diction which has been objected to johnson was first assumed in the rambler his dictionary was going on at the same time and in the course of that work as he grew familiar with technical and scholastic words he thought that the bulk of his readers were equally learned or at least would admire the splendour and dignity of the style and yet it is well known that he praised in cowley the ease and unaffected structure of the sentences cowley may be placed at the head of those who cultivated a clear and natural style dryden tillotson and sir william temple followed addison swift and pope with more correctness carried our language well nigh to perfection of addison johnson was used to say he is the raphael of essay writers how he differed so widely from such elegant models is a problem not to be solved unless it be true that he took an early tincture from the writers of the last century particularly sir thomas browne hence the peculiarities of his style new combinations sentences of an unusual structure and words derived from the learned languages his own account of the matter is when common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification i familiarized the terms of philosophy by applying them to popular ideas but he forgot the observation of dryden if too many foreign words are poured in upon us it looks as if they were designed not to assist the natives but to conquer them there is it must be admitted a swell of language often out of all proportion to the sentiment but there is in general a fulness of mind and the thought seems to expand with the sound of the words determined to discard colloquial barbarisms and licentious idioms he forgot the elegant simplicity that distinguishes the writings of addison he had what locke calls a roundabout view of his subject and though he never was tainted like many modern wits with the ambition of shining in paradox he may be fairly called an original thinker his reading was extensive he treasured in his mind whatever was worthy of notice but he added to it from his own meditation he collected quae reconderet auetaque promeret addison was not so profound a thinker he was born to write converse and live with ease and he found an early patron in lord somers he depended however more upon a fine taste than the vigour of his mind his latin poetry shows that he relished with a just selection all the refined and delicate beauties of the roman classics and when he cultivated his native language no wonder that he formed that graceful style which has been so justly admired simple yet elegant adorned yet never overwrought rich in allusion yet pure and perspicuous correct without labour and though sometimes deficient in strength yet always musical his essays in general are on the surface of life if ever original it was in pieces of humour sir roger de coverly and the tory foxhunter need not to be mentioned johnson had a fund of humour but he did not know it nor was he willing to descend to the familiar idiom and the variety of diction which that mode of composition required the letter in the rambler no from a young girl that wants a place will illustrate this observation addison possessed an unclouded imagination alive to the first objects of nature and of art he reaches the sublime without any apparent effort when he tells us if we consider the fixed stars as so many oceans of flame that are each of them attended with a different set of planets if we still discover new firmaments and new lights that are sunk further in those unfathomable depths of ether we are lost in a labyrinth of suns and worlds and confounded with the magnificence and immensity of nature the ease with which this passage rises to unaffected grandeur is the secret charm that captivates the reader johnson is always lofty he seems to use drydens phrase to be oerinformd with meaning and his words do not appear to himself adequate to his conception he moves in state and his periods are always harmonious his oriental tales are in the true style of eastern magnificence and yet none of them are so much admired as the visions of mirza in matters of criticism johnson is never the echo of preceding writers he thinks and decides for himself if we except the essays on the pleasures of imagination addison cannot be called a philosophical critic his moral essays are beautiful but in that province nothing can exceed the rambler though johnson used to say that the essay on the burthens of mankind in the spectator no was the most exquisite he had ever read talking of himself johnson said topham beauclerk has wit and every thing comes from him with ease but when i say a good thing i seem to labour when we compare him with addison the contrast is still stronger addison lends grace and ornament to truth johnson gives it force and energy addison makes virtue amiable johnson represents it as an awful duty addison insinuates himself with an air of modesty johnson commands like a dictator but a dictator in his splendid robes not labouring at the plough addison is the jupiter of virgil with placid serenity talking to venus vultu quo coelum tempestatesque serenat johnson is jupiter tonans he darts his lightning and rolls his thunder in the cause of virtue and piety the language seems to fall short of his ideas he pours along familiarizing the terms of philosophy with bold inversions and sonorous periods but we may apply to him what pope has said of homer it is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense it is not the design of this comparison to decide between these two eminent writers in matters of taste every reader will choose for himself johnson is always profound and of course gives the fatigue of thinking addison charms while he instructs and writing as he always does a pure an elegant and idiomatic style he may be pronounced the safest model for imitation the essays written by johnson in the adventurer may be called a continuation of the rambler the idler in order to be consistent with the assumed character is written with abated vigour in a style of ease and unlaboured elegance it is the odyssey after the iliad intense thinking would not become the idler the first number presents a welldrawn portrait of an idler and from that character no deviation could be made accordingly johnson forgets his austere manner and plays us into sense he still continues his lectures on human life but he adverts to common occurrences and is often content with the topic of the day an advertisement in the beginning of the first volume informs us that twelve entire essays were a contribution from different hands one of these no is the journal of a senior fellow at cambridge but as johnson being himself an original thinker always revolted from servile imitation he has printed the piece with an apology importing that the journal of a citizen in the spectator almost precluded the attempt of any subsequent writer this account of the idler may be closed after observing that the authors mother being buried on the rd of january there is an admirable paper occasioned by that event on saturday the th of the same month no the reader if he pleases may compare it with another fine paper in the rambler no on the conviction that rushes on the mind at the bed of a dying friend rasselas says sir john hawkins is a specimen of our language scarcely to be paralleled it is written in a style refined to a degree of immaculate purity and displays the whole force of turgid eloquence one cannot but smile at this encomium rasselas is undoubtedly both elegant and sublime it is a view of human life displayed it must be owned in gloomy colours the authors natural melancholy depressed at the time by the approaching dissolution of his mother darkened the picture a tale that should keep curiosity awake by the artifice of unexpected incidents was not the design of a mind pregnant with better things he who reads the heads of the chapters will find that it is not a course of adventures that invites him forward but a discussion of interesting questions reflections on human life the history of imlac the man of learning a dissertation upon poetry the character of a wise and happy man who discourses with energy on the government of the passions and on a sudden when death deprives him of his daughter forgets all his maxims of wisdom and the eloquence that adorned them yielding to the stroke of affliction with all the vehemence of the bitterest anguish it is by pictures of life and profound moral reflection that expectation is engaged and gratified throughout the work the history of the mad astronomer who imagines that for five years he possessed the regulation of the weather and that the sun passed from tropic to tropic by his direction represents in striking colours the sad effects of a distempered imagination it becomes the more affecting when we recollect that it proceeds from one who lived in fear of the same dreadful visitation from one who says emphatically of the uncertainties in our present state the most dreadful and alarming is the uncertain continuance of reason the inquiry into the cause of madness and the dangerous prevalence of imagination till in time some particular train of ideas fixes the attention and the mind recurs constantly to the favourite conception is carried on in a strain of acute observation but it leaves us room to think that the author was transcribing from his own apprehensions the discourse on the nature of the soul gives us all that philosophy knows not without a tincture of superstition it is remarkable that the vanity of human pursuits was about the same time the subject that employed both johnson and voltaire but candide is the work of a lively imagination and rasselas with all its splendour of eloquence exhibits a gloomy picture it should however be remembered that the world has known the weeping as well as the laughing philosopher the dictionary does not properly fall within the province of this essay the preface however will be found in this edition he who reads the close of it without acknowledging the force of the pathethic and sublime must have more insensibility in his composition than usually falls to the share of a man the work itself though in some instances abuse has been loud and in others malice has endeavoured to undermine its fame still remains the mount atlas of english literature though storms and tempests thunder on its brow and oceans break their billows at its feet it stands unmovd and glories in its height that johnson was eminently qualified for the office of a commentator on shakespeare no man can doubt but it was an office which he never cordially embraced the public expected more than he had diligence to perform and yet his edition has been the ground on which every subsequent commentator has chosen to build one note for its singularity may be thought worthy of notice in this place hamlet says for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a godkissing carrion in this warburton discovered the origin of evil hamlet he says breaks off in the middle of the sentence but the learned commentator knows what he was going to say and being unwilling to keep the secret he goes on in a train of philosophical reasoning that leaves the reader in astonishment johnson with true piety adopts the fanciful hypothesis declaring it to be a noble emendation which almost sets the critic on a level with the author the general observations at the end of the several plays and the preface will be found in this edition the former with great elegance and precision give a summary view of each drama the preface is a tract of great erudition and philosophical criticism johnsons political pamphlets whatever was his motive for writing them whether gratitude for his pension or the solicitation of men in power did not support the cause for which they were undertaken they are written in a style truly harmonious and with his usual dignity of language when it is said that he advanced positions repugnant to the common rights of mankind the virulence of party may be suspected it is perhaps true that in the clamour raised throughout the kingdom johnson overheated his mind but he was a friend to the rights of man and he was greatly superior to the littleness of spirit that might incline him to advance what he did not think and firmly believe in the false alarm though many of the most eminent men in the kingdom concurred in petitions to the throne yet johnson having well surveyed the mass of the people has given with great humour and no less truth what may be called the birth parentage and education of a remonstrance on the subject of falklands islands the fine dissuasive from too hastily involving the world in the calamities of war must extort applause even from the party that wished at that time for scenes of tumult and commotion it was in the same pamphlet that johnson offered battle to junius a writer who by the uncommon elegance of his style charmed every reader though his object was to inflame the nation in favour of a faction junius fought in the dark he saw his enemy and had his full blow while he himself remained safe in obscurity but let us not said johnson mistake the venom of the shaft for the vigour of the bow the keen invective which he published on that occasion promised a paper war between two combatants who knew the use of their weapons a battle between them was as eagerly expected as between mendoza and big ben but junius whatever was his reason never returned to the field he laid down his arms and has ever since remained as secret as the man in the mask in voltaires history the account of his journey to the hebrides or western isles of scotland is a model for such as shall hereafter relate their travels the author did not visit that part of the world in the character of an antiquary to amuse us with wonders taken from the dark and fabulous ages nor as a mathematician to measure a degree and settle the longitude and latitude of the several islands those who expected such information expected what was never intended in every work regard the writers end johnson went to see men and manners modes of life and the progress of civilization his remarks are so artfully blended with the rapidity and elegance of his narrative that the reader is inclined to wish as johnson did with regard to gray that to travel and to tell his travels had been more of his employment as to johnsons parliamentary debates nothing with propriety can be said in this place they are collected in two volumes by mr stockdale and the flow of eloquence which runs through the several speeches is sufficiently known it will not be useless to mention two more volumes which may form a proper supplement to this edition they contain a set of sermons left for publication by john taylor lld the reverend mr hayes who ushered these discourses into the world has not given them as the composition of dr taylor all he could say for his departed friend was that he left them in silence among his papers mr hayes knew them to be the production of a superior mind and the writer of these memoirs owes it to the candour of that elegant scholar that he is now warranted to give an additional proof of johnsons ardour in the cause of piety and every moral duty the last discourse in the collection was intended to be delivered by dr taylor at the funeral of johnsons wife but that reverend gentleman declined the office because as he told mr hayes the praise of the deceased was too much amplified he who reads the piece will find it a beautiful moral lesson written with temper and nowhere overcharged with ambitious ornaments the rest of the discourses were the fund which dr taylor from time to time carried with him to his pulpit he had the largest bulldd in england and some of the best sermons we come now to the lives of the poets a work undertaken at the age of seventy yet the most brilliant and certainly the most popular of all our authors writings for this performance he needed little preparation attentive always to the history of letters and by his own natural bias fond of biography he was the more willing to embrace the proposition of the booksellers he was versed in the whole body of english poetry and his rules of criticism were settled with precision the dissertation in the life of cowley on the metaphysical poets of the last century has the attraction of novelty as well as sound observation the writers who followed dr donne went in quest of something better than truth and nature as sancho says in don quixote they wanted better bread than is made with wheat they took pains to bewilder themselves and were ingenious for no other purpose than to err in johnsons review of cowleys works false wit is detected in all its shapes and the gothic taste for glittering conceits and farfetched allusions is exploded never it is hoped to revive again an author who has published his observations on the life and writings of dr johnson speaking of the lives of the poets says these compositions abounding in strong and acute remark and with many fine and even sublime passages have unquestionably great merit but if they be regarded merely as containing narrations of the lives delineations of the characters and strictures of the several authors they are far from being always to be depended on he adds the characters are sometimes partial and there is sometimes too much malignity of misrepresentation to which perhaps may be joined no inconsiderable portion of erroneous criticism the several clauses of this censure deserve to be answered as fully as the limits of this essay will permit in the first place the facts are related upon the best intelligence and the best vouchers that could be gleaned after a great lapse of time probability was to be inferred from such materials as could be procured and no man better understood the nature of historical evidence than dr johnson no man was more religiously an observer of truth if his history is any where defective it must be imputed to the want of better information and the errors of uncertain tradition ad nos vix tenuis famae perlabitur aura if the strictures on the works of the various authors are not always satisfactory and if erroneous criticism may sometimes be suspected who can hope that in matters of taste all shall agree the instances in which the public mind has differed from the positions advanced by the author are few in number it has been said that justice has not been done to swift that gay and prior are undervalued and that gray has been harshly treated this charge perhaps ought not to be disputed johnson it is well known had conceived a prejudice against swift his friends trembled for him when he was writing that life but were pleased at last to see it executed with temper and moderation as to prior it is probable that he gave his real opinion but an opinion that will not be adopted by men of lively fancy with regard to gray when he condemns the apostrophe in which father thames is desired to tell who drives the hoop or tosses the ball and then adds that father thames had no better means of knowing than himself when he compares the abrupt beginning of the first stanza of the bard to the ballad of johnny armstrong is there ever a man in all scotland there are perhaps few friends of johnson who would not wish to blot out both the passages it may be questioned whether the remarks on popes essay on man can be received without great caution it has been already mentioned that crousaz a professor in switzerland eminent for his treatise of logic started up a professed enemy to that poem johnson says his mind was one of those in which philosophy and piety are happily united he looked with distrust upon all metaphysical systems of theology and was persuaded that the positions of pope were intended to draw mankind away from revelation and to represent the whole course of things as a necessary concatenation of indissoluble fatality this is not the place fur a controversy about the leibnitzian system warburton with all the powers of his large and comprehensive mind published a vindication of pope and yet johnson says that in many passages a religious eye may easily discover expressions not very favourable to morals or to liberty this sentence is severe and perhaps dogmatical crousaz wrote an examen of the essay on man and afterwards a commentary on every remarkable passage and though it now appears that mrs elizabeth carter translated the foreign critic yet it is certain that johnson encouraged the work and perhaps imbibed those early prejudices which adhered to him to the end of his life he shuddered at the idea of irreligion hence we are told in the life of pope never were penury of knowledge and vulgarity of sentiment so happily disguised pope in the chair of wisdom tells much that every man knows and much that he did not know himself and gives us comfort in the position that though mans a fool yet god is wise that human advantages are unstable that our true honour is not to have a great part but to act it well that virtue only is our own and that happiness is always in our power the reader when he meets all this in its new array no longer knows the talk of his mother and his nurse but may it not be said that every system of ethics must or ought to terminate in plain and general maxims for the use of life and though in such anxioms no discovery is made does not the beauty of the moral theory consist in the premises and the chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusion may not truth as johnson himself says be conveyed to the mind by a new train of intermediate images popes doctrine about the ruling passion does not seem to be refuted though it is called in harsh terms pernicious as well as false tending to establish a kind of moral predestination or overruling principle which cannot be resisted but johnson was too easily alarmed in the cause of religion organized as the human race is individuals have different inlets of perception different powers of mind and different sensations of pleasure and pain all spread their charms but charm not all alike on different senses different objects strike hence different passions more or less inflame as strong or weak the organs of the frame and hence one masterpassion in the breast like aarons serpent swallows up the rest brumoy says pascal from his infancy felt himself a geometrician and vandyke in like manner was a painter shakespeare who of all poets had the deepest insight into human nature was aware of a prevailing bias in the operations of every mind by him we are told masterless passion sways us to the mood of what it likes or loathes it remains to inquire whether in the lives before us the characters are partial and too often drawn with malignity of misrepresentation to prove this it is alleged that johnson has misrepresented the circumstances relative to the translation of the first iliad and maliciously ascribed that performance to addison instead of tickell with too much reliance on the testimony of pope taken from the account in the papers left by mr spence for a refutation of the fallacy imputed to addison we are referred to a note in the biographia britannica written by the late judge blackstone who it is said examined the whole matter with accuracy and found that the first regular statement of the accusation against addison was published by ruffhead in his life of pope from the materials which he received from dr warburton but with all due deference to the learned judge whose talents deserve all praise this account is by no means accurate sir richard steele in a dedication of the comedy of the drummer to mr congreve gave the first insight into that business he says in a style of anger and resentment if that gentleman mr tickell thinks himself injured i will allow i have wronged him upon this issue that if the reputed translator of the first book of homer shall please to give us another book there shall appear another good judge in poetry besides mr alexander pope who shall like it the authority of steele outweighs all opinions founded on vain conjecture and indeed seems to be decisive since we do not find that tickell though warmly pressed thought proper to vindicate himself but the grand proof of johnsons malignity is the manner in which he has treated the character and conduct of milton to enforce this charge has wearied sophistry and exhausted the invention of a party what they cannot deny they palliate what they cannot prove they say is probable but why all this rage against dr johnson addison before him had said of milton oh had the poet neer profand his pen to varnish oer the guilt of faithless men and had not johnson an equal right to avow his sentiments do his enemies claim a privilege to abuse whatever is valuable to englishmen either in church or state and must the liberty of unlicensed printing be denied to the friends of the british constitution it is unnecessary to pursue the argument through all its artifices since dismantled of ornament and seducing language the plain truth may be stated in a narrow compass johnson knew that milton was a republican he says an acrimonious and surly republican for which it is not known that he gave any better reason than that a popular government was the most frugal for the trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary commonwealth johnson knew that milton talked aloud of the danger of readmitting kingship in this nation and when milton adds that a commonwealth was commended or rather enjoined by our saviour himself to all christians not without a remarkable disallowance and the brand of gentilism upon kingship johnson thought him no better than a wild enthusiast he knew as well as milton that the happiness of a nation must needs be firmest and certainest in a full and free council of their own electing where no single person but reason only sways but the example of all the republicks recorded in the annals of mankind gave him no room to hope that reason only would be heard he knew that the republican form of government having little or no complication and no consonance of parts by a nice mechanism forming a regular whole was too simple to be beautiful even in theory in practice it perhaps never existed in its most flourishing state at athens rome and carthage it was a constant scene of tumult and commotion from the mischiefs of a wild democracy the progress has ever been to the dominion of an aristocracy and the word aristocracy fatally includes the boldest and most turbulent citizens who rise by their crimes and call themselves the best men in the state by intrigue by cabal and faction a pernicious oligarchy is sure to succeed and end at last in the tyranny of a single ruler tacitus the great master of political wisdom saw under the mixed authority of king nobles and people a better form of government than miltons boasted republick and what tacitus admired in theory but despaired of enjoying johnson saw established in this country he knew that it had been overturned by the rage of frantic men but he knew that after the iron rod of cromwells usurpation the constitution was once more restored to its first principles monarchy was established and this country was regenerated it was regenerated a second time at the revolution the rights of men were then defined and the blessings of good order and civil liberty have been ever since diffused through the whole community the peace and happiness of society were what dr johnson had at heart he knew that milton called his defence of the regicides a defence of the people of england but however glossed and varnished he thought it an apology for murder had the men who under a show of liberty brought their king to the scaffold proved by their subsequent conduct that the public good inspired their actions the end might have given some sanction to the means but usurpation and slavery followed milton undertook the office of secretary under the despotic power of cromwell offering the incense of adulation to his master with the titles of director of public councils the leader of unconquered armies the father of his country milton declared at the same time that nothing is more pleasing to god or more agreeable to reason than that the highest mind should have the sovereign power in this strain of servile flattery milton gives us the right divine of tyrants but it seems in the same piece he exhorts cromwell not to desert those great principles of liberty which he had professed to espouse for it would be a grievous enormity if after having successfully opposed tyranny he should himself act the part of a tyrant and betray the cause that he had defended this desertion of every honest principle the advocate for liberty lived to see cromwell acted the tyrant and with vile hypocrisy told the people that he had consulted the lord and the lord would have it so milton took an under part in the tragedy did that become the defender of the people of england brutus saw his country enslaved he struck the blow for freedom and he died with honour in the cause had he lived to be a secretary under tiberius what would now be said of his memory but still it seems the prostitution with which milton is charged since it cannot be defended is to be retorted on the character of johnson for this purpose a book has been published called remarks on dr johnsons life of milton to which are added miltons tractate of education and areopagitica in this laboured tract we are told there is one performance ascribed to the pen of the doctor where the prostitution is of so singular a nature that it would be difficult to select an adequate motive for it out of the mountainous heap of conjectural causes of human passions or human caprice it is the speech of the late unhappy dr william dodd when he was about to hear the sentence of the law pronounced upon him in consequence of an indictment for forgery the voice of the public has given the honour of manufacturing this speech to dr johnson and the style and configuration of the speech itself confirm the imputation but it is hardly possible to divine what could be his motive for accepting the office a man to express the precise state of mind of another about to be destined to an ignominious death for a capital crime should one would imagine have some consciousness that he himself had incurred some guilt of the same kind in all the schools of sophistry is there to be found so vile an argument in the purlieus of grub street is there such another mouthful of dirt in the whole quiver of malice is there so envenomed a shaft after this it is to be hoped that a certain class of men will talk no more of johnsons malignity the last apology for milton is that he acted according to his principles but johnson thought those principles detestable pernicious to the constitution in church and state destructive of the peace of society and hostile to the great fabric of civil policy which the wisdom of ages has taught every briton to revere to love and cherish he reckoned milton in that class of men of whom the roman historian says when they want by a sudden convulsion to overturn the government they roar and clamour for liberty if they succeed they destroy liberty itself ut imperium evertant libertatem praeferunt si perverterint libertatem ipsam aggredientur such were the sentiments of dr johnson and it may be asked in the language of bolingbroke are these sentiments which any man who is born a briton in any circumstances in any situation ought to be ashamed or afraid to avow johnson has done ample justice to miltons poetry the criticism on paradise lost is a sublime composition had he thought the author as good and pious a citizen as dr watts he would have been ready notwithstanding his nonconformity to do equal honour to the memory of the man it is now

a friend whom he loved esteemed and honoured his saltern accumulem donis et fungar inani munere the author of these memoirs has been anxious to give the features of the man and the true character of the author he has not suffered the hand of partiality to colour his excellencies with too much warmth nor has he endeavoured to throw his singularities too much into the shade dr johnsons failings may well be forgiven for the sake of his virtues his defects were spots in the sun his piety his kind affections and the goodness of his heart present an example worthy of imitation his works still remain a monument of genius and of learning had he written nothing but what is contained in this edition the quantity shows a life spent in study and meditation if to this be added the labour of his dictionary and other various productions it may be fairly allowed as he used to say of himself that he has written his share in the volumes here presented to the public the reader will find a

first of his prayers after the alteration of the style he kept his birthday on the th of september and it is accordingly marked september c the impression which this interview left on johnsons fancy is recorded by mrs piozzi in her anecdotes and johnsons description of it is picturesque and poetical being asked if he could remember queen anne he had he said a confused but somehow a sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds and a long black hood ed d the entry of this is remarkable for his early resolution to preserve through life a fair and upright character junii undecim aureos

allowing that there was a seat or bench which there is not in the middle of the pool it is absolutely impossible by any exertion of human strength to have arrived at it but it may be asked can mr bruce say what was the face of the country in the year when lobo saw the magnificent sight which he has described mr bruces pool of water may have been formed since and lobo perhaps was content to sit

see johnsons letters from ashbourne in this volume poems prefatory observations to the imitations of the third and tenth satires of juvenal we will not examine here johnsons poetical merits since that discussion will more properly introduce his lives of the poets but merely offer some few biographical remarks in the poem of london mr boswell was of opinion that johnson did not allude to savage under the name of thales and adds for his reason that johnson was not so much as acquainted with savage when he wrote his london about a month however before he published this poem he addressed the following lines to him through the gentlemans magazine for april ad ricardum savage humanani studium generis cui pectore fervet o colat humanum te foveatque genus we cannot certainly infer from this an intimacy with savage but it is more probable that these lines flowed from a feeling of private friendship than mere admiration of an author in a public point of view and they at any rate give credibility to the general opinion that under the name of thales the poet referred to the author of the wanderer who was at this time preparing for his retreat to wales whither he actually went in the ensuing year the names of lydiat vane and sedley which are brought forward in the poem on the vanity of human wishes as examples of inefficiency of either learning or beauty to shield their possessors from distress have exercised inquiry the following is the best account of them we can collect thomas lydiat was born in after passing through the studies of the university of oxford with applause he was elected fellow of new college but his defective utterance induced him to resign his fellowship in order to avoid entering holy orders and to live upon a small patrimony he was highly esteemed by the accomplished and unfortunate prince henry son of james the first but his hopes of provision in that quarter were blasted by that princes premature death and he then accompanied the celebrated usher into ireland after two or three years he returned to england and poverty induced him now to accept the rectory of okerton near banbury which he had before declined here he imprudently became security for the debts of a relation and being unable to pay was imprisoned for several years he was released at last by his patron usher sir w boswell dr pink then warden of new college and archbishop laud to whom he showed his gratitude by writing in defence of his measures of churchgovernment he now applied to charles the first for his protection and encouragement to travel into the east to collect mss but the embarrassed state of the kings affairs prevented his petition from receiving attention lastly his wellknown attachment to the royal cause drew upon him the repeated violence of the parliament troops who plundered imprisoned and abused him in the most cruel manner he died in obscurity and indigence in a stone was laid over his grave in okerton church in by the society of new college who also erected an honorary monument to his memory in the cloisters of their college we have dwelt thus long on lydiats name because when this poem was published it was a subject of inquiry who lydiat was though some of his contemporaries both in england and on the continent ranked him with lord bacon in mathematical and physical knowledge for a more detailed account see chalmers biographical dictionary vol xxi whence the above facts have been extracted and gentlemans magazine vol lxviii galileo and his history are too well known to require a note in this place the vane who told what ills from beauty spring was not lady vane the subject of smolletts memoirs in peregrine pickle but according to mr malone she was anne vane mistress to frederick prince of wales and died in not long before johnson settled in london some account of her was published under the title of the secret history of vanella vo and in other similar works referred to in boswell i in mr boswells tour to the hebrides we find lord hailes objecting to the instances of unfortunate beauties selected by johnson and suggesting in place of vane and sedley the names of shore and valire catherine sedley was daughter of sir charles sedley mistress of king james the second who created her countess of dorchester she was a woman of a sprightly and agreeable wit which could charm without the aid of beauty and longer maintain its power she had been the kings mistress before he ascended the throne and soon after january was created countess of dorchester sir c sedley her father looked on this title as a splendid indignity purchased at the expense of his daughters honour and when he was very active against the king about the time of the revolution he said that in gratitude he should do his utmost to make his majestys daughter a queen as the king had made his own a countess the king continued to visit her which gave great uneasiness to the queen who employed her friends particularly the priests to persuade him to break off the correspondence they remonstrated with him on the guilt of the commerce and the reproach it would bring on the catholic religion she on the contrary employed the whole force of her ridicule against the priests and their counsels they at length prevailed and he is said to have sent her word to retire to france or that her pension of l a year should be withdrawn she then probably repented of having been the royal mistress and cursed the form that pleased the king see manning and brays surrey ii where the countesss issue is also given

garden theatre the winter before said to be a turk prefatory notice to the tragedy of irene the history of this tragedys composition is interesting as affording dates to distinguish johnsons literary progress it was begun and considerably advanced while he kept a school at edial near lichfield in in the following year when he relinquished the task of a schoolmaster so little congenial with his mind and disposition and resolved to seek his fortunes in the metropolis irene was carried along with him as a foundation for his success mr walmsley one of his early friends recommended him and his fellowadventurer garrick to the notice and protection of colson the mathematician unless mrs piozzi is correct in rescuing the character of colson from any identity with that of gelidus in the ramblera johnson entertained no lively recollection of his first patrons kindness he was ever warm in expressions of gratitude for favours conferred on him in his season of want and obscurity and from his deep silence here we may conclude that the recluse mathematician did not evince much sympathy with the distresses of the young candidate for dramatic fame be this however as it may johnson shortly after this introduction took lodgings at greenwich to proceed with his irene in quiet and retirement but soon returned to lichfield to complete it the same year that saw these successive disappointments witnessed also johnsons return to london with his tragedy completed and its rejection by fleetwood the patentee at that time of drury lane theatre twelve years elapsed before it was acted and after many alterations by his pupil and companion garrick who was then manager of the theatre it was by his zeal and the support of the most eminent performers of the day carried through a representation of nine nights johnsons profits after the deduction of expenses and together with the hundred pounds which he received from robert dodsley for the copy were nearly three hundred pounds so fallacious were the hopes cherished by walmsley that johnson would turn out a fine tragedy writerb the tragedy of irene says mr murphy is founded on a passage in knolless history of the turks an author highly commended in the rambler no an incident in the life of mahomet the great first emperor of the turks is the hinge on which the fable is made to move the substance of the story is shortly this in mahomet laid siege to constantinople and having reduced the place became enamoured of a fair greek whose name was irene the sultan invited her to embrace the law of the prophet and to grace his throne enraged at this intended marriage the janizaries formed a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor to avert the impending danger mahomet in a full assembly of the grandees catching with one hand as knolles relates it the fair greek by the hair of her head and drawing his falchion with the other he at one blow struck off her head to the great terror of them all and having so done said unto them now by this judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or notc we are not unjust we conceive in affirming that there is an interest kept alive in the plain and simple narrative of the old historian which is lost in the declamatory tragedy of johnson it is sufficient for our present purpose to confess that he has failed in this his only dramatic attempt we shall endeavour more fully to show how he has failed in our discussion of his powers as a critic that they were not blinded to the defects of others by his own inefficiency in dramatic composition is fully proved by his judicious remarks on cato which was constructed on a plan similar to irene and the strongest censure ever passed on this tragedy was conveyed in garricks application of johnsons own severe but correct critique on the wits of charles in whose works declamation roard while passion sleptd addison speaks the language of poets says johnson in his preface to shakespeare and shakespeare of men we find in cato innumerable beauties which enamour us of its author but we see nothing that acquaints us with human sentiments or human actions we place it with the fairest and the noblest progeny which judgment propagates by conjunction with learning but othello is the vigorous and vivacious offspring of observation impregnated by genius cato affords a splendid exhibition of artificial and fictitious manners and delivers just and noble sentiments in diction easy elevated and harmonious but its hopes and fears communicate no vibration to the heart the composition refers us only to the writer we pronounce the name of cato but we think on addison the critics remarks on the same tragedy in his life of addison are as applicable as the above to his own production cato is rather a poem in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a representation of natural affections or of any state probable or possible in human life nothing here excites or assuages emotion here is no magical power of raising phantastick terrour or wild anxiety the events are expected without solicitude and are remembered without joy or sorrow of the agents we have no care we consider not what they are doing or what they are suffering we wish only to know what they have to say but while we thus pronounce johnsons failure in the production of dramatic effect we will not withhold our tribute of admiration from irene as a moral piece for although a remark of foxs on an unpublished tragedy of burkes that it was rather rhetorical than poetical may be applied to the work under consideration still it abounds throughout with the most elevated and dignified lessons of morality and virtue the address of demetrius to the aged cali on the dangers of procrastinatione aspasias reprobation of irenes meditated apostasyf and the allusive panegyric on the british constitutiong may be enumerated as examples of its excellence in sentiment and diction lastly we may consider irene as one other illustrious proof that the most strict adherence to the farfamed unities the most harmonious versification and the most correct philosophy will not vie with a single and simple touch of nature expressed in simple and artless language but how rich in reputation must that author be who can spare an irene and not feel the loss h footnotes a rambler no and note b boswells

english author his reply was in the genuine spirit of an old scholar he would never consent to disgrace the walls of westminster abbey with an english inscription one of his arguments in favour of a common learned language was ludicrously cogent consider sir how you should feel were you to find at rotterdam an epitaph upon erasmus in dutch boswell iii he would however undoubtedly have written a better epitaph in english than in latin his compositions in that language are not of first rate excellence either in prose or verse the epitaph in stretham church on mr thrale abounds with

numerical computations that are the subject of them his work has been accordingly consulted the title of which is a new survey of the globe and which professes to give an accurate mensuration of all the empires kingdoms and other divisions thereof in the square miles that they respectively contain on comparison of the several numbers in these verses with those set down by templeman it appears that nearly half of them are precisely the same the rest are not quite so exactly done for the convenience of the reader it has been thought right to subjoin each number as it stands in templemans works to that in dr johnsons verses which refers to it b in this first article that is versified there is an accurate conformity in dr johnsons number to templemans who sets down the square miles of palestine at c the square miles of egypt are in templeman d the whole turkish empire in templeman is computed at square miles e in the four following articles the numbers in templeman and in johnsons verses are alike we find accordingly the morea in templeman to be set down at square miles arabia at persia at and naples at f sicily in templeman is put down at g the popes dominions at h tuscany at i genoa in templeman as in johnson likewise is set down at j lucca at k the russian empire in the th plate of templeman is set down at square miles l sardinia in templeman as likewise in johnson m the

cultum contempsit agelli et petiit terras per freta longa novas the history of rasselas prince of abissinia prefatory observations the following incomparable tale was published in and the early familiarity with eastern manners which johnson derived from his translation of father lobos travels into abissinia may be presumed to have led him to fix his opening scene in that country while rassela christos the general of sultan sequed mentioned in that work may have suggested the name of his speculative prince rasselas was written in the evenings of a single week and sent to the press in portions with the amiable view of defraying the funeral expenses of the authors aged mother and discharging her few remaining debts the sum however which he received for it does not seem large to those who know its subsequent popularity none of his works has been more widely circulated and the admiration which it has attracted in almost every country of europe proves that with all its depression and sadness it does utter a voice that meets with an assenting answer in the hearts of all who have tried life and found its emptiness johnsons view of our lot on earth was always gloomy and the circumstances under which rasselas was composed were calculated to add a deepened tinge of melancholy to its speculations on human folly misery or malignity many of the subjects discussed are known to have been those which had agitated johnsons mind among them is the question whether the departed ever revisit the places that knew them on earth and how far they may take an interest in the welfare of those over whom they watched when here we shall elsewhere have to contemplate the moralist standing on the border of his mothers grave and asking with anxious agony whether that dark bourn once passed terminated for ever the cares of maternity and lovea the frivolous and the proud who think not or acknowledge not that there are secrets in both matter and mind of which their philosophy has not dreamed may smile at what they may in their derision term such weak and idle inquiries but on them the most powerful minds that ever illuminated this world have fastened with an intense curiosity and owning their fears or their ignorance have not dared to disavow their beliefb it is not to be denied that rasselas displays life as one unvaried series of disappointments and leaves the mind at its close in painful depression this effect has been considered an evil and regarded even as similar to that produced by the doctrines of voltaire bolingbroke and rousseau who combined every thing venerable on earth with ridicule treated virtue and vice with equal contemptuous indifference and laid bare with cruel mockery the vanity of all mortal wishes prospects and pursuits their motive for all this we need not pause in this place to examine but a distinction may be made between the melancholy of the heart and the melancholy of the mind while the latter is sceptical sour and misanthropic the former is passionate tender and religious those who are under the influence of the one become inactive morose or heedless detecting the follies of the wisest and the frailties of the best they scoff at the very name of virtue they spurn as visionary and weak every attempt to meliorate mans condition and from their conviction of the earthward tendency of his mind they bound his destinies by this narrow world and its concerns but those whose hearts are penetrated with a feeling for human infirmity and sorrow are benevolent and active considering man as the victim of sin and woe and death for a cause which reason cannot unfold but which religion promises to terminate they sooth the shortlived disappointments of life by pointing to a loftier and more lasting state candide is the book of the one party rasselas of the other they appeared nearly together they exhibit the same picture of change and misery and crime but the one demoralized a continent and gave birth to lust and rapine and bloodshed the other has blessed many a heart and gladdened the vale of sorrow with many a rill of pure and living water voltaire may be likened to the venomous toad of eastern allegory which extracts a deadly poison from that sunbeam which bears health and light and life to all beside the philosopher in rasselas like some holy and aged man who has well nigh run his course in recounting the toils and perils of his pilgrimage may sadden the young heart and crush the fond hopes of inexperience but while he wounds he presents the antidote and the balm and tells where promises will be realized and hopes will no more be disappointed we have ventured to detain our readers thus long from rasselas itself because from its similar view of life with the sceptical school many wellintentioned men have apprehended its effects might be the same we have therefore attempted briefly to distinguish the sources whence these different writings have issued and we trust we have pointed out their remoteness from each other and we do not dwell on the subject at greater length because johnsons writings in various parts will require our attention on this particular head to be restless and weary of the dull details and incomplete enjoyments of life is common to all lofty minds frederick of prussia sought in the bosom of a cold philosophy to chill every generous impulse and each warm aspiration after immortality but he painfully felt how inefficient was grandeur or power to fill the heart and plaintively exclaimed to maupertuis que notre vie est peu de chose all is vanity the philosophy of rasselas however though it pronounces on the unsatisfactory nature of all human enjoyments and though its perusal may check the worldling in his mirth and bring down the mighty in his pride does not with the philosophic conqueror sullenly despair but gently sooths the mourner by the prospect of a final recompense and repose its pages inculcate the same lesson as those of the rambler but the precept which is tedious in a formal essay may acquire attractions in a tale and the sober charms of truth be divested of their austerity by the graces of innocent fictionc we may observe in conclusion that the abrupt termination of rasselas so left according to sir john hawkins by its author to admit of continuation and its unbroken gloom induced miss e cornelia knight to

credulity to the whispers of fancy and pursue with eagerness the phantoms of hope who expect that age will perform the promises of youth and that the deficiencies of the present day will be supplied by the morrow attend to the history of rasselas prince of abissinia rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty emperour in whose dominions the father of waters begins his course whose bounty pours down the streams of plenty and scatters over half the world the harvests of egypt according to the custom which has descended from age to age among the monarchs of the torrid zone rasselas was confined in a private palace with the other sons and daughters of abissinian royalty till the order of succession should call him to the throne the place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the residence of the abissinan princes was a spacious valley in the kingdom of amhara surrounded on every side by mountains of which the summits overhang the middle part the only passage by which it could be entered was a cavern that passed under a rock of which it has been long disputed whether it was the work of nature or of human industry the outlet of the cavern was concealed by a thick wood and the mouth which opened into the valley was closed with gates of iron forged by the artificers of ancient days so massy that no man could without the help of engines open or shut them from the mountains on every side rivulets descended that filled all the valley with verdure and fertility and formed a lake in the middle inhabited by fish of every species and frequented by every fowl whom nature has taught to dip the wing in water this lake discharged its superfluities by a stream which entered a dark cleft of the mountain on the northern side and fell with dreadful noise from precipice to precipice till it was heard no more the sides of the mountains were covered with trees the banks of the brooks were diversified with flowers every blast shook spices from the rocks and every month dropped fruits upon the ground all animals that bite the grass or browse the shrub whether wild or tame wandered in this extensive circuit secured from beasts of prey by the mountains which confined them on one part were flocks and herds feeding in the pastures on another all the beasts of chase frisking in the lawns the sprightly kid was bounding on the rocks the subtle monkey frolicking in the trees and the solemn elephant reposing in the shade all the diversities of the world were brought together the blessings of nature were collected and its evils extracted and excluded the valley wide and fruitful supplied its inhabitants with the necessaries of life and all delights and superfluities were added at the annual visit which the emperour paid his children when the iron gate was opened to the sound of musick and during eight days every one that resided in the valley was required to propose whatever might contribute to make seclusion pleasant to fill up the vacancies of attention and lessen the tediousness of time every desire was immediately granted all the artificers of pleasure were called to gladden the festivity the musicians exerted the power of harmony and the dancers showed their activity before the princes in hope that they should pass their lives in this blissful captivity to which those only were admitted whose performance was thought able to add novelty to luxury such was the appearance of security and delight which this retirement afforded that they to whom it was new always desired that it might be perpetual and as those on whom the iron gate had once closed were never suffered to return the effect of long experience could not be known thus every year produced new schemes of delight and new competitors for imprisonment the palace stood on an eminence raised about thirty paces above the surface of the lake it was divided into many squares or courts built with greater or less magnificence according to the rank of those for whom they were designed the roofs were turned into arches of massy stone joined by a cement that grew harder by time and the building stood from century to century deriding the solstitial rains and equinoctial hurricanes without need of reparation this house which was so large as to be fully known to none but some ancient officers who successively inherited the secrets of the place was built as if suspicion herself had dictated the plan to every room there was an open and secret passage every square had a communication with the rest either from the upper stories by private galleries or by subterranean passages from the lower apartments many of the columns had unsuspected cavities in which a long race of monarchs had reposited their treasures they then closed up the opening with marble which was never to be removed but in the utmost exigencies of the kingdom and recorded their accumulations in a book which was itself concealed in a tower not entered but by the emperour attended by the prince who stood next in succession chap ii the discontent op rasselas in the happy valley here the sons and daughters of abissinia lived only to know the soft vicissitudes of pleasure and repose attended by all that were skilful to delight and gratified with whatever the senses can enjoy they wandered in gardens of fragrance and slept in the fortresses of security every art was practised to make them pleased with their own condition the sages who instructed them told them of nothing but the miseries of publick life and described all beyond the mountains as regions of calamity where discord was always raging and where man preyed upon man to heighten their opinion of their own felicity they were daily entertained with songs the subject of which was the happy valley their appetites were excited by frequent enumerations of different enjoyments and revelry and merriment was the business of every hour from the dawn of morning to the close of even these methods were generally successful few of the princes had ever wished to enlarge their bounds but passed their lives in full conviction that they had all within their reach that art or nature could bestow and pitied those whom fate had excluded from this seat of tranquillity as the sport of chance and the slaves of misery thus they rose in the morning and lay down at night pleased with each other and with themselves all but rasselas who in the twentysixth year of his age began to withdraw himself from their pastimes and assemblies and to delight in solitary walks and silent meditation he often sat before tables covered with luxury and forgot to taste the dainties that were placed before him he rose abruptly in the midst of the song and hastily retired beyond the sound of musick his attendants observed the change and endeavoured to renew his love of pleasure he neglected their officiousness repulsed their invitations and spent day after day on the banks of rivulets sheltered with trees where he sometimes listened to the birds in the branches sometimes observed the fish playing in the stream and anon cast his eyes upon the pastures and mountains filled with animals of which some were biting the herbage and some sleeping among the bushes this singularity of his humour made him much observed one of the sages in whose conversation he had formerly delighted followed him secretly in hope of discovering the cause of his disquiet rasselas who knew not that any one was near him having for some time fixed his eyes upon the goats that were browsing among the rocks began to compare their condition with his own what said he makes the difference between man and all the rest of the animal creation every beast that strays beside me has the same corporal necessities with myself he is hungry and crops the grass he is thirsty and drinks the stream his thirst and hunger are appeased he is satisfied and sleeps he rises again and is hungry he is again fed and is at rest i am hungry and thirsty like him but when thirst and hunger cease i am not at rest i am like him pained with want but am not like him satisfied with fulness the intermediate hours are tedious and gloomy i long again to be hungry that i may again quicken my attention the birds peck the berries or the corn and fly away to the groves where they sit in seeming happiness on the branches and waste their lives in tuning one unvaried series of sounds i likewise can call the lutanist and the singer but the sounds that pleased me yesterday weary me today and will grow yet more wearisome tomorrow i can discover within me no power of perception which is not glutted with its proper pleasure yet i do not feel myself delighted man surely has some latent sense for which this place affords no gratification or he has some desires distinct from sense which must be satisfied before he can be happy after this he lifted up his head and seeing the moon rising walked towards the palace as he passed through the fields and saw the animals around him ye said he are happy and need not envy me that walk thus among you burdened with myself nor do i ye gentle beings envy your felicity for it is not the felicity of man i have many distresses from which ye are free i fear pain when i do not feel it i sometimes shrink at evils recollected and sometimes start at evils anticipated surely the equity of providence has balanced peculiar sufferings with peculiar enjoyments with observations like these the prince amused himself as he returned uttering them with a plaintive voice yet with a look that discovered him to feel some complacence in his own perspicacity and to receive some solace of the miseries of life from consciousness of the delicacy with which he felt and the eloquence with which he bewailed them he mingled cheerfully in the diversions of the evening and all rejoiced to find that his heart was lightened chap iii the wants of him that wants nothing on the next day his old instructor imagining that he had now made himself acquainted with his disease of mind was in hope of curing it by counsel and officiously sought an opportunity of conference which the prince having long considered him as one whose intellects were exhausted was not very willing to afford why said he does this man thus obtrude upon me shall i be never suffered to forget those lectures which pleased only while they were new and to become new again must be forgotten he then walked into the wood and composed himself to his usual meditations when before his thoughts had taken any settled form he perceived his pursuer at his side and was at first prompted by his impatience to go hastily away but being unwilling to offend a man whom he had once reverenced and still loved he invited him to sit down with him on the bank the old man thus encouraged began to lament the change which had been lately observed in the prince and to inquire why he so often retired from the pleasures of the palace to loneliness and silence i fly from pleasure said the prince because pleasure has ceased to please i am lonely because i am miserable and am unwilling to cloud with my presence the happiness of others you sir said the sage are the first who has complained of misery in the happy valley i hope to convince you that your complaints have no real cause you are here in full possession of all that the emperour of abissinia can bestow here is neither labour to be endured nor danger to be dreaded yet here is all that labour or danger can procure or purchase look round and tell me which of your wants is without supply if you want nothing how are you unhappy that i want nothing said the prince or that i know not what i want is the cause of my complaint if i had any known want i should have a certain wish that wish would excite endeavour and i should not then repine to see the sun move so slowly towards the western mountain or lament when the day breaks and sleep will no longer hide me from myself when i see the kids and the lambs chasing one another i fancy that i should be happy if i had something to pursue but possessing all that i can want i find one day and one hour exactly like another except that the latter is still more tedious than the former let your experience inform me how the day may now seem as short as in my childhood while nature was yet fresh and every moment showed me what i never had observed before i have already enjoyed too much give me something to desire the old man was surprised at this new species of affliction and knew not what to reply yet was unwilling to be silent sir said he if you had seen the miseries of the world you would know how to value your present state now said the prince you have given me something to desire i shall long to see the miseries of the world since the sight of them is necessary to happiness chap iv the prince continues to grieve and muse at this time the sound of musick proclaimed the hour of repast and the conversation was concluded the old man went away sufficiently discontented to find that his reasonings had produced the only conclusion which they were intended to prevent but in the decline of life shame and grief are of short duration whether it be that we bear easily what we have borne long or that finding ourselves in age less regarded we less regard others or that we look with slight regard upon afflictions to which we know that the hand of death is about to put an end the prince whose views were extended to a wider space could not speedily quiet his emotions he had been before terrified at the length of life which nature promised him because he considered that in a long time much must be endured he now rejoiced in his youth because in many years much might be done this first beam of hope that had been ever darted into his mind rekindled youth in his cheeks and doubled the lustre of his eyes he was fired with the desire of doing something though he knew not yet with distinctness either end or means he was now no longer gloomy and unsocial but considering himself as master of a secret stock of happiness which he could enjoy only by concealing it he affected to be busy in all schemes of diversion and endeavoured to make others pleased with the state of which he himself was weary but pleasures never can be so multiplied or continued as not to leave much of life unemployed there were many hours both of the night and day which he could spend without suspicion in solitary thought the load of life was much lightened he went eagerly into the assemblies because he supposed the frequency of his presence necessary to the success of his purposes he retired gladly to privacy because he had now a subject of thought his chief amusement was to picture to himself that world which he had never seen to place himself in various conditions to be entangled in imaginary difficulties and to be engaged in wild adventures but his benevolence always terminated his projects in the relief of distress the detection of fraud the defeat of oppression and the diffusion of happiness thus passed twenty months of the life of rasselas he busied himself so intensely in visionary bustle that he forgot his real solitude and amidst hourly preparations for the various incidents of human affairs neglected to consider by what means he should mingle with mankind one day as he was sitting on a bank he feigned to himself an orphan virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover and crying after him for restitution and redress so strongly was the image impressed upon his mind that he started up in the maids defence and ran forward to seize the plunderer with all the eagerness of real pursuit fear naturally quickens the flight of guilt rasselas could not catch the fugitive with his utmost efforts but resolving to weary by perseverance him whom he could not surpass in speed he pressed on till the foot of the mountain stopped his course here he recollected himself and smiled at his own useless impetuosity then raising his eyes to the mountain this said he is the fatal obstacle that hinders at once the enjoyment of pleasure and the exercise of virtue how long is it that my hopes and wishes have flown beyond this boundary of my life which yet i never have attempted to surmount struck with this reflection he sat down to muse and remembered that since he first resolved to escape from his confinement the sun had passed twice over him in his annual course he now felt a degree of regret with which he had never been before acquainted he considered how much might have been done in the time which had passed and left nothing real behind it he compared twenty months with the life of man in life said he is not to be counted the ignorance of infancy or imbecility of age we are long before we are able to think and we soon cease from the power of acting the true period of human existence may be reasonably estimated at forty years of which i have mused away the four and twentieth part what i have lost was certain for i have certainly possessed it but of twenty months to come who can assure me the consciousness of his own folly pierced him deeply and he was long before he could be reconciled to himself the rest of my time said he has been lost by the crime or folly of my ancestors and the absurd institutions of my country i remember it with disgust yet without remorse but the months that have passed since new light darted into my soul since i formed a scheme of reasonable felicity have been squandered by my own fault i have lost that which can never be restored i have seen the sun rise and set for twenty months an idle gazer on the light of heaven in this time the birds have left the nest of their mother and committed themselves to the woods and to the skies the kid has forsaken the teat and learned by degrees to climb the rocks in quest of independent sustenance i only have made no advances but am still helpless and ignorant the moon by more than twenty changes admonished me of the flux of life the stream that rolled before my feet upbraided my inactivity i sat feasting on intellectual luxury regardless alike of the examples of the earth and the instructions of the planets twenty months are passed who shall restore them these sorrowful meditations fastened upon his mind he passed four months in resolving to lose no more time in idle resolves and was awakened to more vigorous exertion by hearing a maid who had broken a porcelain cup remark that what cannot be repaired is not to be regretted this was obvious and rasselas reproached himself that he had not discovered it having not known or not considered how many useful hints are obtained by chance and how often the mind hurried by her own ardour to distant views neglects the truths that lie open before her he for a few hours regretted his regret and from that time bent his whole mind upon the means of escaping from the valley of happiness chap v the prince meditates his escape he now found that it would be very difficult to effect that which it was very easy to suppose effected when he looked round about him he saw himself confined by the bars of nature which had never yet been broken and by the gate through which none that once had passed it were ever able to return he was now impatient as an eagle in a grate he passed week after week in clambering the mountains to see if there was any aperture which the bushes might conceal but found all the summits inaccessible by their prominence the iron gate he despaired to open for it was not only secured with all the power of art but was always watched by successive sentinels and was by its position exposed to the perpetual observation of all the inhabitants he then examined the cavern through which the waters of the lake were discharged and looking down at a time when the sun shone strongly upon its mouth he discovered it to be full of broken rocks which though they permitted the stream to flow through many narrow passages would stop any body of solid bulk he returned discouraged and dejected but having now known the blessing of hope resolved never to despair in these fruitless searches he spent ten months the time however passed cheerfully away in the morning he rose with new hope in the evening applauded his own diligence and in the night slept sound after his fatigue he met a thousand amusements which beguiled his labour and diversified his thoughts he discerned the various instincts of animals and properties of plants and found the place replete with wonders of which he purposed to solace himself with the contemplation if he should never be able to accomplish his flight rejoicing that his endeavours though yet unsuccessful had supplied him with a source of inexhaustible inquiry but his original curiosity was not yet abated he resolved to obtain some knowledge of the ways of men his wish still continued but his hope grew less he ceased to survey any longer the walls of his prison and spared to search by new toils for interstices which he knew could not be found yet determined to keep his design always in view and lay hold on any expedient that time should offer chap vi a dissertation on the art of flying among the artists that had been allured into the happy valley to labour for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitants was a man eminent for his knowledge of the mechanick powers who had contrived many engines both of use and recreation by a wheel which the stream turned he forced the water into a tower whence it was distributed to all the apartments of the palace he erected a pavilion in the garden around which he kept the air always cool by artificial showers one of the groves appropriated to the ladies was ventilated by fans to which the rivulet that ran through it gave a constant motion and instruments of soft musick were placed at proper distances of which some played by the impulse of the wind and some by the power of the stream this artist was sometimes visited by rasselas who was pleased with every kind of knowledge imagining that the time would come when all his acquisitions should be of use to him in the open world he came one day to amuse himself in his usual manner and found the master busy in building a sailing chariot he saw that the design was practicable upon a level surface and with expressions of great esteem solicited its completion the workman was pleased to find himself so much regarded by the prince and resolved to gain yet higher honours sir said he you have seen but a small part of what the mechanick sciences can perform i have been long of opinion that instead of the tardy conveyance of ships and chariots man might use the swifter migration of wings that the fields of air are open to knowledge and that only ignorance and idleness need crawl upon the ground this hint rekindled the princes desire of passing the mountains having seen what the mechanist had already performed he was willing to fancy that he could do more yet resolved to inquire further before he suffered hope to afflict him by disappointment i am afraid said he to the artist that your imagination prevails over your skill and that you now tell me rather what you wish than what you know every animal has his element assigned him the birds have the air and man and beasts the earth so replied the mechanist fishes have the water in which yet beasts can swim by nature and men by art he that can swim needs not despair to fly to swim is to fly in a grosser fluid and to fly is to swim in a subtler we are only to proportion our power of resistance to the different density of matter through which we are to pass you will be necessarily upborne by the air if you can renew any impulse upon it faster than the air can recede from the pressure but the exercise of swimming said the prince is very laborious the strongest limbs are soon wearied i am afraid the act of flying will be yet more violent and wings will be of no great use unless we can fly further than we can swim the labour of rising from the ground said the artist will be great as we see it in the heavier domestick fowls but as we mount higher the earths attraction and the bodys gravity will be gradually diminished till we shall arrive at a region where the man will float in the air without any tendency to fall no care will then be necessary but to move forwards which the gentlest impulse will effect you sir whose curiosity is so extensive will easily conceive with what pleasure a philosopher furnished with wings and hovering in the sky would see the earth and all its inhabitants rolling beneath him and presenting to him successively by its diurnal motion all the countries within the same parallel how must it amuse the pendent spectator to see the moving scene of land and ocean cities and deserts to survey with equal security the marts of trade and the fields of battle mountains infested by barbarians and fruitful regions gladdened by plenty and lulled by peace how easily shall we then trace the nile through all its passage pass over to distant regions and examine the face of nature from one extremity of the earth to the other all this said the prince is much to be desired but i am afraid that no man will be able to breathe in these regions of speculation and tranquillity i have been told that respiration is difficult upon lofty mountains yet from these precipices though so high as to produce great tenuity of air it is very easy to fall therefore i suspect that from any height where life can be supported there may be danger of too quick descent nothing replied the artist will ever be attempted if all possible objections must be first overcome if you will favour my project i will try the first flight at my own hazard i have considered the structure of all volant animals and find the folding continuity of the bats wings most easily accommodated to the human form upon this model i shall begin my task tomorrow and in a year expect to tower into the air beyond the malice and pursuit of man but i will work only on this condition that the art shall not be divulged and that you shall not require me to make wings for any but ourselves why said rasselas should you envy others so great an advantage all skill ought to be exerted for universal good every man has owed much to others and ought to repay the kindness that he has received if men were all virtuous returned the artist i should with great alacrity teach them all to fly but what would be the security of the good if the bad could at pleasure invade them from the sky against an army sailing through the clouds neither walls nor mountains nor seas could afford any security a flight of northern savages might hover in the wind and light at once with irresistible violence upon the capital of a fruitful region that was rolling under them even this valley the retreat of princes the abode of happiness might be violated by the sudden descent of some of the naked nations that swarm on the coast of the southern sea the prince promised secrecy and waited for the performance not wholly hopeless of success he visited the work from time to time observed its progress and remarked many ingenious contrivances to facilitate motion and unite levity with strength the artist was every day more certain that he should leave vultures and eagles behind him and the contagion of his confidence seized upon the prince in a year the wings were finished and on a morning appointed the maker appeared furnished for flight on a little promontory he waved his pinions awhile to gather air then leaped from his stand and in an instant dropped into the lake his wings which were of no use in the air sustained him in the water and the prince drew him to land half dead with terrour and vexationa a see rambler no and note chap vii the prince finds a man of learning the prince was not much afflicted by this disaster having suffered himself to hope for a happier event only because he had no other means of escape in view he still persisted in his design to leave the happy valley by the first opportunity his imagination was now at a stand he had no prospect of entering into the world and notwithstanding all his endeavours to support himself discontent by degrees preyed upon him and he began again to lose his thoughts in sadness when the rainy season which in these countries is periodical made it inconvenient to wander in the woods the rain continued longer and with more violence than had been ever known the clouds broke on the surrounding mountains and the torrents streamed into the plain on every side till the cavern was too narrow to discharge the water the lake overflowed its banks and all the level of the valley was covered with the inundation the eminence on which the palace was built and some other spots of rising ground were all that the eye could now discover the herds and flocks left the pastures and both the wild beasts and the tame retreated to the mountains this inundation confined all the princes to domestick amusements and the attention of rasselas was particularly seized by a poem which imlac rehearsed upon the various conditions of humanity he commanded the poet to attend him in his apartment and recite his verses a second time then entering into familiar talk he thought himself happy in having found a man who knew the world so well and could so skilfully paint the scenes of life he asked a thousand questions about things to which though common to all other mortals his confinement from childhood had kept him a stranger the poet pitied his ignorance and loved his curiosity and entertained him from day to day with novelty and instruction so that the prince regretted the necessity of sleep and longed till the morning should renew his pleasure as they were sitting together the prince commanded imlac to relate his history and to tell by what accident he was forced or by what motive induced to close his life in the happy valley as he was going to begin his narrative rasselas was called to a concert and obliged to restrain his curiosity till the evening chap viii the history of imlac the close of the day is in the regions of the torrid zone the only season of diversion and entertainment and it was therefore midnight before the musick ceased and the princesses retired rasselas then called for his companion and required him to begin the story of his life sir said imlac my history will not be long the life that is devoted to knowledge passes silently away and is very little diversified by events to talk in publick to think in solitude to read and hear to inquire and answer inquiries is the business of a scholar he wanders about the world without pomp or terrour and is neither known nor valued but by men like himself i was born in the kingdom of goiama at no great distance from the fountain of the nile my father was a wealthy merchant who traded between the inland countries of africk and the ports of the red sea he was honest frugal and diligent but of mean sentiments and narrow comprehension he desired only to be rich and to conceal his riches lest he should be spoiled by the governours of the province surely said the prince my father must be negligent of his charge if any man in his dominions dares take that which belongs to another does he not know that kings are accountable for injustice permitted as well as done if i were emperour not the meanest of my subjects should be oppressed with impunity my blood boils when i am told that a merchant durst not enjoy his honest gains for fear of losing them by the rapacity of power name the governour who robbed the people that i may declare his crimes to the emperour sir said imlac your ardour is the natural effect of virtue animated by youth the time will come when you will acquit your father and perhaps hear with less impatience of the governour oppression is in the abissinian dominions neither frequent nor tolerated but no form of government has been yet discovered by which cruelty can be wholly prevented subordination supposes power on one part and subjection on the other and if power be in the hands of men it will sometimes be abused the vigilance of the supreme magistrate may do much but much will still remain undone he can never know all the crimes that are committed and can seldom punish all that he knows this said the prince i do not understand but i had rather hear thee than dispute continue thy narration my father proceeded imlac originally intended that i should have no other education than such as might qualify me for commerce and discovering in me great strength of memory and quickness of apprehension often declared his hope that i should be some time the richest man in abissinia why said the prince did thy father desire the increase of his wealth when it was already greater than he durst discover or enjoy i am unwilling to doubt thy veracity yet inconsistencies cannot both be true inconsistencies answered imlac cannot both be right but imputed to man they may both be true yet diversity is not inconsistency my father might expect a time of greater security however some desire is necessary to keep life in motion and he whose real wants are supplied must admit those of fancy this said the prince i can in some measure conceive i repent that i interrupted thee with this hope proceeded imlac he sent me to school but when i had once found the delight of knowledge and felt the pleasure of intelligence and the pride of invention i began silently to despise riches and determined to disappoint the purpose of my father whose grossness of conception raised my pity i was twenty years old before his tenderness would expose me to the fatigue of travel in which time i had been instructed by successive masters in all the literature of my native country as every hour taught me something new i lived in a continual course of gratifications but as i advanced towards manhood i lost much of the reverence with which i had been used to look on my instructers because when the lesson was ended i did not find them wiser or better than common men at length my father resolved to initiate me in commerce and opening one of his subterranean treasuries counted out ten thousand pieces of gold this young man said he is the stock with which you must negotiate i began with less than the fifth part and you see how diligence and parsimony have increased it this is your own to waste or to improve if you squander it by negligence or caprice you must wait for my death before you will be rich if in four years you double your stock we will thenceforward let subordination cease and live together as friends and partners for he shall always be equal with me who is equally skilled in the art of growing rich we laid our money upon camels concealed in bales of cheap goods and travelled to the shore of the red sea when i cast my eye on the expanse of waters my heart bounded like that of a prisoner escaped i felt an unextinguishable curiosity kindle in my mind and resolved to snatch this opportunity of seeing the manners of other nations and of learning sciences unknown in abissinia i remembered that my father had obliged me to the improvement of my stock not by a promise which i ought not to violate but by a penalty which i was at liberty to incur and therefore determined to gratify my predominant desire and by drinking at the fountains of knowledge to quench the thirst of curiosity as i was supposed to trade without connexion with my father it was easy for me to become acquainted with the master of a ship and procure a passage to some other country i had no motives of choice to regulate my voyage it was sufficient for me that wherever i wandered i should see a country which i had not seen before i therefore entered a ship bound for surat having left a letter for my father declaring my intention chap ix the history of imlac continued when i first entered upon the world of waters and lost sight of land i looked round about me with pleasing terrour and thinking my soul enlarged by the boundless prospect imagined that i could gaze round for ever without satiety but in a short time i grew weary of looking on barren uniformity where i could only see again what i had already seen i then descended into the ship and doubted for awhile whether all my future pleasures would not end like this in disgust and disappointment yet surely said i the ocean and the land are very different the only variety of water is rest and motion but the earth has mountains and valleys deserts and cities it is inhabited by men of different customs and contrary opinions and i may hope to find variety in life though i should miss it in nature with this thought i quieted my mind and amused myself during the voyage sometimes by learning from the sailors the art of navigation which i have never practised and sometimes by forming schemes for my conduct in different situations in not one of which i have been ever placed i was almost weary of my naval amusements when we landed safely at surat i secured my money and purchasing some commodities for show joined myself to a caravan that was passing into the inland country my companions for some reason or other conjecturing that i was rich and by my inquiries and admiration finding that i was ignorant considered me as a novice whom they had a right to cheat and who was to learn at the usual expense the art of fraud they exposed me to the theft of servants and the exaction of officers and saw me plundered upon false pretences without any advantage to themselves but that of rejoicing in the superiority of their own knowledge stop a moment said the prince is there such depravity in man as that he should injure another without benefit to himself i can easily conceive that all are pleased with superiority but your ignorance was merely accidental which being neither your crime nor your folly could afford them no reason to applaud themselves and the knowledge which they had and which you wanted they might as effectually have shown by warning as betraying you pride said imlac is seldom delicate it will please itself with very mean advantages and envy feels not its own happiness but when it may be compared with the misery of others they were my enemies because they grieved to think me rich and my oppressors because they delighted to find me weak proceed said the prince i do not doubt of the facts which you relate but imagine that you impute them to mistaken motives in this company said imlac i arrived at agra the capital of indostan the city in which the great mogul commonly resides i applied myself to the language of the country and in a few months was able to converse with the learned men some of whom i found morose and reserved and others easy and communicative some were unwilling to teach another what they had with difficulty learned themselves and some showed that the end of their studies was to gain the dignity of instructing to the tutor of the young princes i recommended myself so much that i was presented to the emperour as a man of uncommon knowledge the emperour asked me many questions concerning my country and my travels and though i cannot now recollect any thing that he uttered above the power of a common man he dismissed me astonished at his wisdom and enamoured of his goodness my credit was now so high that the merchants with whom i had travelled applied to me for recommendations to the ladies of the court i was surprised at their confidence of solicitation and gently reproached them with their practices on the road they heard me with cold indifference and showed no tokens of shame or sorrow they then urged their request with the offer of a bribe but what i would not do for kindness i would not do for money and refused them not because they had injured me but because i would not enable them to injure others for i knew they would have made use of my credit to cheat those who should buy their wares having resided at agra till there was no more to be learned i travelled into persia where i saw many remains of ancient magnificence and observed many new accommodations of life the persians are a nation eminently social and their assemblies afforded me daily opportunities of remarking characters and manners and of tracing human nature through all its variations from persia i passed into arabia where i saw a nation at once pastoral and warlike who live without any settled habitation whose only wealth is their flocks and herds and who have yet carried on through all ages an hereditary war with all mankind though they neither covet nor envy their possessions chap x imlacs history continued a dissertation upon poetry wherever i went i found that poetry was considered as the highest learning and regarded with a veneration somewhat approaching to that which man would pay to the angelick nature and yet it fills me with wonder that in almost all countries the most ancient poets are considered as the best whether it be that every other kind of knowledge is an acquisition gradually attained and poetry is a gift conferred at once or that the first poetry of every nation surprised them as a novelty and retained the credit by consent which it received by accident at first or whether as the province of poetry is to describe nature and passion which are always the same the first writers took possession of the most striking objects for description and the most probable occurrences for fiction and left nothing to those that followed them but transcription of the same events and new combinations of the same images whatever be the reason it is commonly observed that the early writers are in possession of nature and their followers of art that the first excel in strength and invention and the latter in elegance and refinement i was desirous to add my name to this illustrious fraternity i read all the poets of persia and arabia and was able to repeat by memory the volumes that are suspended in the mosque of mecca but i soon found that no man was ever great by imitation my desire of excellence impelled me to transfer my attention to nature and to life nature was to be my subject and men to be my auditors i could never describe what i had not seen i could not hope to move those with delight or terrour whose interest and opinions i did not understand being now resolved to be a poet i saw every thing with a new purpose my sphere of attention was suddenly magnified no kind of knowledge was to be overlooked i ranged mountains and deserts for images and resemblances and pictured upon my mind every tree of the forest and flower of the valley i observed with equal care the crags of the rock and the pinnacles of the palace sometimes i wandered along the mazes of the rivulet and sometimes watched the changes of the summer clouds to a poet nothing can be useless whatever is beautiful and whatever is dreadful must be familiar to his imagination he must be conversant with all that is awfully vast or elegantly little the plants of the garden the animals of the wood the minerals of the earth and meteors of the sky must all concur to store his mind with inexhaustible variety for every idea is useful for the enforcement or decoration of moral or religious truth and he who knows most will have most power of diversifying his scenes and of gratifying his reader with remote allusions and unexpected instruction all the appearances of nature i was therefore careful to study and every country which i have surveyed has contributed something to my poetical powers in so wide a survey said the prince you must surely have left much unobserved i have lived till now within the circuit of these mountains and yet cannot walk abroad without the sight of something which i had never beheld before or never heeded the business of a poet said imlac is to examine not the individual but the species to remark general properties and large appearances he does not number the streaks of the tulip or describe the different shades in the verdure of the forest he is to exhibit in his portraits of nature such prominent and striking features as recall the original to every mind and must neglect the minuter discriminations which one may have remarked and another have neglected for those characteristicks which are alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness but the knowledge of nature is only half the task of a poet he must be acquainted likewise with all the modes of life his character requires that he estimate the happiness and misery of every condition observe the power of all the passions in all their combinations and trace the changes of the human mind as they are modified by various institutions and accidental influences of climate or custom from the sprightliness of infancy to the despondence of decrepitude he must divest himself of the prejudices of his age or country he must consider right and wrong in their abstracted and invariable state he must disregard present laws and opinions and rise to general and transcendental truths which will always be the same he must therefore content himself with the slow progress of his name contemn the applause of his own time and commit his claims to the justice of posterity he must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind and consider himself as presiding over the thoughts and manners of future generations as a being superiour to time and place his labour is not yet at an end he must know many languages and many sciences and that his style may be worthy of his thoughts must by incessant practice familiarize to himself every delicacy of speech and grace of harmony chap xi imlacs narrative continued a hint on pilgrimage imlac now felt the enthusiastick fit and was proceeding to aggrandize his own profession when the prince cried out enough thou hast convinced me that no human being can ever be a poet proceed with thy narration to be a poet said imlac is indeed very difficult so difficult returned the prince that i will at present hear no more of his labours tell me whither you went when you had seen persia from persia said the poet i travelled through syria and for three years resided in palestine where i conversed with great numbers of the northern and western nations of europe the nations which are now in possession of all power and all knowledge whose armies are irresistible and whose fleets command the remotest parts of the globe when i compared these men with the natives of our own kingdom and those that surround us they appeared almost another order of beings in their countries it is difficult to wish for any thing that may not be obtained a thousand arts of which we never heard are continually labouring for their convenience and pleasure and whatever their own climate has denied them is supplied by their commerce by what means said the prince are the europeans thus powerful or why since they can so easily visit asia and africa for trade or conquest cannot the asiaticks and africans invade their coasts plant colonies in their ports and give laws to their natural princes the same wind that carries them back would bring us thither they are more powerful sir than we answered imlac because they are wiser knowledge will always predominate over ignorance as man governs the other animals but why their knowledge is more than ours i know not what reason can be given but the unsearchable will of the supreme being when said the prince with a sigh shall i be able to visit palestine and mingle with this mighty confluence of nations till that happy moment shall arrive let me fill up the time with such representations as thou canst give me i am not ignorant of the motive that assembles such numbers in that place and cannot but consider it as the centre of wisdom and piety to which the best and wisest men of every land must be continually resorting there are some nations said imlac that send few visitants to palestine for many numerous and learned sects in europe concur to censure pilgrimage as superstitious or deride it as ridiculous you know said the prince how little my life has made me acquainted with diversity of opinions it will be too long to hear the arguments on both sides you that have considered them tell me the result pilgrimage said imlac like many other acts of piety may be reasonable or superstitious according to the principles upon which it is performed long journeys in search of truth are not commanded truth such as is necessary to the regulation of life is always found where it is honestly sought change of place is no natural cause of the increase of piety for it inevitably produces dissipation of mind yet since men go every day to view the fields where great actions have been performed and return with stronger impressions of the event curiosity of the same kind may naturally dispose us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning and i believe no man surveys those awful scenes without some confirmation of holy resolutions that the supreme being may be more easily propitiated in one place than in another is the dream of idle superstition but that some places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner is an opinion which hourly experience will justifya he who supposes that his vices may be more successfully combated in palestine will perhaps find himself mistaken yet he may go thither without folly he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned dishonours at once his reason and religion these said the prince are european distinctions i will consider them another time what have you found to be the effect of knowledge are those nations happier than we there is so much infelicity said the poet in the world that scarce any man has leisure from his own distresses to estimate the comparative happiness of others knowledge is certainly one of the means of pleasure as is confessed by the natural desire which every mind feels of increasing its ideas ignorance is mere privation by which nothing can be produced it is a vacuity in which the soul sits motionless and torpid for want of attraction and without knowing why we always rejoice when we learn and grieve when we forget i am therefore inclined to conclude that if nothing counteracts the natural consequence of learning we grow more happy as our minds take a wider range in enumerating the particular comforts of life we shall find many advantages on the side of the europeans they cure wounds and diseases with which we languish and perish we suffer inclemencies of weather which they can obviate they have engines for the despatch of many laborious works which we must perform by manual industry there is such communication between distant places that one friend can hardly be said to be absent from another their policy removes all publick inconveniencies they have roads cut through their mountains and bridges laid upon their rivers and if we descend to the privacies of life their habitations are more commodious and their possessions are more secure they are surely happy said the prince who have all these conveniencies of which i envy none so much as the facility with which separated friends interchange their thoughts the europeans answered imlac are less unhappy than we but they are not happy human life is everywhere a state in which much is to be endured and little to be enjoyed a see idler no and note and read in dr clarkes travels the effect produced on his mind by the distant prospect of the holy city and by the habitual reverence of his guides the passage exemplifies the sublime in narrative see his travels in greece egypt and the holy land part ii sect i vo ed vol iv p ed chap xii the story of imlac continued i am not yet willing said the prince to suppose that happiness is so parsimoniously distributed to mortals nor can believe but that if i had the choice of life i should be able to fill every day with pleasure i would injure no man and should provoke no resentment i would relieve every distress and should enjoy the benedictions of gratitude i would choose my friends among the wise and my wife among the virtuous and therefore should be in no danger from treachery or unkindness my children should by my care be learned and pious and would repay to my age what their childhood had received what would dare to molest him who might call on every side to thousands enriched by his bounty or assisted by his power and why should not life glide quietly away in the soft reciprocation of protection and reverence all this may be done without the help of european refinements which appear by their effects to be rather specious than useful let us leave them and pursue our journey from palestine said imlac i passed through many regions of asia in the more civilized kingdoms as a trader and among the barbarians of the mountains as a pilgrim at last i began to long for my native country that i might repose after my travels and fatigues in the places where i had spent my earliest years and gladden my old companions with the recital of my adventures often did i figure to myself those with whom i had sported away the gay hours of dawning life sitting round me in its evening wondering at my tales and listening to my counsels when this thought had taken possession of my mind i considered every moment as wasted which did not bring me nearer to abissinia i hastened into egypt and notwithstanding my impatience was detained ten months in the contemplation of its ancient magnificence and in inquiries after the remains of its ancient learning i found in cairo a mixture of all nations some brought thither by the love of knowledge some by the hope of gain and many by the desire of living after their own manner without observation and of lying hid in the obscurity of multitudes for in a city populous as cairo it is possible to obtain at the same time the gratifications of society and the secrecy of solitude from cairo i travelled to suez and embarked on the red sea passing along the coast till i arrived at the port from which i had departed twenty years before here i joined myself to a caravan and reentered my native country i now expected the caresses of my kinsmen and the congratulations of my friends and was not without hope that my father whatever value he had set upon riches would own with gladness and pride a son who was able to add to the felicity and honour of the nation but i was soon convinced that my thoughts were vain my father had been dead fourteen years having divided his wealth among my brothers who were removed to some other provinces of my companions the greater part was in the grave of the rest some could with difficulty remember me and some considered me as one corrupted by foreign manners a man used to vicissitudes is not easily dejected i forgot after a time my disappointment and endeavoured to recommend myself to the nobles of the kingdom they admitted me to their tables heard my story and dismissed me i opened a school and was prohibited to teach i then resolved to sit down in the quiet of domestick life and addressed a lady that was fond of my conversation but rejected my suit because my father was a merchant wearied at last with solicitation and repulses i resolved to hide myself for ever from the world and depend no longer on the opinion or caprice of others i waited for the time when the gate of the happy valley should open that i might bid farewell to hope and fear the day came my performance was distinguished with favour and i resigned myself with joy to perpetual confinement hast thou here found happiness at last said rasselas tell me without reserve art thou content with thy condition or dost thou wish to be again wandering and inquiring all the inhabitants of this valley celebrate their lot and at the annual visit of the emperour invite others to partake of their felicity great prince said imlac i shall speak the truth i know not one of all your attendants who does not lament the hour when he entered this retreat i am less unhappy than the rest because i have a mind replete with images which i can vary and combine at pleasure i can amuse my solitude by the renovation of the knowledge which begins to fade from my memory and by recollection of the accidents of my past life yet all this ends in the sorrowful consideration that my acquirements are now useless and that none of my pleasures can be again enjoyed the rest whose minds have no impression but of the present moment are either corroded by malignant passions or sit stupid in the gloom of perpetual vacancy what passions can infest those said the prince who have no rivals we are in a place where impotence precludes malice and where all envy is repressed by community of enjoyments there may be community said imlac of material possessions but there can never be community of love or of esteem it must happen that one will please more than another he that knows himself despised will always be envious and still more envious and malevolent if he is condemned to live in the presence of those who despise him the invitations by which they allure others to a state which they feel to be wretched proceed from the natural malignity of hopeless misery they are weary of themselves and of each other and expect to find relief in new companions they envy the liberty which their folly has forfeited and would gladly see all mankind imprisoned like themselves from this crime however i am wholly free no man can say that he is wretched by my persuasion i look with pity on the crowds who are annually soliciting admission to captivity and wish that it were lawful for me to warn them of their danger my dear imlac said the prince i will open to thee my whole heart i have long meditated an escape from the happy valley i have examined the mountains on every side but find myself insuperably barred teach me the way to break my prison thou shalt be the companion of my flight the guide of my rambles the partner of my fortune and my sole director in the choice of life sir answered the poet your escape will be difficult and perhaps you may soon repent your curiosity the world which you figure to yourself smooth and quiet as the lake in the valley you will find a sea foaming with tempests and boiling with whirlpools you will be sometimes overwhelmed by the waves of violence and sometimes dashed against the rocks of treachery amidst wrongs and frauds competitions and anxieties you will wish a thousand times for these seats of quiet and willingly quit hope to be free from fear do not seek to deter me from my purpose said the prince i am impatient to see what thou hast seen and since thou art thyself weary of the valley it is evident that thy former state was better than this whatever be the consequence of my experiment i am resolved to judge with mine own eyes of the various conditions of men and then to make deliberately my choice of life i am afraid said imlac you are hindered by stronger restraints than my persuasions yet if your determination is fixed i do not counsel you to despair few things are impossible to diligence and skill chap xiii rasselas discovers the means of escape the prince now dismissed his favourite to rest but the narrative of wonders and novelties filled his mind with perturbation he revolved all that he had heard and prepared innumerable questions for the morning much of his uneasiness was now removed he had a friend to whom he could impart his thoughts and whose experience could assist him in his designs his heart was no longer condemned to swell with silent vexation he thought that even the happy valley might be endured with such a companion and that if they could range the world together he should have nothing further to desire in a few days the water was discharged and the ground dried the prince and imlac then walked out together to converse without the notice of the rest the prince whose thoughts were always on the wing as he passed by the gate said with a countenance of sorrow why art thou so strong and why is man so weak man is not weak answered his companion knowledge is more than equivalent to force the master of mechanicks laughs at strength i can burst the gate but cannot do it secretly some other expedient must be tried as they were walking on the side of the mountain they observed that the conies which the rain had driven from their burrows had taken shelter among the bushes and formed holes behind them tending upwards in an oblique line it has been the opinion of antiquity said imlac that human reason borrowed many arts from the instinct of animals let us therefore not think ourselves degraded by learning from the cony we may escape by piercing the mountain in the same direction we will begin where the summit hangs over the middle part and labour upwards till we shall issue up beyond the prominence the eyes of the prince when he heard this proposal sparkled with joy the execution was easy and the success certain no time was now lost they hastened early in the morning to choose a place proper for their mine they clambered with great fatigue among crags and brambles and returned without having discovered any part that favoured their design the second and the third day were spent in the same manner and with the same frustration but on the fourth they found a small cavern concealed by a thicket where they resolved to make their experiment imlac procured instruments proper to hew stone and remove earth and they fell to their work on the next day with more eagerness than vigour they were presently exhausted by their efforts and sat down to pant upon the grass the prince for a moment appeared to be discouraged sir said his companion practice will enable us to continue our labour for a longer time mark however how far we have advanced and you will find that our toil will sometime have an end great works are performed not by strength but perseverance yonder palace was raised by single stones yet you see its height and spaciousness he that shall walk with vigour three hours a day will pass in seven years a space equal to the circumference of the globe they returned to their work day after day and in a short time found a fissure in the rock which enabled them to pass far with very little obstruction this rasselas considered as a good omen do not disturb your mind said imlac with other hopes or fears than reason may suggest if you are pleased with prognosticks of good you will be terrified likewise with tokens of evil and your whole life will be a prey to superstition whatever facilitates our work is more than an omen it is a cause of success this is one of those pleasing surprises which often happen to active resolution many tilings difficult to design prove easy to performance chap xiv rasselas and imlac receive an unexpected visit they had now wrought their way to the middle and solaced their toil with the approach of liberty when the prince coming down to refresh himself with air found his sister nekayah standing before the mouth of the cavity he started and stood confused afraid to tell his design yet hopeless to conceal it a few moments determined him to repose on her fidelity and secure her secrecy by a declaration without reserve do not imagine said the princess that i came hither as a spy i had long observed from my window that you and imlac directed your walk every day towards the same point but i did not suppose you had any better reason for the preference than a cooler shade or more fragrant bank nor followed you with any other design than to partake of your conversation since then not suspicion but fondness has detected you let me not lose the advantage of my discovery i am equally weary of confinement with yourself and not less desirous of knowing what is done or suffered in the world permit me to fly with you from this tasteless tranquillity which will yet grow more loathsome when you have left me you may deny me to accompany you but cannot hinder me from following the prince who loved nekayah above his other sisters had no inclination to refuse her request and grieved that he had lost an opportunity of showing his confidence by a voluntary communication it was therefore agreed that she should leave the valley with them and that in the mean time she should watch lest any other straggler should by chance or curiosity follow them to the mountain at length their labour was at an end they saw light beyond the prominence and issuing to the top of the mountain beheld the nile yet a narrow current wandering beneath them the prince looked round with rapture anticipated all the pleasures of travel and in thought was already transported beyond his fathers dominions imlac though very joyful at his escape had less expectation of pleasure in the world which he had before tried and of which he had been weary rasselas was so much delighted with a wider horizon that he could not soon be persuaded to return into the valley he informed his sister that the way was open and that nothing now remained but to prepare for their departure chap xv the prince and princess leave the valley and see many wonders the prince and princess had jewels sufficient to make them rich whenever they came into a place of commerce which by imlacs direction they hid in their clothes and on the night of the next full moon all left the valley the princess was followed only by a single favourite who did not know whither she was going they clambered through the cavity and began to go down on the other side the princess and her maid turned their eyes towards every part and seeing nothing to bound their prospect considered themselves as in danger of being lost in a dreary vacuity they stopped and trembled i am almost afraid said the princess to begin a journey of which i cannot perceive an end and to venture into this immense plain where i may be approached on every side by men whom i never saw the prince felt nearly the same emotions though he thought it more manly to conceal them imlac smiled at their terrours and encouraged them to proceed but the princess continued irresolute till she had been imperceptibly drawn forward too far to return in the morning they found some shepherds in the field who set milk and fruits before them the princess wondered that she did not see a palace ready for her reception and a table spread with delicacies but being faint and hungry she drank the milk and eat the fruits and thought them of a higher flavour than the produce of the valley they travelled forward by easy journeys being all unaccustomed to toil or difficulty and knowing that though they might be missed they could not be pursued in a few days they came into a more populous region where imlac was diverted with the admiration which his companions expressed at the diversity of manners stations and employments their dress was such as might not bring upon them the suspicion of having any thing to conceal yet the prince wherever he came expected to be obeyed and the princess was frightened because those that came into her presence did not prostrate themselves before her imlac was forced to observe them with great vigilance lest they should betray their rank by their unusual behaviour and detained them several weeks in the first village to accustom them to the sight of common mortals by degrees the royal wanderers were taught to understand that they had for a time laid aside their dignity and were to expect only such regard as liberality and courtesy could procure and imlac having by many admonitions prepared them to endure the tumults of a port and the ruggedness of the commercial race brought them down to the seacoast the prince and his sister to whom every thing was new were gratified equally at all places and therefore remained for some months at the port without any inclination to pass further imlac was content with their stay because he did not think it safe to expose them unpractised in the world to the hazards of a foreign country at last he began to fear lest they should be discovered and proposed to fix a day for their departure they had no pretensions to judge for themselves and referred the whole scheme to his direction he therefore took passage in a ship to suez and when the time came with great difficulty prevailed on the princess to enter the vessel they had a quick and prosperous voyage and from suez travelled by land to cairo chap xvi they enter cairo and find every man happy as they approached the city which filled the strangers with astonishment this said imlac to the prince is the place where travellers and merchants assemble from all the corners of the earth you will here find men of every character and every occupation commerce is here honourable i will act as a merchant and you shall live as strangers who have no other end of travel than curiosity it will soon be observed that we are rich our reputation will procure us access to all whom we shall desire to know you will see all the conditions of humanity and enable yourself at leisure to make your choice of life they now entered the town stunned by the noise and offended by the crowds instruction had not yet so prevailed over habit but that they wondered to see themselves pass undistinguished along the street and met by the lowest of the people without reverence or notice the princess could not at first bear the thought of being levelled with the vulgar and for some days continued in her chamber where she was served by her favourite pekuah as in the palace of the valley imlac who understood traffick sold part of the jewels the next day and hired a house which he adorned with such magnificence that he was immediately considered as a merchant of great wealth his politeness attracted many acquaintance and his generosity made him courted by many dependants his table was crowded by men of every nation who all admired his knowledge and solicited his favour his companions not being able to mix in the conversation could make no discovery of their ignorance or surprise and were gradually initiated in the world as they gained knowledge of the language the prince had by frequent lectures been taught the use and nature of money but the ladies could not for a long time comprehend what the merchants did with small pieces of gold and silver or why things of so little use should be received as equivalent to the necessaries of life they studied the language two years while imlac was preparing to set before them the various ranks and conditions of mankind he grew acquainted with all who had any thing uncommon in their fortune or conduct he frequented the voluptuous and the frugal the idle and the busy the merchants and the men of learning the prince being now able to converse with fluency and having learned the caution necessary to be observed in his intercourse with strangers began to accompany imlac to places of resort and to enter into all assemblies that he might make his choice of life for some time he thought choice needless because all appeared to him equally happy wherever he went he met gaiety and kindness and heard the song of joy or the laugh of carelessness he began to believe that the world overflowed with universal plenty and that nothing was withheld either from want or merit that every hand showered liberality and every heart melted with benevolence and who then says he will be suffered to be wretched imlac permitted the pleasing delusion and was unwilling to crush the hope of inexperience till one day having sat awhile silent i know not said the prince what can be the reason that i am more unhappy than any of our friends i see them perpetually and unalterably cheerful but feel my own mind restless and uneasy i am unsatisfied with those pleasures which i seem most to court i live in the crowds of jollity not so much to enjoy company as to shun myself and am only loud and merry to conceal my sadness every man said imlac may by examining his own mind guess what passes in the minds of others when you feel that your own gaiety is counterfeit it may justly lead you to suspect that of your companions not to be sincere envy is commonly reciprocal we are long before we are convinced that happiness is never to be found and each believes it possessed by others to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself in the assembly where you passed the last night there appeared such sprightliness of air and volatility of fancy as might have suited beings of a higher order formed to inhabit serener regions inaccessible to care or sorrow yet believe me prince there was not one who did not dread the moment when solitude should deliver him to the tyranny of reflection this said the prince may be true of others since it is true of me yet whatever be the general infelicity of man one condition is more happy than another and wisdom surely directs us to take the least evil in the choice of life the causes of good and evil answered imlac are so various and uncertain so often entangled with each other so diversified by various relations and so much subject to accidents which cannot be foreseen that he who would fix his condition upon incontestable reasons of preference must live and die inquiring and deliberating but surely said rasselas the wise men to whom we listen with reverence and wonder chose that mode of life for themselves which they thought most likely to make them happy very few said the poet live by choice every man is placed in his present condition by causes which acted without his foresight and with which he did not always willingly cooperate and therefore you will rarely meet one who does not think the lot of his neighbour better than his own i am pleased to think said the prince that my birth has given me at least one advantage over others by enabling me to determine for myself i have here the world before me i will review it at leisure surely happiness is somewhere to be found chap xvii the prince associates with young men of spirit and gaiety rasselas rose next day and resolved to begin his experiments upon life youth cried he is the time of gladness i will join myself to the young men whose only business is to gratify their desires and whose time is all spent in a succession of enjoyments to such societies he was readily admitted but a few days brought him back weary and disgusted their mirth was without images their laughter without motive their pleasures were gross and sensual in which the mind had no part their conduct was at once wild and mean they laughed at order and at law but the frown of power dejected and the eye of wisdom abashed them the prince soon concluded that he should never be happy in a course of life of which he was ashamed he thought it unsuitable to a reasonable being to act without a plan and to be sad or cheerful only by chance happiness said he must be something solid and permanent without fear and without uncertainty but his young companions had gained so much of his regard by their frankness and courtesy that he could not leave them without warning and remonstrance my friends said he i have seriously considered our manners and our prospects and find that we have mistaken our own interest the first years of man must make provision for the last he that never thinks never can be wise perpetual levity must end in ignorance and intemperance though it may fire the spirits for an hour will make life short or miserable let us consider that youth is of no long duration and that in maturer age when the enchantments of fancy shall cease and phantoms of delight dance no more about us we shall have no comforts but the esteem of wise men and the means of doing good let us therefore stop while to stop is in our power let us live as men who are sometime to grow old and to whom it will be the most dreadful of all evils to count their past years by follies and to be reminded of their former luxuriance of health only by the maladies which riot has produced they stared awhile in silence one upon another and at last drove him away by a general chorus of continued laughter the consciousness that his sentiments were just and his intentions kind was scarcely sufficient to support him against the horrour of derision but he recovered his tranquillity and pursued his search chap xviii the prince finds a wise and happy man as he was one day walking in the street he saw a spacious building which all were by the open doors invited to enter he followed the stream of people and found it a hall or school of declamation in which professors read lectures to their auditory he fixed his eye upon a sage raised above the rest who discoursed with great energy on the government of the passions his look was venerable his action graceful his pronunciation clear and his diction elegant he showed with great strength of sentiment and variety of illustration that human nature is degraded and debased when the lower faculties predominate over the higher that when fancy the parent of passion usurps the dominion of the mind nothing ensues but the natural effect of unlawful government perturbation and confusion that she betrays the fortresses of the intellect to rebels and excites her children to sedition against reason their lawful sovereign he compared reason to the sun of which the light is constant uniform and lasting and fancy to a meteor of bright but transitory lustre irregular in its motion and delusive in its direction he then communicated the various precepts given from time to time for the conquest of passion and displayed the happiness of those who had obtained the important victory after which man is no longer the slave of fear nor the fool of hope is no more emaciated by envy inflamed by anger emasculated by tenderness or depressed by grief but walks on calmly through the tumults or privacies of life as the sun pursues alike his course through the calm or the stormy sky he enumerated many examples of heroes immovable by pain or pleasure who looked with indifference on those modes or accidents to which the vulgar give the names of good and evil he exhorted his hearers to lay aside their prejudices and arm themselves against the shafts of malice or misfortune by invulnerable patience concluding that this state only was happiness and that this happiness was in every ones power rasselas listened to him with the veneration due to the instructions of a superiour being and waiting for him at the door humbly implored the liberty of visiting so great a master of true wisdom the lecturer hesitated a moment when rasselas put a purse of gold into his hand which he received with a mixture of joy and wonder i have found said the prince at his return to imlac a man who can teach all that is necessary to be known who from the unshaken throne of rational fortitude looks down on the scenes of life changing beneath him he speaks and attention watches his lips he reasons and conviction closes his periods this man shall be my future guide i will learn his doctrines and imitate his life be not too hasty said imlac to trust or to admire the teachers of morality they discourse like angels but they live like men rasselas who could not conceive how any man could reason so forcibly without feeling the cogency of his own arguments paid his visit in a few days and was denied admission he had now learned the power of money and made his way by a piece of gold to the inner apartment where he found the philosopher in a room halfdarkened with his eyes misty and his face pale sir said he you are come at a time when all human friendship is useless what i suffer cannot be remedied what i have lost cannot be supplied my daughter my only daughter from whose tenderness i expected all the comforts of my age died last night of a fever my views my purposes my hopes are at an end i am now a lonely being disunited from society sir said the prince mortality is an event by which a wise man can never be surprised we know that death is always near and it should therefore always be expected young man answered the philosopher you speak like one that has never felt the pangs of separation have you then forgot the precepts said rasselas which you so powerfully enforced has wisdom no strength to arm the heart against calamity consider that external things are naturally variable but truth and reason are always the same what comfort said the mourner can truth and reason afford me of what effect are they now but to tell me that my daughter will not be restored the prince whose humanity would not suffer him to insult misery with reproof went away convinced of the emptiness of rhetorical sound and the inefficacy of polished periods and studied sentences chap xix a glimpse of pastoral life he was still eager upon the same inquiry and having heard of a hermit that lived near the lowest cataract of the nile and filled the whole country with the fame of his sanctity resolved to visit his retreat and inquire whether that felicity which publick life could not afford was to be found in solitude and whether a man whose age and virtue made him venerable could teach any peculiar art of shunning evils or enduring them imlac and the princess agreed to accompany him and after the necessary preparations they began their journey their way lay through the fields where shepherds tended their flocks and the lambs were playing upon the pasture this said the poet is the life which has been often celebrated for its innocence and quiet let us pass the heat of the day among the shepherds tents and know whether all our searches are not to terminate in pastoral simplicity the proposal pleased them and they induced the shepherds by small presents and familiar questions to tell their opinion of their own state they were so rude and ignorant so little able to compare the good with the evil of the occupation and so indistinct in their narratives and descriptions that very little could be learned from them but it was evident that their hearts were cankered with discontent that they considered themselves as condemned to labour for the luxury of the rich and looked up with stupid malevolence toward those that were placed above them the princess pronounced with vehemence that she would never suffer these envious savages to be her companions and that she should not soon be desirous of seeing any more specimens of rustick happiness but could not believe that all the accounts of primeval pleasures were fabulous and was yet in doubt whether life had any thing that could be justly preferred to the placid gratifications of fields and woods she hoped that the time would come when with a few virtuous and elegant companions she should gather flowers planted by her own hand fondle the lambs of her own ewe and listen without care among brooks and breezes to one of her maidens reading in the shade chap xx the danger of prosperity on the next day they continued their journey till the heat compelled them to look round for shelter at a small distance they saw a thick wood which they no sooner entered than they perceived that they were approaching the habitations of men the shrubs were diligently cut away to open walks where the shades were darkest the boughs of opposite trees were artificially interwoven seats of flowery turf were raised in vacant spaces and a rivulet that wantoned along the side of a winding path had its banks sometimes opened into small basins and its streams sometimes obstructed by little mounds of stone heaped together to increase its murmurs they passed slowly through the wood delighted with such unexpected accommodations and entertained each other with conjecturing what or who he could be that in those rude and unfrequented regions had leisure and art for such harmless luxury as they advanced they heard the sound of musick and saw youths and virgins dancing in the grove and going still further beheld a stately palace built upon a hill surrounded with woods the laws of eastern hospitality allowed them to enter and the master welcomed them like a man liberal and wealthy he was skilful enough in appearances soon to discern that they were no common guests and spread his table with magnificence the eloquence of imlac caught his attention and the lofty courtesy of the princess excited his respect when they offered to depart he entreated their stay and was the next day still more unwilling to dismiss them than before they were easily persuaded to stop and civility grew up in time to freedom and confidence the prince now saw all the domesticks cheerful and all the face of nature smiling round the place and could not forbear to hope that he should find here what he was seeking but when he was congratulating the master upon his possessions he answered with a sigh my condition has indeed the appearance of happiness but appearances are delusive my prosperity puts my life in danger the bassa of egypt is my enemy incensed only by my wealth and popularity i have been hitherto protected against him by the princes of the country but as the favour of the great is uncertain i know not how soon my defenders may be persuaded to share the plunder with the bassa i have sent my treasures into a distant country and upon the first alarm am prepared to follow them then will my enemies riot in my mansion and enjoy the gardens which i have planted they all joined in lamenting his danger and deprecating his exile and the princess was so much disturbed with the tumult of grief and indignation that she retired to her apartment they continued with their kind inviter a few days longer and then went forward to find the hermit chap xxi the happiness of solitude the hermits history they came on the third day by the direction of the peasants to the hermits cell it was a cavern in the side of a mountain overshadowed with palmtrees at such a distance from the cataract that nothing more was heard than a gentle uniform murmur such as composed the mind to pensive meditation especially when it was assisted by the wind whistling among the branches the first rude essay of nature had been so much improved by human labour that the cave contained several apartments appropriated to different uses and often afforded lodging to travellers whom darkness or tempests happened to overtake the hermit sat on a bench at the door to enjoy the coolness of the evening on one side lay a book with pens and papers on the other mechanical instruments of various kinds as they approached him unregarded the princess observed that he had not the countenance of a man that had found or could teach the way to happiness they saluted him with great respect which he repaid like a man not unaccustomed to the forms of courts my children said he if you have lost your way you shall be willingly supplied with such conveniencies for the night as this cavern will afford i have all that nature requires and you will not expect delicacies in a hermits cell they thanked him and entering were pleased with the neatness and regularity of the place the hermit set flesh and wine before them though he fed only upon fruits and water his discourse was cheerful without levity and pious without enthusiasm he soon gained the esteem of his guests and the princess repented of her hasty censure at last imlac began thus i do not now wonder that your reputation is so far extended we have heard at cairo of your wisdom and came hither to implore your direction for this young man and maiden in the choice of life to him that lives well answered the hermit every form of life is good nor can i give any other rule for choice than to remove from all apparent evil he will remove most certainly from evil said the prince who shall devote himself to that solitude which you have recommended by your example i have indeed lived fifteen years in solitude said the hermit but have no desire that my example should gain any imitators in my youth i professed arms and was raised by degrees to the highest military rank i have traversed wide countries at the head of my troops and seen many battles and sieges at last being disgusted by the preferment of a younger officer and feeling that my vigour was beginning to decay i was resolved to close my life in peace having found the world full of snares discord and misery i had once escaped from the pursuit of the enemy by the shelter of this cavern and therefore chose it for my final residence i employed artificers to form it into chambers and stored it with all that i was likely to want for some time after my retreat i rejoiced like a tempestbeaten sailor at his entrance into the harbour being delighted with the sudden change of the noise and hurry of war to stillness and repose when the pleasure of novelty went away i employed my hours in examining the plants which grow in the valley and the minerals which i collected from the rocks but that inquiry is now grown tasteless and irksome i have been for some time unsettled and distracted my mind is disturbed with a thousand perplexities of doubt and vanities of imagination which hourly prevail upon me because i have no opportunities of relaxation or diversion i am sometimes ashamed to think that i could not secure myself from vice but by retiring from the exercise of virtue and begin to suspect that i was rather impelled by resentment than led by devotion into solitude my fancy riots in scenes of folly and i lament that i have lost so much and have gained so little in solitude if i escape the example of bad men i want likewise the counsel and conversation of the good i have been long comparing the evils with the advantages of society and resolve to return into the world tomorrow the life of a solitary man will be certainly miserable but not certainly devout they heard his resolution with surprise but after a short pause offered to conduct him to cairo he dug up a considerable treasure which he had hid among the rocks and accompanied them to the city on which as he approached it he gazed with rapture chap xxii the happiness of a life led according to nature rasselas went often to an assembly of learned men who met at stated times to unbend their minds and compare their opinions their manners were somewhat coarse but their conversation was instructive and their disputations acute though sometimes too violent and often continued till neither controvertist remembered upon what question they began some faults were almost general among them every one was desirous to dictate to the rest and every one was pleased to hear the genius or knowledge of another depreciated in this assembly rasselas was relating his interview with the hermit and the wonder with which he heard him censure a course of life which he had so deliberately chosen and so laudably followed the sentiments of the hearers were various some were of opinion that the folly of his choice had been justly punished by condemnation to perpetual perseverance one of the youngest among them with great vehemence pronounced him a hypocrite some talked of the right of society to the labour of individuals and considered retirement as a desertion of duty others readily allowed that there was a time when the claims of the publick were satisfied and when a man might properly sequester himself to review his life and purify his heart one who appeared more affected with the narrative than the rest thought it likely that the hermit would in a few years go back to his retreat and perhaps if shame did not restrain or death intercept him return once more from his retreat into the world for the hope of happiness said he is so strongly impressed that the longest experience is not able to efface it of the present state whatever it may be we feel and are forced to confess the misery yet when the same state is again at a distance imagination paints it as desirable but the time will surely come when desire will be no longer our torment and no man shall be wretched but by his own fault this said a philosopher who had heard him with tokens of great impatience is the present condition of a wise man the time is already come when none are wretched but by their own fault nothing is more idle than to inquire after happiness which nature has kindly placed within our reach the way to be happy is to live according to nature in obedience to that universal and unalterable law with which every heart is originally impressed which is not written on it by precept but engraven by destiny not instilled by education but infused at our nativity he that lives according to nature will suffer nothing from the delusions of hope or importunities of desire he will receive and reject with equability of temper and act or suffer as the reason of things shall alternately prescribe other men may amuse themselves with subtile definitions or intricate ratiocinations let them learn to be wise by easier means let them observe the hind of the forest and the linnet of the grove let them consider the life of animals whose motions are regulated by instinct they obey their guide and are happy let us therefore at length cease to dispute and learn to live throw away the incumbrance of precepts which they who utter them with so much pride and pomp do not understand and carry with us this simple and intelligible maxim that deviation from nature is deviation from happiness when he had spoken he looked round him with a placid air and enjoyed the consciousness of his own beneficence sir said the prince with great modesty as i like all the rest of mankind am desirous of felicity my closest attention has been fixed upon your discourse i doubt not the truth of a position which a man so learned has so confidently advanced let me only know what it is to live according to nature when i find young men so humble and so docile said the philosopher i can deny them no information which my studies have enabled me to afford to live according to nature is to act always with due regard to the fitness arising from the relations and qualities of causes and effects to concur with the great and unchangeable scheme of universal felicity to cooperate with the general disposition and tendency of the present system of things the prince soon found that this was one of the sages whom he should understand less as he heard him longer he therefore bowed and was silent and the philosopher supposing him satisfied and the rest vanquished rose up and departed with the air of a man that had cooperated with the present system chap xxiii the prince and his sister divide between them the work of observation rasselas returned home full of reflections doubtful how to direct his future steps of the way to happiness he found the learned and simple equally ignorant but as he was yet young he flattered himself that he had time remaining for more experiments and further inquiries he communicated to imlac his observations and his doubts but was answered by him with new doubts and remarks that gave him no comfort he therefore discoursed more frequently and freely with his sister who had yet the same hope with himself and always assisted him to give some reason why though he had been hitherto frustrated he might succeed at last we have hitherto said she known but little of the world we have never yet been either great or mean in our own country though we had royalty we had no power and in this we have not yet seen the private recesses of domestick peace imlac favours not our search lest we should in time find him mistaken we will divide the task between us you shall try what is to be found in the splendour of courts and i will range the shades of humbler life perhaps command and authority may be the supreme blessings as they afford most opportunities of doing good or perhaps what this world can give may be found in the modest habitations of middle fortune too low for great designs and too high for penury and distress chap xxiv the prince examines the happiness of high stations rasselas applauded the design and appeared next day with a splendid retinue at the court of the bassa he was soon distinguished for his magnificence and admitted as a prince whose curiosity had brought him from distant countries to an intimacy with the great officers and frequent conversation with the bassa himself he was at first inclined to believe that the man must be pleased with his own condition whom all approached with reverence and heard with obedience and who had the power to extend his edicts to a whole kingdom there can be no pleasure said he equal to that of feeling at once the joy of thousands all made happy by wise administration yet since by the law of subordination this sublime delight can be in one nation but the lot of one it is surely reasonable to think that there is some satisfaction more popular and accessible and that millions can hardly be subjected to the will of a single man only to fill his particular breast with incommunicable content these thoughts were often in his mind and he found no solution of the difficulty but as presents and civilities gained him more familiarity he found that almost every man who stood high in employment hated all the rest and was hated by them and that their lives were a continual succession of plots and detections stratagems and escapes faction and treachery many of those who surrounded the bassa were sent only to watch and report his conduct every tongue was muttering censure and every eye was searching for a fault at last the letters of revocation arrived the bassa was carried in chains to constantinople and his name was mentioned no more what are we now to think of the prerogatives of power said rasselas to his sister is it without any efficacy to good or is the subordinate degree only dangerous and the supreme safe and glorious is the sultan the only happy man in his dominions or is the sultan himself subject to the torments of suspicion and the dread of enemies in a short time the second bassa was deposed the sultan that had advanced him was murdered by the janizaries and his successour had other views and different favourites chap xxv the princess pursues her inquiry with more diligence than success the princess in the mean time insinuated herself into many families for there are few doors through which liberality joined with goodhumour cannot find its way the daughters of many houses were airy and cheerful but nekayah had been too long accustomed to the conversation of imlac and her brother to be much pleased with childish levity and prattle which had no meaning she found their thoughts narrow their wishes low and their merriment often artificial their pleasures poor as they were could not be preserved pure but were imbittered by petty competitions and worthless emulation they were always jealous of the beauty of each other of a quality to which solicitude can add nothing and from which detraction can take nothing away many were in love with triflers like themselves and many fancied that they were in love when in truth they were only idle their affection was not fixed on sense or virtue and therefore seldom ended but in vexation their grief however like their joy was transient every thing floated in their mind unconnected with the past or future so that one desire easily gave way to another as a second stone cast into the water effaces and confounds the circles of the first with these girls she played as with inoffensive animals and found them proud of her countenance and weary of her company but her purpose was to examine more deeply and her affability easily persuaded the hearts that were swelling with sorrow to discharge their secrets in her ear and those whom hope flattered or prosperity delighted often courted her to partake their pleasures the princess and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private summer house on the bank of the nile and related to each other the occurrences of the day as they were sitting together the princess cast her eyes upon the river that flowed before her answer said she great father of waters thou that rollest thy floods through eighty nations to the invocations of the daughter of thy native king tell me if thou waterest through all thy course a single habitation from which thou dost not hear the murmurs of complaint you are then said rasselas not more successful in private houses than i have been in courts i have since the last partition of our provinces said the princess enabled myself to enter familiarly into many families where there was the fairest show of prosperity and peace and know not one house that is not haunted by some fury that destroys their quiet i did not seek ease among the poor because i concluded that there it could not be found but i saw many poor whom i had supposed to live in affluence poverty has in large cities very different appearances it is often concealed in splendour and often in extravagance it is the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the rest they support themselves by temporary expedients and every day is lost in contriving for the morrow this however was an evil which though frequent i saw with less pain because i could relieve it yet some have refused my bounties more offended with my quickness to detect their wants than pleased with my readiness to succour them and others whose exigencies compelled them to admit my kindness have never been able to forgive their benefactress many however have been sincerely grateful without the ostentation of gratitude or the hope of other favours chap xxvi the princess continues her remarks upon private life nekayah perceiving her brothers attention fixed proceeded in her narrative in families where there is or is not poverty there is commonly discord if a kingdom be as imlac tells us a great family a family likewise is a little kingdom torn with factions and exposed to revolutions an unpractised observer expects the love of parents and children to be constant and equal but this kindness seldom continues beyond the years of infancy in a short time the children become rivals to their parents benefits are allayed by reproaches and gratitude debased by envy parents and children seldom act in concert each child endeavours to appropriate the esteem or fondness of the parents and the parents with yet less temptation betray each other to their children thus some place their confidence in the father and some in the mother and by degrees the house is filled with artifices and feuds the opinions of children and parents of the young and the old are naturally opposite by the contrary effects of hope and despondence of expectation and experience without crime or folly on either side the colours of life in youth and age appear different as the face of nature in spring and winter and how can children credit the assertions of parents which their own eyes show them to be false few parents act in such a manner as much to enforce their maxims by the credit of their lives the old man trusts wholly to slow contrivance and gradual progression the youth expects to force his way by genius vigour and precipitance the old man pays regard to riches and the youth reverences virtue the old man deifies prudence the youth commits himself to magnanimity and chance the young man who intends no ill believes that none is intended and therefore acts with openness and candour but his father having suffered the injuries of fraud is impelled to suspect and too often allured to practise it age looks with anger on the temerity of youth and youth with contempt on the scrupulosity of age thus parents and children for the greatest part live on to love less and less and if those whom nature has thus closely united are the torments of each other where shall we look for tenderness and consolation surely said the prince you must have been unfortunate in your choice of acquaintance i am unwilling to believe that the most tender of all relations is thus impeded in its effects by natural necessity domestick discord answered she is not inevitably and fatally necessary but yet it is not easily avoided we seldom see that a whole family is virtuous the good and evil cannot well agree and the evil can yet less agree with one another even the virtuous fall sometimes to variance when their virtues are of different kinds and tending to extremes in general those parents have most reverence who most deserve it for he that lives well cannot be despised many other evils infest private life some are the slaves of servants whom they have trusted with their affairs some are kept in continual anxiety by the caprice of rich relations whom they cannot please and dare not offend some husbands are imperious and some wives perverse and as it is always more easy to do evil than good though the wisdom or virtue of one can very rarely make many happy the folly or vice of one may often make many miserable if such be the general effect of marriage said the prince i shall for the future think it dangerous to connect my interest with that of another lest i should be unhappy by my partners fault i have met said the princess with many who live single for that reason but i never found that their prudence ought to raise envy they dream away their time without friendship without fondness and are driven to rid themselves of the day for which they have no use by childish amusements or vitious delights they act as beings under the constant sense of some known inferiority that fills their minds with rancour and their tongues with censure they are peevish at home and malevolent abroad and as the outlaws of human nature make it their business and their pleasure to disturb that society which debars them from its privileges to live without feeling or exciting sympathy to be fortunate without adding to the felicity of others or afflicted without tasting the balm of pity is a state more gloomy than solitude it is not retreat but exclusion from mankind marriage has many pains but celibacy has no pleasures what then is to be done said rasselas the more we inquire the less we can resolve surely he is most likely to please himself that has no other inclination to regard chap xxvii disquisition upon greatness the conversation had a short pause the prince having considered his sisters observations told her that she had surveyed life with prejudice and supposed misery where she did not find it your narrative says he throws yet a darker gloom upon the prospects of futurity the predictions of imlac were but faint sketches of the evils painted by nekayah i have been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of grandeur or of power that her presence is not to be bought by wealth nor enforced by conquest it is evident that as any man acts in a wider compass he must be more exposed to opposition from enmity or miscarriage from chance whoever has many to please or to govern must use the ministry of many agents some of whom will be wicked and some ignorant by some he will be misled and by others betrayed if he gratifies one he will offend another those that are not favoured will think themselves injured and since favours can be conferred but upon few the greater number will be always discontented the discontent said the princess which is thus unreasonable i hope that i shall always have spirit to despise and you power to repress discontent answered rasselas will not always be without reason under the most just and vigilant administration of publick affairs none however attentive can always discover that merit which indigence or faction may happen to obscure and none however powerful can always reward it yet he that sees inferiour desert advanced above him will naturally impute that preference to partiality or caprice and indeed it can scarcely be hoped that any man however magnanimous by nature or exalted by condition will be able to persist for ever in the fixed and inexorable justice of distribution he will sometimes indulge his own affections and sometimes those of his favourites he will permit some to please him who can never serve him he will discover in those whom he loves qualities which in reality they do not possess and to those from whom he receives pleasure he will in his turn endeavour to give it thus will recommendations sometimes prevail which were purchased by money or by the more destructive bribery of flattery and servility he that has much to do will do something wrong and of that wrong must suffer the consequences and if it were possible that he should always act rightly yet when such numbers are to judge of his conduct the bad will censure and obstruct him by malevolence and the good sometimes by mistake the highest stations cannot therefore hope to be the abodes of happiness which i would willingly believe to have fled from thrones and palaces to seats of humble privacy and placid obscurity for what can hinder the satisfaction or intercept the expectations of him whose abilities are adequate to his employments who sees with his own eyes the whole circuit of his influence who chooses by his own knowledge all whom he trusts and whom none are tempted to deceive by hope or fear surely he has nothing to do but to love and to be loved to be virtuous and to be happy whether perfect happiness would be procured by perfect goodness said nekayah this world will never afford an opportunity of deciding but this at least may be maintained that we do not always find visible happiness in proportion to visible virtue all natural and almost all political evils are incident alike to the bad and good they are confounded in the misery of a famine and not much distinguished in the fury of a faction they sink together in a tempest and are driven together from their country by invaders all that virtue can afford is quietness of conscience a steady prospect of a happier state this may enable us to endure calamity with patience but remember that patience must suppose pain chap xxviii rasselas and nekayah continue their conversation dear princess said rasselas you fall into the common errours of exaggeratory declamation by producing in a familiar disquisition examples of national calamities and scenes of extensive misery which are found in books rather than in the world and which as they are horrid are ordained to be rare let us not imagine evils which we do not feel nor injure life by misrepresentations i cannot bear that querulous eloquence which threatens every city with a siege like that of jerusalem that makes famine attend on every flight of locusts and suspends pestilence on the wing of every blast that issues from the south on necessary and inevitable evils which overwhelm kingdoms at once all disputation is vain when they happen they must be endured but it is evident that these bursts of universal distress are more dreaded than felt thousands and ten thousands flourish in youth and wither in age without the knowledge of any other than domestick evils and share the same pleasures and vexations whether their kings are mild or cruel whether the armies of their country pursue their enemies or retreat before them while courts are disturbed with intestine competitions and ambassadours are negotiating in foreign countries the smith still plies his anvil and the husbandman drives his plough forward the necessaries of life are required and obtained and the successive business of the seasons continues to make its wonted revolutions let us cease to consider what perhaps may never happen and what when it shall happen will laugh at human speculation we will not endeavour to modify the motions of the elements or to fix the destiny of kingdoms it is our business to consider what beings like us may perform each labouring for his own happiness by promoting within his circle however narrow the happiness of others marriage is evidently the dictate of nature men and women are made to be companions of each other and therefore i cannot be persuaded but that marriage is one of the means of happiness i know not said the princess whether marriage be more than one of the innumerable modes of human misery when i see and reckon the various forms of connubial infelicity the unexpected causes of lasting discord the diversities of temper the oppositions of opinion the rude collisions of contrary desire where both are urged by violent impulses the obstinate contests of disagreeable virtues where both are supported by consciousness of good intention i am sometimes disposed to think with the severer casuists of most nations that marriage is rather permitted than approved and that none but by the instigation of a passion too much indulged entangle themselves with indissoluble compacts you seem to forget replied rasselas that you have even now represented celibacy as less happy than marriage both conditions may be bad but they cannot both be worst thus it happens when wrong opinions are entertained that they mutually destroy each other and leave the mind open to truth i did not expect answered the princess to hear that imputed to falsehood which is the consequence only of frailty to the mind as to the eye it is difficult to compare with exactness objects vast in their extent and various in their parts where we see or conceive the whole at once we readily note the discriminations and decide the preference but of two systems of which neither can be surveyed by any human being in its full compass of magnitude and multiplicity of complication where is the wonder that judging of the whole by parts i am alternately affected by one and the other as either presses on my memory or fancy we differ from ourselves just as we differ from each other when we see only part of the question as in the multifarious relations of politicks and morality but when we perceive the whole at once as in numerical computations all agree in one judgment and none ever varies his opinion let us not add said the prince to the other evils of life the bitterness of controversy nor endeavour to vie with each other in subtilties of argument we are employed in a search of which both are equally to enjoy the success or suffer by the miscarriage it is therefore fit that we assist each other you surely conclude too hastily from the infelicity of marriage against its institution will not the misery of life prove equally that life cannot be the gift of heaven the world must be peopled by marriage or peopled without it how the world is to be peopled returned nekayah is not my care and needs not be yours i see no danger that the present generation should omit to leave successours behind them we are not now inquiring for the world but for ourselves chap xxix the debate on marriage continued the good of the whole says rasselas is the same with the good of all its parts if marriage be best for mankind it must be evidently best for individuals or a permanent and necessary duty must be the cause of evil and some must be inevitably sacrificed to the convenience of others in the estimate which you have made of the two states it appears that the incommodities of a single life are in a great measure necessary and certain but those of the conjugal state accidental and avoidable i cannot forbear to flatter myself that prudence and benevolence will make marriage happy the general folly of mankind is the cause of general complaint what can be expected but disappointment and repentance from a choice made in the immaturity of youth in the ardour of desire without judgment without foresight without inquiry after conformity of opinions similarity of manners rectitude of judgment or purity of sentiment such is the common process of marriage a youth and maiden meeting by chance or brought together by artifice exchange glances reciprocate civilities go home and dream of one another having little to divert attention or diversify thought they find themselves uneasy when they are apart and therefore conclude that they shall be happy together they marry and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness before had concealed they wear out life in altercations and charge nature with cruelty from those early marriages proceeds likewise the rivalry of parents and children the son is eager to enjoy the world before the father is willing to forsake it and there is hardly room at once for two generations the daughter begins to bloom before the mother can be content to fade and neither can forbear to wish for the absence of the other surely all these evils may be avoided by that deliberation and delay which prudence prescribes to irrevocable choice in the variety and jollity of youthful pleasures life may be well enough supported without the help of a partner longer time will increase experience and wider views will allow better opportunities of inquiry and selection one advantage at least will be certain the parents will be visibly older than their children what reason cannot collect said nekayah and what experiment has not yet taught can be known only from the report of others i have been told that late marriages are not eminently happy this is a question too important to be neglected and i have often proposed it to those whose accuracy of remark and comprehensiveness of knowledge made their suffrages worthy of regard they have generally determined that it is dangerous for a man and woman to suspend their fate upon each other at a time when opinions are fixed and habits are established when friendships have been contracted on both sides when life has been planned into method and the mind has long enjoyed the contemplation of its own prospects it is scarcely possible that two travelling through the world under the conduct of chance should have been both directed to the same path and it will not often happen that either will quit the track which custom has made pleasing when the desultory levity of youth has settled into regularity it is soon succeeded by pride ashamed to yield or obstinacy delighting to contend and even though mutual esteem produces mutual desire to please time itself as it modifies unchangeably the external mien determines likewise the direction of the passions and gives an inflexible rigidity to the manners long customs are not easily broken he that attempts to change the course of his own life very often labours in vain and how shall we do that for others which we are seldom able to do for ourselves but surely interposed the prince you suppose the chief motive of choice forgotten or neglected whenever i shall seek a wife it shall be my first question whether she be willing to be led by reason thus it is said nekayah that philosophers are deceived there are a thousand familiar disputes which reason can never decide questions that elude investigation and make logick ridiculous cases where something must be done and where little can be said consider the state of mankind and inquire how few can be supposed to act upon any occasions whether small or great with all the reasons of action present to their minds wretched would be the pair above all names of wretchedness who should be doomed to adjust by reason every morning all the minute detail of a domestick day those who marry at an advanced age will probably escape the encroachments of their children but in diminution of this advantage they will be likely to leave them ignorant and helpless to a guardians mercy or if that should not happen they must at least go out of the world before they see those whom they love best either wise or great from their children if they have less to fear they have less also to hope and they lose without equivalent the joys of early love and the convenience of uniting with manners pliant and minds susceptible of new impressions which might wear away their dissimilitudes by long cohabitation as soft bodies by continual attrition conform their surfaces to each other i believe it will be found that those who marry late are best pleased with their children and those who marry early with their partners the union of these two affections said rasselas would produce all that could be wished perhaps there is a time when marriage might unite them a time neither too early for the father nor too late for the husband every hour answered the princess confirms my prejudice in favour of the position so often uttered by the mouth of imlac that nature sets her gifts on the right hand and on the left those conditions which flatter hope and attract desire are so constituted that as we approach one we recede from another there are goods so opposed that we cannot seize both but by too much prudence may pass between them at too great a distance to reach either this is often the fate of long consideration he does nothing who endeavours to do more than is allowed to humanity flatter not yourself with contrarieties of pleasure of the blessings set before you make your choice and be content no man can taste the fruits of autumn while he is delighting his scent with the flowers of the spring no man can at the same time fill his cup from the source and from the mouth of the nile chap xxx imlac enters and changes the conversation here imlac entered and interrupted them imlac said rasselas i have been taking from the princess the dismal history of private life and am almost discouraged from further search it seems to me said imlac that while you are making the choice of life you neglect to live you wander about a single city which however large and diversified can now afford few novelties and forget that you are in a country famous among the earliest monarchies for the power and wisdom of its inhabitants a country where the sciences first dawned that illuminate the world and beyond which the arts cannot be traced of civil society or domestick life the old egyptians have left behind them monuments of industry and power before which all european magnificence is confessed to fade away the ruins of their architecture are the schools of modern builders and from the wonders which time has spared we may conjecture though uncertainly what it has destroyed my curiosity said rasselas does not very strongly lead me to survey piles of stone or mounds of earth my business is with man i came hither not to measure fragments of temples or trace choked aqueducts but to look upon the various scenes of the present world the things that are now before us said the princess require attention and deserve it what have i to do with the heroes or the monuments of ancient times with times which never can return and heroes whose form of life was different from all that the present condition of mankind requires or allows to know any thing returned the poet we must know its effects to see men we must see their works that we may learn what reason has dictated or passion has incited and find what are the most powerful motives of action to judge rightly of the present we must oppose it to the past for all judgment is comparative and of the future nothing can be known the truth is that no mind is much employed upon the present recollection and anticipation fill up almost all our moments our passions are joy and grief love and hatred hope and fear of joy and grief the past is the object and the future of hope and fear even love and hatred respect the past for the cause must have been before the effect the present state of things is the consequence of the former and it is natural to inquire what were the sources of the good that we enjoy or the evil that we suffer if we act only for ourselves to neglect the study of history is not prudent if we are intrusted with the care of others it is not just ignorance when it is voluntary is criminal and he may properly be charged with evil who refused to learn how he might prevent it there is no part of history so generally useful as that which relates the progress of the human mind the gradual improvement of reason the successive advances of science the vicissitudes of learning and ignorance which are the light and darkness of thinking beings the extinction and resuscitation of arts and the revolutions of the intellectual world if accounts of battles and invasions are peculiarly the business of princes the useful or elegant arts are not to be neglected those who have kingdoms to govern have understandings to cultivate example is always more efficacious than precept a soldier is formed in war and a painter must copy pictures in this contemplative life has the advantage great actions are seldom seen but the labours of art are always at hand for those who desire to know what art has been able to perform when the eye or the imagination is struck with an uncommon work the next transition of an active mind is to the means by which it was performed here begins the true use of such contemplation we enlarge our comprehension by new ideas and perhaps recover some art lost to mankind or learn what is less perfectly known in our own country at least we compare our own with former times and either rejoice at our improvements or what is the first motion towards good discover our defects i am willing said the prince to see all that can deserve my search and i said the princess shall rejoice to learn something of the manners of antiquity the most pompous monument of egyptian greatness and one of the most bulky works of manual industry said imlac are the pyramids fabricks raised before the time of history and of which the earliest narratives afford us only uncertain traditions of these the greatest is still standing very little injured by time let us visit them tomorrow said nekayah i have often heard of the pyramids and shall not rest till i have seen them within and without with my own eyes chap xxxi they visit the pyramids the resolution being thus taken they set out the next day they laid tents upon their camels being resolved to stay among the pyramids till their curiosity was fully satisfied they travelled gently turned aside to every thing remarkable stopped from time to time and conversed with the inhabitants and observed the various appearances of towns ruined and inhabited of wild and cultivated nature when they came to the great pyramid they were astonished at the extent of the base and the height of the top imlac explained to them the principles upon which the pyramidal form was chosen for a fabrick intended to coextend its duration with that of the world he showed that its gradual diminution gave it such stability as defeated all the common attacks of the elements and could scarcely be overthrown by earthquakes themselves the least resistible of natural violence a concussion that should shatter the pyramid would threaten the dissolution of the continent they measured all its dimensions and pitched their tents at its foot next day they prepared to enter its interiour apartments and having hired the common guides climbed up to the first passage when the favourite of the princess looking into the cavity stepped back and trembled pekuah said the princess of what art thou afraid of the narrow entrance answered the lady and of the dreadful gloom i dare not enter a place which must surely be inhabited by unquiet souls the original possessours of these dreadful vaults will start up before us and perhaps shut us in for evera she spoke and threw her arms round the neck of her mistress if all your fear be of apparitions said the prince i will promise you safety there is no danger from the dead he that is once buried will be seen no more that the dead are seen no more said imlac i will not undertake to maintain against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of all ages and of all nations there is no people rude or learned among whom apparitions of the dead are not related and believed this opinion which perhaps prevails as far as human nature is diffused could become universal only by its truth those that never heard of one another would not have agreed in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible that it is doubted by single cavillers can very little weaken the general evidence and some who deny it with their tongues confess it by their fearsb yet i do not mean to add new terrours to those which have already seized upon pekuah there can be no reason why spectres should haunt the pyramid more than other places or why they should have power or will to hurt innocence and purity our entrance is no violation of their privileges we can take nothing from them how then can we offend them my dear pekuah said the princess i will always go before you and imlac shall follow you remember that you are the companion of the princess of abissinia if the princess is pleased that her servant should die returned the lady let her command some death less dreadful than enclosure in this horrid cavern you know i dare not disobey you i must go if you command me but if i once enter i never shall come back the princess saw that her fear was too strong for expostulation or reproof and embracing her told her that she should stay in the tent till their return pekuah was yet not satisfied but entreated the princess not to pursue so dreadful a purpose as that of entering the rececess of the pyramid though i cannot teach courage said nekayah i must not learn cowardice nor leave at last undone what i came hither only to do a it may not be unacceptable to our readers to quote in this place a stanza from an ode to horror in the student ii it alludes to the story of a french gentleman who going into the catacombs not far from cairo with some arab guides was there robbed by them and left a huge stone being placed over the entrance what felt the gallic traveller when far in arab desert drear he found within the catacomb alive the terrors of a tomb while many a mummy through the shade in hieroglyphic stole arrayed seemd to uprear the mystic head and trace the gloom with ghostly tread thou heardst him pour the stifled groan horror his soul was all thy own ed b see hibberts philosophy of apparitions it is to be regretted that coleridge has never yet gratified the wish he professed to feel in the first volume of his friend p to devote an entire work to the subject of dreams visions ghosts witchcraft c in it we should have had the satisfaction of tracing the workings of a most vivid imagination analyzed by the most discriminating judgment see barrows sermon on the being of god proved from supernatural effects we need scarcely request the reader to bear in mind that barrow was a mathematician and one of the most severe of reasoners ed chap xxxii they enter the pyramid pekuah descended to the tents and the rest entered the pyramid they passed through the galleries surveyed the vaults of marble and examined the chest in which the body of the founder is supposed to have been reposited they then sat down in one of the most spacious chambers to rest awhile before they attempted to return we have now said imlac gratified our minds with an exact view of the greatest work of man except the wall of china of the wall it is very easy to assign the motive it secured a wealthy and timorous nation from the incursions of barbarians whose unskilfulness in arts made it easier for them to supply their wants by rapine than by industry and who from time to time poured in upon the habitations of peaceful commerce as vultures descend upon domestick fowl their celerity and fierceness made the wall necessary and their ignorance made it efficacious but for the pyramids no reason has ever been given adequate to the cost and labour of the work the narrowness of the chambers proves that it could afford no retreat from enemies and treasures might have been reposited at far less expense with equal security it seems to have been erected only in compliance with that hunger of imagination which preys incessantly upon life and must be always appeased by some employment those who have already all that they can enjoy must enlarge their desires he that has built for use till use is supplied must begin to build for vanity and extend his plan to the utmost power of human performance that he may not be soon reduced to form another wish i consider this mighty structure as a monument of the insufficiency of human enjoyments a king whose power is unlimited and whose treasures surmount all real and imaginary wants is compelled to solace by the erection of a pyramid the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of pleasures and to amuse the tediousness of declining life by seeing thousands labouring without end and one stone for no purpose laid upon another whoever thou art that not content with a moderate condition imaginest happiness in royal magnificence and dreamest that command or riches can feed the appetite of novelty with perpetual gratifications survey the pyramids and confess thy folly chap xxxiii the princess meets with an unexpected misfortune they rose up and returned through the cavity at which they had entered and the princess prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark labyrinths and costly rooms and of the different impressions which the varieties of the way had made upon her but when they came to their train they found every one silent and dejected the men discovered shame and fear in their countenances and the women were weeping in the tents what had happened they did not try to conjecture but immediately inquired you had scarcely entered into the pyramid said one of the attendants when a troop of arabs rushed upon us we were too few to resist them and too slow to escape they were about to search the tents set us on our camels and drive us along before them when the approach of some turkish horsemen put them to flight but they seized the lady pekuah with her two maids and carried them away the turks are now pursuing them by our instigation but i fear they will not be able to overtake them the princess was overpowered with surprise and grief rasselas in the first heat of his resentment ordered his servants to follow him and prepared to pursue the robbers with his sabre in his hand sir said imlac what can you hope from violence or valour the arabs are mounted on horses trained to battle and retreat we have only beasts of burden by leaving our present station we may lose the princess but cannot hope to regain pekuah in a short time the turks returned having not been able to reach the enemy the princess burst out into new lamentations and rasselas could scarcely forbear to reproach them with cowardice but imlac was of opinion that the escape of the arabs was no addition to their misfortune for perhaps they would have killed their captives rather than have resigned them chap xxxiv they return to cairo without pekuah there was nothing to be hoped from longer stay they returned to cairo repenting of their curiosity censuring the negligence of the government lamenting their own rashness which had neglected to procure a guard imagining many expedients by which the loss of pekuah might have been prevented and resolving to do something for her recovery though none could find any thing proper to be done nekayah retired to her chamber where her women attempted to comfort her by telling her that all had their troubles and that lady pekuah had enjoyed much happiness in the world for a long time and might reasonably expect a change of fortune they hoped that some good would befall her wheresoever she was and that their mistress would find another friend who might supply her place the princess made them no answer and they continued the form of condolence not much grieved in their hearts that the favourite was lost next day the prince presented to the bassa a memorial of the wrong which he had suffered and a petition for redress the bassa threatened to punish the robbers but did not attempt to catch them nor indeed could any account or description be given by which he might direct the pursuit it soon appeared that nothing would be done by authority governours being accustomed to hear of more crimes than they can punish and more wrongs than they can redress set themselves at ease by indiscriminate negligence and presently forget the request when they lose sight of the petitioner imlac then endeavoured to gain some intelligence by private agents he found many who pretended to an exact knowledge of all the haunts of the arabs and to regular correspondence with their chiefs and who readily undertook the recovery of pekuah of these some were furnished with money for their journey and came back no more some were liberally paid for accounts which a few days discovered to be false but the princess would not suffer any means however improbable to be left untried while she was doing something she kept her hope alive as one expedient failed another was suggested when one messenger returned unsuccessful another was despatched to a different quarter two months had now passed and of pekuah nothing had been heard the hopes which they had endeavoured to raise in each other grew more languid and the princess when she saw nothing more to be tried sunk down inconsolable in hopeless dejection a thousand times she reproached herself with the easy compliance by which she permitted her favourite to stay behind her had not my fondness said she lessened my authority pekuah had not dared to talk of her terrours she ought to have feared me more than spectres a severe look would have overpowered her a peremptory command would have compelled obedience why did foolish indulgence prevail upon me why did i not speak and refuse to hear great princess said imlac do not reproach yourself for your virtue or consider that as blamable by which evil has accidentally been caused your tenderness for the timidity of pekuah was generous and kind when we act according to our duty we commit the event to him by whose laws our actions are governed and who will suffer none to be finally punished for obedience when in prospect of some good whether natural or moral we break the rules prescribed us we withdraw from the direction of superiour wisdom and take all consequences upon ourselves man cannot so far know the connexion of causes and events as that he may venture to do wrong in order to do right when we pursue our end by lawful means we may always console our miscarriage by the hope of future recompense when we consult only our own policy and attempt to find a nearer way to good by overleaping the settled boundaries of right and wrong we cannot be happy even by success because we cannot escape the consciousness of our fault but if we miscarry the disappointment is irremediably imbittered how comfortless is the sorrow of him who feels at once the pangs of guilt and the vexation of calamity which guilt has brought upon him consider princess what would have been your condition if the lady pekuah had entreated to accompany you and being compelled to stay in the tents had been carried away or how would you have borne the thought if you had forced her into the pyramid and she had died before you in agonies of terrour had either happened said nekayah i could not have endured life till now i should have been tortured to madness by the remembrance of such cruelty or must have pined away in abhorrence of myself this at least said imlac is the present reward of virtuous conduct that no unlucky consequence can oblige us to repent it chap xxxv the princess languishes for want of pekuah nekayah being thus reconciled to herself found that no evil is insupportable but that which is accompanied with consciousness of wrong she was from that time delivered from the violence of tempestuous sorrow and sunk into silent pensiveness and gloomy tranquillity she sat from morning to evening recollecting all that had been done or said by her pekuah treasured up with care every trifle on which pekuah had set an accidental value and which might recall to mind any little incident or careless conversation the sentiments of her whom she now expected to see no more were treasured in her memory as rules of life and she deliberated to no other end than to conjecture on any occasion what would have been the opinion and counsel of pekuah the women by whom she was attended knew nothing of her real condition and therefore she could not talk to them but with caution and reserve she began to remit her curiosity having no great care to collect notions which she had no convenience of uttering rasselas endeavoured first to comfort and afterwards to divert her he hired musicians to whom she seemed to listen but did not hear them and procured masters to instruct her in various arts whose lectures when they visited her again were again to be repeated she had lost her taste of pleasure and her ambition of excellence and her mind though forced into short excursions always recurred to the image of her friend imlac was every morning earnestly enjoined to renew his inquiries and was asked every night whether he had yet heard of pekuah till not being able to return the princess the answer that she desired he was less and less willing to come into her presence she observed his backwardness and commanded him to attend her you are not said she to confound impatience with resentment or to suppose that i charge you with negligence because i repine at your unsuccessfulness i do not much wonder at your absence i know that the unhappy are never pleasing and that all naturally avoid the contagion of misery to hear complaints is wearisome alike to the wretched and the happy for who would cloud by adventitious grief the short gleams of gaiety which life allows us or who that is struggling under his own evils will add to them the miseries of another the time is at hand when none shall be disturbed any longer by the sighs of nekayah my search after happiness is now at an end i am resolved to retire from the world with all its flatteries and deceits and will hide myself in solitude without any other care than to compose my thoughts and regulate my hours by a constant succession of innocent occupations till with a mind purified from all earthly desires i shall enter into that state to which all are hastening and in which i hope again to enjoy the friendship of pekuah do not entangle your mind said imlac by irrevocable determinations nor increase the burden of life by a voluntary accumulation of misery the weariness of retirement will continue or increase when the loss of pekuah is forgotten that you have been deprived of one pleasure is no very good reason for rejection of the rest since pekuah was taken from me said the princess i have no pleasure to reject or to retain she that has no one to love or trust has little to hope she wants the radical principle of happiness we may perhaps allow that what satisfaction this world can afford must arise from the conjunction of wealth knowledge and goodness wealth is nothing but as it is bestowed and knowledge nothing but as it is communicated they must therefore be imparted to others and to whom could i now delight to impart them goodness affords the only comfort which can be enjoyed without a partner and goodness may be practised in retirement how far solitude may admit goodness or advance it i shall not replied imlac dispute at present remember the confession of the pious hermit you will wish to return into the world when the image of your companion has left your thoughts that time said nekayah will never come the generous frankness the modest obsequiousness and the faithful secrecy of my dear pekuah will always be more missed as i shall live longer to see vice and folly the state of a mind oppressed with a sudden calamity said imlac is like that of the fabulous inhabitants of the newcreated earth who when the first night came upon them supposed that day would never return when the clouds of sorrow gather over us we see nothing beyond them nor can imagine how they will be dispelled yet a new day succeeded to the night and sorrow is never long without a dawn of ease but they who restrain themselves from receiving comfort do as the savages would have done had they put out their eyes when it was dark our minds like our bodies are in continual flux something is hourly lost and something acquired to lose much at once is inconvenient to either but while the vital powers remain uninjured nature will find the means of reparation distance has the same effect on the mind as on the eye and while we glide along the stream of time whatever we leave behind us is always lessening and that which we approach increasing in magnitude do not suffer life to stagnate it will grow muddy for want of motion commit yourself again to the current of the world pekuah will vanish by degrees you will meet in your way some other favourite or learn to diffuse yourself in general conversation at least said the prince do not despair before all remedies have been tried the inquiry after the unfortunate lady is still continued and shall be carried on with yet greater diligence on condition that you will promise to wait a year for the event without any unalterable resolution nekayah thought this a reasonable demand and made the promise to her brother who had been advised by imlac to require it imlac had indeed no great hope of regaining pekuah but he supposed that if he could secure the interval of a year the princess would be then in no danger of a cloister chap xxxvi pekuah is still remembered the progress of sorrow nekayah seeing that nothing was omitted for the recovery of her favourite and having by her promise set her intention of retirement at a distance began imperceptibly to return to common cares and common pleasures she rejoiced without her own consent at the suspension of her sorrows and sometimes caught herself with indignation in the act of turning away her mind from the remembrance of her whom yet she resolved never to forget she then appointed a certain hour of the day for meditation on the merits and fondness of pekuah and for some weeks retired constantly at the time fixed and returned with her eyes swollen and her countenance clouded by degrees she grew less scrupulous and suffered any important and pressing avocation to delay the tribute of daily tears she then yielded to less occasions sometimes forgot what she was indeed afraid to remember and at last wholly released herself from the duty of periodical affliction her real love of pekuah was yet not diminished a thousand occurrences brought her back to memory and a thousand wants which nothing but the confidence of friendship can supply made her frequently regretted she therefore solicited imlac never to desist from inquiry and to leave no art of intelligence untried that at least she might have the comfort of knowing that she did not suffer by negligence or sluggishness yet what said she is to be expected from our pursuit of happiness when we find the state of life to be such that happiness itself is the cause of misery why should we endeavour to attain that of which the possession cannot be secured i shall henceforward fear to yield my heart to excellence however bright or to fondness however tender lest i should lose again what i have lost in pekuah chap xxxvii the princess hears news of pekuah in seven months one of the messengers who had been sent away upon the day when the promise was drawn from the princess returned after many unsuccessful rambles from the borders of nubia with an account that pekuah was in the hands of an arab chief who possessed a castle or fortress on the extremity of egypt the arab whose revenue was plunder was willing to restore her with her two attendants for two hundred ounces of gold the price was no subject of debate the princess was in ecstasies when she heard that her favourite was alive and might so cheaply be ransomed she could not think of delaying for a moment pekuahs happiness or her own but entreated her brother to send back the messenger with the sum required imlac being consulted was not very confident of the veracity of the relater and was still more doubtful of the arabs faith who might if he were too liberally trusted detain at once the money and the captives he thought it dangerous to put themselves in the power of the arab by going into his district and could not expect that the rover would so much expose himself as to come into the lower country where he might be seized by the forces of the bassa it is difficult to negotiate where neither will trust but imlac after some deliberation directed the messenger to propose that pekuah should be conducted by ten horsemen to the monastery of st anthony which is situated in the deserts of upper egypt where she should be met by the same number and her ransome should be paid that no time might be lost as they expected that the proposal would not be refused they immediately began their journey to the monastery and when they arrived imlac went forward with the former messenger to the arabs fortress rasselas was desirous to go with them but neither his sister nor imlac would consent the arab according to the custom of his nation observed the laws of hospitality with great exactness to those who put themselves into his power and in a few days brought pekuah with her maids by easy journeys to the place appointed where receiving the stipulated price he restored her with great respect to liberty and her friends and undertook to conduct them back towards cairo beyond all danger of robbery or violence the princess and her favourite embraced each other with transport too violent to be expressed and went out together to pour the tears of tenderness in secret and exchange professions of kindness and gratitude after a few hours they returned into the refectory of the convent where in the presence of the prior and his brethren the prince required of pekuah the history of her adventures chap xxxviii the adventures of the lady pekuah at what time and in what manner i was forced away said pekuah your servants have told you the suddenness of the event struck me with surprise and i was at first rather stupified than agitated with any passion of either fear or sorrow my confusion was increased by the speed and tumult of our flight while we were followed by the turks who as it seemed soon despaired to overtake us or were afraid of those whom they made a show of menacing when the arabs saw themselves out of danger they slackened their course and as i was less harassed by external violence i began to feel more uneasiness in my mind after some time we stopped near a spring shaded with trees in a pleasant meadow where we were set upon the ground and offered such refreshments as our masters were partaking i was suffered to sit with my maids apart from the rest and none attempted to comfort or insult us here i first began to feel the full weight of my misery the girls sat weeping in silence and from time to time looked on me for succour i knew not to what condition we were doomed nor could conjecture where would be the place of our captivity or whence to draw any hope of deliverance i was in the hands of robbers and savages and had no reason to suppose that their pity was more than their justice or that they would forbear the gratification of any ardour of desire or caprice of cruelty i however kissed my maids and endeavoured to pacify them by remarking that we were yet treated with decency and that since we were now carried beyond pursuit there was no danger of violence to our lives when we were to be set again on horseback my maids clung round me and refused to be parted but i commanded them not to irritate those who had us in their power we travelled the remaining part of the day through an unfrequented and pathless country and came by moonlight to the side of a hill where the rest of the troop was stationed their tents were pitched and their fires kindled and our chief was welcomed as a man much beloved by his dependants we were received into a large tent where we found women who had attended their husbands in the expedition they set before us the supper which they had provided and i ate rather to encourage my maids than to comply with any appetite of my own when the meat was taken away they spread the carpets for repose i was weary and hoped to find in sleep that remission of distress which nature seldom denies ordering myself therefore to be undressed i observed that the women looked submissively attended when my upper vest was taken off they were apparently struck with the splendour of my clothes and one of them timorously laid her hand upon the embroidery she then went out and in a short time came back with another woman who seemed to be of higher rank and greater authority she did at her entrance the usual act of reverence and taking me by the hand placed me in a smaller tent spread with finer carpets where i spent the night quietly with my maids in the morning as i was sitting on the grass the chief of the troop came towards me i rose up to receive him and he bowed with great respect illustrious lady said he my fortune is better than i had presumed to hope i am told by my women that i have a princess in my camp sir answered i your women have deceived themselves and you i am not a princess but an unhappy stranger who intended soon to have left this country in which i am now to be imprisoned for ever whoever or whencesoever you are returned the arab your dress and that of your servants show your rank to be high and your wealth to be great why should you who can so easily procure your ransome think yourself in danger of perpetual captivity the purpose of my incursions is to increase my riches or more properly to gather tribute the sons of ishmael are the natural and hereditary lords of this part of the continent which is usurped by late invaders and lowborn tyrants from whom we are compelled to take by the sword what is denied to justice the violence of war admits no distinction the lance that is lifted at guilt and power will sometimes fall on innocence and gentleness how little said i did i expect that yesterday it should have fallen upon me misfortunes answered the arab should always be expected if the eye of hostility could learn reverence or pity excellence like yours had been exempt from injury but the angels of affliction spread their toils alike for the virtuous and the wicked for the mighty and the mean do not be disconsolate i am not one of the lawless and cruel rovers of the desert i know the rules of civil life i will fix your ransome give a passport to your messenger and perform my stipulation with nice punctuality you will easily believe that i was pleased with his courtesy and finding that his predominant passion was desire of money i began now to think my danger less for i knew that no sum would be thought too great for the release of pekuah i told him that he should have no reason to charge me with ingratitude if i was used with kindness and that any ransome which could be expected for a maid of common rank would be paid but that he must not persist to rate me as a princess he said he would consider what he should demand and then smiling bowed and retired soon after the women came about me each contending to be more officious than the other and my maids themselves were served with reverence we travelled onwards by short journeys on the fourth day the chief told me that my ransome must be two hundred ounces of gold which i not only promised him but told him that i would add fifty more if i and my maids were honourably treated i never knew the power of gold before from that time i was the leader of the troop the march of every day was longer or shorter as i commanded and the tents were pitched where i chose to rest we now had camels and other conveniencies for travel my own women were always at my side and i amused myself with observing the manners of the vagrant nations and with viewing remains of ancient edifices with which these deserted countries appear to have been in some distant age lavishly embellished the chief of the band was a man far from illiterate he was able to travel by the stars or the compass and had marked in his erratick expeditions such places as are most worthy the notice of a passenger he observed to me that buildings are always best preserved in places little frequented and difficult of access for when once a country declines from its primitive splendour the more inhabitants are left the quicker ruin will be made walls supply stones more easily than quarries and palaces and temples will be demolished to make stables of granite and cottages of porphyry chap xxxix the adventures of pekuah continued we wandered about in this manner for some weeks whether as our chief pretended for my gratification or as i rather suspected for some convenience of his own i endeavoured to appear contented where sullenness and resentment would have been of no use and that endeavour conduced much to the calmness of my mind but my heart was always with nekayah and the troubles of the night much overbalanced the amusements of the day my women who threw all their cares upon their mistress set their minds at ease from the time when they saw me treated with respect and gave themselves up to the incidental alleviations of our fatigue without solicitude or sorrow i was pleased with their pleasure and animated with their confidence my condition had lost much of its terrour since i found that the arab ranged the country merely to get riches avarice is an uniform and tractable vice other intellectual distempers are different in different constitutions of mind that which sooths the pride of one will offend the pride of another but to the favour of the covetous there is a ready way bring money and nothing is denied at last we came to the dwelling of our chief a strong and spacious house built with stone in an island of the nile which lies as i was told under the tropick lady said the arab you shall rest after your journey a few weeks in this place where you are to consider yourself as sovereign my occupation is war i have therefore chosen this obscure residence from which i can issue unexpected and to which i can retire unpursued you may now repose in security here are few pleasures but here is no danger he then led me into the inner apartments and seating me on the richest couch bowed to the ground his women who considered me as a rival looked on me with malignity but being soon informed that i was a great lady detained only for my ransome they began to vie with each other in obsequiousness and reverence being again comforted with new assurances of speedy liberty i was for some days diverted from impatience by the novelty of the place the turrets overlooked the country to a great distance and afforded a view of many windings of the stream in the day i wandered from one place to another as the course of the sun varied the splendour of the prospect and saw many things which i had never seen before the crocodiles and riverhorses are common in this unpeopled region and i often looked upon them with terrour though i knew that they could not hurt me for some time i expected to see mermaids and tritons which as imlac has told me the european travellers have stationed in the nile but no such beings ever appeared and the arab when i inquired after them laughed at my credulity at night the arab always attended me to a tower set apart for celestial observations where he endeavoured to teach me the names and courses of the stars i had no great inclination to this study but an appearance of attention was necessary to please my instructer who valued himself for his skill and in a little while i found some employment requisite to beguile the tediousness of time which was to be passed always amidst the same objects i was weary of looking in the morning on things from which i had turned away weary in the evening i therefore was at last willing to observe the stars rather than do nothing but could not always compose my thoughts and was very often thinking on nekayah when others imagined me contemplating the sky soon after the arab went upon another expedition and then my only pleasure was to talk with my maids about the accident by which we were carried away and the happiness that we should all enjoy at the end of our captivity there were women in your arabs fortress said the princess why did you not make them your companions enjoy their conversation and partake their diversions in a place where they found business or amusement why should you alone sit corroded with idle melancholy or why could not you bear for a few months that condition to which they were condemned for life the diversions of the women answered pekuah were only childish play by which the mind accustomed to stronger operations could not be kept busy i could do all which they delighted in doing by powers merely sensitive while my intellectual faculties were flown to cairo they ran from room to room as a bird hops from wire to wire in his cage they danced for the sake of motion as lambs frisk in a meadow one sometimes pretended to be hurt that the rest might be alarmed or hid herself that another might seek her part of their time passed in watching the progress of light bodies that floated on the river and part in marking the various forms into which clouds broke in the sky their business was only needlework in which i and my maids sometimes helped them but you know that the mind will easily straggle from the fingers nor will you suspect that captivity and absence from nekayah could receive solace from silken flowers nor was much satisfaction to be hoped from their conversation for of what could they be expected to talk they had seen nothing for they had lived from early youth in that narrow spot of what they had not seen they could have no knowledge for they could not read they had no ideas but of the few things that were within their view and had hardly names for any thing but their clothes and their food as i bore a superiour character i was often called to terminate their quarrels which i decided as equitably as i could if it could have amused me to hear the complaints of each against the rest i might have been often detained by long stories but the motives of their animosity were so small that i could not listen without intercepting the tale how said rasselas can the arab whom you represented as a man of more than common accomplishments take any pleasure in his seraglio when it is filled only with women like these are they exquisitely beautiful they do not said pekuah want that unaffecting and ignoble beauty which may subsist without sprightliness or sublimity without energy of thought or dignity of virtue but to a man like the arab such beauty was only a flower casually plucked and carelessly thrown away whatever pleasures he might find among them they were not those of friendship or society when they were playing about him he looked on them with inattentive superiority when they vied for his regard he sometimes turned away disgusted as they had no knowledge their talk could take nothing from the tediousness of life as they had no choice their fondness or appearance of fondness excited in him neither pride nor gratitude he was not exalted in his own esteem by the smiles of a woman who saw no other man nor was much obliged by that regard of which he could never know the sincerity and which he might often perceive to be exerted not so much to delight him as to pain a rival that which he gave and they received as love was only a careless distribution of superfluous time such love as man can bestow upon that which he despises such as has neither hope nor fear neither joy nor sorrow you have reason lady to think yourself happy said imlac that you have been thus easily dismissed how could a mind hungry for knowledge be willing in an intellectual famine to lose such a banquet as pekuahs conversation i am inclined to believe answered pekuah that he was for sometime in suspense for notwithstanding his promise whenever i proposed to despatch a messenger to cairo he found some excuse for delay while i was detained in his house he made many incursions into the neighbouring countries and perhaps he would have refused to discharge me had his plunder been equal to his wishes he returned always courteous related his adventures delighted to hear my observations and endeavoured to advance my acquaintance with the stars when i importuned him to send away my letters he soothed me with professions of honour and sincerity and when i could be no longer decently denied put his troop again in motion and left me to govern in his absence i was much afflicted by this studied procrastination and was sometimes afraid that i should be forgotten that you would leave cairo and i must end my days in an island of the nile i grew at last hopeless and dejected and cared so little to entertain him that he for awhile more frequently talked with my maids that he should fall in love with them or with me might have been equally fatal and i was not much pleased with the growing friendship my anxiety was not long for as i recovered some degree of cheerfulness he returned to me and i could not forbear to despise my former uneasiness he still delayed to send for my ransome and would perhaps never have determined had not your agent found his way to him the gold which he would not fetch he could not reject when it was offered he hastened to prepare for our journey hither like a man delivered from the pain of an intestine conflict i took leave of my companions in the house who dismissed me with cold indifference nekayah having heard her favourites relation rose and embraced her and rasselas gave her a hundred ounces of gold which she presented to the arab for the fifty that were promised chap xl the history of a man of learning they returned to cairo and were so well pleased at finding themselves together that none of them went much abroad the prince began to love learning and one day declared to imlac that he intended to devote himself to science and pass the rest of his days in literary solitude before you make your final choice answered imlac you ought to examine its hazards and converse with some of those who are grown old in the company of themselves i have just left the observatory of one of the most learned astronomers in the world who has spent forty years in unwearied attention to the motions and appearances of the celestial bodies and has drawn out his soul in endless calculations he admits a few friends once a month to hear his deductions and enjoy his discoveries i was introduced as a man of knowledge worthy of his notice men of various ideas and fluent conversation are commonly welcome to those whose thoughts have been long fixed upon a single point and who find the images of other things stealing away i delighted him with my remarks he smiled at the narrative of my travels and was glad to forget the constellations and descend for a moment into the lower world on the next day of vacation i renewed my visit and was so fortunate as to please him again he relaxed from that time the severity of his rule and permitted me to enter at my own choice i found him always busy and always glad to be relieved as each knew much which the other was desirous of learning we exchanged our notions with great delight i perceived that i had every day more of his confidence and always found new cause of admiration in the profundity of his mind his comprehension is vast his memory capacious and retentive his discourse is methodical and his expression clear his integrity and benevolence are equal to his learning his deepest researches and most favourite studies are willingly interrupted for any opportunity of doing good by his counsel or his riches to his closest retreat at his most busy moments all are admitted that want his assistance for though i exclude idleness and pleasure i will never says he bar my doors against charity to man is permitted the contemplation of the skies but the practice of virtue is commanded surely said the princess this man is happy i visited him said imlac with more and more frequency and was every time more enamoured of his conversation he was sublime without haughtiness courteous without formality and communicative without ostentation i was at first great princess of your opinion thought him the happiest of mankind and often congratulated him on the blessing that he enjoyed he seemed to hear nothing with indifference but the praises of his condition to which he always returned a general answer and diverted the conversation to some other topick amidst this willingness to be pleased and labour to please i had quickly reason to imagine that some painful sentiment pressed upon his mind he often looked up earnestly towards the sun and let his voice fall in the midst of his discourse he would sometimes when we were alone gaze upon me in silence with the air of a man who longed to speak what he was yet resolved to suppress he would often send for me with vehement injunctions of haste though when i came to him he had nothing extraordinary to say and sometimes when i was leaving him would call me back pause a few moments and then dismiss me chap xli the astronomer discovers the cause of his uneasiness at last the time came when the secret burst his reserve we were sitting together last night in the turret of his house watching the emersion of a satellite of jupiter a sudden tempest clouded the sky and disappointed our observation we sat awhile silent in the dark and then he addressed himself to me in these words imlac i have long considered thy friendship as the greatest blessing of my life integrity without knowledge is weak and useless and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful i have found in thee all the qualities requisite for trust benevolence experience and fortitude i have long discharged an office which i must soon quit at the call of nature and shall rejoice in the hour of imbecility and pain to devolve it upon thee i thought myself honoured by this testimony and protested that whatever could conduce to his happiness would add likewise to mine hear imlac what thou wilt not without difficulty credit i have possessed for five years the regulation of weather and the distribution of the seasons the sun has listened to my dictates and passed from tropick to tropick by my direction the clouds at my call have poured their waters and the nile has overflowed at my command i have restrained the rage of the dogstar and mitigated the fervours of the crab the winds alone of all the elemental powers have hitherto refused my authority and multitudes have perished by equinoctial tempests which i found myself unable to prohibit or restrain i have administered this great office with exact justice and made to the different nations of the earth an impartial dividend of rain and sunshine what must have been the misery of half the globe if i had limited the clouds to particular regions or confined the sun to either side of the equator chap xlii the opinion of the astronomer is explained and justified i suppose he discovered in me through the obscurity of the room some tokens of amazement and doubt for after a short pause he proceeded thus not to be easily credited will neither surprise nor offend me for i am probably the first of human beings to whom this trust has been imparted nor do i know whether to deem this distinction a reward or punishment since i have possessed it i have been far less happy than before and nothing but the consciousness of good intention could have enabled me to support the weariness of unremitted vigilance how long sir said i has this great office been in your hands about ten years ago said he my daily observations of the changes of the sky led me to consider whether if i had the power of the seasons i could confer greater plenty upon the inhabitants of the earth this contemplation fastened on my mind and i sat days and nights in imaginary dominion pouring upon this country and that the showers of fertility and seconding every fall of rain with a due proportion of sunshine i had yet only the will to do good and did not imagine that i should ever have the power one day as i was looking on the fields withering with heat i felt in my mind a sudden wish that i could send rain on the southern mountains and raise the nile to an inundation in the hurry of my imagination i commanded rain to fall and by comparing the time of my command with that of the inundation i found that the clouds had listened to my lips might not some other cause said i produce this concurrence the nile does not always rise on the same day do not believe said he with impatience that such objections could escape me i reasoned long against my own conviction and laboured against truth with the utmost obstinacy i sometimes suspected myself of madness and should not have dared to impart this secret but to a man like you capable of distinguishing the wonderful from the impossible and the incredible from the false why sir said i do you call that incredible which you know or think you know to be true because said he i cannot prove it by any external evidence and i know too well the laws of demonstration to think that my conviction ought to influence another who cannot like me be conscious of its force i therefore shall not attempt to gain credit by disputation it is sufficient that i feel this power that i have long possessed and every day exerted it but the life of man is short the infirmities of age increase upon me and the time will soon come when the regulator of the year must mingle with the dust the care of appointing a successour has long disturbed me the night and the day have been spent in comparisons of all the characters which have come to my knowledge and i have yet found none so worthy as thyself chap xliii the astronomer leaves imlac his directions hear therefore what i shall impart with attention such as the welfare of the world requires if the task of a king be considered as difficult who has the care only of a few millions to whom he cannot do much good or harm what must be the anxiety of him on whom depends the action of the elements and the great gifts of light and heat hear me therefore with attention i have diligently considered the position of the earth and sun and formed innumerable schemes in which i changed their situation i have sometimes turned aside the axis of the earth and sometimes varied the ecliptick of the sun but i have found it impossible to make a disposition by which the world may be advantaged what one region gains another loses by an imaginable alteration even without considering the distant parts of the solar system with which ye are unacquainted do not therefore in thy administration of the year indulge thy pride by innovation do not please thyself with thinking that thou canst make thyself renowned to all future ages by disordering the seasons the memory of mischief is no desirable fame much less will it become thee to let kindness or interest prevail never rob other countries of rain to pour it on thine own for us the nile is sufficient i promised that when i possessed the power i would use it with inflexible integrity and he dismissed me pressing my hand my heart said he will be now at rest and my benevolence will no more destroy my quiet i have found a man of wisdom and virtue to whom i can cheerfully bequeath the inheritance of the sun the prince heard this narration with very serious regard but the princess smiled and pekuah convulsed herself with laughter ladies said imlac to mock the heaviest of human afflictions is neither charitable nor wise few can attain this mans knowledge and few practise his virtues but all may suffer his calamity of the uncertainties of our present state the most dreadful and alarming is the uncertain continuance of reason the princess was recollected and the favourite was abashed rasselas more deeply affected inquired of imlac whether he thought such maladies of the mind frequent and how they were contracted chap xliv the dangerous prevalence of imagination disorders of intellect answered imlac happen much more often than superficial observers will easily believe perhaps if we speak with rigorous exactness no human mind is in its right statea there is no man whose imagination does not sometimes predominate over his reason who can regulate his attention wholly by his will and whose ideas will come and go at his command no man will be found in whose mind airy notions do not sometimes tyrannize and force him to hope or fear beyond the limits of sober probability all power of fancy over reason is a degree of insanity but while this power is such as we can control and repress it is not visible to others nor considered as any deprivation of the mental faculties it is not pronounced madness but when it becomes ungovernable and apparently influences speech or action to indulge the power of fiction and send imagination out upon the wing is often the sport of those who delight too much in silent speculation when we are alone we are not always busy the labour of excogitation is too violent to last long the ardour of inquiry will sometimes give way to idleness or satiety he who has nothing external that can divert him must find pleasure in his own thoughts and must conceive himself what he is not for who is pleased with what he is he then expatiates in boundless futurity and culls from all imaginable conditions that which for the present moment he should most desire amuses his desires with impossible enjoyments and confers upon his pride unattainable dominion the mind dances from scene to scene unites all pleasures in all combinations and riots in delights which nature and fortune with all their bounty cannot bestow in time some particular train of ideas fixes the attention all other intellectual gratifications are rejected the mind in weariness or leisure recurs constantly to the favourite conception and feasts on the luscious falsehood whenever she is offended with the bitterness of truth by degrees the reign of fancy is confirmed she grows first imperious and in time despotick then fictions begin to operate as realities false opinions fasten upon the mind and life passes in dreams of rapture or of anguish this sir is one of the dangers of solitude which the hermit has confessed not always to promote goodness and the astronomers misery has proved to be not always propitious to wisdom i will no more said the favourite imagine myself the queen of abissinia i have often spent the hours which the princess gave to my own disposal in adjusting ceremonies and regulating the court i have repressed the pride of the powerful and granted the petitions of the poor i have built new palaces in more happy situations planted groves upon the tops of mountains and have exulted in the beneficence of royalty till when the princess entered i had almost forgotten to bow down before her and i said the princess will not allow myself any more to play the shepherdess in my waking dreams i have often soothed my thoughts with the quiet and innocence of pastoral employments till i have in my chamber heard the winds whistle and the sheep bleat sometimes freed the lamb entangled in the thicket and sometimes with my crook encountered the wolf i have a dress like that of the village maids which i put on to help my imagination and a pipe on which i play softly and suppose myself followed by my flocks i will confess said the prince an indulgence of fantastick delight more dangerous than yours i have frequently endeavoured to image the possibility of a perfect government by which all wrong should be restrained all vice reformed and all the subjects preserved in tranquillity and innocence this thought produced innumerable schemes of reformation and dictated many useful regulations and salutary edicts this has been the sport and sometimes the labour of my solitude and i start when i think with how little anguish i once supposed the death of my father and my brothers such said imlac are the effects of visionary schemes when we first form them we know them to be absurd but familiarize them by degrees and in time lose sight of their folly a see traite mdicophilosophique sur lalination mentale par pinel dr willis defined in remarkable accordance with this case in rasselas insanity to be the tendency of a mind to cherish one idea or one set of ideas to the exclusion of others ed chap xlv they discourse with an old man the evening was now far past and they rose to return home as they walked along the bank of the nile delighted with the beams of the moon quivering on the water they saw at a small distance an old man whom the prince had often heard in the assembly of the sages yonder said he is one whose years have calmed his passions but not clouded his reason let us close the disquisitions of the night by inquiring what are his sentiments of his own state that we may know whether youth alone is to struggle with vexation and whether any better hope remains for the latter part of life here the sage approached and saluted them they invited him to join their walk and prattled awhile as acquaintance that had unexpectedly met one another the old man was cheerful and talkative and the way seemed short in his company he was pleased to find himself not disregarded accompanied them to their house and at the princes request entered with them they placed him in the seat of honour and set wine and conserves before him sir said the princess an evening walk must give to a man of learning like you pleasures which ignorance and youth can hardly conceive you know the qualities and the causes of all that you behold the laws by which the river flows the periods in which the planets perform their revolutions every thing must supply you with contemplation and renew the consciousness of your own dignity lady answered he let the gay and the vigorous expect pleasure in their excursions it is enough that age can obtain ease to me the world has lost its novelty i look round and see what i remember to have seen in happier days i rest against a tree and consider that in the same shade i once disputed upon the annual overflow of the nile with a friend who is now silent in the grave i cast my eyes upwards fix them on the changing moon and think with pain on the vicissitudes of life i have ceased to take much delight in physical truth for what have i to do with those things which i am soon to leave you may at least recreate yourself said imlac with the recollection of an honourable and useful life and enjoy the praise which all agree to give you praise said the sage with a sigh is to an old man an empty sound i have neither mother to be delighted with the reputation of her son nor wife to partake the honours of her husband i have outlived my friends and my rivals nothing is now of much importance for i cannot extend my interest beyond myself youth is delighted with applause because it is considered as the earnest of some future good and because the prospect of life is far extended but to me who am now declining to decrepitude there is little to be feared from the malevolence of men and yet less to be hoped from their affection or esteem something they may yet take away but they can give me nothing riches would now be useless and high employment would be pain my retrospect of life recalls to my view many opportunities of good neglected much time squandered upon trifles and more lost in idleness and vacancy i leave many great designs unattempted and many great attempts unfinished my mind is burdened with no heavy crime and therefore i compose myself to tranquillity endeavour to abstract my thoughts from hopes and cares which though reason knows them to be vain still try to keep their old possession of the heart expect with serene humility that hour which nature cannot long delay and hope to possess in a better state that happiness which here i could not find and that virtue which here i have not attained he rose and went away leaving his audience not much elated with the hope of long life the prince consoled himself with remarking that it was not reasonable to be disappointed by this account for age had never been considered as the season of felicity and if it was possible to be easy in decline and weakness it was likely that the days of vigour and alacrity might be happy that the noon of life might be bright if the evening could be calm the princess suspected that age was querulous and malignant and delighted to repress the expectations of those who had newly entered the world she had seen the possessours of estates look with envy on their heirs and known many who enjoyed pleasure no longer than they could confine it to themselves pekuah conjectured that the man was older than he appeared and was willing to impute his complaints to delirious dejection or else supposed that he had been unfortunate and was therefore discontented for nothing said she is more common than to call our own condition the condition of life imlac who had no desire to see them depressed smiled at the comforts which they could so readily procure to themselves and remembered that at the same age he was equally confident of unmingled prosperity and equally fertile of consolatory expedients he forbore to force upon them unwelcome knowledge which time itself would too soon impress the princess and her lady retired the madness of the astronomer hung on their minds and they desired imlac to enter upon his office and delay next morning the rising of the sun chap xlvi the princess and pekuah visit the astronomer the princess and pekuah having talked in private of imlacs astronomer thought his character at once so amiable and so strange that they could not be satisfied without a nearer knowledge and imlac was requested to find the means of bringing them together this was somewhat difficult the philosopher had never received any visits from women though he lived in a city that had in it many europeans who followed the manners of their own countries and many from other parts of the world that lived there with european liberty the ladies would not be refused and several schemes were proposed for the accomplishment of their design it was proposed to introduce them as strangers in distress to whom the sage was always accessible but after some deliberation it appeared that by this artifice no acquaintance could be formed for their conversation would be short and they could not decently importune him often this said rasselas is true but i have yet a stronger objection against the misrepresentation of your state i have always considered it as treason against the great republick of human nature to make any mans virtues the means of deceiving him whether on great or little occasions all imposture weakens confidence and chills benevolence when the sage finds that you are not what you seemed he will feel the resentment natural to a man who conscious of great abilities discovers that he has been tricked by understandings meaner than his own and perhaps the distrust which he can never afterwards wholly lay aside may stop the voice of counsel and close the hand of charity and where will you find the power of restoring his benefactions to mankind or his peace to himself to this no reply was attempted and imlac began to hope that their curiosity would subside but next day pekuah told him she had now found an honest pretence for a visit to the astronomer for she would solicit permission to continue under him the studies in which she had been initiated by the arab and the princess might go with her either as a fellowstudent or because a woman could not decently come alone i am afraid said imlac that he will be soon weary of your company men advanced far in knowledge do not love to repeat the elements of their art and i am not certain that even of the elements as he will deliver them connected with inferences and mingled with reflections you are a very capable auditress that said pekuah must be my care i ask of you only to take me thither my knowledge is perhaps more than you imagine it and by concurring always with his opinions i shall make him think it greater than it is the astronomer in pursuance of this resolution was told that a foreign lady travelling in search of knowledge had heard of his reputation and was desirous to become his scholar the uncommonness of the proposal raised at once his surprise and curiosity and when after a short deliberation he consented to admit her he could not stay without impatience till the next day the ladies dressed themselves magnificently and were attended by imlac to the astronomer who was pleased to see himself approached with respect by persons of so splendid an appearance in the exchange of the first civilities he was timorous and bashful but when the talk became regular he recollected his powers and justified the character which imlac had given inquiring of pekuah what could have turned her inclination toward astronomy he received from her a history of her adventure at the pyramid and of the time passed in the arabs island she told her tale with ease and elegance and her conversation took possession of his heart the discourse was then turned to astronomy pekuah displayed what she knew he looked upon her as a prodigy of genius and entreated her not to desist from a study which she had so happily begun they came again and again and were every time more welcome than before the sage endeavoured to amuse them that they might prolong their visits for he found his thoughts grow brighter in their company the clouds of solicitude vanished by degrees as he forced himself to entertain them and he grieved when he was left at their departure to his old employment of regulating the seasons the princess and her favourite had now watched his lips for several months and could not catch a single word from which they could judge whether he continued or not in the opinion of his preternatural commission they often contrived to bring him to an open declaration but he easily eluded all their attacks and on which side soever they pressed him escaped from them to some other topick as their familiarity increased they invited him often to the house of imlac where they distinguished him by extraordinary respect he began gradually to delight in sublunary pleasures he came early and departed late laboured to recommend himself by assiduity and compliance excited their curiosity after new arts that they might still want his assistance and when they made any excursion of pleasure or inquiry entreated to attend them by long experience of his integrity and wisdom the prince and his sister were convinced that he might be trusted without danger and lest he should draw any false hopes from the civilities which he received discovered to him their condition with the motives of their journey and required his opinion on the choice of life of the various conditions which the world spreads before you which you shall prefer said the sage i am not able to instruct you i can only tell that i have chosen wrong i have passed my time in study without experience in the attainment of sciences which can for the most part be but remotely useful to mankind i have purchased knowledge at the expense of all the common comforts of life i have missed the endearing elegance of female friendship and the happy commerce of domestick tenderness if i have obtained any prerogatives above other students they have been accompanied with fear disquiet and scrupulosity but even of these prerogatives whatever they were i have since my thoughts have been diversified by more intercourse with the world begun to question the reality when i have been for a few days lost in pleasing dissipation i am always tempted to think that my inquiries have ended in errour and that i have suffered much and suffered it in vain imlac was delighted to find that the sages understanding was breaking through its mists and resolved to detain him from the planets till he should forget his task of ruling them and reason should recover its original influence from this time the astronomer was received into familiar friendship and partook of all their projects and pleasures his respect kept him attentive and the activity of rasselas did not leave much time unengaged something was always to be done the day was spent in making observations which furnished talk for the evening and the evening was closed with a scheme for the morrow the sage confessed to imlac that since he had mingled in the gay tumults of life and divided his hours by a succession of amusements he found the conviction of his authority over the skies fade gradually from his mind and began to trust less to an opinion which he never could prove to others and which he now found subject to variation from causes in which reason had no part if i am accidentally left alone for a few hours said he my inveterate persuasion rushes upon my soul and my thoughts are chained down by some irresistible violence but they are soon disentangled by the princes conversation and instantaneously released at the entrance of pekuah i am like a man habitually afraid of spectres who is set at ease by a lamp and wonders at the dread which harassed him in the dark yet if his lamp be extinguished feels again the terrours which he knows that when it is light he shall feel no more but i am sometimes afraid lest i indulge my quiet by criminal negligence and voluntarily forget the great charge with which i am intrusted if i favour myself in a known errour or am determined by my own ease in a doubtful question of this importance how dreadful is my crime no disease of the imagination answered imlac is so difficult of cure as that which is complicated with the dread of guilt fancy and conscience then act interchangeably upon us and so often shift their places that the illusions of one are not distinguished from the dictates of the other if fancy presents images not moral or religious the mind drives them away when they give it pain but when melancholick notions take the form of duty they lay hold on the faculties without opposition because we are afraid to exclude or banish them for this reason the superstitious are often melancholy and the melancholy almost always superstitious but do not let the suggestions of timidity overpower your better reason the danger of neglect can be but as the probability of the obligation which when you consider it with freedom you find very little and that little growing every day less open your heart to the influence of the light which from time to time breaks in upon you when scruples importune you which you in your lucid moments know to be vain do not stand to parley but fly to business or to pekuah and keep this thought always prevalent that you are only one atom of the mass of humanity and have neither such virtue nor vice as that you should be singled out for supernatural favours or afflictions chap xlvii the prince enters and brings a new topick all this said the astronomer i have often thought but my reason has been so long subjugated by an uncontroulable and overwhelming idea that it durst not confide in its own decisions i now see how fatally i betrayed my quiet by suffering chimeras to prey upon me in secret but melancholy shrinks from communication and i never found a man before to whom i could impart my troubles though i had been certain of relief i rejoice to find my own sentiments confirmed by yours who are not easily deceived and can have no motive or purpose to deceive i hope that time and variety will dissipate the gloom that has so long surrounded me and the latter part of my days will be spent in peace your learning and virtue said imlac may justly give you hopes rasselas then entered with the princess and pekuah and inquired whether they had contrived any new diversion for the next day such said nekayah is the state of life that none are happy but by the anticipation of change the change itself is nothing when we have made it the next wish is to change again the world is not yet exhausted let me see something tomorrow which i never saw before variety said rasselas is so necessary to content that even the happy valley disgusted me by the recurrence of its luxuries yet i could not forbear to reproach myself with impatience when i saw the monks of st anthony support without complaint a life not of uniform delight but uniform hardship those men answered imlac are less wretched in their silent convent than the abissinian princes in their prison of pleasure whatever is done by the monks is incited by an adequate and reasonable motive their labour supplies them with necessaries it therefore cannot be omitted and is certainly rewarded their devotion prepares them for another state and reminds them of its approach while it fits them for it their time is regularly distributed one duty succeeds another so that they are not left open to the distraction of unguided choice nor lost in the shades of listless inactivity there is a certain task to be performed at an appropriated hour and their toils are cheerful because they consider them as acts of piety by which they are always advancing towards endless felicity do you think said nekayah that the monastick rule is a more holy and less imperfect state than any other may not he equally hope for future happiness who converses openly with mankind who succours the distressed by his charity instructs the ignorant by his learning and contributes by his industry to the general system of life even though he should omit some of the mortifications which are practised in the cloister and allow himself such harmless delights as his condition may place within his reach this said imlac is a question which has long divided the wise and perplexed the good i am afraid to decide on either part he that lives well in the world is better than he that lives well in a monastery but perhaps every one is not able to stem the temptations of publick life and if he cannot conquer he may properly retreat some have little power to do good and have likewise little strength to resist evil many are weary of their conflicts with adversity and are willing to eject those passions which have long busied them in vain and many are dismissed by age and disease from the more laborious duties of society in monasteries the weak and timorous may be happily sheltered the weary may repose and the penitent may meditate those retreats of prayer and contemplation have something so congenial to the mind of man that perhaps there is scarcely one that does not propose to close his life in pious abstraction with a few associates serious as himself such said pekuah has often been my wish and i have heard the princess declare that she should not willingly die in a crowd the liberty of using harmless pleasures proceeded imlac will not be disputed but it is still to be examined what pleasures are harmless the evil of any pleasure that nekayah can image is not in the act itself but in its consequences pleasure in itself harmless may become mischievous by endearing to us a state which we know to be transient and probatory and withdrawing our thoughts from that of which every hour brings us nearer to the beginning and of which no length of time will bring us to the end mortification is not virtuous in itself nor has any other use but that it disengages us from the allurements of sense in the state of future perfection to which we all aspire there will be pleasure without danger and security without restraint the princess was silent and rasselas turning to the astronomer asked him whether he could not delay her retreat by showing her something which she had not seen before your curiosity said the sage has been so general and your pursuit of knowledge so vigorous that novelties are not now very easily to be found but what you can no longer procure from the living may be given by the dead among the wonders of this country are the catacombs or the ancient repositories in which the bodies of the earliest generations were lodged and where by the virtue of the gums which embalmed them they yet remain without corruption i know not said rasselas what pleasure the sight of the catacombs can afford but since nothing else offers i am resolved to view them and shall place this with many other things which i have done because i would do something they hired a guard of horsemen and the next day visited the catacombs when they were about to descend into the sepulchral caves pekuah said the princess we are now again invading the habitations of the dead i know that you will stay behind let me find you safe when i return no i will not be left answered pekuah i will go down between you and the prince they then all descended and roved with wonder through the labyrinth of subterraneous passages where the bodies were laid in rows on either side chap xlviii imlac discourses on the nature of the soul what reason said the prince can be given why the egyptians should thus expensively preserve those carcasses which some nations consume with fire others lay to mingle with the earth and all agree to remove from their sight as soon as decent rites can be performed the original of ancient customs said imlac is commonly unknown for the practice often continues when the cause has ceased and concerning superstitious ceremonies it is vain to conjecture for what reason did not dictate reason cannot explain i have long believed that the practice of embalming arose only from tenderness to the remains of relations or friends and to this opinion i am more inclined because it seems impossible that this care should have been general had all the dead been embalmed their repositories must in time have been more spacious than the dwellings of the living i suppose only the rich or honourable were secured from corruption and the rest left to the course of nature but it is commonly supposed that the egyptians believed the soul to live as long as the body continued undissolved and therefore tried this method of eluding death could the wise egyptians said nekayah think so grossly of the soul if the soul could once survive its separation what could it afterwards receive or suffer from the body the egyptians would doubtless think erroneously said the astronomer in the darkness of heathenism and the first dawn of philosophy the nature of the soul is still disputed amidst all our opportunities of clearer knowledge some yet say that it may be material who nevertheless believe it to be immortal some answered imlac have indeed said that the soul is material but i can scarcely believe that any man has thought it who knew how to think for all the conclusions of reason enforce the immateriality of mind and all the notices of sense and investigations of science concur to prove the unconsciousness of matter it was never supposed that cogitation is inherent in matter or that every particle is a thinking being yet if any part of matter be devoid of thought what part can we suppose to think matter can differ from matter only in form density bulk motion and direction of motion to which of these however varied or combined can consciousness be annexed to be round or square to be solid or fluid to be great or little to be moved slowly or swiftly one way or another are modes of material existence all equally alien from the nature of cogitation if matter be once without thought it can only be made to think by some new modification but all the modifications which it can admit are equally unconnected with cogitative powers but the materialists said the astronomer urge that matter may have qualities with which we are unacquainted he who will determine returned imlac against that which he knows because there may be something which he knows not he that can set hypothetical possibility against acknowledged certainty is not to be admitted among reasonable beings all that we know of matter is that matter is inert senseless and lifeless and if this conviction cannot be opposed but by referring us to something that we know not we have all the evidence that human intellect can admit if that which is known may be overruled by that which is unknown no being not omniscient can arrive at certainty yet let us not said the astronomer too arrogantly limit the creators power it is no limitation of omnipotence replied the poet to suppose that one thing is not consistent with another that the same proposition cannot be at once true and false that the same number cannot be even and odd that cogitation cannot be conferred on that which is created incapable of cogitation i know not said nekayah any great use of this question does that immateriality which in my opinion you have sufficiently proved necessarily include eternal duration of immateriality said imlac our ideas are negative and therefore obscure immateriality seems to imply a natural power of perpetual duration as a consequence of exemption from all causes of decay whatever perishes is destroyed by the solution of its contexture and separation of its parts nor can we conceive how that which has no parts and therefore admits no solution can be naturally corrupted or impaired i know not said rasselas how to conceive any thing without extension what is extended must have parts and you allow that whatever has parts may be destroyed consider your own conceptions replied imlac and the difficulty will be less you will find substance without extension an ideal form is no less real than material bulk yet an ideal form has no extension it is no less certain when you think on a pyramid that your mind possesses the idea of a pyramid than that the pyramid itself is standing what space does the idea of a pyramid occupy more than the idea of a grain of corn or how can either idea suffer laceration as is the effect such is the cause as thought such is the power that thinks a power impassive and indiscerptible but the being said nekayah whom i fear to name the being which made the soul can destroy it he surely can destroy it answered imlac since however unperishable it receives from a superiour nature its power of duration that it will not perish by any inherent cause of decay or principle of corruption may be shown by philosophy but philosophy can tell no more that it will not be annihilated by him that made it we must humbly learn from higher authority the whole assembly stood awhile silent and collected let us return said rasselas from this scene of mortality how gloomy would be these mansions of the dead to him who did not know that he should never die that what now acts shall continue its agency and what now thinks shall think on for ever those that lie here stretched before us the wise and the powerful of ancient times warn us to remember the shortness of our present state they were perhaps snatched away while they were busy like us in the choice of life to me said the princess the choice of life is become less important i hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity they then hastened out of the caverns and under the protection of their guard returned to cairo chap xlix this conclusion in which nothing is concluded it was now the time of the inundation of the nile a few days after their visit to the catacombs the river began to rise they were confined to their house the whole region being under water gave them no invitation to any excursions and being well supplied with materials for talk they diverted themselves with comparisons of the different forms of life which they had observed and with various schemes of happiness which each of them had formed pekuah was never so much charmed with any place as the convent of st anthony where the arab restored her to the princess and wished only to fill it with pious maidens and to be made prioress of the order she was weary of expectation and disgust and would gladly be fixed in some unvariable state the princess thought that of all sublunary things knowledge was the best she desired first to learn all sciences and then purposed to found a college of learned women in which she would preside that by conversing with the old and educating the young she might divide her time between the acquisition and communication of wisdom and raise up fur the next age models of prudence and patterns of piety the prince desired a little kingdom in which he might administer justice in his own person and see all the parts of government with his own eyes but he could never fix the limits of his dominion and was always adding to the number of his subjects imlac and the astronomer were contented to be driven along the stream of life without directing their course to any particular port of these wishes that they had formed they well knew that none could be obtained they deliberated awhile what was to be done and resolved when the inundation should cease to return to abissinia letters i to mr james elphinston sept th dear sir you have as i find by every kind of evidence lost an excellent mother and i hope you will not think me incapable of partaking of your grief i have a mother now eightytwo years of age whom therefore i must soon lose unless it please god that she rather should mourn for me i read the letters in which you relate your mothers death to mrs strahan and think i do myself honour when i tell you that i read them with tears but tears are neither to you nor to me of any farther use when once the tribute of nature has been paid the business of life summons us away from useless grief and calls us to the exercise of those virtues of which we are lamenting our deprivation the greatest benefit which one friend can confer upon another is to guard and excite and elevate his virtues this your mother will still perform if you diligently preserve the memory of her life and of her death a life so far as i can learn useful wise and innocent and a death resigned peaceful and holy i cannot forbear to mention that neither reason nor revelation denies you to hope that you may increase her happiness by obeying her precepts and that she may in her present state look with pleasure upon every act of virtue to which her instructions or example have contributed whether this be more than a pleasing dream or a just opinion of separate spirits is indeed of no great importance to us when we consider ourselves as acting under the eye of god yet surely there is something pleasing in the belief that our separation from those whom we love is merely corporeal and it may be a great incitement to virtuous friendship if it can be made probable that that union which has received the divine approbation shall continue to eternity there is one expedient by which you may in some degree continue her presence if you write down minutely what you remember of her from your earliest years you will read it with great pleasure and receive from it many hints of soothing recollection when time shall remove her yet farther from you and your grief shall be matured to veneration to this however painful for the present i cannot but advise you as to a source of comfort and satisfaction in the time to come for all comfort and all satisfaction is sincerely wished you by dear sir your most obliged most obedient and most humble servant sam johnson ii to mrs thrale london aug madam if you have really so good an opinion of me as you express it will not be necessary to inform you how unwillingly i miss the opportunity of coming to brighthelmstone in mr thrales company or since i cannot do what i wish first how eagerly i shall catch the second degree of pleasure by coming to you and him as soon as i can dismiss my work from my hands i am afraid to make promises even to myself but i hope that the week after the next will be the end of my present business when business is done what remains but pleasure and where should pleasure be sought but under mrs thrales influence do not blame me for a delay by which i must suffer so much and by which i suffer alone if you cannot think i am good pray think i am mending and that in time i may deserve to be dear madam your c iii to mrs thrale lichfield july madam though i have been away so much longer than i purposed or expected i have found nothing that withdraws my affections from the friends whom i left behind or which makes me less desirous of reposing at that place which your kindness and mr thrales allows me to call my home miss lucya is more kind and civil than i expected and has raised my esteem by many excellencies very noble and resplendent though a little discoloured by hoary virginity every thing else recalls to my remembrance years in which i proposed what i am afraid i have not done and promised myself pleasure which i have not found but complaint can be of no use and why then should i depress your hopes by my lamentations i suppose it is the condition of humanity to design what never will be done and to hope what never will be obtained but among the vain hopes let me not number the hope which i have of being long dear madam your c a miss lucy porter daughter to dr johnsons wife by a former husband iv to the same lichfield august madam i set out on thursday morning and found my companion to whom i was very much a stranger more agreeable than i expected we went cheerfully forward and passed the night at coventry we came in late and went out early and therefore i did not send for my cousin tom but i design to make him some amends for the omission next day we came early to lucy who was i believe glad to see us she had saved her best gooseberries upon the tree for me and as steele says i was neither too proud nor too wise to gather them i have rambled a very little inter fontes et flumina nota but i am not yet well they have cut down the trees in george lane evelyn in his book of forest trees tells us of wicked men that cut down trees and never prospered afterwards yet nothing has deterred these audacious aldermen from violating the hamadryads of george lane as an impartial traveller i must however tell that in stow street where i left a drawwell i have found a pump but the ladingwell in this ill fated george lane lies shamefully neglected i am going today or tomorrow to ashbourne but i am at a loss how i shall get back in time to london here are only chance coaches so that there is no certainty of a place if i do not come let it not hinder your journey i can be but a few days behind you and i will follow in the brighthelmstone coach but i hope to come i took care to tell miss porter that i have got another lucy i hope she is well tell mrs salusbury that i beg her stay at streatham for little lucys sake i am c v to mrs thrale lichfield july madam since my last letter nothing extraordinary has happened rheumatism which has been very troublesome is grown better i have not yet seen dr taylor and july runs fast away i shall not have much time for him if he delays much longer to come or send mr green the apothecary has found a book which tells who paid levies in our parish and how much they paid above a hundred years ago do you not think we study this book hard nothing is like going to the bottom of things many families that paid the parishrates are now extinct like the race of hercules pulvis et umbra sumus what is nearest us touches us most the passions rise higher at domestick than at imperial tragedies i am not wholly unaffected by the revolutions of sadler street nor can forbear to mourn a little when old names vanish away and new come into their place do not imagine madam that i wrote this letter for the sake of these philosophical meditations for when i began it i had neither mr green nor his book in my thoughts but was resolved to write and did not know what i had to send but my respects to mrs salusbury and mr thrale and harry and the misses i am dearest madam your c vi to mrs thrale ashbourne july dearest madam there had not been so long an interval between my two last letters but that when i came hither i did not at first understand the hours of the post i have seen the great bull and very great he is i have seen likewise his heir apparent who promises to inherit all the bulk and all the virtues of his sire i have seen the man who offered a hundred guineas for the young bull while he was yet little better than a calf matlock i am afraid i shall not see but i purpose to see dovedale and after all this seeing i hope to see you i am c vii to the same ashbourne july dear madam last saturday i came to ashbourne the dangers or the pleasures of the journey i have at present no disposition to recount else might i paint the beauties of my native plains might i tell of the smiles of nature and the charms of art else might i relate how i crossed the staffordshire canal one of the great efforts of human labour and human contrivance which from the bridge on which i viewed it passed away on either side and loses itself in distant regions uniting waters that nature had divided and dividing lands which nature had united i might tell how these reflections fermented in my mind till the chaise stopped at ashbourne at ashbourne in the peak let not the barren name of the peak terrify you i have never wanted strawberries and cream the great bull has no disease but age i hope in time to be like the great bull and hope you will be like him too a hundred years hence i am c viii to mrs thrale ashbourne july dearest madam i am obliged to my friend harry for his remembrance but think it a little hard that i hear nothing from miss there has been a man here today to take a farm after some talk he went to see the bull and said that he had seen a bigger do you think he is likely to get the farm toujours strawberries and cream dr taylor is much better and my rheumatism is less painful let me hear in return as much good of you and of mrs salusbury you despise the dog and duck things that are at hand are always slighted i remember that dr grevil of gloucester sent for that water when his wife was in the same danger but he lived near malvern and you live near the dog and duck thus in difficult cases we naturally trust most what we least know why bromefield supposing that a lotion can do good should despise laurelwater in comparison with his own receipt i do not see and see still less why he should laugh at that which wall thinks efficacious i am afraid philosophy will not warrant much hope in a lotion be pleased to make my compliments from mrs salusbury to susy i am c ix to the same october madam though i am just informed that by some accidental negligence the letter which i wrote on thursday was not given to the post yet i cannot refuse myself the gratification of writing again to my mistress not that i have any thing to tell but that by showing how much i am employed upon you i hope to keep you from forgetting me doctor taylor asked me this morning on what i was thinking and i was thinking on lucy i hope lucy is a good girl but she cannot yet be so good as queeney i have got nothing yet for queeneys cabinet i hope dear mrs salusbury grows no worse i wish any thing could be found that would make her better you must remember her admonition and bustle in the brewhouse when i come you may expect to have your hands full with all of us our bulls and cows are all well but we yet hate the man that had seen a bigger bull our deer have died but many are left our waterfall at the garden makes a great roaring this wet weather and so no more at present from madam your c x to mrs thrale november dear madam i am sorry that none of your letters bring better news of the poor dear lady i hope her pain is not great to have a disease confessedly incurable and apparently mortal is a very heavy affliction and it is still more grievous when pain is added to despair every thing else in your letter pleased me very well except that when i come i entreat i may not be flattered as your letters flatter me you have read of heroes and princes ruined by flattery and i question if any of them had a flatterer so dangerous as you pray keep strictly to your character of governess i cannot yet get well my nights are flatulent and unquiet but my days are tolerably easy and taylor says that i look much better than when i came hither you will see when i come and i can take your word our house affords no revolutions the great bull is well but i write not merely to think on you for i do that without writing but to keep you a little thinking on me i perceive that i have taken a broken piece of paper but that is not the greatest fault that you must forgive in madam your c xi to mrs thrale november dear madam if you are so kind as to write to me on saturday the day on which you will receive this i shall have it before i leave ashbourne i am to go to lichfield on wednesday and purpose to find my way to london through birmingham and oxford i was yesterday at chatsworth it is a very fine house i wish you had been with me to see it for then as we are apt to want matter of talk we should have gained something new to talk on they complimented me with playing the fountain and opening the cascade but i am of my friends opinion that when one has seen the ocean cascades are but little things i am in hope of a letter today from you or queeney but the post has made some blunder and the packet is not yet distributed i wish it may bring me a little good of you all i am c xii to the same tuesday jan madam the inequalities of human life have always employed the meditation of deep thinkers and i cannot forbear to reflect on the difference between your condition and my own you live upon mockturtle and stewed rumps of beef i dined yesterday upon crumpets you sit with parish officers caressing and caressed the idol of the table and the wonder of the day i pine in the solitude of sickness not bad enough to be pitied and not well enough to be endured you sleep away the night and laugh or scold away the day i cough and grumble and grumble and cough last night was very tedious and this day makes no promises of much ease however i have this day put on my shoe and hope that gout is gone i shall have only the cough to contend with and i doubt whether i shall get rid of that without change of place i caught cold in the coach as i went away and am disordered by very little things is it accident or age i am dearest madam c xiii to mrs thrale march dear madam to tell you that i am sorry both for the poor lady and for you is useless i cannot help either of you the weakness of mind is perhaps only a casual interruption or intermission of the attention such as we all suffer when some weighty care or urgent calamity has possession of the mind she will compose herself she is unwilling to die and the first conviction of approaching death raised great perturbation i think she has but very lately thought death close at hand she will compose herself to do that as well as she can which must at last be done may she not want the divine assistance you madam will have a great loss a greater than is common in the loss of a parent fill your mind with hope of her happiness and turn your thoughts first to him who gives and takes away in whose presence the living and dead are standing together then remember that when this mournful duty is paid others yet remain of equal obligation and we may hope of less painful performance grief is a species of idleness and the necessity of attention to the present preserves us by the merciful disposition of providence from being lacerated and devoured by sorrow for the past you must think on your husband and your children and do what this dear lady has done for you not to come to town while the great struggle continues is undoubtedly well resolved but do not harass yourself into danger you owe the care of your health to all that love you at least to all whom it is your duty to love you cannot give such a mother too much if you do not give her what belongs to another i am c xiv to mrs thrale april dear madam hope is more pleasing than fear but not less fallacious you know when you do not try to deceive yourself that the disease which at last is to destroy must be gradually growing worse and that it is vain to wish for more than that the descent to death may be slow and easy in this wish i join with you and hope it will be granted dear dear lady whenever she is lost she will be missed and whenever she is remembered she will be lamented is it a good or an evil to me that she now loves me it is surely a good for you will love me better and we shall have a new principle of concord and i shall be happier with honest sorrow than with sullen indifference and far happier still than with counterfeited sympathy i am reasoning upon a principle very far from certain a confidence of survivance you or i or both may be called into the presence of the supreme judge before her i have lived a life of which i do not like the review surely i shall in time live better i sat down with an intention to write high compliments but my thoughts have taken another course and some other time must now serve to tell you with what other emotions benevolence and fidelity i am c xv to the same may madam never imagine that your letters are long they are always too short for my curiosity i do not know that i was ever content with a single perusal of dear mrs salusbury i never expect much better news than you send me de pis en pis is the natural and certain course of her dreadful malady i am content when it leaves her ease enough for the exercise of her mind why should mr suppose that what i took the liberty of suggesting was concerted with you he does not know how much i revolve his affairs and how honestly i desire his prosperity i hope he has let the hint take some hold of his mind your declaration to miss is more general than my opinions allow i think an unlimited promise of acting by the opinion of another so wrong that nothing or hardly anything can make it right all unnecessary vows are folly because they suppose a prescience of the future which has not been given us they are i think a crime because they resign that life to chance which god has given us to be regulated by reason and superinduce a kind of fatality from which it is the great privilege of our nature to be free unlimited obedience is due only to the universal father of heaven and earth my parents may be mad and foolish may be wicked and malicious may be erroneously religious or absurdly scrupulous i am not bound to compliance with mandates either positive or negative which either religion condemns or reason rejects there wanders about the world a wild notion which extends over marriage more than over any other transaction if miss followed a trade would it be said that she was bound in conscience to give or refuse credit at her fathers choice and is not marriage a thing in which she is more interested and has therefore more right of choice when i may suffer for my own crimes when i may be sued for my own debts i may judge by parity of reason for my own happiness the parents moral right can arise only from his kindness and his civil right only from his money conscience cannot dictate obedience to the wicked or compliance with the foolish and of interest mere prudence is the judge if the daughter is bound without a promise she promises nothing and if she is not bound she promises too much what is meant by tying up money in trade i do not understand no money is so little tied as that which is employed in trade mr perhaps only means that in consideration of money to be advanced he will oblige his son to be a trader this is reasonable enough upon ten thousand pounds diligently occupied they may live in great plenty and splendour without the mischiefs of idleness i can write a long letter as well as my mistress and shall be glad that my long letters may be as welcome as hers my nights are grown again very uneasy and troublesome i know not that the country will mend them but i hope your company will mend my days though i cannot now expect much attention and would not wish for more than can be spared from the poor dear lady yet i shall see you and hear you every now and then and to see and hear you is always to hear wit and to see virtue i shall i hope see you tomorrow and a little on the two next days and with that little i must for the present try to be contented i am c xvi to mrs thrale august dear madam we left london on friday the th not very early and travelled without any memorable accident through a country which i had seen before in the evening i was not well and was forced to stop at stilton one stage short of stamford where we intended to have lodged on the th we passed through stamford and grantham and dined at newark where i had only time to observe that the marketplace was uncommonly spacious and neat in london we should call it a square though the sides were neither straight nor parallel we came at night to doncaster and went to church in the morning where chambers found the monument of robert of doncaster who says on his stone something like this what i gave that i have what i spent that i had what i left that i lost so saith robert of doncaster who reigned in the world sixtyseven years and all that time lived not one here we were invited to dinner and therefore made no great haste away we reached york however that night i was much disordered with old complaints next morning we saw the minster an edifice of loftiness and elegance equal to the highest hopes of architecture i remember nothing but the dome of st pauls that can be compared with the middle walk the chapterhouse is a circular building very stately but i think excelled by the chapterhouse of lincoln i then went to see the ruins of the abbey which are almost vanished and i remember nothing of them distinct the next visit was to the gaol which they call the castle a fabrick built lately such is terrestrial mutability out of the materials of the ruined abbey the under gaoler was very officious to show his fetters in which there was no contrivance the head gaoler came in and seeing me look i suppose fatigued offered me wine and when i went away would not suffer his servant to take money the gaol is accounted the best in the kingdom and you find the gaoler deserving of his dignity we dined at york and went on to northallerton a place of which i know nothing but that it afforded us a lodging on monday night and about two hundred and seventy years ago gave birth to roger ascham next morning we changed our horses at darlington where mr cornelius harrison a cousingerman of mine was perpetual curate he was the only one of my relations who ever rose in fortune above penury or in character above neglect the church is built crosswise with a fine spire and might invite a traveller to survey it but i perhaps wanted vigour and thought i wanted time the next stage brought us to durham a place of which mr thrale bade me take particular notice the bishops palace has the appearance of an old feudal castle built upon an eminence and looking down upon the river upon which was formerly thrown a drawbridge as i suppose to be raised at night lest the scots should pass it the cathedral has a massiness and solidity such as i have seen in no other place it rather awes than pleases as it strikes with a kind of gigantick dignity and aspires to no other praise than that of rocky solidity and indeterminate duration i had none of my friends resident and therefore saw but little the library is mean and scanty at durham beside all expectation i met an old friend miss fordyce is married there to a physician we met i think with honest kindness on both sides i thought her much decayed and having since heard that the banker had involved her husband in his extensive ruin i cannot forbear to think that i saw in her withered features more impression of sorrow than that of time qua terra patet sera regnat erinnys he that wanders about the world sees new forms of human misery and if he chances to meet an old friend meets a face darkened with troubles on tuesday night we came hither yesterday i took some care of myself and today i am quite polite i have been taking a view of all that could be shown me and find that all very near to nothing you have often heard me complain of finding myself disappointed by books of travels i am afraid travel itself will end likewise in disappointment one town one country is very like another civilized nations have the same customs and barbarous nations have the same nature there are indeed minute discriminations both of places and manners which perhaps are not wanting of curiosity but which a traveller seldom stays long enough to investigate and compare the dull utterly neglect them the acute see a little and supply the rest with fancy and conjecture i shall set out again tomorrow but i shall not i am afraid see alnwick for dr percy is not there i hope to lodge tomorrow night at berwick and the next at edinburgh where i shall direct mr drummond bookseller at ossians head to take care of my letters i hope the little dears are all well and that my dear master and mistress may go somewhither but wherever you go do not forget madam your most humble servant i am pretty well august thus far i had written at newcastle i forgot to send it i am now at edinburgh and have been this day running about i run pretty well xvii to mrs thrale edinburgh august dear madam on the th i left newcastle and in the afternoon came to alnwick where we were treated with great civility by the duke i went through the apartments walked on the wall and climbed the towers that night we lay at belford and on the next night came to edinburgh on sunday th i went to the english chapel after dinner dr robertson came in and promised to show me the place on monday i saw their publick buildings the cathedral which i told robertson i wished to see because it had once been a church the courts of justice the parliamenthouse the advocates library the repository of records the college and its library and the palace particularly the old tower where the king of scotland seized david rizzio in the queens presence most of their buildings are very mean and the whole town bears some resemblance to the old part of birmingham boswell has very handsome and spacious rooms level with the ground on one side of the house and on the other four stories high at dinner on monday were the dutchess of douglas an old lady who talks broad scotch with a paralytick voice and is scarcely understood by her own countrymen the lord chief baron sir adolphus oughton and many more at supper there was such a conflux of company that i could scarcely support the tumult i have never been well in the whole journey and am very easily disordered this morning i saw at breakfast dr blacklock the blind poet who does not remember to have seen light and is read to by a poor scholar in latin greek and french he was originally a poor scholar himself i looked on him with reverence tomorrow our journey begins i know not when i shall write again i am but poorly i am c xviii to mrs thrale bamff august dear madam it has so happened that though i am perpetually thinking on you i could seldom find opportunity to write i have in fourteen days sent only one letter you must consider the fatigues of travel and the difficulties encountered in a strange country august th i passed with boswell the frith of forth and began our journey in the passage we observed an island which i persuaded my companions to survey we found it a rock somewhat troublesome to climb about a mile long and half a mile broad in the middle were the ruins of an old fort which had on one of the stones maria re it had been only a blockhouse one story high i measured two apartments of which the walls were entire and found them twentyseven feet long and twentythree broad the rock had some grass and many thistles both cows and sheep were grazing there was a spring of water the name is inchkeith look on your maps this visit took about an hour we pleased ourselves with being in a country all our own and then went back to the boat and landed at kinghorn a mean town and travelling through kirkaldie a very long town meanly built and cowpar which i could not see because it was night we came late to st andrews the most ancient of the scotch universities and once the see of the primate of scotland the inn was full but lodgings were provided for us at the house of the professor of rhetorick a man of elegant manners who showed us in the morning the poor remains of a stately cathedral demolished in knoxs reformation and now only to be imagined by tracing its foundation and contemplating the little ruins that are left here was once a religious house two of the vaults or cellars of the subprior are even yet entire in one of them lives an old woman who claims an hereditary residence in it boasting that her husband was the sixth tenant of this gloomy mansion in a lineal descent and claims by her marriage with this lord of the cavern an alliance with the bruces mr boswell staid awhile to interrogate her because he understood her language she told him that she and her cat lived together that she had two sons somewhere who might perhaps be dead that when there were quality in the town notice was taken of her and that now she was neglected but did not trouble them her habitation contained all that she had her turf for fire was laid in one place and her balls of coaldust in another but her bed seemed to be clean boswell asked her if she never heard any noises but she could tell him of nothing supernatural though she often wandered in the night among the graves and ruins only she had sometimes notice by dreams of the death of her relations we then viewed the remains of a castle on the margin of the sea in which the archbishops resided and in which cardinal beatoun was killed the professors who happened to be readout in the vacation made a publick dinner and treated us very kindly and respectfully they showed us their colleges in one of which there is a library that for luminousness and elegance may vie at least with the new edifice at streatham but learning seems not to prosper among them one of their colleges has been lately alienated and one of their churches lately deserted an experiment was made of planting a shrubbery in the church but it did not thrive why the place should thus fall to decay i know not for education such as is here to be had is sufficiently cheap the term or as they call it their session lasts seven months in the year which the students of the highest rank and greatest expense may pass here for twenty pounds in which are included board lodging books and the continual instruction of three professors th we left st andrews well satisfied with our reception and crossing the frith of tay came to dundee a dirty despicable town we passed afterwards through aberbrothick famous once for an abbey of which there are only a few fragments left but those fragments testify that the fabrick was once of great extent and of stupendous magnificence two of the towers are yet standing though shattered into one of them boswell climbed but found the stairs broken the way into the other we did not see and had not time to search i believe it might be ascended but the top i think is open we lay at montrose a neat place with a spacious area for the market and an elegant townhouse st we travelled towards aberdeen another university and in the way dined at lord monboddos the scotch judge who has lately written a strange book about the origin of language in which he traces monkeys up to men and says that in some countries the human species have tails like other beasts he inquired for these longtailed men of banks and was not well pleased that they had not been found in all his peregrination he talked nothing of this to me and i hope we parted friends for we agreed pretty well only we disputed in adjusting the claims of merit between a shopkeeper of london and a savage of the american wildernesses our opinions were i think maintained on both sides without full conviction monboddo declared boldly for the savage and i perhaps for that reason sided with the citizen we came late to aberdeen where i found my dear mistresss letter and learned that all our little people were happily recovered of the measles every part of your letter was pleasing there are two cities of the name of aberdeen the old town built about a mile inland once the see of a bishop which contains the kings college and the remains of the cathedral and the new town which stands for the sake of trade upon a frith or arm of the sea so that ships rest against the quay the two cities have their separate magistrates and the two colleges are in effect two universities which confer degrees independently of each other new aberdeen is a large town built almost wholly of that granite which is used for the new pavement in london which hard as it is they square with very little difficulty here i first saw the women in plaids the plaid makes at once a hood and cloak without cutting or sewing merely by the manner of drawing the opposite sides over the shoulders the maids at the inns run over the house barefoot and children not dressed in rags go without shoes or stockings shoes are indeed not yet in universal use they came late into this country one of the professors told us as we were mentioning a fort built by cromwell that the country owed much of its present industry to cromwells soldiers they taught us said he to raise cabbage and make shoes how they lived without shoes may yet be seen but in the passage through villages it seems to him that surveys their gardens that when they had not cabbage they had nothing education is here of the same price as at st andrews only the session is but from the st of november to the st of april the academical buildings seem rather to advance than decline they showed their libraries which were not very splendid but some manuscripts were so exquisitely penned that i wished my dear mistress to have seen them i had an unexpected pleasure by finding an old acquaintance now professor of physick in the kings college we were on both sides glad of the interview having not seen nor perhaps thought on one another for many years but we had no emulation nor had either of us risen to the others envy and our old kindness was easily renewed i hope we shall never try the effect of so long an absence and that i shall always be madam your c xix to mrs thrale inverness august dear madam august rd i had the honour of attending the lord provost of aberdeen and was presented with the freedom of the city not in a gold box but in good latin let me pay scotland one just praise there was no officer gaping for a fee this could have been said of no city on the english side of the tweed i wore my patent of freedom pro more in my hat from the new town to the old about a mile i then dined with my friend the professor of physick at his house and saw the kings college boswell was very angry that the aberdeen professors would not talk when i was at the english church in aberdeen i happened to be espied by lady di middleton whom i had sometime seen in london she told what she had seen to mr boyd lord errols brother who wrote us an invitation to lord errols house called slanes castle we went thither on the next day th of august and found a house not old except but one tower built on the margin of the sea upon a rock scarce accessible from the sea at one corner a tower makes a perpendicular continuation of the lateral surface of the rock so that it is impracticable to walk round the house inclosed a square court and on all sides within the court is a piazza or gallery two stories high we came in as we were invited to dinner and after dinner offered to go but lady errol sent us word by mr boyd that if we went before lord errol came home we must never be forgiven and ordered out the coach to show us two curiosities we were first conducted by mr boyd to dunbuys or the yellow rock dunbuys is a rock consisting of two protuberances each perhaps one hundred yards round joined together by a narrow neck and separated from the land by a very narrow channel or gully these rocks are the haunts of seafowl whose clang though this is not their season we heard at a distance the eggs and the young are gathered here in great numbers at the time of breeding there is a bird here called a coot which though not much bigger than a duck lays a larger egg than a goose we went then to see the buller or bouilloir of buchan buchan is the name of the district and the buller is a small creek or gulf into which the sea flows through an arch of the rock we walked round it and saw it black at a great depth it has its name from the violent ebullition of the water when high winds or high tides drive it up the arch into the basin walking a little farther i spied some boats and told my companions that we would go into the buller and examine it there was no danger all was calm we went through the arch and found ourselves in a narrow gulf surrounded by craggy rocks of height not stupendous but to a mediterranean visitor uncommon on each side was a cave of which the fisherman knew not the extent in which smugglers hide their goods and sometimes parties of pleasure take a dinner i am c xx to mrs thrale skie september dearest madam i am now looking on the sea from a house of sir alexander macdonald in the isle of skie little did i once think of seeing this region of obscurity and little did you once expect a salutation from this verge of european life i have now the pleasure of going where nobody goes and seeing what nobody sees our design is to visit several of the smaller islands and then pass over to the southwest of scotland i returned from the sight of bullers buchan to lord errols and having seen his library had for a time only to look upon the sea which rolled between us and norway next morning august th we continued our journey through a country not uncultivated but so denuded of its woods that in all this journey i had not travelled a hundred yards between hedges or seen five trees fit for the carpenter a few small plantations may be found but i believe scarcely any thirty years old at least they are all posterior to the union this day we dined with a countrygentleman who has in his grounds the remains of a druids temple which when it is complete is nothing more than a circle or double circle of stones placed at equal distances with a flat stone perhaps an altar at a certain point and a stone taller than the rest at the opposite point the tall stone is erected i think at the south of these circles there are many in all the unfrequented parts of the island the inhabitants of these parts respect them as memorials of the sculpture of some illustrious person here i saw a few trees we lay at bamff august th we dined at elgin where we saw the ruins of a noble cathedral the chapterhouse is yet standing a great part of elgin is built with small piazzas to the lower story we went on to foris over the heath where macbeth met the witches but had no adventure only in the way we saw for the first time some houses with fruittrees about them the improvements of the scotch are for immediate profit they do not yet think it quite worth their while to plant what will not produce something to be eaten or sold in a very little time we rested at foris a very great proportion of the people are barefoot shoes are not yet considered as necessaries of life it is still the custom to send out the sons of gentlemen without them into the streets and ways there are more beggars than i have ever seen in england they beg if not silently yet very modestly next day we came to nairn a miserable town but a royal burgh of which the chief annual magistrate is styled lord provost in the neighbourhood we saw the castle of the old thane of cawdor there is one ancient tower with its battlements and winding stairs yet remaining the rest of the house is though not modern of later erection on the th we went to fort george which is accounted the most regular fortification in the island the major of artillery walked with us round the walls and showed us the principles upon which every part was constructed and the way in which it could be defended we dined with the governour sir eyre coote and his officers it was a very pleasant and instructive day but nothing puts my honoured mistress out of my mind at night we came to inverness the last considerable town in the north where we staid all the next day for it was sunday and saw the ruins of what is called macbeths castle it never was a large house but was strongly situated from inverness we were to travel on horseback august th we set out with four horses we had two highlanders to run by us who were active officious civil and hardy our journey was for many miles along a military way made upon the banks of lough ness a water about eighteen miles long but not i think half a mile broad our horses were not bad and the way was very pleasant the rock out of which the road was cut was covered with birchtrees fern and heath the lake below was beating its bank by a gentle wind and the rocks beyond the water on the right stood sometimes horrid and wild and sometimes opened into a kind of bay in which there was a spot of cultivated ground yellow with corn in one part of the way we had trees on both sides for perhaps half a mile such a length of shade perhaps scotland cannot show in any other place you are not to suppose that here are to be any more towns or inns we came to a cottage which they call the generals hut where we alighted to dine and had eggs and bacon and mutton with wine rum and whiskey i had water at a bridge over the river which runs into the ness the rocks rise on three sides with a direction almost perpendicular to a great height they are in part covered with trees and exhibit a kind of dreadful magnificence standing like the barriers of nature placed to keep different orders of being in perpetual separation near this bridge is the fall of fiers a famous cataract of which by clambering over the rocks we obtained a view the water was low and therefore we had only the pleasure of knowing that rain would make it at once pleasing and formidable there will then be a mighty flood foaming along a rocky channel frequently obstructed by protuberances and exasperated by reverberation at last precipitated with a sudden descent and lost in the depth of a gloomy chasm we came somewhat late to fort augustus where the lieutenantgovernour met us beyond the gates and apologized that at that hour he could not by the rules of a garrison admit us otherwise than at a narrow door which only one can enter at a time we were well entertained and well lodged and next morning after having viewed the fort we pursued our journey our way now lay over the mountains which are not to be passed by climbing them directly but by traversing so that as we went forward we saw our baggage following us below in a direction exactly contrary there is in these ways much labour but little danger and perhaps other places of which very terrifick representations are made are not in themselves more formidable these roads have all been made by hewing the rock away with pickaxes or bursting it with gunpowder the stones so separated are often piled loose as a wall by the wayside we saw an inscription importing the year in which one of the regiments made two thousand yards of the road eastward after tedious travel of some hours we came to what i believe we must call a village a place where there were three huts built of turf at one of which we were to have our dinner and our bed for we could not reach any better place that night this place is called enoch in glenmorrison the house in which we lodged was distinguished by a chimney the rest had only a hole for the smoke here we had eggs and mutton and a chicken and a sausage and rum in the afternoon tea was made by a very decent girl in a printed linen she engaged me so much that i made her a present of cockers arithmetick i am c xxi to mrs thrale skie sept dearest madam the post which comes but once a week into these parts is so soon to go that i have not time to go on where i left off in my last letter i have been several days in the island of raarsa and am now again in the isle of skie but at the other end of it skie is almost equally divided between the two great families of macdonald and macleod other proprietors having only small districts the two great lords do not know within twenty square miles the contents of their own territories kept up but ill the reputation of highland hospitality we are now with macleod quite at the other end of the island where there is a fine young gentleman and fine ladies the ladies are studying erse i have a cold and am miserably deaf and am troublesome to lady macleod i force her to speak loud but she will seldom speak loud enough raarsa is an island about fifteen miles long and two broad under the dominion of one gentleman who has three sons and ten daughters the eldest is the beauty of this part of the world and has been polished at edinburgh they sing and dance and without expense have upon their table most of what sea air or earth can afford i intended to have written about raarsa but the post will not wait longer than while i send my compliments to my dear master and little mistresses i am c xxii to mrs thrale skie sept dearest madam i am so vexed at the necessity of sending yesterday so short a letter that i purpose to get a long letter beforehand by writing something every day which i may the more easily do as a cold makes me now too deaf to take the usual pleasure in conversation lady macleod is very good to me and the place at which we now are is equal in strength of situation in the wildness of the adjacent country and in the plenty and elegance of the domestick entertainment to a castle in gothick romances the sea with a little island is before us cascades play within view close to the house is the formidable skeleton of an old castle probably danish and the whole mass of building stands upon a protuberance of rock inaccessible till of late but by a pair of stairs on the seaside and secure in ancient times against any enemy that was likely to invade the kingdom of skie macleod has offered me an island if it were not too far off i should hardly refuse it my island would be pleasanter than brighthelmstone if you and my master could come to it but i cannot think it pleasant to live quite alone oblitusque meorum obliviscendus et illis that i should be elated by the dominion of an island to forgetfulness of my friends at streatham i cannot believe and i hope never to deserve that they should be willing to forget me it has happened that i have been often recognised in my journey where i did not expect it at aberdeen i found one of my acquaintance professor of physick turning aside to dine with a countrygentleman i was owned at table by one who had seen me at a philosophical lecture at macdonalds i was claimed by a naturalist who wanders about the islands to pick up curiosities and i had once in london attracted the notice of lady macleod i will now go on with my account the highland girl made tea and looked and talked not inelegantly her father was by no means an ignorant or a weak man there were books in the cottage among which were some volumes of prideauxs connexion this mans conversation we were glad of while we staid he had been out as they call it in fortyfive and still retained his old opinions he was going to america because his rent was raised beyond what he thought himself able to pay at night our beds were made but we had some difficulty in persuading ourselves to lie down in them though we had put on our own sheets at last we ventured and i slept very soundly in the vale of glenmorrison amidst the rocks and mountains next morning our landlord liked us so well that he walked some miles with us for our company through a country so wild and barren that the proprietor does not with all his pressure upon his tenants raise more than four hundred pounds a year for near one hundred square miles or sixty thousand acres he let us know that he had forty head of black cattle a hundred goats and a hundred sheep upon a farm that he remembered let at five pounds a year but for which he now paid twenty he told us some stories of their march into england at last he left us and we went forward winding among mountains sometimes green and sometimes naked commonly so steep as not easily to be climbed by the greatest vigour and activity our way was often crossed by little rivulets and we were entertained with small streams trickling from the rocks which after heavy rains must be tremendous torrents about noon we came to a small glen so they call a valley which compared with other places appeared rich and fertile here our guides desired us to stop that the horses might graze for the journey was very laborious and no more grass would be found we made no difficulty of compliance and i sat down to take notes on a green bank with a small stream running at my feet in the midst of savage solitude with mountains before me and on either hand covered with heath i looked around me and wondered that i was not more affected but the mind is not at all times equally ready to be put in motion if my mistress and master and queeney had been there we should have produced some reflections among us either poetical or philosophical for though solitude be the nurse of woe conversation is often the parent of remarks and discoveries in about an hour we remounted and pursued our journey the lake by which we had travelled for some time ended in a river which we passed by a bridge and came to another glen with a collection of huts called auknashealds the huts were generally built of clods of earth held together by the intertexture of vegetable fibres of which earth there are great levels in scotland which they call mosses moss in scotland is bog in ireland and mosstrooper is bogtrotter there was however one hut built of loose stones piled up with great thickness into a strong though not solid wall from this house we obtained some great pails of milk and having brought bread with us we were liberally regaled the inhabitants a very coarse tribe ignorant of any language but erse gathered so fast about us that if we had not had highlanders with us they might have caused more alarm than pleasure they are called the clan of macrae we had been told that nothing gratified the highlanders so much as snuff and tobacco and had accordingly stored ourselves with both at fort augustus boswell opened his treasure and gave them each a piece of tobacco roll we had more bread than we could eat for the present and were more liberal than provident boswell cut it in slices and gave them an opportunity of tasting wheaten bread for the first time i then got some halfpence for a shilling and made up the deficiencies of boswells distribution who had given some money among the children we then directed that the mistress of the stonehouse should be asked what we must pay her she who perhaps had never before sold any thing but cattle knew not i believe well what to ask and referred herself to us we obliged her to make some demand and one of the highlanders settled the account with her at a shilling one of the men advised her with the cunning that clowns never can be without to ask more but she said that a shilling was enough we gave her halfacrown and she offered part of it again the macraes were so well pleased with our behaviour that they declared it the best day they had seen since the time of the old laird of macleod who i suppose like us stopped in their valley as he was travelling to skie we were mentioning this view of the highlanders life at macdonalds and mentioning the macraes with some degree of pity when a highland lady informed us that we might spare our tenderness for she doubted not but the woman who supplied us with milk was mistress of thirteen or fourteen milch cows i cannot forbear to interrupt my narrative boswell with some of his troublesome kindness has informed this family and reminded me that the th of september is my birthday the return of my birthday if i remember it fills me with thoughts which it seems to be the general care of humanity to escape i can now look back upon threescore and four years in which little has been done and little has been enjoyed a life diversified by misery spent part in the sluggishness of penury and part under the violence of pain in gloomy discontent or importunate distress but perhaps i am better than i should have been if i had been less afflicted with this i will try to be content in proportion as there is less pleasure in retrospective considerations the mind is more disposed to wander forward into futurity but at sixtyfour what promises however liberal of imaginary good can futurity venture to make yet something will be always promised and some promises will be always credited i am hoping and i am praying that i may live better in the time to come whether long or short than i have yet lived and in the solace of that hope endeavour to repose dear queeneys day is next i hope she at sixtyfour will have less to regret i will now complain no more but tell my mistress of my travels after we left the macraes we travelled on through a country like that which we passed in the morning the highlands are very uniform for there is little variety in universal barrenness the rocks however are not all naked for some have grass on their sides and birches and alders on their tops and in the valleys are often broad and clear streams which have little depth and commonly run very quick the channels are made by the violence of the wintry floods the quickness of the stream is in proportion to the declivity of the descent and the breadth of the channel makes the water shallow in a dry season there are red deer and roe bucks in the mountains but we found only goats in the road and had very little entertainment as we travelled either for the eye or ear there are i fancy no singing birds in the highlands towards night we came to a very formidable hill called rattiken which we climbed with more difficulty than we had yet experienced and at last came to glanelg a place on the seaside opposite to skie we were by this time weary and disgusted nor was our humour much mended by our inn which though it was built of lime and slate the highlanders description of a house which he thinks magnificent had neither wine bread eggs nor any thing that we could eat or drink when we were taken up stairs a dirty fellow bounced out of the bed where one of us was to lie boswell blustered but nothing could be got at last a gentleman in the neighbourhood who heard of our arrival sent us rum and white sugar boswell was now provided for in part and the landlord prepared some mutton chops which we could not eat and killed two hens of which boswell made his servant broil a limb with what effect i know not we had a lemon and a piece of bread which supplied me with my supper when the repast was ended we began to deliberate upon bed mrs boswell had warned us that we should catch something and had given us sheets for our security for and she said came back from skie so scratching themselves i thought sheets a slender defence against the confederacy with which we were threatened and by this time our highlanders had found a place where they could get some hay i ordered hay to be laid thick upon the bed and slept upon it in my great coat boswell laid sheets upon his bed and reposed in linen like a gentleman the horses were turned out to grass with a man to watch them the hill rattiken and the inn at glanelg were the only things of which we or travellers yet more delicate could find any pretensions to complain sept nd i rose rustling from the hay and went to tea which i forget whether we found or brought we saw the isle of skie before us darkening the horizon with its rocky coast a boat was procured and we lanched into one of the straits of the atlantick ocean we had a passage of about twelve miles to the point where resided having come from his seat in the middle of the island to a small house on the shore as we believe that he might with less reproach entertain us meanly if he aspired to meanness his retrograde ambition was completely gratified but he did not succeed equally in escaping reproach he had no cook nor i suppose much provision nor had the lady the common decencies of her teatable we picked up our sugar with our fingers boswell was very angry and reproached him with his improper parsimony i did not much reflect upon the conduct of a man with whom i was not likely to converse as long at any other time you will now expect that i should give you some account of the isle of skie of which though i have been twelve days upon it i have little to say it is an island perhaps fifty miles long so much indented by inlets of the sea that there is no part of it removed from the water more than six miles no part that i have seen is plain you are always climbing or descending and every step is upon rock or mire a walk upon ploughed ground in england is a dance upon carpets compared to the toilsome drudgery of wandering in skie there is neither town nor village in the island nor have i seen any house but macleods that is not much below your habitation at brighthelmstone in the mountains there are stags and roe bucks but no hares and few rabbits nor have i seen any thing that interested me as a zoologist except an otter bigger than i thought an otter could have been you are perhaps imagining that i am withdrawing from the gay and the busy world into regions of peace and pastoral felicity and am enjoying the relicks of the golden age that i am surveying natures magnificence from a mountain or remarking her minuter beauties on the flowery bank of a winding rivulet that i am invigorating myself in the sunshine or delighting my imagination with being hidden from the invasion of human evils and human passions in the darkness of a thicket that i am busy in gathering shells and pebbles on the shore or contemplative on a rock from which i look upon the water and consider how many waves are rolling between me and streatham the use of travelling is to regulate imagination by reality and instead of thinking how things may be to see them as they are here are mountains which i should once have climbed but to climb steeps is now very laborious and to descend them dangerous and i am now content with knowing that by scrambling up a rock i shall only see other rocks and a wider circuit of barren desolation of streams we have here a sufficient number but they murmur not upon pebbles but upon rocks of flowers if chloris herself were here i could present her only with the bloom of heath of lawns and thickets he must read that would know them for here is little sun and no shade on the sea i look from my window but am not much tempted to the shore for since i came to this island almost every breath of air has been a storm and what is worse a storm with all its severity but without its magnificence for the sea is here so broken into channels that there is not a sufficient volume of water either for lofty surges or a loud roar on sept th we left to visit raarsa the island which i have already mentioned we were to cross part of skie on horseback a mode of travelling very uncomfortable for the road is so narrow where any road can be found that only one can go and so craggy that the attention can never be remitted it allows therefore neither the gaiety of conversation nor the laxity of solitude nor has it in itself the amusement of much variety as it affords only all the possible transpositions of bog rock and rivulet twelve miles by computation make a reasonable journey for a day at night we came to a tenants house of the first rank of tenants where we were entertained better than at the landlords there were books both english and latin company gathered about us and we heard some talk of the second sight and some talk of the events of fortyfive a year which will not soon be forgotten among the islanders the next day we were confined by a storm the company i think increased and our entertainment was not only hospitable but elegant at night a ministers sister in very fine brocade sung erse songs i wished to know the meaning but the highlanders are not much used to scholastick questions and no translations could be obtained next day sept th the weather allowed us to depart a good boat was provided us and we went to raarsa under the conduct of mr malcolm macleod a gentleman who conducted prince charles through the mountains in his distresses the prince he says was more active than himself they were at least one night without any shelter the wind blew enough to give the boat a kind of dancing agitation and in about three or four hours we arrived at raarsa where we were met by the laird and his friends upon the shore raarsa for such is his title is master of two islands upon the smaller of which called rona he has only flocks and herds rona gives title to his eldest son the money which he raises annually by rent from all his dominions which contain at least fifty thousand acres is not believed to exceed two hundred and fifty pounds but as he keeps a large farm in his own hands he sells every year great numbers of cattle which add to his revenue and his table is furnished from the farm and from the sea with very little expense except for those things this country does not produce and of those he is very liberal the wine circulates vigorously and the tea chocolate and coffee however they are got are always at hand i am c we are this morning trying to get out of skie xxiii to mrs thrale skie sept dear madam i am still in skie do you remember the song every island is a prison strongly guarded by the sea we have at one time no boat and at another may have too much wind but of our reception here we have no reason to complain we are now with colonel macleod in a more pleasant place than i thought skie could afford now to the narrative we were received at raarsa on the seaside and after clambering with some difficulty over the rocks a labour which the traveller wherever he reposes himself on land must in these islands be contented to endure we were introduced into the house which one of the company called the court of raarsa with politeness which not the court of versailles could have thought defective the house is not large though we were told in our passage that it had eleven fine rooms nor magnificently furnished but our utensils were most commonly silver we went up into a diningroom about as large as your blue room where we had something given us to eat and tea and coffee raarsa himself is a man of no inelegant appearance and of manners uncommonly refined lady raarsa makes no very sublime appearance for a sovereign but is a good housewife and a very prudent and diligent conductress of her family miss flora macleod is a celebrated beauty has been admired at edinburgh dresses her head very high and has manners so ladylike that i wish her headdress was lower the rest of the nine girls are all pretty the youngest is between queeney and lucy the youngest boy of four years old runs barefoot and wandered with us over the rocks to see a mill i believe he would walk on that rough ground without shoes ten miles in a day the laird of raarsa has sometimes disputed the chieftainry of the clan with macleod of skie but being much inferiour in extent of possessions has i suppose been forced to desist raarsa and its provinces have descended to its present possessour through a succession of four hundred years without any increase or diminution it was indeed lately in danger of forfeiture but the old laird joined some prudence with his zeal and when prince charles landed in scotland made over his estate to this son the present laird and led one hundred men of raarsa into the field with officers of his own family eightysix only came back after the last battle the prince was hidden in his distress two nights at raarsa and the kings troops burnt the whole country and killed some of the cattle you may guess at the opinions that prevail in this country they are however content with fighting for their king they do not drink for him we had no foolish healths at night unexpectedly to us who were strangers the carpet was taken up the fiddler of the family came up and a very vigorous and general dance was begun as i told you we were two and thirty at supper there were full as many dancers for though all who supped did not dance some danced of the young people who did not sup raarsa himself danced with his children and old malcolm in his fillibeg was as nimble as when he led the prince over the mountains when they had danced themselves weary two tables were spread and i suppose at least twenty dishes were upon them in this country some preparations of milk are always served up at supper and sometimes in the place of tarts at dinner the table was not coarsely heaped but at once plentiful and elegant they do not pretend to make a loaf there are only cakes commonly of oats or barley but they made me very nice cakes of wheat flour i always sat at the left hand of lady raarsa and young macleod of skie the chieftain of the clan sat on the right after supper a young lady who was visiting sung erse songs in which lady raarsa joined prettily enough but not gracefully the young ladies sustained the chorus better they are very little used to be asked questions and not well prepared with answers when one of the songs was over i asked the princess that sat next to me what is that about i question if she conceived that i did not understand it for the entertainment of the company said she but madam what is the meaning of it it is a love song this was all the intelligence that i could obtain nor have i been able to procure the translation of a single line of erse at twelve it was bedtime i had a chamber to myself which in eleven rooms to forty people was more than my share how the company and the family were distributed is not easy to tell macleod the chieftain and boswell and i had all single chambers on the first floor there remained eight rooms only for at least seven and thirty lodgers i suppose they put up temporary beds in the diningroom where they stowed all the young ladies there was a room above stairs with six beds in which they put ten men the rest in my next xxiv to mrs thrale ostich in skie sept dearest madam i am still confined in skie we were unskilful travellers and imagined that the sea was an open road which we could pass at pleasure but we have now learned with some pain that we may still wait for a long time the caprices of the equinoctial winds and sit reading or writing as i now do while the tempest is rolling the sea or roaring in the mountains i am now no longer pleased with the delay you can hear from me but seldom and i cannot at all hear from you it comes into my mind that some evil may happen or that i might be of use while i am away but these thoughts are vain the wind is violent and adverse and our boat cannot yet come i must content myself with writing to you and hoping that you will sometime receive my letter now to my narrative sept th having passed the night as is usual i rose and found the diningroom full of company we feasted and talked and when the evening came it brought musick and dancing young macleod the great proprietor of skie and head of his clan was very distinguishable a young man of nineteen bred awhile at st andrews and afterwards at oxford a pupil of g strahan he is a young man of a mind as much advanced as i have ever known very elegant of manners and very graceful in his person he has the full spirit of a feudal chief and i was very ready to accept his invitation to dunvegan all raarsas children are beautiful the ladies all except the eldest are in the morning dressed in their hair the true highlander never wears more than a riband on her head till she is married on the third day boswell went out with old malcolm to see a ruined castle which he found less entire than was promised but he saw the country i did not go for the castle was perhaps ten miles off and there is no riding at raarsa the whole island being rock or mountain from which the cattle often fall and are destroyed it is very barren and maintains as near as i could collect about seven hundred inhabitants perhaps ten to a square mile in these countries you are not to suppose that you shall find villages or inclosures the traveller wanders through a naked desert gratified sometimes but rarely with the sight of cows and now and then finds a heap of loose stones and turf in a cavity between rocks where a being born with all those powers which education expands and all those sensations which culture refines is condemned to shelter itself from the wind and rain philosophers there are who try to make themselves believe that this life is happy but they believe it only while they are saying it and never yet produced conviction in a single mind he whom want of words or images sunk into silence still thought as he thought before that privation of pleasure can never please and that content is not to be much envied when it has no other principle than ignorance of good this gloomy tranquillity which some may call fortitude and others wisdom was i believe for a long time to be very frequently found in these dens of poverty every man was content to live like his neighbours and never wandering from home saw no mode of life preferable to his own except at the house of the laird or the lairds nearest relations whom he considered as a superiour order of beings to whose luxuries or honours he had no pretensions but the end of this reverence and submission seems now approaching the highlanders have learned that there are countries less bleak and barren than their own where instead of working for the laird every man will till his own ground and eat the produce of his own labour great numbers have been induced by this discovery to go every year for some time past to america macdonald and macleod of skie have lost many tenants and many labourers but raarsa has not yet been forsaken by a single inhabitant rona is yet more rocky and barren than raarsa and though it contains perhaps four thousand acres is possessed only by a herd of cattle and the keepers i find myself not very able to walk upon the mountains but one day i went out to see the walls yet standing of an ancient chapel in almost every island the superstitious votaries of the romish church erected places of worship in which the drones of convents or cathedrals performed the holy offices but by the active zeal of protestant devotion almost all of them have sunk into ruin the chapel at raarsa is now only considered as the buryingplace of the family and i suppose of the whole island we would now have gone away and left room for others to enjoy the pleasures of this little court but the wind detained us till the th when though it was sunday we thought it proper to snatch the opportunity of a calm day raarsa accompanied us in his sixoared boat which he said was his coach and six it is indeed the vehicle in which the ladies take the air and pay their visits but they have taken very little care for accommodations there is no way in or out of the boat for a woman but by being carried and in the boat thus dignified with a pompous name there is no seat but an occasional bundle of straw thus we left raarsa the seat of plenty civility and cheerfulness we dined at a publick house at port re so called because one of the scottish kings landed there in a progress through the western isles raarsa paid the reckoning privately we then got on horseback and by a short but very tedious journey came to kingsburgh at which the same king lodged after he landed here i had the honour of saluting the farfamed miss flora macdonald who conducted the prince dressed as her maid through the english forces from the island of lewes and when she came to skie dined with the english officers and left her maid below she must then have been a very young lady she is now not old of a pleasing person and elegant behaviour she told me that she thought herself honoured by my visit and i am sure that whatever regard she bestowed on me was liberally repaid if thou likest her opinions thou wilt praise her virtue she was carried to london but dismissed without a trial and came down with malcolm macleod against whom sufficient evidence could not be procured she and her husband are poor and are going to try their fortune in america sic rerum volvitur orbis at kingsburgh we were very liberally feasted and i slept in the bed in which the prince reposed in his distress the sheets which he used were never put to any meaner offices but were wrapped up by the lady of the house and at last according to her desire were laid round her in her grave these are not whigs on the th travelling partly on horseback where we could not row and partly on foot where we could not ride we came to dunvegan which i have described already here though poor macleod had been left by his grandfather overwhelmed with debts we had another exhibition of feudal hospitality there were two stags in the house and venison came to the table every day in its various forms macleod besides his estate in skie larger i suppose than some english counties is proprietor of nine inhabited isles and of his islands uninhabited i doubt if he very exactly knows the number i told him that he was a mighty monarch such dominions fill an englishman with envious wonder but when he surveys the naked mountains and treads the quaking moor and wanders over the wild regions of gloomy barrenness his wonder may continue but his envy ceases the unprofitableness of these vast domains can be conceived only by the means of positive instances the heir of col an island not far distant has lately told me how wealthy he should be if he could let rum another of his islands for twopence halfpenny an acre and macleod has an estate which the surveyor reports to contain eighty thousand acres rented at six hundred pounds a year while we were at dunvegan the wind was high and the rain violent so that we were not able to put forth a boat to fish in the sea or to visit the adjacent islands which may be seen from the house but we filled up the time as we could sometimes by talk sometimes by reading i have never wanted books in the isle of skie we were invited one day by the laird and lady of muck one of the western islands two miles long and three quarters of a mile high he has half his island in his own culture and upon the other half live one hundred and fifty dependants who not only live upon the product but export corn sufficient for the payment of their rent lady macleod has a son and four daughters they have lived long in england and have the language and manners of english ladies we lived with them very easily the hospitality of this remote region is like that of the golden age we have found ourselves treated at every house as if we came to confer a benefit we were eight days at dunvegan but we took the first opportunity which the weather afforded after the first days of going away and on the st went to ulinish where we were well entertained and wandered a little after curiosities in the afternoon an interval of calm sunshine courted us out to see a cave on the shore famous for its echo when we went into the boat one of our companions was asked in erse by the boatmen who they were that came with him he gave us characters i suppose to our advantage and was asked in the spirit of the highlands whether i could recite a long series of ancestors the boatmen said as i perceived afterwards that they heard the cry of an english ghost this boswell says disturbed him we came to the cave and clambering up the rocks came to an arch open at one end one hundred and eighty feet long thirty broad in the broadest part and about thirty high there was no echo such is the fidelity of report but i saw what i had never seen before muscles and whilks in their natural state there was another arch in the rock open at both ends september rd we removed to talisker a house occupied by mr macleod a lieutenant colonel in the dutch service talisker has been long in the possession of gentlemen and therefore has a garden well cultivated and what is here very rare is shaded by trees a place where the imagination is more amused cannot easily be found the mountains about it are of great height with waterfalls succeeding one another so fast that as one ceases to be heard another begins between the mountains there is a small valley extending to the sea which is not far off beating upon a coast very difficult of access two nights before our arrival two boats were driven upon this coast by the tempest one of them had a pilot that knew the passage the second followed but a third missed the true course and was driven forward with great danger of being forced into the vast ocean but however gained at last some other island the crews crept to talisker almost lifeless with wet cold fatigue and terrour but the lady took care of them she is a woman of more than common qualifications having travelled with her husband she speaks four languages you find that all the islanders even in these recesses of life are not barbarous one of the ministers who has adhered to us almost all the time is an excellent scholar we have now with us the young laird of col who is heir perhaps to two hundred square miles of land he has first studied at aberdeen and afterwards gone to hertfordshire to learn agriculture being much impressed with desire of improvement he likewise has the notions of a chief and keeps a piper at macleods the bagpipe always played while we were dining col has undertaken by permission of the waves and wind to carry us about several of the islands with which he is acquainted enough to show us whatever curious is given by nature or left by antiquity but we grew afraid of deviating from our way home lest we should be shut up for months upon some little protuberance of rock that just appears above the sea and perhaps is scarcely marked upon a map you remember the doge of genoa who being asked what struck him most at the french court answered myself i cannot think many things here more likely to affect the fancy than to see johnson ending his sixtyfourth year in the wilderness of the hebrides but now i am here it will gratify me very little to return without seeing or doing my best to see what those places afford i have a desire to instruct myself in the whole system of pastoral life but i know not whether i shall be able to perfect the idea however i have many pictures in my mind which i could not have had without this journey and should have passed it with great pleasure had you and master and queeney been in the party we should have excited the attention and enlarged the observation of each other and obtained many pleasing topicks of future conversation as it is i travel with my mind too much at home and perhaps miss many things worthy of observation or pass them with transient notice so that the images for want of that reimpression which discussion and comparison produce easily fade away but i keep a book of remarks and boswell writes a regular journal of our travels which i think contains as much of what i say and do as of all other occurrences together for such a faithful chronicler as griffith i hope dearest madam you are equally careful to reposit proper memorials of all that happens to you and your family and then when we meet we shall tell our stories i wish you had gone this summer in your usual splendour to brighthelmstone mr thrale probably wonders how i live all this time without sending to him for money travelling in scotland is dear enough dearer in proportion to what the country affords than in england but residence in the isles is unexpensive company is i think considered as a supply of pleasure and a relief of that tediousness of life which is felt in every place elegant or rude of wine and punch they are very liberal for they get them cheap but as there is no customhouse on the island they can hardly be considered as smugglers their punch is made without lemons or any substitute their tables are very plentiful but a very nice man would not be pampered as they have no meat but as they kill it they are obliged to live while it lasts upon the same flesh they kill a sheep and set mutton boiled and roast on the table together they have fish both of the sea and of the brooks but they can hardly conceive that it requires any sauce to sauce in general they are strangers now and then butter is melted but i dare not always take lest i should offend by disliking it barley broth is a constant dish and is made well in every house a stranger if he is prudent will secure his share for it is not certain that he will be able to eat any thing else their meat being often newly killed is very tough and as nothing is sufficiently subdued by the fire is not easily to be eaten carving is here a very laborious employment for the knives are never whetted table knives are not of long subsistence in the highlands every man while arms were a regular part of dress had his knife and fork appendant to his dirk knives they now lay upon the table but the handles are apt to show that they have been in other hands and the blades have neither brightness nor edge of silver there is no want and it will last long for it is never cleaned they are a nation just rising from barbarity long contented with necessaries now somewhat studious of convenience but not yet arrived at delicate discriminations their linen is however both clean and fine bread such as we mean by that name i have never seen in the isle of skie they have ovens for they bake their pies but they never ferment their meal nor mould a loaf cakes of oats and barley are brought to the table but i believe wheat is reserved for strangers they are commonly too hard for me and therefore i take potatoes to my meat and am sure to find them on almost every table they retain so much of the pastoral life that some preparation of milk is commonly one of the dishes both at dinner and supper tea is always drunk at the usual times but in the morning the table is polluted with a plate of slices of strong cheese this is peculiar to the highlands at edinburgh there are always honey and sweetmeats on the morning teatable strong liquors they seem to love every man perhaps woman begins the day with a dram and the punch is made both at dinner and supper they have neither wood nor coal for fuel but burn peat or turf in their chimneys it is dug out of the moors or mosses and makes a strong and lasting fire not always very sweet and somewhat apt to smoke the pot the houses of inferiour gentlemen are very small and every room serves many purposes in the bedrooms perhaps are laid up stores of different kinds and the parlour of the day is a bedroom at night in the room which i inhabited last about fourteen feet square there were three chests of drawers a long chest for larger clothes two closetcupboards and the bed their rooms are commonly dirty of which they seem to have little sensibility and if they had more clean floors would be difficultly kept where the first step from the door is into the dirt they are very much inclined to carpets and seldom fail to lay down something under their feet better or worse as they happen to be furnished the highland dress being forbidden by law is very little used sometimes it may be seen but the english traveller is struck with nothing so much as the nudit des pieds of the common people skie is the greatest island or the greatest but one among the hebrides of the soil i have already given some account it is generally barren but some spots are not wholly unfruitful the gardens have apples and pears cherries strawberries raspberries currants and gooseberries but all the fruit that i have seen is small they attempt to sow nothing but oats and barley oats constitute the breadcorn of the place their harvest is about the beginning of october and being so late is very much subject to disappointments from the rains that follow the equinox this year has been particularly disastrous their rainy season lasts from autumn to spring they have seldom very hard frosts nor was it ever known that a lake was covered with ice strong enough to bear a skater the sea round them is always open the snow falls but soon melts only in they had a cold spring in which the island was so long covered with it that many beasts both wild and domestick perished and the whole country was reduced to distress from which i know not if it is even yet recovered the animals here are not remarkably small perhaps they recruit their breed from the mainland the cows are sometimes without horns the horned and unhorned cattle are not accidental variations but different species they will however breed together october rd the wind is now changed and if we snatch the moment of opportunity an escape from this island is become practicable i have no reason to complain of my reception yet i long to be again at home you and my master may perhaps expect after this description of skie some account of myself my eye is i am afraid not fully recovered my ears are not mended my nerves seem to grow weaker and i have been otherwise not as well as i sometimes am but think myself lately better this climate perhaps is not within my degree of healthy latitude thus i have given my most honoured mistress the story of me and my little ramble we are now going to some other isle to what we know not the wind will tell us i am c xxv to mrs thrale mull oct dear madam though i have written to mr thrale yet having a little more time than was promised me i would not suffer the messenger to go without some token of my duty to my mistress who i suppose expects the usual tribute of intelligence a tribute which i am not very able to pay october rd after having been detained by storms many days in skie we left it as we thought with a fair wind but a violent gust which bos had a great mind to call a tempest forced us into col an obscure island on which nulla campis arbor aestiva recreatur aura there is literally no tree upon the island part of it is a sandy waste over which it would be really dangerous to travel in dry weather and with a high wind it seems to be little more than one continued rock covered from space to space with a thin layer of earth it is however according to the highland notion very populous and life is improved beyond the manners of skie for the huts are collected into little villages and every one has a small garden of roots and cabbage the laird has a new house built by his uncle and an old castle inhabited by his ancestors the young laird entertained us very liberally he is heir perhaps to three hundred square miles of land which at ten shillings an acre would bring him ninetysix thousand pounds a year he is desirous of improving the agriculture of his country and in imitation of the czar travelled for improvement and worked with his own hands upon a farm in hertfordshire in the neighbourhood of your uncle sir thomas salusbury he talks of doing useful things and has introduced turnips for winter fodder he has made a small essay towards a road col is but a barren place description has here few opportunities of spreading her colours the difference of day and night is the only vicissitude the succession of sunshine to rain or of calms to tempests we have not known wind and rain have been our only weather at last after about nine days we hired a sloop and having lain in it all night with such accommodations as these miserable vessels can afford were landed yesterday on the isle of mull from which we expect an easy passage into scotland i am sick in a ship but recover by lying down i have not good health i do not find that travelling much helps me my nights are flatulent though not in the utmost degree and i have a weakness in my knees which makes me very unable to walk pray dear madam let me have a long letter i am c xxvi to mrs thrale inverary oct honoured mistress my last letters to you and my dear master were written from mull the third island of the hebrides in extent there is no post and i took the opportunity of a gentlemans passage to the mainland in mull we were confined two days by the weather on the third we got on horseback and after a journey difficult and tedious over rocks naked and valleys untracked through a country of barrenness and solitude we came almost in the dark to the seaside weary and dejected having met with nothing but water falling from the mountains that could raise any image of delight our company was the young laird of col and his servant col made every maclean open his house where he came and supply us with horses when we departed but the horses of this country are small and i was not mounted to my wish at the seaside we found the ferryboat departed if it had been where it was expected the wind was against us and the hour was late nor was it very desirable to cross the sea in darkness with a small boat the captain of a sloop that had been driven thither by the storms saw our distress and as we were hesitating and deliberating sent his boat which by cols order transported us to the isle of ulva we were introduced to mr macquarry the head of a small clan whose ancestors have reigned in ulva beyond memory but who has reduced himself by his negligence and folly to the necessity of selling this venerable patrimony on the next morning we passed the strait to inch kenneth an island about a mile in length and less than half a mile broad in which kenneth a scottish saint established a small clerical college of which the chapel walls are still standing at this place i beheld a scene which i wish you and my master and queeney had partaken the only family on the island is that of sir allan the chief of the ancient and numerous clan of maclean the clan which claims the second place yielding only to macdonald in the line of battle sir allan a chieftain a baronet and a soldier inhabits in this insulated desert a thatched hut with no chambers young col who owns him as his chief and whose cousin was his lady had i believe given him some notice of our visit he received us with the soldiers frankness and the gentlemans elegance and introduced us to his daughters two young ladies who have not wanted education suitable to their birth and who in their cottage neither forgot their dignity nor affected to remember it do not you wish to have been with us sir allans affairs are in disorder by the fault of his ancestors and while he forms some scheme for retrieving them he has retreated hither when our salutations were over he showed us the island we walked uncovered into the chapel and saw in the reverend ruin the effects of precipitate reformation the floor is covered with ancient gravestones of which the inscriptions are not now legible and without some of the chief families still continue the right of sepulture the altar is not yet quite demolished beside it on the right side is a bassrelief of the virgin with her child and an angel hovering over her on the other side still stands a handbell which though it has no clapper neither presbyterian bigotry nor barbarian wantonness has yet taken away the chapel is thirtyeight feet long and eighteen broad boswell who is very pious went into it at night to perform his devotions but came back in haste for fear of spectres near the chapel is a fountain to which the water remarkably pure is conveyed from a distant hill through pipes laid by the romish clergy which still perform the office of conveyance though they have never been repaired since popery was suppressed we soon after went in to dinner and wanted neither the comforts nor the elegancies of life there were several dishes and variety of liquors the servants live in another cottage in which i suppose the meat is dressed towards evening sir allan told us that sunday never passed over him like another day one of the ladies read and read very well the evening service and paradise was opened in the wild next day th we went and wandered among the rocks on the shore while the boat was busy in catching oysters of which there is a great bed oysters lie upon the sand one i think sticking to another and cockles are found a few inches under the sand we then went in the boat to sondiland a little island very near we found it a wild rock of about ten acres part naked part covered with sand out of which we picked shells and part clothed with a thin layer of mould on the grass of which a few sheep are sometimes fed we then came back and dined i passed part of the afternoon in reading and in the evening one of the ladies played on her harpsichord and boswell and col danced a reel with the other on the th we persuaded sir allan to lanch his boat again and go with us to icolmkill where the first great preacher of christianity to the scots built a church and settled a monastery in our way we stopped to examine a very uncommon cave on the coast of mull we had some difficulty to make our way over the vast masses of broken rocks that lie before the entrance and at the mouth were embarrassed with stones which the sea had accumulated as at brighthelmstone but as we advanced we reached a floor of soft sand and as we left the light behind us walked along a very spacious cavity vaulted over head with an arch almost regular by which a mountain was sustained at least a very lofty rock from this magnificent cavern went a narrow passage to the right hand which we entered with a candle and though it was obstructed with great stones clambered over them to a second expansion of the cave in which there lies a great square stone which might serve as a table the air here was very warm but not oppressive and the flame of the candle continued pyramidal the cave goes onward to an unknown extent but we were now one hundred and sixty yards under ground we had but one candle and had never heard of any that went farther and came back we therefore thought it prudent to return going forward in our boat we came to a cluster of rocks black and horrid which sir allan chose for the place where he would eat his dinner we climbed till we got seats the stores were opened and the repast taken we then entered the boat again the night came upon us the wind rose the sea swelled and boswell desired to be set on dry ground we however pursued our navigation and passed by several little islands in the silent solemnity of faint moonshine seeing little and hearing only the wind and the water at last we reached the island the venerable seat of ancient sanctity where secret piety reposed and where falling greatness was reposited the island has no house of entertainment and we manfully made our bed in a farmers barn the description i hope to give you another time i am c xxvii to mrs thrale edinburgh nov dearest madam among the possibilities of evil which my imagination suggested at this distance i missed that which has really happened i never had much hope of a will in your favour but was willing to believe that no will would have been made the event is now irrevocable it remains only to bear it not to wish it had been different is impossible but as the wish is painful without use it is not prudent perhaps not lawful to indulge it as life and vigour of mind and sprightliness of imagination and flexibility of attention are given us for valuable and useful purposes we must not think ourselves at liberty to squander life to enervate intellectual strength to cloud our thoughts or fix our attention when by all this expense we know that no good can be produced be alone as little as you can when you are alone do not suffer your thoughts to dwell on what you might have done to prevent this disappointment you perhaps could not have done what you imagine or might have done it without effect but even to think in the most reasonable manner is for the present not so useful as not to think remit yourself solemnly into the hands of god and then turn your mind upon the business and amusements which lie before you all is best says chene as it has been excepting the errours of our own free will burton concludes his long book upon melancholy with this important precept be not solitary be not idle remember chenes position and observe burtons precept we came hither on the ninth of this month i long to come under your care but for some days cannot decently get away they congratulate our return as if we had been with phipps or banks i am ashamed of their salutations i have been able to collect very little for queeneys cabinet but she will not want toys now she is so well employed i wish her success and am not without some thought of becoming her schoolfellow i have got an italian rasselas surely my dear lucy will recover i wish i could do her good i love her very much and should love another godchild if i might have the honour of standing to the next baby i am c xxviii to mrs thrale edinburgh nov my dearest mistress this is the last letter that i shall write while you are reading it i shall be coming home i congratulate you upon your boy but you must not think that i will love him all at once as well as i love harry for harry you know is so rational i shall love him by degrees poor pretty dear lucy can nothing do her good i am sorry to lose her but if she must be taken from us let us resign her with confidence into the hands of him who knows and who only knows what is best both for us and her do not suffer yourself to be dejected resolution and diligence will supply all that is wanting and all that is lost but if your health should be impaired i know not where to find a substitute i shall have no mistress mr thrale will have no wife and the little flock will have no mother i long to be home and have taken a place in the coach for monday i hope therefore to be in london on friday the th in the evening please to let mrs williams know i am c xxix to the same lichfield june dear madam now i hope you are thinking shall i have a letter today from lichfield something of a letter you will have how else can i expect that you should write and the morning on which i should miss a letter would be a morning of uneasiness notwithstanding all that would be said or done by the sisters of stowhill who do and say whatever good they can they give me good words and cherries and strawberries lady and her mother and sister were visiting there yesterday and lady took her tea before her mother mrs cobb is to come to miss porters this afternoon miss a comes little near me mr langley of ashbourne was here today in his way to birmingham and every body talks of you the ladies of the amicable society are to walk in a few days from the townhall to the cathedral in procession to hear a sermon they walk in linen gowns and each has a stick with an acorn but for the acorn they could give no reason till i told them of the civick crown i have just had your sweet letter and am glad that you are to be at the regatta you know how little i love to have you left out of any shining part of life you have every right to distinction and should therefore be distinguished you will see a show with philosophick superiority and therefore may see it safely it is easy to talk of sitting at home contented when others are seeing or making shows but not to have been where it is supposed and seldom supposed falsely that all would go if they could to be able to say nothing when every one is talking to have no opinion when every one is judging to hear exclamations of rapture without power to depress to listen to falsehoods without right to contradict is after all a state of temporary inferiority in which the mind is rather hardened by stubbornness than supported by fortitude if the world be worth winning let us enjoy it if it is to be despised let us despise it by conviction but the world is not to be despised but as it is compared with something better company is in itself better than solitude and pleasure better than indolence ex nihilo nihil fit says the moral as well as the natural philosopher by doing nothing and by knowing nothing no power of doing good can be obtained he must mingle with the world that desires to be useful every new scene impresses new ideas enriches the imagination and enlarges the power of reason by new topicks of comparison you that have seen the regatta will have images which we who miss it must want and no intellectual images are without use but when you are in this scene of splendour and gaiety do not let one of your fits of negligence steal upon you hoc age is the great rule whether you are serious or merry whether you are stating the expenses of your family learning science or duty from a folio or floating on the thames in a fancied dress of the whole entertainment let me not hear so copious nor so true an account from any body as from you i am dearest madam your c xxx to mrs thrale ashbourne dear madam i am sure i write and write and every letter that comes from you charges me with not writing since i wrote to queeney i have written twice to you on the th and the th be pleased to let me know whether you have them or have them not that of the th you should regularly have had on the th yet your letter of the th seems not to mention it all this puzzles me poor dear he only grows dull because he is sickly age has not yet begun to impair him nor is he such a chameleon as to take immediately the colour of his company when you see him again you will find him reanimated most men have their bright and their cloudy days at least they have days when they put their powers into action and days when they suffer them to repose fourteen thousand pounds make a sum sufficient for the establishment of a family and which in whatever flow of riches or confidence of prosperity deserves to be very seriously considered i hope a great part of it has paid debts and no small part bought land as for gravelling and walling and digging though i am not much delighted with them yet something indeed much must be allowed to every mans taste he that is growing rich has a right to enjoy part of the growth his own way i hope to range in the walk and row upon the water and devour fruit from the wall dr taylor wants to be gardening he means to buy a piece of ground in the neighbourhood and surround it with a wall and build a gardeners house upon it and have fruit and be happy much happiness it will not bring him but what can he do better if i had money enough what would i do perhaps if you and master did not hold me i might go to cairo and down the red sea to bengal and take a ramble in india would this be better than building and planting it would surely give more variety to the eye and more amplitude to the mind half fourteen thousand would send me out to see other forms of existence and bring me back to describe them i answer this the day on which i had yours of the th that is on the th let me know when it comes i am c xxxi to mrs thrale lichfield august madam i dined today at stowhill and am come away to write my letter never surely was i such a writer before do you keep my letters i am not of your opinion that i shall not like to read them hereafter for though there is in them not much history of mind or anything else they will i hope always be in some degree the records of a pure and blameless friendship and in some hours of languor and sadness may revive the memory of more cheerful times why you should suppose yourself not desirous hereafter to read the history of your own mind i do not see twelve years on which you now look as on a vast expanse of life will probably be passed over uniformly and smoothly with very little perception of your progress and with very few remarks upon the way the accumulation of knowledge which you promise to yourself by which the future is to look back upon the present with the superiority of manhood to infancy will perhaps never be attempted or never will be made and you will find as millions have found before you that fortyfive has made little sensible addition to thirtythree as the body after a certain time gains no increase of height and little of strength there is likewise a period though more variable by external causes when the mind commonly attains its stationary point and very little advances its powers of reflection judgment and ratiocination the body may acquire new modes of motion or new dexterities of mechanick operations but its original strength receives not improvement the mind may be stored with new languages or new sciences but its power of thinking remains nearly the same and unless it attains new subjects of meditation it commonly produces thoughts of the same force and the same extent at very distant intervals of life as the tree unless a foreign fruit be ingrafted gives year after year productions of the same form and the same flavour by intellectual force or strength of thought is meant the degree of power which the mind possesses of surveying the subject of meditation with its circuit of concomitants and its train of dependence of this power which all observe to be very different in different minds part seems the gift of nature and part the acquisition of experience when the powers of nature have attained their intended energy they can be no more advanced the shrub can never become a tree and it is not unreasonable to suppose that they are before the middle of life in their full vigour nothing then remains but practice and experience and perhaps why they do so little may be worth inquiry but i have just now looked and find it so late that i will inquire against the next post night i am c xxxii to mrs thrale lichfield augusts dear madam instead of forty reasons for my return one is sufficient that you wish for my company i purpose to write no more till you see me the ladies at stowhill and greenhill are unanimously of opinion that it will be best to take a post chaise and not to be troubled with the vexations of a common carriage i will venture to suppose the ladies at streatham to be of the same mind you will now expect to be told why you will not be so much wiser as you expect when you have lived twelve years longer it is said and said truly that experience is the best teacher and it is supposed that as life is lengthened experience is increased but a closer inspection of human life will discover that time often passes without any incident which can much enlarge knowledge or ratify judgment when we are young we learn much because we are universally ignorant we observe every thing because every thing is new but after some years the occurrences of daily life are exhausted one day passes like another in the same scene of appearances in the same course of transactions we have to do what we have often done and what we do not try because we do not wish to do much better we are told what we already know and therefore what repetition cannot make us know with greater certainty he that has early learned much perhaps seldom makes with regard to life and manners much addition to his knowledge not only because as more is known there is less to learn but because a mind stored with images and principles turns inwards for its own entertainment and is employed in settling those ideas which run into confusion and in recollecting those which are stealing away practices by which wisdom may be kept but not gained the merchant who was at first busy in acquiring money ceases to grow richer from the time when he makes it his business only to count it those who have families or employments are engaged in business of little difficulty but of great importance requiring rather assiduity of practice than subtilty of speculation occupying the attention with images too bulky for refinement and too obvious for research the right is already known what remains is only to follow it daily business adds no more to wisdom than daily lesson to the learning of the teacher but of how few lives does not stated duty claim the greater part far the greater part of human minds never endeavour their own improvement opinions once received from instruction or settled by whatever accident are seldom recalled to examination having been once supposed to be right they are never discovered to be erroneous for no application is made of any thing that time may present either to shake or to confirm them from this acquiescence in preconceptions none are wholly free between fear of uncertainty and dislike of labour every one rests while he might yet go forward and they that were wise at thirtythree are very little wiser at fortyfive of this speculation you are perhaps tired and would rather hear of sophy i hope before this comes that her head will be easier and your head less filled with fears and troubles which you know are to be indulged only to prevent evil not to increase it your uneasiness about sophy is probably unnecessary and at worst your own children are healthful and your affairs prosperous unmingled good cannot be expected but as we may lawfully gather all the good within our reach we may be allowed to lament after that which we lose i hope your losses are at an end and that as far as the condition of our present existence permits your remaining life will be happy i am c xxxiii to mrs thrale lichfield march dear madam this letter will not i hope reach you many days before me in a distress which can be so little relieved nothing remains for a friend but to come and partake it poor dear sweet little boy when i read the letter this day to mrs aston she said such a death is the next to translation yet however i may convince myself of this the tears are in my eyes and yet i could not love him as you loved him nor reckon upon him for a future comfort as you and his father reckoned upon him he is gone and we are going we could not have enjoyed him long and shall not long be separated from him he has probably escaped many such pangs as you are now feeling nothing remains but that with humble confidence we resign ourselves to almighty goodness and fall down without irreverent murmurs before the sovereign distributer of good and evil with hope that though sorrow endureth for a night yet joy may come in the morning i have known you madam too long to think that you want any arguments for submission to the supreme will nor can my consolation have any effect but that of showing that i wish to comfort you what can be done you must do for yourself remember first that your child is happy and then that he is safe not only from the ills of this world but from those more formidable dangers which extend their mischief to eternity you have brought into the world a rational being have seen him happy during the little life that has been granted him and can have no doubt but that his happiness is now permanent and immutable when you have obtained by prayer such tranquillity as nature will admit force your attention as you can upon your accustomed duties and accustomed entertainments you can do no more for our dear boy but you must not therefore think less on those whom your attention may make fitter for the place to which he is gone i am dearest dearest madam your most affectionate humble servant xxxiv to mrs thrale sept dearest lady it is true that i have loitered and what is worse loitered with very little pleasure the time has run away as most time runs without account without use and without memorial but to say this of a few weeks though not pleasing might be borne but what ought to be the regret of him who in a few days will have so nearly the same to say of sixtyeight years but complaint is vain if you have nothing to say from the neighbourhood of the metropolis what can occur to me in little cities and petty towns in places which we have both seen and of which no description is wanted i have left part of the company with which you dined here to come and write this letter in which i have nothing to tell but that my nights are very tedious i cannot persuade myself to forbear trying something as you have now little to do i suppose you are pretty diligent at the thraliana and a very curious collection posterity will find it do not remit the practice of writing down occurrences as they arise of whatever kind and be very punctual in annexing the dates chronology you know is the eye of history and every mans life is of importance to himself do not omit painful casualties or unpleasing passages they make the variegation of existence and there are many transactions of which i will not promise with aeneas et haec olim meminisse juvabit yet that remembrance which is not pleasant may be useful there is however an intemperate attention to slight circumstances which is to be avoided lest a great part of life be spent in writing the history of the rest every day perhaps has something to be noted but in a settled and uniform course few days can have much why do i write all this which i had no thought of when i began the thraliana drove it all into my head it deserves however an hours reflection to consider how with the least loss of time the loss of what we wish to retain may be prevented do not neglect to write to me for when a post comes empty i am really disappointed boswell i believe will meet me here i am dearest lady your c xxxv to mrs thrale lichfield october dear madam this is the last time that i shall write in this excursion from this place tomorrow i shall be i hope at birmingham from which place i shall do my best to find the nearest way home i come home i think worse than i went and do not like the state of my health but vive hodie make the most of life i hope to get better and sweep the cobwebs but i have sad nights mrs aston has sent me to mr greene to be cured did you see foote at brighthelmstone did you think he would so soon be gone life says falstaff is a shuttle he was a fine fellow in his way and the world is really impoverished by his sinking glories murphy ought to write his life at least to give the world a footeiana now will any of his contemporaries bewail him will genius change his sex to weep i would really have his life written with diligence it will be proper for me to work pretty diligently now for some time i hope to get through though so many weeks have passed little lives and little criticisms may serve having been in the country so long with very little to detain me i am rather glad to look homewards i am c xxxvi to mrs thrale october dear madam yet i do love to hear from you such pretty kind letters as you send but it gives me great delight to find that my master misses me i begin to wish myself with you more than i should do if i were wanted less it is a good thing to stay away till ones company is desired but not so good to stay after it is desired you know i have some work to do i did not set to it very soon and if i should go up to london with nothing done what would be said but that i was who can tell what i therefore stay till i can bring up something to stop their mouths and then though i am still at ashbourne i receive your dear letters that come to lichfield and you continue that direction for i think to get thither as soon as i can one of the does died yesterday and i am afraid her fawn will be starved i wish miss thrale had it to nurse but the doctor is now all for cattle and minds very little either does or hens how did you and your aunt part did you turn her out of doors to begin your journey or did she leave you by her usual shortness of visits i love to know how you go on i cannot but think on your kindness and my masters life has upon the whole fallen short very short of my early expectation but the acquisition of such a friendship at an age when new friendships are seldom acquired is something better than the general course of things gives man a right to expect i think on it with great delight i am not very apt to be delighted i am c xxxvii to mrs thrale lichfield october dear madam you talk of writing and writing as if you had all the writing to yourself if our correspondence were printed i am sure posterity for posterity is always the authors favourite would say that i am a good writer too anchio sono pittore to sit down so often with nothing to say to say something so often almost without consciousness of saying and without any remembrance of having said is a power of which i will not violate my modesty by boasting but i do not believe that every body has it some when they write to their friends are all affection some are wise and sententious some strain their powers for efforts of gaiety some write news and some write secrets but to make a letter without affection without wisdom without gaiety without news and without a secret is doubtless the great epistolick art in a mans letters you know madam his soul lies naked his letters are only the mirror of his breast whatever passes within him is shown undisguised in its natural process nothing is inverted nothing distorted you see systems in their elements you discover actions in their motives of this great truth sounded by the knowing to the ignorant and so echoed by the ignorant to the knowing what evidence have you now before you is not my soul laid open in these veracious pages do not you see me reduced to my first principles this is the pleasure of corresponding with a friend where doubt and distrust have no place and every thing is said as it is thought the original idea is laid down in its simple purity and all the supervenient conceptions are spread over it stratum super stratum as they happen to be formed these are the letters by which souls are united and by which minds naturally in unison move each other as they are moved themselves i know dearest lady that in the perusal of this such is the consanguinity of our intellects you will be touched as i am touched i have indeed concealed nothing from you nor do i expect ever to repent of having thus opened my heart i am c xxxviii to mrs thrale november dear madam and so supposing that i might come to town and neglect to give you notice or thinking some other strange thought but certainly thinking wrong you fall to writing about me to tom davies as if he could tell you anything that i would not have you know as soon as i came hither i let you know of my arrival and the consequence is that i am summoned to brighthelmstone through storms and cold and dirt and all the hardships of wintry journeys you know my natural dread of all those evils yet to show my master an example of compliance and to let you know how much i long to see you and to boast how little i give way to disease my purpose is to be with you on friday i am sorry for poor nezzy and hope she will in time be better i hope the same for myself the rejuvenescency of mr scrase gives us both reason to hope and therefore both of us rejoice in his recovery i wish him well besides as a friend to my master i am just come home from not seeing my lord mayors show but i might have seen at least part of it but i saw miss wesley and her brothers she sends her compliments mrs williams is come home i think a very little better every body was an enemy to that wig we will burn it and get drunk for what is joy without drink wagers are laid in the city about our success which is yet as the french call it problematical well but seriously i think i shall be glad to see you in your own hair but do not take too much time in combing and twisting and papering and unpapering and curling and frizling and powdering and getting out the powder with all the other operations required in the cultivation of a head of hair yet let it be combed at least once in three months on the quarterday i could wish it might be combed once at least in six weeks if i were to indulge my wishes but what are wishes without hopes i should fancy the operation performed one knows not when one has enough perhaps every morning i am dearest lady your c xxxix to mrs thrale ashbourne june dear madam your account of mr thrales illness is very terrible but when i remember that he seems to have it peculiar to his constitution that whatever distemper he has he always has his head affected i am less frighted the seizure was i think not apoplectical but hysterical and therefore not dangerous to life i would have you however consult such physicians as you think you can best trust broomfield seems to have done well and by his practice appears not to suspect an apoplexy this is a solid and fundamental comfort i remember dr marsigli an italian physician whose seizure was more violent than mr thrales for he fell down helpless but his case was not considered as of much danger and he went safe home and is now a professor at padua his fit was considered as only hysterical i hope sir philip who franked your letter comforts you as well as mr seward if i can comfort you i will come to you but i hope you are now no longer in want of any help to be happy i am c the doctor sends his compliments he is one of the people that are growing old xl to mrs thrale ashbourne june dear madam how near we are all to extreme danger we are merry or sad or busy or idle and forget that death is hovering over us you are a dear lady for writing again the case as you now describe it is worse than i conceived it when i read your first letter it is still however not apoplectick but seems to have something worse than hysterical a tendency to a palsy which i hope however is now over i am glad that you have heberden and hope we are all safer i am the more alarmed by this violent seizure as i can impute it to no wrong practices or intemperance of any kind and therefore know not how any defence or preservative can be obtained mr thrale has certainly less exercise than when he followed the foxes but he is very far from unwieldiness or inactivity and further still from any vitious or dangerous excess i fancy however he will do well to ride more do dear madam let me know every post how he goes on such sudden violence is very dreadful we know not by what it is let loose upon us nor by what its effects are limited if my coming can either assist or divert or be useful to any purpose let me but know i will soon be with you mrs kennedy queeneys baucis ended last week a long life of disease and poverty she had been married about fifty years dr taylor is not much amiss but always complaining i am c xli to mr thrale lichfield june dear sir to show how well i think of your health i have sent you a hundred pounds to keep for me it will come within one day of quarterday and that day you must give me i came by it in a very uncommon manner and would not confound it with the rest my wicked mistress talks as if she thought it possible for me to be indifferent or negligent about your health or hers if i could have done any good i had not delayed an hour to come to you and i will come very soon to try if my advice can be of any use or my company of any entertainment what can be done you must do for yourself do not let any uneasy thought settle in your mind cheerfulness and exercise are your great remedies nothing is for the present worth your anxiety vivite laeti is one of the great rules of health i believe it will be good to ride often but never to weariness for weariness is itself a temporary resolution of the nerves and is therefore to be avoided labour is exercise continued to fatigue exercise is labour used only while it produces pleasure above all keep your mind quiet do not think with earnestness even of your health but think on such things as may please without too much agitation among which i hope is dear sir your c xlii to mrs thrale dear madam on sunday i dined with poor lawrence who is deafer than ever when he was told that dr moisy visited mr thrale he inquired for what and said there was nothing to be done which nature would not do for herself on sunday evening i was at mrs vesys and there was inquiry about my master but i told them all good there was dr bernard of eton and we made a noise all the evening and there was pepys and wraxal till i drove him away and i have no loss of my mistress who laughs and frisks and frolicks it all the long day and never thinks of poor colin if mr thrale will but continue to mend we shall i hope come together again and do as good things as ever we did but perhaps you will be made too proud to heed me and yet as i have often told you it will not be easy for you to find such another queeney has been a good girl and wrote me a letter if burney said she would write she told you a fib she writes nothing to me she can write home fast enough i have a good mind not to let her know that dr bernard to whom i had recommended her novel speaks of it with great commendation and that the copy which she lent me has been read by dr lawrence three times over and yet what a gipsy it is she no more minds me than if i were a brangton pray speak to queeney to write again i have had a cold and a cough and taken opium and think i am better we have had very cold weather bad riding weather for my master but he will surmount it all did mrs browne make any reply to your comparison of business with solitude or did you quite down her i am much pleased to think that mrs cotton thinks me worth a frame and a place upon her wall her kindness was hardly within my hope but time does wonderful things all my fear is that if i should come again my print would be taken down i fear i shall never hold it who dines with you do you see dr woodward or dr harrington do you go to the house where they write for the myrtle you are at all places of high resort and bring home hearts by dozens while i am seeking for something to say about men of whom i know nothing but their verses and sometimes very little of them now i have begun however i do not despair of making an end mr nichols holds that addison is the most taking of all that i have done i doubt they will not be done before you come away now you think yourself the first writer in the world for a letter about nothing can you write such a letter as this so miscellaneous with such noble disdain of regularity like shakespeares works such graceful negligence of transition like the ancient enthusiasts the pure voice of nature and of friendship now of whom shall i proceed to speak of whom but mrs montague having mentioned shakespeare and nature does not the name of montague force itself upon me such were the transitions of the ancients which now seem abrupt because the intermediate idea is lost to modern understandings i wish her name had connected itself with friendship but ah colin thy hopes are in vain one thing however is left me i have still to complain but i hope i shall not complain much while you have any kindness for me i am dearest and dearest madam your c london april xliii to mrs thrale dearest madam mr thrale never will live abstinently till he can persuade himself to abstain by rule i lived on potatoes on friday and on spinage today but i have had i am afraid too many dinners of late i took physick too both days and hope to fast tomorrow when he comes home we will shame him and jebb shall scold him into regularity i am glad however that he is always one of the company and that my dear queeney is again another encourage as you can the musical girl nothing is more common than mutual dislike where mutual approbation is particularly expected there is often on both sides a vigilance not overbenevolent and as attention is strongly excited so that nothing drops unheeded any difference in taste or opinion and some difference where there is no restraint will commonly appear immediately generates dislike never let criticisms operate upon your face or your mind it is very rarely that an author is hurt by his criticks the blaze of reputation cannot be blown out but it often dies in the socket a very few names may be considered as perpetual lamps that shine unconsumed from the author of fitzosbornes letters i cannot think myself in much danger i met him only once about thirty years ago and in some small dispute reduced him to whistle having not seen him since that is the last impression poor moore the fabulist was one of the company mrs montagues long stay against her own inclination is very convenient you would by your own confession want a companion and she is par pluribus conversing with her you may find variety in one at mrs ords i met one mrs b a travelled lady of great spirit and some consciousness of her own abilities we had a contest of gallantry an hour long so much to the diversion of the company that at ramsays last night in a crowded room they would have pitted us again there were smelt and the bishop of st asaph who comes to every place and lord monboddo and sir joshua and ladies out of tale the exhibition how will you do either to see or not to see the exhibition is eminently splendid there is contour and keeping and grace and expression and all the varieties of artificial excellence the apartments were truly very noble the pictures for the sake of a skylight are at the top of the house there we dined and i sat over against the archbishop of york see how i live when i am not under petticoat government i am c london may xliv to mrs thrale london june dear madam to the question who was impressed with consternation it may with great truth be answered that every body was impressed for nobody was sure of his safety on friday the good protestants met in st georges fields at the summons of lord george gordon and marching to westminster insulted the lords and commons who all bore it with great tameness at night the outrages began by the demolition of the masshouse by lincolns inn an exact journal of a weeks defiance of government i cannot give you on monday mr strahan who had been insulted spoke to lord mansfield who had i think been insulted too of the licentiousness of the populace and his lordship treated it as a very slight irregularity on tuesday night they pulled down fieldings house and burnt his goods in the street they had gutted on monday sir george savilles house but the building was saved on tuesday evening leaving fieldings ruins they went to newgate to demand their companions who had been seized demolishing the chapel the keeper could not release them but by the mayors permission which he went to ask at his return he found all the prisoners released and newgate in a blaze they then went to bloomsbury and fastened upon lord mansfields house which they pulled down and as for his goods they totally burnt them they have since gone to caen wood but a guard was there before them they plundered some papists i think and burnt a masshouse in moorfields the same night on wednesday i walked with dr scott to look at newgate and found it in ruins with the fire yet glowing as i went by the protestants were plundering the sessions house at the old bailey there were not i believe a hundred but they did their work at leisure in full security without sentinels without trepidation as men lawfully employed in full day such is the cowardice of a commercial place on wednesday they broke open the fleet and the kings bench and the marshalsea and wood street counter and clerkenwell bridewell and released all the prisoners at night they set fire to the fleet and to the kings bench and i know not how many other places and one might see the glare of conflagration fill the sky from many parts the sight was dreadful some people were threatened mr strahan advised me to take care of myself such a time of terrour you have been happy in not seeing the king said in council that the magistrates had not done their duty but that he would do his own and a proclamation was published directing us to keep our servants within doors as the peace was now to be preserved by force the soldiers were sent out to different parts and the town is now at quiet what has happened at your house you will know the harm is only a few butts of beer and i think you may be sure that the danger is over there is a body of soldiers at st margarets hill of mr tyson i know nothing nor can guess to what he can allude but i know that a young fellow of little more than seventy is naturally an unresisted conqueror of hearts pray tell mr thrale that i live here and have no fruit and if he does not interpose am not likely to have much but i think he might as well give me a little as give all to the gardener pray make my compliments to queeney and burney i am c xlv to mrs thrale june dear madam you have ere now heard and read enough to convince you that we have had something to suffer and something to fear and therefore i think it necessary to quiet the solicitude which you undoubtedly feel by telling you that our calamities and terrours are now at an end the soldiers are stationed so as to be every where within call there is no longer any body of rioters and the individuals are hunted to their holes and led to prison the streets are safe and quiet lord george was last night sent to the tower mr john wilkes was this day with a party of soldiers in my neighbourhood to seize the publisher of a seditious paper every body walks and eats and sleeps in security but the history of the last week would fill you with amazement it is without any modern example several chapels have been destroyed and several inoffensive papists have been plundered but the high sport was to burn the gaols this was a good rabble trick the debtors and the criminals were all set at liberty but of the criminals as has always happened many are already retaken and two pirates have surrendered themselves and it is expected that they will be pardoned government now acts again with its proper force and we are all again under the protection of the king and the law i thought that it would be agreeable to you and my master to have my testimony to the publick security and that you would sleep more quietly when i told you that you are safe i am dearest lady your c xlvi to mrs thrale london april dearest madam of your injunctions to pray for you and write to you i hope to leave neither unobserved and i hope to find you willing in a short time to alleviate your trouble by some other exercise of the mind i am not without my part of the calamity no death since that of my wife has ever oppressed me like this but let us remember that we are in the hands of him who knows when to give and when to take away who will look upon us with mercy through all our variations of existence and who invites us to call on him in the day of trouble call upon him in this great revolution of life and call with confidence you will then find comfort for the past and support for the future he that has given you happiness in marriage to a degree of which without personal knowledge i should have thought the description fabulous can give you another mode of happiness as a mother and at last the happiness of losing all temporal cares in the thoughts of an eternity in heaven i do not exhort you to reason yourself into tranquillity we must first pray and then labour first implore the blessing of god and use those means which he puts into our hands cultivated ground has few weeds a mind occupied by lawful business has little room for useless regret we read the will today but i will not fill my first letter with any other account than that with all my zeal for your advantage i am satisfied and that the other executors more used to consider property than i commended it for wisdom and equity yet why should i not tell you that you have five hundred pounds for your immediate expenses and two thousand pounds a year with both the houses and all the goods let us pray for one another that the time whether long or short that shall yet be granted us may be well spent and that when this life which at the longest is very short shall come to an end a better may begin which shall never end i am dearest madam your c xlvii to mrs thrale april dear madam i hope you begin to find your mind grow clearer my part of the loss hangs upon me i have lost a friend of boundless kindness at an age when it is very unlikely that i should find another if you think change of place likely to relieve you there is no reason why you should not go to bath the distances are unequal but with regard to practice and business they are the same it is a days journey from either place and the post is more expeditious and certain to bath consult only your own inclination for there is really no other principle of choice god direct and bless you mr c has offered mr p money but it was not wanted i hope we shall all do all we can to make you less unhappy and you must do all you can for yourself what we or what you can do will for a time be but little yet certainly that calamity which may be considered as doomed to fall inevitably on half mankind is not finally without alleviation it is something for me that as i have not the decrepitude i have not the callousness of old age i hope in time to be less affected i am c xlviii to mrs thrale london april dear madam that you are gradually recovering your tranquillity is the effect to be humbly expected from trust in god do not represent life as darker than it is your loss has been very great but you retain more than almost any other can hope to possess you are high in the opinion of mankind you have children from whom much pleasure may be expected and that you will find many friends you have no reason to doubt of my friendship be it worth more or less i hope you think yourself certain without much art or care it will not be easy for me to repay the benefits that i have received but i hope to be always ready at your call our sorrow has different effects you are withdrawn into solitude and i am driven into company i am afraid of thinking what i have lost i never had such a friend before let me have your prayers and those of my dear queeney the prudence and resolution of your design to return so soon to your business and your duty deserves great praise i shall communicate it on wednesday to the other executors be pleased to let me know whether you would have me come to streatham to receive you or stay here till the next day i am c xlix to the same bolt court fleet street june dear madam i am sitting down in no cheerful solitude to write a narrative which would once have affected you with tenderness and sorrow but which you will perhaps pass over now with a careless glance of frigid indifference for this diminution of regard however i know not whether i ought to blame you who may have reasons which i cannot know and i do not blame myself who have for a great part of human life done you what good i could and have never done you evil i have been disordered in the usual way and had been relieved by the usual methods by opium and catharticks but had rather lessened my dose of opium on monday the th i sat for my picture and walked a considerable way with little inconvenience in the afternoon and evening i felt myself light and easy and began to plan schemes of life thus i went to bed and in a short time waked and sat up as has been long my custom when i felt a confusion and indistinctness in my head which lasted i suppose about half a minute i was alarmed and prayed god that however he might afflict my body he would spare my understanding this prayer that i might try the integrity of my faculties i made in latin verse the lines were not very good but i knew them not to be very good i made them easily and concluded myself to be unimpaired in my faculties soon after i perceived that i had suffered a paralytick stroke and that my speech was taken from me i had no pain and so little dejection in this dreadful state that i wondered at my own apathy and considered that perhaps death itself when it should come would excite less horrour than seems now to attend it in order to rouse the vocal organs i took two drams wine has been celebrated for the production of eloquence i put myself into violent motion and i think repeated it but all was vain i then went to bed and strange as it may seem i think slept when i saw light it was time to contrive what i should do though god stopped my speech he left me my hand i enjoyed a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend lawrence who now perhaps overlooks me as i am writing and rejoices that i have what he wanted my first note was necessarily to my servant who came in talking and could not immediately comprehend why he should read what i put into his hands i then wrote a card to mr allen that i might have a discreet friend at hand to act as occasion should require in penning this note i had some difficulty my hand i knew not how nor why made wrong letters i then wrote to dr taylor to come to me and bring dr heberden and i sent to dr brocklesby who is my neighbour my physicians are very friendly and very disinterested and give me great hopes but you may imagine my situation i have so far recovered my vocal powers as to repeat the lords prayer with no very imperfect articulation my memory i hope yet remains as it was but such an attack produces solicitude for the safety of every faculty how this will be received by you i know not i hope you will sympathize with me but perhaps my mistress gracious mild and good cries is he dumb tis time he shoud but can this be possible i hope it cannot i hope that what when i could speak i spoke of you and to you will be in a sober and serious hour remembered by you and surely it cannot be remembered but with some degree of kindness i have loved you with virtuous affection i have honoured you with sincere esteem let not all our endearments be forgotten but let me have in this great distress your pity and your prayers you see i yet turn to you with my complaints as a settled and unalienable friend do not do not drive me from you for i have not deserved either neglect or hatred to the girls who do not write often for susy has written only once and miss thrale owes me a letter i earnestly recommend as their guardian and friend that they remember their creator in the days of their youth i suppose you may wish to know how my disease is treated by the physicians they put a blister upon my back and two from my ear to my throat one on a side the blister on the back has done little and those on the throat have not risen i bullied and bounced it sticks to our last sand and compelled the apothecary to make his salve according to the edinburgh dispensatory that it might adhere better i have two on now of my own prescription they likewise give me salt of hartshorn which i take with no great confidence but i am satisfied that what can be done is done for me o god give me comfort and confidence in thee forgive my sins and if it be thy good pleasure relieve my diseases for jesus christs sake amen i am almost ashamed of this querulous letter but now it is written let it go i am c l to mrs thrale dear madam among those that have inquired after me sir philip is one and dr burney was one of those who came to see me i have had no reason to complain of indifference or neglect dick burney is come home five inches taller yesterday in the evening i went to church and have been today to see the great burningglass which does more than was ever done before by the transmission of the rays but is not equal in power to those which reflect them it wastes a diamond placed in the focus but causes no diminution of pure gold of the rubies exposed to its action one was made more vivid the other paler to see the glass i climbed up stairs to the garret and then up a ladder to the leads and talked to the artist rather too long for my voice though clear and distinct for a little while soon tires and falters the organs of speech are yet very feeble but will i hope be by the mercy of god finally restored at present like any other weak limb they can endure but little labour at once would you not have been very sorry for me when i could scarcely speak fresh cantharides were this morning applied to my head and are to be continued some time longer if they play me no treacherous tricks they give me very little pain let me have your kindness and your prayers and think on me as on a man who for a very great portion of your life has done you all the good he could and desires still to be considered madam your c li to mrs thrale london july dearest madam this morning i took the air by a ride to hampstead and this afternoon i dined with the club but fresh cantharides were this day applied to my head mr cator called on me today and told me that he had invited you back to streatham i showed the unfitness of your return thither till the neighbourhood should have lost its habits of depredation and he seemed to be satisfied he invited me very kindly and cordially to try the air of beckenham and pleased me very much by his affectionate attention to miss vesy there is much good in his character and much usefulness in his knowledge queeney seems now to have forgotten me of the different appearance of the hills and valleys an account may perhaps be given without the supposition of any prodigy if she had been out and the evening was breezy the exhalations would rise from the low grounds very copiously and the wind that swept and cleared the hills would only by its cold condense the vapours of the sheltered valleys murphy is just gone from me he visits me very kindly and i have no unkindness to complain of i am sorry that sir philips request was not treated with more respect nor can i imagine what has put them so much out of humour i hope their business is prosperous i hope that i recover by degrees but my nights are restless and you will suppose the nervous system to be somewhat enfeebled i am madam your c lii to mrs thrale london october two nights ago mr burke sat with me a long time he seems much pleased with his journey we had both seen stonehenge this summer for the first time i told him that the view had enabled me to confute two opinions which have been advanced about it one that the materials are not natural stones but an artificial composition hardened by time this notion is as old as camdens time and has this strong argument to support it that stone of that species is nowhere to be found the other opinion advanced by dr charlton is that it was erected by the danes mr bowles made me observe that the transverse stones were fixed on the perpendicular supporters by a knob formed on the top of the upright stone which entered into a hollow cut in the crossing stone this is a proof that the enormous edifice was raised by a people who had not yet the knowledge of mortar which cannot be supposed of the danes who came hither in ships and were not ignorant certainly of the arts of life this proves likewise the stones not to be factitious for they that could mould such durable masses could do much more than make mortar and could have continued the transverse from the upright part with the same paste you have doubtless seen stonehenge and if you have not i should think it a hard task to make an adequate description it is in my opinion to be referred to the earliest habitation of the island as a druidical monument of at least two thousand years probably the most ancient work of man upon the island salisbury cathedral and its neighbour stonehenge are two eminent monuments of art and rudeness and may show the first essay and the last perfection in architecture i have not yet settled my thoughts about the generation of light air which i indeed once saw produced but i was at the height of my great complaint i have made inquiry and shall soon be able to tell you how to fill a balloon i am madam your c liii to mrs thrale london dec dear madam the wearisome solitude of the long evenings did indeed suggest to me the convenience of a club in my neighbourhood but i have been hindered from attending it by want of breath if i can complete the scheme you shall have the names and the regulations the time of the year for i hope the fault is rather in the weather than in me has been very hard upon me the muscles of my breast are much convulsed dr heberden recommends opiates of which i have such horrour that i do not think of them but in extremis i was however driven to them last night for refuge and having taken the usual quantity durst not go to bed for fear of that uneasiness to which a supine posture exposes me but rested all night in a chair with much relief and have been today more warm active and cheerful you have more than once wondered at my complaint of solitude when you hear that i am crowded with visits inopem me copia fecit visitors are no proper companions in the chamber of sickness they come when i could sleep or read they stay till i am weary they force me to attend when my mind calls for relaxation and to speak when my powers will hardly actuate my tongue the amusements and consolations of languor and depression are conferred by familiar and domestick companions which can be visited or called at will and can occasionally be quitted or dismissed who do not obstruct accommodation by ceremony or destroy indolence by awakening effort such society i had with levet and williams such i had where i am never likely to have it more i wish dear lady to you and my dear girls many a cheerful and pious christmas i am your c liv to mrs piozzi london july dear madam what you have done however i may lament it i have no pretence to resent as it has not been injurious to me i therefore breathe out one sigh more of tenderness perhaps useless but at least sincere i wish that god may grant you every blessing that you may be happy in this world for its short continuance and eternally happy in a better state and whatever i can contribute to your happiness i am very ready to repay for that kindness which soothed twenty years of a life radically wretched do not think slightly of the advice which i now presume to offer prevail upon mr piozzi to settle in england you may live here with more dignity than in italy and with more security your rank will be higher and your fortune more under your own eye i desire not to detail all my reasons but every argument of prudence and interest is for england and only some phantoms of imagination seduce you to italy i am afraid however that my counsel is vain yet i have eased my heart by giving it when queen mary took the resolution of sheltering herself in england the archbishop of st andrews attempting to dissuade her attended on her journey and when they came to the irremeable stream that separated the two kingdoms walked by her side into the water in the middle of which he seized her bridle and with earnestness proportioned to her danger and his own affection pressed her to return the queen went forward if the parallel reaches thus far may it go no farther the tears stand in my eyes i am going into derbyshire and hope to be followed by your good wishes for i am with great affection your c end of vol i
