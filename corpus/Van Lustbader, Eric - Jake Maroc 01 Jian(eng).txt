prologue toshimaku tokyo summer present the old man with the bent shoulders came out of the rain furling his janomegasahis ricepaper umbrellaas if it were a ships sail with some deliberation he climbed the slate step crept past the carved stone pot into which clear water flowed from a cut length of bamboo just above there he paused a moment cocking his head like the most attentive of pupils listening to the confluence of sounds the pitterpatter of the rain at his back the cheery gurgle of the flowing water at his side there was within that mingling he thought the precise mix of the melancholy and the joyous that made life so exquisite to live there is sadness in beauty he recalled his father telling him as a child when you can understand that you will no longer be a boy the old man shook his head and smiling thinly pushed through the nawanorens beaded curtaindoorway inside the room was small crowded with men drinking and eating smoke curled in the air like dragons breath dissipating slowly leaving behind a gray haze the nawanoren was a kind of neighborhood pub its name derived literally from the beaded curtain that in the past served as its only entrance irasshaimase was his greeting from friends as he brushed by a tall kimonoed figure the old man nodded admiring the exquisite workmanship of the blackonblack kimono he took his seat at a table where he was expected a waiter set an iced beer before him and he nodded his grateful thanks he ordered what he always loved to eat here broiled hamachi head nowhere in tokyo he thought do they make this fish better the beer cooled him the food came and he was soon totally engrossed in heated conversation with his friends if he noticed the movement of the tall figure as it passed through the beaded curtain covering the back doorway he gave no sign of it this was no typical japanese pub though its front room was similar to almost every one of the thousands of such small eating and drinking establishments that dotted the islands off the hallway that led from the nawanoren itself was a series of rooms since all traditional structures in japan were built around the size of the straw mat the tatamiapproximately six feet by three feetrooms were measured by that standard the tall figure of nichiren paused for a moment to take in his surroundings here each of the larger roomseighteen tatami or sowas filled with a single long low boxwood table around it were grouped men in business suits to a man they were leaning forward eyes gleaming faces sweating white shirts open striped ties askew droplets of perspiration were caught in the short bristles of their hair sparkling like diamonds in the lamplight nichiren grunted his contempt for these men then his eyes moved interspersed among the intent gamblers were men bare to the waist instead of shirts or jackets they wore their skin like clothing from wrists to neck from shoulder blades to narrow waists irezumi rippled over every square inch of their flesh the art form of japanese tattooing was like no other in the world the insertion of the sumi the colored ink made from pressed charcoal was not performed with an electric needle but rather as it always had been down through the centuries with handheld awls and chisels manufactured especially for the arduous task nichiren knew well how many years it took to complete one body he admired the iron will of these men he felt a certain kinship with the pain they had endured the inspired designs leapt out at him as he glanced from individual to individual here were a pair of bowing courtesans in complexly flowing robes of intricately patterned silk there was a rampant tiger muscles rippling sinuously leaping through underbrush alongside a swiftly flowing river here a dragons head surrounded by meticulously drawn flames there fishermen with their skeins and boats hauling up their catch as behind them fujiyama humbled both man and ocean with its whitecapped majesty nichiren was blind to the great sums of money that lay along the table smoke hung from the low rafters of the room from time to time geisha served sake and onigiri or rice balls from the nawanorens kitchen a gambler rose perhaps nichiren thought he was tired of the table his poor luck needed changing so he would spend more money nichiren laughed silently as he watched the poor wretch stumble down the hallway he retired to one of the small sixtatami rooms farther back in the complex there a woman or for a premium fee two would be sent him to sate other longings nichiren moved on past the two large pools and numerous baths for the clients relaxation eventually he came to a fusuma a sliding door removing his wooden clogs he knelt before sliding back the door and bowing formally entered inside was a ninetatami room furnished only with a low black lacquer table to his left sat kisan in the place of power he was the owner of this establishment and oyabunchiefof tokyos most powerful yakuza clan yakuza were gangsters but as in all things the japanese underworld was different from its counterparts in other countries for instance the yakuza clans were rigidly fixed bound by a moral code of giridutyas stringent as that of bushido the way of the samurai if one could say that there was honor among thieves it would be among the yakuza inlaid into the center of the table was kisans kamon his family crest it was a depiction of several interlocking masu boxes of graduating sizes traditionally used to measure rice the ancient japanese symbol of wealth masu therefore also meant to increase and to prosper to kisans left in the traditional place of the honored guest sat another man he was whipthin with a sunken chest his cheeks were emaciated which served to accentuate his darkly burning eyes the three men bowed to one another and waited kisan had made green tea himself serving the other men as a sign of honor and graciousness nothing passed between them save polite greetings until the tea had been made and served and the first sips savored on tongue palate and throat the refreshment is most delicious the man with the sunken chest said he was dressed in a dark chalkstriped suit with white shirt and striped tie except for the deep smallpox scars he was indistinguishable from all the other gamblers in the eighteentatami rooms down the hall domo arigato higirasan kisan inclined his bald head he was built low to the ground like a miniature sumo he was barrelchested with thickthewed limbs and a bull neck his features were powerful but coarse some might call it a peasants face in contrast nichirens face was composed of delicate features it was this curious ethereal beauty that seemed to the more superstitious his almost mysterious source of power like kisan he possessed big hara a centered assuredness that was as apparent when he was kneeling as it was when he was on his feet his arching forehead and flat planar cheeks caused him to be sought out by many modern japanese artists who wished to capture on paper or woodblock that certain magic they all found in his face it is always a pleasure to welcome you to ohenro house kisan said at last higira smiled grimly that was kisans wry sense of humor at work since ohenro meant pilgrimage the most serious of which was hachijuhakkasho a circuit covering eightyeight buddhist shrines his use of the word in naming this establishment was ironic indeed im quite certain that you would cherish seeing the last of me oh not true inspector kisan said if you were gone there would only be another to claim the fragrant grease we would not know him and i can readily assure you would not think as highly of him as we do you higira flushed at this unabashed flattery it did not embarrass him he never received such complimentary remarks from his superiors at the office domo he said bowing deeply deliberately wishing to conceal the extent to which he was pleased he glanced discreetly at his wristwatch pardon me for my impoliteness but time dictates my schedule of course nichiren said but he made no move a tension enveloped them a quiet that quickly became so profound that the exhortations of the feverish gamblers came to them in waves down the long hallway as if they were sitting near the sea higira despite the friendliness of the meeting had begun to sweat he felt nichirens glossy depthless eyes on him with such intensity that he imagined they were causing him pain his chest had tightened uncomfortably and it seemed to him as if he had forgotten how to get air into his lungs politeness prohibited him from uttering another word but it was nichirens gaze that was like a talon in his throat kisan watched nichiren carefully but covertly so that his guest could not see it was not only this extraordinary stillness that made him such a dreaded adversary kisan thought but the manner in which he could from this absolute state explode into immediate force of such fearful intensity like the wind blown across the water this power seemed elemental to kisan and therefore that much more deadly in time higira could no longer contain himself and he began to fidget in games of go kisan had observed that nichiren employed just this tactic engendering in his opponent an illconceived placement then with an astoundingly rapid series of moves he would cleave to the secret heart of each game penetrating his adversarys defenses at last laying down the winning stone when beads of sweat could be discerned on higiras forehead scarring it like his concave cheeks nichirens slash of a mouth curved upward at its ends from folds hidden inside his flowing blackonblack kimono he produced a gold key this he applied to a lock hidden in the grain of the wood floorboards beneath the tatami a section of wood came up from within nichiren lifted a woven basket approximately the size of a womans hatbox this he placed on the lacquer table precisely over the spot where kisans kamon was embedded higira was dumbfounded is this it he asked somewhat stupidly by way of answer nichiren lifted off the top of the basket and laid it with a certain reverence on the tatami beside him what is in there please higiras mouth was sticky with a lack of saliva nichiren pushed his kimono sleeve back with one hand while plunging the other into the basket when he pulled it out higiras tongue clove to the roof of his mouth ooof he exclaimed just as if he had been hit in the solar plexus he saw held up before him a severed human head blood still oozed from the stump of the neck and because it was being held aloft by the hair the head twisted slightly to and fro amida shizukisan your departmental rival nichiren said softly you wished your own promotion assured did you not his voice was high and singsong a trait associated more with a chinese than a japanese yes but the slight twisting motion made higira queasy in the pit of his stomach even so his eyes could not leave the grisly sight like a bloody war banner before him thus mesmerized his voice was as slurred as a drunkards i did not mean this i i had no idea i shizukisan was favored by keibatsu nichiren said his high odd voice heightening the bizarreness of the scene he was scheduled to marry tanabasansyour chiefsdaughter that would have so i learned sealed his fate and yours you had good cause to be concerned higirasan the marriage would have pushed him ahead of you you came to the right people kisan said to solve your problem but this higira felt as if he were in the grip of a nightmare he wanted to feel elated but he dared not his terror at what his request had unleashed gripped him with iron claws in another ten days nichiren said it would have been too late shizukisan would have been married part of tanabasans family and therefore untouchable you can see that there was no other alternative kisan said he stared at his guest higirasan yes yes with a supreme effort higira pulled himself back from the abyss toward which these revelations had been inexorably pushing him all his training told him how evil this was yet he was here he had come willingly to ask their aid in his predicament his greed and his ambition had rendered him blind to consequences that he saw now were like ripples on a lake moving outward from their source affecting the whole like it or not he knew that he had stepped across an invisible but nonetheless powerful barrier and could never return to the safety and security of his previous life home and hearth had never seemed so far away to him henceforth he would have to live according to his greed and his ambition he closed his eyes for a moment as if thus sealing his karma with a physical act would somehow reassure him now your career is free of rivals kisan said very pleased with the situation nichiren had researched higiras predicament well if higira had not come to them seeking aid they would have manufactured a series of events that would have manipulated him into making the request but this way kisan thought was so much less complicated in several years tanabasans chronic illness will become insupportable even for such an ironwilled man as he time will force him to step down he smiled broadly his small white teeth gleaming like a foxs then we shall all celebrate eh he laughed chief of police higira how does that sound to you my friend he nodded you see we are delighted for you you are part of our family now we will take care of you the three men lifted their tea cups in unison as they drank a discreet knock sounded nichiren rose and crossed the room to a fusuma directly behind kisan sliding it open he stood very still as if he were contemplating a complex and slightly puzzling object of art he stared straight ahead at the face illuminated within the dusky semidarkness at length he said so youve come after all really i never believed that you would outside the nawanoren the rain pattered dolefully slipping off sprays of leaves bowed beneath its weight yappari aoi kuni da from across the street the doorway to the nawanoren appeared framed by a jungle of bluegreen irises and hydrangeas hybrid gardenias of the same family of hues peeped out here and there as if shyly seeking recognition it is a green country jake maroc smiled to himself as he heard mandy choi repeat his whispered exclamation crouched as the two of them were in the dripping doorway directly opposite ohenro house it was important to keep noise down to a minimum even though the rain was a great help in that regard but of course it was a green country jake thought it was tsuyu the time of the plum rains the japanese found pleasure in such a multiplicity of major and minor occurrences they had created a word for that feeling odayaka that pleasure could pertain to a person just as well as an inanimate object such as a stone or a changeable one such as the sea or the weather aoi that host of varying bluegreen which burgeoned beneath the early summer tsuyu was the most odayaka of all colors in nature jake glanced at his chronometer mandy go get the others he whispered in japanese its almost time the small chinese nodded and disappeared into the rainfilled night in a moment he returned with four men all were chinese trained by jake himself at the hong kong station though they spoke perfect idiomatic japanese this was their first journey here for jake it was another story entirely he watched them as they came as proud as a father with his sons in their precision and expertise they were dressed alike vnecked white tshirts khaki trousers flared at the thighs like riding breeches hachimaki wound calico headbands encircled their gleaming foreheads on their feet were jikatabi rubbersoled boots that had a split between the big toe and the others and fit more like gloves than shoes they were as soft and pliable as indian moccasins so that one could still grip with the foot in short the six of them appeared to be nothing more than a group of workmen huddled in a doorway on their way home that was precisely the impression they wished to give jake had been counting off the seconds in his mind so that he did not have to look at his chronometer again this close to the jump he did not want to look away from the door his information had been exceptionally precise about the time jake mandy choi said close by his side what if hes not there hes there all right mandy watched the manic intensity in his friends face and felt a slight chill go through him i wish we had never come he thought this is the fourth day of the month he knew what that meant in numerology four was the number of death a very bad omen all gods protect us he thought now as he said the danger here is acute did you ever think to distrust your source hes there jake repeated my informations accurate if only it were someone other than nichiren mandy thought anyone id sooner take on the christian devil himself if he exists but nichiren and jake there was too much history between them the river of hatred too dark and too wide when it comes to nichiren mandy thought jake does not think clearly therefore i must look after him jake took three deep breaths he could feel the tension and the accelerated pulses behind him like a tide urging him on nichiren he thought at last i have you black images threatened to swamp his awareness thoughts he had locked away securely tore from their moorings whirling upward in anarchic disarray and with them emotions blood rushed in his ears like a battle cry all right he said thickly lets go neons turned the bed of the street to pinks and pale electric greens their shadows as they passed brought the darkness of the night back to the macadam the few passersby were withdrawn behind the shields of their amagasa backs bowed against the slanting rain a dog barked disconsolately down an alleyway the narrow walls lending a desperate note to the echoes the edge of the city like the blaze from a hearth seemed dulled by distance the throbbing of its vibrant colored lights watered down by the weather jake led the way through the beaded curtains hearing the preternaturally loud clatter they made as he parted them he was aware of mandy close at his side the others behind him and felt the brief flutters in his stomach subsiding he was no longer an individual he was part of dantai the group he was back in japan theres a drain break down the road mandy said as patrons heads turned and the manager came through from the tiny kitchen off to one side he shrugged all this rain tsuyu we have to check all the buildings within these six blocks jake slid as unobtrusively as he could through the smoke broken conversations continued sake and beer were lifted laughter crept again around the room the aroma of roasting shioyaki mingled with those of tobacco and sweat they went by the manager and abruptly accelerating sped through the rear curtaindoorway two kimonoed guards drew pistols as they broke through but mandy and one of the others smashed the edges of their hands against collarbones then the backs of necks kimono pooled across the polished wood strips of the hallway and the raiders stepped quickly over them with silent prearranged signals jake motioned for two of his men to take the north gambling room two others to take the south room he and mandy raced down the hallway toward the west room where his information told him nichiren would be flinging aside the fusuma jake found himself in a kind of antechamber it was a sixtatami room deep red and dovegray futon curled on the reed mats tansu chests their metalwork opalescent with age crouched at the four corners of the room on the walls were the repeated crescents of scabbarded katana at that moment he stopped dead in his tracks another sliding door was opening and two men stepped into the room for an instant the three stood at opposite ends staring at one another then the two men bare to the waist irezumi rippling with their long sleek muscles drew swords advancing toward jake mandy was just outside the door lintel engaged in silent combat with another guard jake darted to his right away from the first blindingly swift strikes and toward the scabbards on the wall he reached up withdrew a katana he knew instantly that it was old perhaps more than three centuries its heft and balance were exquisite it was a museum piece but that did not mean it had lost its deadly edge over and over the pure steel had been refolded in upon itself with the master swordsmiths zen dedication to create the finest blade the world had ever known seeing him thus armed the irezumimen separated so that they could come at him from either side and so increase their chances of success jake knew that time was slipping away from him with each added beat of the clock the likelihood of his capturing nichiren was rapidly decreasing as they rushed him he employed the techniques of kumiuchi stopping in midair the overhead blow from the thinner of the two irezumimen the one on his right with a horizontal parry that sent a clashing ring around the room within the same blinding motion he disguised until the last possible split second the wristflip that now continued the horizontal slash at waist height away from the thin mans blade and inward in a vicious arc slicing through skin flesh and bone into the second mans abdomen the heavier of the irezumimen screamed and clutching at the sliding mass of himself oozing through the rent dropped to his knees his useless katana clattered to the floor as jake pushed him forward and down on his face with his left hand while his hips began the powerful rightfacing swivel away from the path taken by his first opponent madeyed leopards in reds and lurid yellows leapt at jake the irezumi bulging with the mans efforts to bring his previously deflected overhead strike down on jakes skull but jake was already in another position swiveled enough so that he was facing the mans side out of range of his frontal attack as the yakuzas fierce momentum pushed him forward jake lifted his blade to shoulder height bringing the pointed end of it outward in a shallow arc there was a brief shout as the razor edge slashed through the meaty part of the mans arm because of the fineness of the edge and because jake was leaning his entire weight behind the strike the steel severed the arm completely slicing hotly into the rib cage and the vital organs it protected within blood spurted and there was a fetid wind as of a coffin briefly opened jake leapt over the settling corpse turning his head briefly as he heard movement outside the door mandy and the rest of the raiding party were piling through the open doorway using the katana jake slashed through the shoji into the connecting room he saw three men surrounding an object on a low table heads shape of a hatboxfilled with what shiny black strawfaces turning in his direction like pale flowers to the sun then jake was focused on only one person that man was clad in a blackonblack kimono his obsidian eyes were quite large in a rather narrow skull his face was triangular almost feline he had a long almost feminine neck and finely sculpted features he had small flat ears his thick hair was blueblack worn long in the style of another generation nichiren it was a sibilant whisper that jake could not contain his heart thudded painfully in his chest and his mouth was abruptly dry he remembered as a youth in hong kong going to see a film called the horror of dracula and being frightened out of his wits irrationally he felt the same unexplainable terror welling up in him now he was remembering what had happened at the sumchun river and it sent a shiver through him then jake was aware of a subtle movement nichiren made beneath the folds of his kimono he leapt forward the katana raised before him but kisan had stepped in front of nichiren his balled right fist outstretched a honed sixth sense warned jake and he thrust the katana to the vertical as kisans fingers unfurled like the petals of a flower his shouted kiai stunned those in the room not prepared for it but jake had known what lethal weapon lay within the oyabuns palm and as the metal links came hurtling at his face he shifted the point of his blade fractionally catching the weighted end the manrikigusari whirled around the katana but before jake could grab it kisan used the kakoiuchi a circular twist to disengage immediately he was on the offensive using a sukuiuchi a vertical figureeight pattern to get inside jakes defense he came in hard and jake broke away raising the katana this kisan blocked with the jodanuke immediately bringing his fists together for the eye strike that would end the struggle but jake had anticipated him and he stepped through the jodanuke freeing his upper arm the weighted ends of the manrikigusari were rushing at him as he struck downward obliquely he grunted heavily as the blade made contact because kisan was already twisting away the blow cut through arm and shoulder encountered ribs kisans eyes filled with an unnameable emotion even as he began to sink to his knees shuddering jake was unsure how deep he had gone and was bringing the blade forward and down for another strike when there came a swirl of movement from just behind kisan a savage cry as if reluctantly ripped from a tightened throat had jakes vision not been blocked had his mind not been fixed on the killing blow he might have had more warning spherical blurred shape arcing at him desperately he shouted to his men there was a sense then of reality breaking up into tiny discrete fragments dizzying and overlapping one upon the other until clarity was lost and only a vague impression was left like smeared pastel hues upon a canvas mandy grabbed his arm turning him backward he felt the other mans body close against him felt his warmth the protection it afforded him but in that shifting his gaze fell upon the other people across the room now far back against the opposite wall japanese faces and the woman blurred sense of time shifting of an element being acutely out of place then an arm was being raised and like a brocaded curtain a kimono sleeve rose up to shield her face from his sight then the room turned yellowwhite it seemed to balloon outward at him a ferocious howling filled his ears until it became too painful to hear the walls split apart and shot at him the ceiling broke apart like an ice floe and dropped inward with a sickening rush the monstrous percussion reached him then hurling mandy into him flattening them both against the floor with incredible force cursing nichirens name jake went down into blackness and unending pain and it was as if the entire building followed him down pinning him to the depths book one washington hong kong beijing tokyo moscow tsurugi summer present throw it onto the screen color shot eight feet by ten made grainy by size a human face that radiated power in precisely the way a tiger caught in midleap will curly black hair above a wide intelligent brow hooded coppery eyes extraordinary in their intelligence an aggressive cleanlined jaw high cheekbones that set the eyes deeply into the skull is there an update on him this was another voice somewhat warmer in tone i dont think he was hit too hard henry wunderman said although were not yet sure of the extent of the damages its fairly certain the worst part will be the psychological aspect of the dantais death dantai rodger donovan asked yes gerard stallings said in the slightly supercilious tone he used when addressing donovan he was a large rawboned man of sixfour who had the chiseled countenance of an englishman but spoke in a deceptively soft texas drawl suntanned his lined face was lean as muscular as his body dominated by deepset jadegreen eyes below a high freckled forehead he had thrived in nam when henry wunderman had recruited him for the quarry in he was leading the rebel forces in a small but strategic african country heavily supplied by the russians and not giving a damn stallings had been about to mount the final assault on the capital when wunderman had intervened wunderman had recognized stallings superb strategic mind and what had to be done to win the man over he had selected a soviet military cipher that had been intercepted by the quarry its voweltransposition inconstantdoubleconsonant code had been broken but despite that no one in staff could make head or tail of it wunderman took it to stallings who had one good look at it and was hooked he was a student of sun tzu to unite resolution with resilience is the business of war he had quoted to wunderman that hot sticky day in africa with the skulls of the government functionaries he and his raiders had killed piled all about them he loved the business of strategy too moving men around the world as if it were a wei qi board like jake dantai is a special kind of group stallings continued closer even than a family they rely on one another completely in situations of extreme hazard we have found that this intimate kinship reinforces the most desirable combat attributes of courage stamina and clear incisive thinking under duress stallings the only active field operative in the room clearly disliked anyone who lacked that experience of the three only donovan had no inkling of what fieldwork was like he often thought that if donovan was ever called upon to do wet work he would upchuck all over his expensive loafers the dantai wunderman went on is what made jake marocs unit so successful for so long up until the time of the sumchun river incident donovan said occasionally he glanced down at a sheaf of computer printouts it is the opinion of staff that that encounter radically changed jake maroc stallings shrugged the sumchun river was a bad one jake lost what was it henry three men four wunderman said he was a shorter man than stallings but a good deal chunkier henry you look like a sumo jake had told him laughingly more than once he was coarsefeatured with the veined vaguely bulbous nose of the irish prizefighter too long at his work his dark hair was receding too fast for him his ears were as large as a puppys his cheeks bore the scars of a childhood bout with smallpox but his soft brown eyes managed to turn a decidedly heavy face into a friendly one a fifth was crippled for life that was well over three years ago and since then jake put together the new dantai the men were supposed to be something special i think he did not want what happened at the sumchun river ever to happen again yet it did he lost them alland almost himselfon a chaos mission he saw a chance to get nichiren and took it wunderman said after what happened at the sumchun river can you blame him i dont god knows donovan said but the old man does he was by far the youngest man in the room of medium build fairskinned thick blond hair cool gray eyes which quietly took everything in a graduate of stanford and the rand corporation he was the odd man out here and knew it he was also smart enough not to try to overcome it you know better than i do henry how he feels about discipline his voice took on the deep almost stentorian tones of antony beridien discipline is the backbone of the quarry without it we would have no mandate without our mandate the world would have chaos donovan shook his head i know what jake was up to but the old man cant or wont im just trying to prepare you shit stallings said tension laced the room like fog but it was as if the three men seated across from one another at the round ashburl table had made a silent pact never to acknowledge it overtly there were four seats permanently bolted to the leadlined floor but one was vacant at the moment wheres antony wunderman asked at last hes winding up the meeting at state with the president i think theyre all pretty pissed with the flap that jakes created right now the japanese government is using the yakuza to explain away the violence but i can tell you theyve been very cold to us today that makes the president madder than hell because hes spent the last nine months of his term in office creating a series of reciprocal trade agreements with japan to help lessen our enormous trade deficit now only the devil knows what will happen and i dont have to remind you that if the presidents unhappy the old man will light a fire under us the three men froze as the leadlined door to their inner sanctum far below street level slid open with a distinctive rumble in the doorway was revealed the small gnarled figure of antony beridien the presidents advisorand prime confidanton all matters involving international security as the automaticseal door closed behind him the rooms internal light devolved upon him outlining his features he had an abnormally large head with a wide high forehead above which thick curling hair sprouted brushed carefully back he had enormous eyes the color of cobalt that could at times appear just as hard his heavily bridged hawklike nose would otherwise have dominated that face the deeply scored lines in his cheeks and brow like notches in a revolvers grip were worn with pride rather than the fear of passing time perhaps to compensate for his lack of height he moved in a long almost loping stride without a word he sat down surveying them all then he turned his adamantine gaze on wunderman your man maroc took a crack quarry unit off their preplanned assignment outside of hong kong and disappeared with them into the mist he endangered a waiting quarry network up near the border alerting the communist chinese and destroying all chance of ever running that particular mission nichiren wunderman said his knuckled fists hard against the wood tabletop he got a lead on nichiren the first iota of positive information weve come up with in sixteen months he acted on that information there was no time to notify you to put it through proper channels for us to be implicated in the death of an inspector of police for chrissakes is unthinkable beridien made no effort to calm himself tell me one thing did he clear it with you i mean wunderman youre his goddamned superior arent you you run the bastard just like you run all our agents that is in the job description of the head of wet section if memory serves or is jake maroc running you as has been my suspicion ever since the sumchun river incident wundermans eyes flickered involuntarily toward donovan and beridien picking it up said hes not going to help you this time henry your personal loyalties have gotten in the way of the orderly running of this organization once too often for my taste i ought to if we have serious business to discuss we should get to it now donovan said with enough intensity that beridien gave a quick birdlike flick of his head the quarry comes first in all things wunderman said angry at feeling so defensive he was obliged to state the obvious it always has ever since you created us beridien took a deep breath and his voice softened no one is accusing you of disloyalty henry good god you are my mailed fist against the chaos out there in the world but you are like the rest of us only human we all have frailties we all blunder every so often or lose our way in this gigantic labyrinth in which weve chosen to make our home its quite understandable i was only pointing that out dismissing the subject he turned his head in the same quick jerky fashion that had helped earn him the longtime sobriquet the owl and said to donovan any glimmer of what maroc found on nichiren and how donovan shook his handsome head not a thing ive been personally monitoring the soviets new polar cipher route over the past seven months he glanced at a page midway through his sheaf of printouts nothing came over our normal international routes of that im certain whatever maroc filched he did it solely on his own he shrugged his shoulders anything wed got wouldve been passed immediately on to you nichiren has been code red around here for more than three years beridien inclined his enormous head the rosecolored overheads threw his eyes into deep shadow making him seem even more birdlike its clear then that maroc received some volatile information on nichiren he did so outside this agencys aegis withouthere his head swung in wundermans direction againthis agencys knowledge support or sanction he had a good shot it appears donovan said at terminating nichiren which has been this departments disposition for him ever since he surfaced a little more than five years ago as the numberone independent assassinforhire well get to the consequences of marocs failure in a moment beridien said at this juncture however the operatives success or failure is irrelevant im afraid henry that marocs effectiveness in this agency has been permanently compromised sir beridien raised a pale hand henry please were all professionals here this is what i was speaking of before maroc was under discipline we have nothing herenothing at allunless we maintain discipline the quarry was formed fifteen years ago with the full consent of the then president of the united states to fight what we perceived as a growing international chaos fomented in part by foreign governments all of which were and still are hostile to ours im not i know telling you anything you dont already know since you signed on with me from the beginning but perhaps you dont know that each president upon his inauguration has a period of ninety days in which to reevaluate the quarry in order to decide on its disposition not one im gratified to say has ever contemplated dismantling us all of thats for a very good reason were the best and were rigidly controlled so ironclad is our discipline that what happened in the cia more than once could never occur here we have never had to clean house and we never will this crash meeting at state was difficult for the president to field unlike the cia which now belongs to the country we are the presidents stepchild therefore our blunders reflect directly on him he takes any mistakes quite personally let me say that right now the quarry is not very high up on his list of favorite government organizations those eyes bored into wundermans skull as for state they were as usual in a panic over a series of particularly heated exchanges with the tokyo chief of police yasuhiro tanaba it seems his man higira was an innocentbystander fatality in marocs abortive raid as was the businessman kisan i was not happy to be the cause of the presidents difficulties today his cause cйlиbre has been these reciprocal importexport agreements with japan in any case maroc broke discipline and discipline is what makes us strong it is also henry what allows us to survive through changing administrations the moment jake maroc set foot on japanese soil he cut himself off from us hes totally on his own now thats final wunderman said nothing but his eyes dropped to his fingers interlaced before him on the table why he asked himself did he feel like a schoolboy called out in front of the class by the principal he felt a momentary lick of rage at beridiens cruel and so it seemed to him unfeeling summary judgment where was consideration for all that jake had done for the quarry over the years wunderman knew that he should speak up now that the heroic thing to do would be to make an impassioned speech in jakes defense on just that subject but he remained silent why was it because he felt instinctively that donovan was right that somehow in some inexplicable fashion the sumchun river incident had marked jake forever that the trauma he had suffered there had impaired his effectiveness as an agent the fact was that jake had broken discipline wunderman had had no idea what jake had planned until the aftermath of the failed raid had been relayed into quarry hq damn him he thought now if only hed let me know i could have provided some backup id be in some kind of tenable position to help him now what really had happened at the sumchun river wunderman asked himself was it the trauma of seeing four of his men die and a fifth become a paraplegic that had turned jake hard and inwarddirected wunderman recalled the debriefing it had been an effort to get jake to talk in full sentences let alone to get the entire story of what had happened and in the end wunderman thought now i suspect he gave me only pieces of the story now to nichiren beridien said and wunderman knew that his moment to defend jake had passed henry do we have any leads as to what happened to him after the explosion no even as he spoke he wondered what would happen to jake without the quarry wunderman knew that he himself would be like a rudderless boat without this organization wouldnt it be the same for jake when the od at ciphers relayed the signal i ordered an emergency team in from hong kong which is our nearest station one of the dantai had managed to drag maroc out of there before dying they took maroc back with them to kowloon there was nothing else to do five men beridien shook his head how galling to have to add them to this long list my god nichirens a oneman abattoir ive got to hand it to him though stallings said maroc sure had the right idea about how to take out nichiren what do you mean beridien asked huo yan the entire maneuver was like a potent wei qi move just like jake wei qi beridien said whats wei qi a chinese game of military strategy stallings was pleased to at last be in his element the japanese call it go beridien snorted a game translated into real life oh come on stallings ignored his tone unlike western games wei qi has a strong philosophical side a players wei qi strategy is a translation of his view of life and what is jake marocs view of life stallings beridien wanted to know according to this game the raid was like huo yan a move known as the movable eye an eye is created when a players pieces surround an intersection on the board by leaving a space in the center he creates a defensive formation which he then repeats across the board no enemy piece can be placed within the eye surrounded it will die butstallings raised a long forefingeran eye can also be used for offensive purposes when it is it is called huo yan that was the essence of jakes raid yet it failed beridien pointed out stallings nodded obviously jake was outplayed he shrugged again pity wundermans coarsefeatured face was set in a frown weve got a somewhat more immediate problem he said when he was certain he had their attention he turned his gaze on beridien and said jake marocs wife mariana is missing from out of the hollow silence beridiens baritone rose what the fuck are you telling us missing goddammit what do you mean shes missing i think youd better tell us all of it henry donovan said in his calm unhurried voice wunderman squared his shoulders and did as he was bade mariana maroc was at home in hong kong on the night of the chaos raid using donovans brainchild the random intervention surveillance sweep which we now keep on every active field operatives home base the janitors picked up a phone call to marocs apartment at local time local or long distance beridien wanted to know long distance as you know the riss is meant as a trace not as a recording device therefore we can pinpoint the origin of the call but not who made it or what was said by either party go on beridien said the call emanated from japan tokyo to be more specific maroc beridien meant did jake make the call its the most logical explanation of course wunderman said but it doesnt hold according to the eta weve been able to piece together on the dantai jake wouldve been en route at in the air he would not have been able to reach her or anyone else by phone all we know is that within fifteen minutes of that call mariana maroc was gone gone where donovan asked weve been able to trace her as far as tokyo she or maroc have any known friends there beridien asked jake did but strictly on the business side wunderman answered as far as we know mariana knew no one there how far is that beridien barked far enough it was very quiet in the windowless room beridiens dark eyes bored into wundermans from across the table do you have more specifics on the calls origin henry the janitors are working on that now as rodger knows there are still a couple of bugs in the system they tell me however that we have a shot at narrowing it down to at least a district and possibly even the actual number there was a peculiar scent in the room as if somewhere out of their sight a fire had been lit mrs marocs disappearance may mean nothing donovan said i understand they were having some er difficulties lately missing is missing stallings said that kind of things always serious the more so under these circumstances beridien said shrewdly meaning what wunderman said meaning that i dont trust coincidences maybe the twomarocs chaos raid and his wifes disappearanceare connected i dont see that wunderman said and knew it was a mistake the minute the words were out of his mouth beridiens primeval head swung around oh thiswhat did you call it gerrymovable eye of marocs it should have worked it didnt maybe its because maroc isnt the operative he once was maybe sumchun river has undermined his effectiveness or maybe just maybe nichiren had some kind of inside information about the raid if so there could be only one source no one within the quarry knew about it only maroc and his dantai his flaming tigers are you suggesting that mariana maroc could have told nichiren wunderman was incredulous antony beridiens eyes seemed to pierce through him pinning him to the wall it was deliberate beridien did not like wunderman possessing salient facts that he himself did not i am suggesting nothing henry merely positing a train of thought because of marocs dangerously precipitous actions we are now under pressure the kind of pressure that can be if it is not eliminated immediately the most debilitating kind for us perhaps random chance has forced us into this position if so we will accept it and go on from there but the possibility exists that what we are facing here is an iceberg an inimical design of foreign manufacture that would put us under attack if that is the case i put you all on notice that i mean to get to the bottom of this iceberg in the most expeditious manner and gentlemen god help the man who gets in my way all gods defecate on this weather david oh said in cantonese outside rain filled the hong kong streets to overflowing his mood turned blacker he slammed the heel of his hand against the windowsill praying to buddha that jake wasnt going to do something stupid like not wake up all the tests had been made and analyzed physically jake had come away from the debacle at ohenro house with nothing more than multiple abrasions and contusions the intervention of mandy chois body between him and the blast had assured that except there was concussion to think about eeg readings found jakes brain patterns undisturbed yet he had not regained consciousness a matter of time the doctors had said shaking their heads gray rain as dark as david ohs mood streaked the windowpanes turning dust to grime on the fourth floor he had stood for a time with his back against the closed door as if wary of coming into the room itself shadows built a bizarre superstructure out of thin air he heard the sound of breathing and was not certain whether it was his or jakes he did not want to move did not want to approach any closer as if by this denial he could also deny what he knew he must eventually see david oh wondered what jakes breaking discipline would mean for hong kong station nothing good he was certain he found himself afraid of that before jake maroc had joined the quarry hong kong station had been nothing but a bunch of illtrained errand boys scurrying about the colony like so many ants without his force it could so easily revert fornicate unnaturally those in washington who control our future without taking any risks themselves he thought im sure theyre bleeding inside for jake mandy choi and the others at the bedside he stared down there was nothing much there to which he could relate if this is what it leads to why do any of us do this he asked himself but he already knew the answer the risk was secondary to the objectives they were dedicated to accomplishing dedication david oh knew well had many origins but it was the one element that bound all of them in the quarry together jake the whisper was out before he knew it it hung in the air mingling with all the other shadows spun in the room hovering peaked and angular there was movement from the shadows and david started he peered into the gloom he heard only the steady drumming of the rain then he recognized the figure formidable sung he said sharply what are you doing here jake maroc is a friend the other man said moving silently into the light i am showing my concern as i would toward any friend david oh snorted derisively oh i get it your concern about whether you will get this months payment more likely the two men had a natural antipathy david oh was shanghainese sung was cantonese the two did not mix well formidable sungs heavy moon face was as blank as a garden gate the protection we provide for you and all the members of the quarry here at your residences demands remuneration that cannot be so difficult to understand not at all david said but let us not confuse business with friendship your money will be disbursed in the same manner as always that is not why i came if i had required such information i would have contacted you at your office as i said it was jake marocs condition that brought me david oh had nothing more to say so he turned away why did the cantonese have to be here now at this moment it had been jakes idea to put his contacts to good use when he had been assigned here making his deal with formidable sung had been one of them and it had proved an excellent one davids relatives were rivals of formidable sung david hated him for that or perhaps it was only the primitive railing of shanghainese against cantonese have you seen enough i have been here awhile if that is your meaning good day formidable sung went out without a sound dew neh loh moh to have uttered that one word jake with that son of a sea slime in the room david rocked in shame to have such a one be privy to my inner feelings someday he will find a way to use that against me oh gods curse my joss he made himself look down at jakes sleeping face swathed in bandages dark bruises like thunderclouds say something to me jake anything david oh sat down heavily in a chair by the bed all gods great and small piss on all doctors he put down the paper cup he had been holding the tea was cold and tasted as bitter as bile what the hell do they really know anyway they tell us nothing preferring to make us wait that is what we pay them for heya he told himself that it was all joss whether jake woke or slept but thai wasnt good enough davids mother was catholic and he had caught a whiff of the western religion he was like a man trapped on a spit of land between the ocean and a great lake on the surface they appeared to be the same but beneath they were so very different buddhists found contentment in living in changing as the seasons changed in accepting all that life had to offer or take away catholics strove against the natural order believing that man should be above such base instincts that he should impose his own particular order on the anarchy that already existed if jake slept on david oh knew that he would take it hard how many times had they saved each others lives in the ten years or so since jake had been assigned to hong kong station stupid to even try a count they had shared death and so they shared life with a bond closer than that of brothers brothers after all had only blood between them jake and david in a way shared minds now he found himself angry at jake for the singlemindedness of purpose that had made him risk all of it for a chance to bring in nichiren like some great trophy from out of darkest africa what did a bastard like nichiren count for against someone like jake david oh sighed he found hospital rooms odd the atmosphere so humid it seemed to dampen all coherent thought always they seemed awash with violent emotion it was as if instead of the etching of a former queens clippers in victoria harbor and the color portrait of the present queen the walls were hung with tears and wailing sorrow and resignation dominated here as they did in the slums nearby david david oh stood jerkily the shadows had spoken his name he looked down at jake marocs bandaged face and saw those feline eyes a disturbing bronzetinged topaz staring up at him dew neh loh moh jake he sat down beside his friend youve been out a long time id better fetch the doctors theyll want to wait i dont feel that bad marocs words were crusty and brittle as if he had lost the easy facility of speech the tongue came out questing along the ridge of dry lip david oh reached over and poured some water from a carafe gently he placed the cup against marocs mouth allowing him to drink his fill nichiren the name seemed to be pulled from the very depths of him gone to ground im afraid jake maroc closed his eyes tightly how long four days now should have had him there was nothing but anger in jakes voice i wouldve bet anything that this time he was down for the count those yellow topaz eyes opened fixing david oh with their gaze not even what he had been through could dispel their fiery power i want him david david oh nodded well get him bullshit the force of emotion cost him and he was silent for a time regathering his strength its not wet section im thinking about its me david oh did not want to state the obvious hes disappeared jake we have no line on him at all jakes eyelids fluttered david oh felt as if his friend was struggling to remain conscious how badly were the others hurt hows mandy david oh put his hands together to stop them from sweating youre the only one who made it oh god jakes eyes closed again david oh did not want to see the tears but he had no choice a searing pain tore through jakes chest and he cried out so loudly that david oh took hold of him as if contact with another human being would be enough now to ease his suffering oh dear god in heaven what have i done jake thought as swiftly as the attack had come it receded in its wake he felt a spiritlessness as if the very core of him which had just moments before been filled with life had now dissolved into bitter emptiness in the west descartes had perhaps given modern man his watchword phrase i think therefore i am but as with all things in the east it was different we think therefore i am it was possible that no true western man could fully comprehend that jake could his unit with whom he had lived and whom he had trained for more than a year had taken on just that kind of collective presence it was dantai and it was their collective death that he had just experienced inside himself they had been a selfsufficient entity as was right and natural a familial bond had sprung up between them so that no matter what alien environment they were dropped into they never really left the family circle this was what gave them their almost legendary strength it was what allowed them to do what no other unit in the quarry was able to do survive intact for a long time without respite from hazardous duty once when pressed to explicate further the dantais uncanny success rate jake had said to rodger donovan remember that the most famous of japanese dramas chushingura is not about one hero but rather fortyseven but then westerners were always asking direct questions and expecting in return direct answers they were consequently at a loss when it came to interpreting oblique replies they were all so young it was like war david oh thought thats what you said about the boys on the line time to plow on staff thinks there must have been a leak youre too good the dantai was our best unit marocs eyes were redrimmed accentuating the bluishblack bruises on his cheeks betrayed but by whom no one in the dantai would have said a word theres always the possibility your intelligence was tainted jake shook his head the source is unimpeachable then i fear we must look elsewhere david ohs voice had taken on a floating quality he had no liking for what he had to do now he saw the sweat beading on his friends face and suspected that his pulse rate was raised he recognized that he did not have much time at least theres no amnesia he said jake was thinking of nichirens face had there been any surprise there had he been lying in wait for them but there were others in the room with him two had died one of them kisan was purported to be nichirens only friend none of that sounded as if he had been forewarned you werent there david i was i dont believe there was a leak he struggled to sit up david oh put a hand on his chest pushing him back down he wished he could say calm down but considering what he was about to tell him that would be foolish rain drummed against the small windowpanes gusts like angry fists was mariana scheduled to go on any trips while you were gone he forced his voice to remain even knowing jake would pick up any untoward nuance and pounce on it none that i know of he said if this debriefings over would you send her in im sure shes anxious to see me up and making sense marianas not here jake david oh was studying the other man she was observed at kai tak just after your mission began she boarded a jal flight bound for tokyo in the flushed silence he forced himself to continue as you know we have no one in japan so thats all we know i checked your apartment for a note an explanation something there was nothing nothing at all what jakes face was white whats happened to her he peered into david ohs face saw something there for gods sake tell me the consensus of opinion from staff seems to be that word of your raid was somehow transmitted to nichiren prior to your arrival at henro house altogether we have ten people dead that isnt easily explained david jake said shaking for the love of god what is all this mariana got a call on the evening of your raid we know that it came from tokyo just this morning the janitors narrowed the origination field down to the district toshimaku and jake immediately thought ohenro house is in toshimaku david oh went on within forty minutes of taking that call mariana was at kai tak airport twenty minutes after that she boarded a jal flight to tokyo where did she go david oh shrugged you know thats not our field of influence he said pointedly its not possible jake whispered mariana knows no one in japan no one at all what would she be doing there staff thought maybe you could tell them well i cant dammit david oh leaned forward he felt his personal anger at jake overflowing do you have any idea what a mess your raid has made it has jeopardized the presidents entire reciprocal trade plan fuck the president jake said nichirens more important than any it has jeopardized the entire quarry david oh let that sink in a moment before he continued what are we to make of marianas disappearance is it a coincidence that of all the destinations in the world she should choose the one to which under a cloak of absolute secrecy you were headed you tell me he looked at jake beridien suspects that were looking at some kind of iceberg here is that your opinion too i dont know amida david what i did i did on my own like a single drop of ink on a blank page thats all there is to it beridiens swiping at paper tigers maybe so but you know how he is if you dont know why mariana took off we sure dont he wont rest until he knows it all neither will i rain continued to drum against the windowpanes david walked away from the high bed stared out and down at the raindarkened concrete buddha but its foul out there a woman got out of a red nissan and ran through the downpour toward the overhang of the hospitals entrance david admired her legs the sheen of her hair he liked the way she ran with strength and agility a powerful sense of purpose he turned back into the room jake how bad were things between you and mariana i dont want to talk about it i apologize for intruding but the answer may be vital jake closed his eyes for a moment not bad not good either im afraid beridien wont be satisfied with that he looked hard at david oh we hadnt made love in six months is that intimate enough for you what happened i dont know we drifted apart we changed who knows its all garbage anyway it wasnt all garbage when you got married we were different then jake was looking at nothing well youre different anyway jakes eyes focused on david oh what does that mean david oh came away from the window youre not the same person i used to know jake ever since you came back from the massacre at sumchun river youve been moving through life like an automaton you only think of one thingnichiren i dont see anything wrong with that the mans a machine for murder he embraces death as if it were his lover he must be stopped and he will be but perhaps you cannot do it alone jakes eyes were so fierce that david oh found himself unable to stare into them for long i can and will dont think anyone or anything will stop me i understand not even mariana what jake nichirens all you seem to care about you have no time for her you have no time for me or anyone else nichiren has crowded all of us out of your life we used to have fun on our time off now all you want to talk about is your next plan to trap nichiren i cant remember the last time you smiled with him out there theres nothing to smile about david oh pointed a finger at him thats where youre wrong pal you say that nichiren embraces death as if it were his lover i see you doing precisely the same thing you havent been living these past three years since sumchun youve been dying there was a soft knock on the door both men turned as it opened david was surprised to see the security guard usher in the woman he had seen running through the parking lot through the sliver of the opening he could see only her eyes part of her small nose the center of her lips she was quite beautiful enough to take his breath away is jake maroc here he nodded mutely then turned to jake he felt her presence acutely even through the barrier of the wooden door think about what i said heya it could be important he went out past the woman in a moment she had come fully into the room she stood with her back against the door stiff almost as if she were afraid to move further jake had been struggling to stay awake he was terribly exhausted consciousness was a gauzy layer of veils that seemed to float through his blurred mind with the inconstancy of a dream he sensed a presence in the room and said whos there a blackness full of sleep yawned like a chasm before him his body ached all over and he wanted to escape from it sleep seemed like a fine idea the presence intruded upon him edging back the slumber with rude hands whos there he said again more softly this time dont you recognize me the woman came away from the door to stand by his bed oh jake she said she put a hand out and touched his cheek between the bandages his hand came up and grasped her arm feeling along the skin his eyes struggled to focus who its bliss she said we used to play with the snakes on ladder street his eyes opened wide in astonishment he felt the quickening of his pulse he tried to rise toward her but could not bliss how is it possible that was in the winter she went on in the summer wed steal dried skate from the stores in the western district and eat pork chops and rice out of cardboard boxes along the docks at central all year long a deathly slumber was fast overtaking him but he refused to close his eyes its been so long but i remember he drank her in comparing reality with his memories how many times had he wondered what bliss would look like full grown now he knew he seemed to sigh then you were so littlejust a girl once upon a time he held on to her arm stroking her as if he were a blind man bliss he whispered what are you doing here after all this time it seems impossible impossible rest now she said softly there will be time enough when you wake washington like all the great capitals of the world ran on power the people who worked there were drawn to the city as if it were the epicenter of an incipient earthquake the mere mortals of the worldthe working stiffs who labored from nine to five and went home to eat their meat and potatoes in front of their tvs and their squalling kids before lumbering off to bed to lie sweatily atop their wives in comic imitation of intimacycould discern nothing of the invisible emanations that attracted the power elite to washington power means different things in different places in new york americas financial capital it means arriving at a broadway opening in a new volvo stretch limo in hollywood americas entertainment capital it means playing tennis with sylvester stallone in washingtonwhere for those who know the real power liesit is defined in increments of perks for the director of the quarry the perks were many and dazzling for antony beridien by far the best was this sprawling nineteenthcentury mansion in great falls virginia set into the lowlands of a small but spacious valley between rolling emerald hills it was just under an hour from quarry hq in northwest washington it had once been an oss then a cia safe house it was said that eisenhower and dulles as well as wild bill donovan had used its cool sanctuary during world war ii but of course that was solely rumor that antony beridien chose to believe it implicitly was perhaps a measure of his love for it newly repainted precisely the same shade of offwhite as it had first been painted the house was filled with arching gables rounded turrets and along one side an enormous screenedin porch with a floor of pine planking painted battleship gray it was filled with oversized white wicker furniture with cushions and pillows of a deep maroon background on which were printed dark green and offwhite leaves in a kind of jungle pattern inside the gigantic rooms were filled with antiques that beridien had painstakingly collected from around the world a professional decorator might have winced at the confluence of pristine federalperiod chairs and desk with a massively ornate louis xiv ormolu clock on the spotted marble mantel and a magnificent chippendale breakfront beside it but beridien couldnt have cared less here within this house he could feel time in all its grandeur moving slowly from room to room he could trace the monumental procession of the ages of western man from renaissance forward here far from the necessarily ultramodern blankness of the quarry he could stretch his mind on the wings of mans great artistic accomplishments and think through knotty problems he could never seem to unravel at the office beridien unashamedly reveled in this particular perk though quarry funds had bought the house though they maintained it though they allowed him to nurture it and its magnificent grounds filled with carefully pruned rose and tulip gardens and meticulously shorn formal topiaries he nevertheless thought of this house as his own it was he who had provided it with its current name greystoke since in his spare time beridien was an avid reader of the many short novels of edgar rice burroughs it was because of beridien that the president came here the secretary of defense a majority of the members of the joint chiefs power flowed through these old rooms like hot blood antony beridiens power he was entitled to call greystoke his own this sundrenched afternoon he and henry wunderman were lunching on light farecold poached salmon with a lemony dill mayonnaise a bright salad of endive and radicchio that was beridiens favorite and not coincidentally a specialty of greystokes chef because of the heatberidien allowed no airconditioning in the house he had decided to dine on the spacious porch birds sang in the topiary and the nearby woods great hovering bumblebees droned somnolently in the rose garden beridien himself poured more perrier for them both there was no alcohol not even wine served during working hours im glad you came henry beridien said after a time he had pushed his plate away from him clearing his palate with the perrier wunderman had finished before him a houseboy came and took the dishes away nothing more was said until he reappeared with small metal dishes of pear sorbet rimed with ice after my outburst at the meeting last week thats all in the past antony wunderman said just as if he had had an actual choice in the matter its forgotten good good beridien had lighted into his dessert so it was unclear whether he was responding to wunderman or commenting on the sorbet he ate mechanically but his face was filled with pleasure in time he sighed scraping the metal dish with his empty spoon he poured himself coffee from an insulated picnic carafe wunderman had not touched his dessert friendship has its place in the natural order of things of course beridien was staring past wunderman his eyes fixed on the furry body of a bumblebee at work rubbing rose pollen all over its legs however it often slips my mind so i know it must slip yours from time to time that we do not live amongst the natural order of things you and i henry are in the business of imposing our own brand of order on the anarchy of the world thats a heavy responsibility it takes all of our brainpower to keep it going to make the shining web of our choosing work despitehe shruggedoh inclement weather inhospitable terrain the efforts of pests inimical to its creation i think you understand my meaning henry yes sir i do we are different from most people in the world beridien went on and thats by our own choosing were misfits maybe surely wed never be content with the humdrum for my own self i know that saddled with that kind of life id blow my brains out no no what we like to dowhat we craveis dancing in the dark its that edge of not knowing whats just around the bend that gets us were extrapolators henry seers we look into the future and divine the strategic trends of the future by putting our hands in goat entrails wunderman said like the romans beridien laughed and his eyes came back to his immediate surroundings very good indeed henry yes i suppose theres a parallel there somewhere he shifted in his chair but the quarry was created by me out of divination pure and simple trends trends were what formed us like a shell created out of a constant current he brought out a redbound file opened it his finger stabbed out do you realize what weve done with israel each year we give them onepointseven billion dollars in military aid even though the country devotes fully half of its annual budget to military spending then we give them a further eight hundred fifty million in economic aid wunderman was perplexed we both know that israels our only stable ally in the middle east if we dont prop them up who will i cant believe youve swung a hundred eighty degrees and are now advocating cutting aid to them no no not at all beridien seemed annoyed as if he were a professor whose star pupil had turned into a moron before his eyes its not giving them the aid that disturbs me but what that aid is doing to them his finger stabbed down at the file once more despite our help there is a critical economic crisis in israel inflation is running at over two hundred percent per year think of that man besides which the pounds value is continually deteriorating something drastic will have to be done there soon to stabilize the country he glanced down at the sheets of paper now consider this the industrial nation with the highest and most solid growth rate over the past two decades has been japan what does that tell you wunderman decided that given beridiens current mood hed be better off showing his ignorance than giving a wrong answer what are you getting at antony just this beridien said israel with billions in military spending each year is on the brink of economic collapse japans economy on the other hand is going great guns he hunched forward his elbows on the parquet tabletop why could it be solely good management how could it the israelis as we well know are far from stupid in fact wed do well in some areas to learn from them then what the politics of destruction he said answering his own question the current from which the quarry was formed the divination i made way back in the dark ages about the nature of the world in the future and that future henry is today beridien slammed shut the red folder placed his open hand on it its all in this dossier what it shows is that there is an inverse correlation to military spending and healthy economic growth japans military spending is almost nil compared to that of israels one of lenins most oftquoted phrases is imperialism is the final phase of capitalism beridien smiled what would be a better definition of imperialism than arms sales hmm yet the communists engage in it often quite heavily theres a report here from last years soviet summit on economy in novosibirsk the consensus among those gathered was that rising military expenditures were a strong deterrent to their countrys growth last year north korea supplied eight hundred eighty million dollars in arms to iraq even though it is allied with iran iraqs enemy this year the figure will increase half again thirtyone third world countries increased by one hundred percent or more their military spending from to of course almost everyone will recognize egypt iran syria and iraq among them but perhaps you and i are the only ones not surprised by the inclusion of honduras nigeria zambia zimbabwe and kuwait today the militarys the fastestgrowing component of world trade wunderman cleared his throat and thats mostly our doing beridiens eyes were sparkling oh yes you and i know that whether his motivations are ideological religious or merely political a countrys leader will surely feel safer with a bigger betterequipped army than those of his enemies but we know that military spending is not just destructive to economic growth but also to political stability wunderman listened to all this with one ear part of his mind was considering what beridien had said about friendship about how those inside the quarry were somehow different had chosen this life because of that difference the humdrum but if wunderman was honest with himself he knew that he had not joined the quarry to escape a ninetofive prison he had joined to prove to himselfand to his wifethat he could be accepted into a club filled with ivy league mbas with mensacaliber brains wunderman had graduated from a state university his marks had been middling and when his professors were interviewed while he was being recruited by the quarry they had said he was an uninspired student at best some had needed quite a bit of prodding to remember him several could not recall him at all the quarry recruiters liked that seeing in this vagueness the glimmering of a talent the fact was no one remembered wunderman he had that quality of being able to slip through crowds unnoticed his wife marjorie noticed him however she had been homecoming queen at one of the seven sisters colleges she was beautiful and smart enough to finish right behind the valedictorian of her graduating class she and wunderman had met at a mixer that he and several friends crashed he had looked so out of place that she gravitated to him at once wunderman never had understood what she saw in him but then he could never quite grasp the way women saw the world he could not possibly have understood that by her sophomore year marjorie had had her fill of intellectually snobbish young men groomed in style outfitted in paul stuart clothing racing through the fallen leaves of the campus grounds in their jaguars and triumph spitfires they had spoken of clubs and polo and horseback riding as if these were the worlds primary concerns she had seen a sweetness in wunderman that others mistook for shyness and taking the time to speak with him she found him bright curious and flexible three qualities she had felt certain she would never find in a man by the second date she knew that she wanted to see no one else by their fourth she was certain that she was in love by then wunderman had needed little persuading to get married marjorie had stunned him from the first moment he saw her coming toward him across the gym floor her attraction to him seemed to him more miraculous than his winning the irish sweepstakes in this he was utterly serious his insecurity about her love had led him into a recurring nightmare in which he woke up one morning to find out that indeed he was married to marjorie but he himself was someone who wore harris tweeds played golf without a handicap and spoke with a bostonian accent the dream always ended with wunderman staring at himself in the mirror and seeing a face tanned by the sun and wind healthy and impossibly handsome he would put his hands up to his cheeks and they would melt like putty remolding themselves into wundermans true face seeing this wunderman in his dream felt engulfed by panic that marjorie would wake up and seeing him know what a terrible mistake she had made their house in rural virginia not so very far from greystoke had during their first years together seemed lifeless by then he had told marjorie enough of what he had gotten into so that she had said more than once that the place seemed to her inhabited by shadows for many years he had refused her the one thing that really mattered to her having children the uncertainty of his life made him adamant he had lost his fathera seaman when he was only seven he did not want the same fate to befall his unborn children it had taken marjories threat to leave for him to see the importance to her of having a baby at last he had relented terrified that his one nightmare would come true now later in life than any of their friends they had two teenaged children a boy and a girl not a day went by that wunderman did not find himself fearful for them but he recognized this feeling as something he felt for marjorie as well she had been right all along if he wanted this life the fear was something with which he would have to live political instability beridien was saying now is our bread and butter henry that was how i perceived it twentyfive years ago kennedy agreed with me his name is on our charter and im damned proud of that the revisionism thats gone on lately about him and his presidency is in my opinion disgusting he was a president with guts which was why he saw a need for us apart distinct totally separate from the cia weve used the agency as our whipping boy on more than one occasion i can tell you we like to let the world see what idiots they are from time to time that kind of thing relaxes people makes them feel superior beridien chuckled thats just how we like them he gestured then came the scandal i imagine even you dont know that i engineered that some members of the press were getting too close to finding out about us the president and i figured a smoke screen was our best defense he shrugged anyway the resultant housecleaning at the cia did them some good got rid of their most flagrant dead wood he cleared his throat speaking of dead wood henry im thinking of sending stallings into japan after mariana maroc i dont understand wunderman said stallings excels at two things planning and killing yes thats quite true beridien tapped his steepled fingertips together as if contemplating this fact for the first time this isnt a snap decision i assure you he drew out a folded flimsy from his jacket pocket handed it across wunderman took it unfolding it slowly he felt as if a ball of ice had suddenly congealed in his stomach the end phase of the janitors report on the riss phone call beridien said his voice held that peculiar note of detached calm that judges used to possess when the country as a whole condoned execution wunderman looked up the call she got came from ohenro house where nichiren was waiting for jake maroc yes beridien took possession of the flimsy im sorry henry but you must remember what i said before about friendship it is a luxury for people such as ourselves and oftentimes it is a dangerous luxury i fear that this is just such a time mariana marocs connection with nichiren must be explored we must get to the root of it immediately and most importantly we must destroy it he paused for a moment dont you agree henry wunderman felt numb he remembered the times he would go to hong kong staying at jakes mariana would take care of him as if he were a favorite uncle she had taught him all about the crown colony taking him out on tours of each section explaining the history the mixes of dialects religions outlooks she had shown him the power of the governor the triads the royal hong kong jockey club through her he was shown the mad whirligig world of chinese gambling chinese dining chinese architecture and when he had fallen ill with the flu she had stayed up all night with him replacing compresses that his high fever quickly turned from cold to warm henry mariana maroc and nichiren the concept sounded like the ravings of a madman what sense did it make but the riss could not lie and the janitors could not make a mistake of that magnitude he had to face the truth nichiren had called mariana on the night of jakes raid it was inconceivable that anyone else at ohenro house had placed the call no one there was even aware she existed henry im waiting betrayal was a concept that wunderman lived with from day to day it was part and parcel of the shadow world he had chosen to inhabit but the sources of those betrayals never failed to confound him he was far from the sort of cool and calculating spy portrayed in fiction who expects betrayal from his best friend his girlfriend even his wife such betrayals depressed him profoundly the surprise sapping his energy like a bite from a vampire he felt the shriveling inside himself the involuntary tightening of his scrotum the male animals first primitive response to unexpected danger he felt sad and dispirited i dont want to make this kind of irrevocable move without your consent beridien said i believe its your right thumbs up or down wunderman said softly just like the romans beridien recalled wundermans earlier reference and nodded just like the romans wunderman got up from the table outside the day was clouding over all the bright colors were muted as if the flowers were hiding their faces from him so be it he said the rolling hills now a deep hunters green seemed far away from him thumbs down shi zilin stepped out of the black official car the moment it ground to a halt just inside the gates of xiangshan these fragrant hills as they were called perhaps twelve miles northwest of beijing were closed to the public in zilin loved to come here the peace helped to drive away his increasing pain behind him and to the left was the main square fronting that portion of the summer palace known as yuanmingyuan the grounds there were of course a prime tourist attraction personally zilin found them sad after they had been sacked and torched by the english and french in an attempt at restoration had petered out in through a paucity of money after that the few remaining pieces of marble sculpture sections of handglazed tile and brick disappeared all the trees carefully cultivated over the centuries were cut down for firewood the larger structures dismantled to get at the iron that held the sections together of the chinese structuresmade entirely of woodnot a trace was left some walls and remnants of a few of the european palaces remained amid the fiat rice fields where once the great intricate gardens had stretched for acres zilin had deliberately turned his back on all this and was looking rather to the fragrant hills with their purplegray slopes running side by side with yuquanshan jade fountain hill here centuries ago a massive geological upheaval had spewed a layer of hard sinian limestone onto the surface of the hill in the process the violent forces had transmogrified the limestone into marble which had been first used by the qin to build palaces temples and a park once there had been many buddhist and taoist temples along with a number of exquisite rock shrines carved into the marble hill now zilin had turned it into a military zone so that it would not be overrun by curiosity seekers as china opened its doors further to the west officers and infantry soldiers alike saluted him as he made his slow way up the hill he hated the metal brace he was forced to wear on his right leg but without it the pain would incapacitate his muscles he worked out every day in his villa just outside beijing using aquatonics as well as isometrics and exercises with weights every other day a renowned acupressurist visited him and once a week like clockwork his acupuncturist arrived to do his work none of this zilin knew was a cure for the degenerative disease he had but at his age which was now nearing eightysix that did not matter much relief of pain was his shortrange goal and this his minions provided with satisfactory regularity zilin turned his head to catch the summer breeze the rice paddies were all around him comforting him somehow easing his pain his eyes alighted on the edges of the buildings comprising qinghua university on the other side of the wide field burnished in the sun that was another reason zilin liked to come here along with nature he felt closer to the young men and women who were literally chinas future it was so difficult to make his fellow ministers see that chinas most precious natural resource was its young people to a man his colleagues mistrusted the young fearing the treacherous influence of western decadence and sought in every way to inhibit the young generation as they themselves were inhibited fifty years ago there was zilin thought sadly more than a resistance to change within his country there was an almost xenophobic fear of it resistance was one thing the rushing water could eventually wear away the obdurate rock face smoothing it to the rills and dells of its current but fear was another matter entirely it was an unreasoning response and therefore immune to the effect of normal erosion fear insinuated itself into the very fabric of things making them impervious immutable yet even this could not deter zilin if the stream in its endless flow could not erode an object in its path it must then change its path leaving that object alone to dry in the baking sun and soon without the streams protection the natural forces would crack it open destroying it utterly this was the fate zilin planned for his enemies who were both numerous and powerful perhaps together they were more powerful than he like the cycles of the ages they seemed to renew themselves becoming ever more cunning and determined to bring him down twice now within the past five years there had been a concerted effort to oust him once the idea had been to make of him the same kind of example that the gang of four had been that failed and just over a year later that same qun a group of ministers had sought to retire him quietly on the grounds of his advancing age and illness just after that second failure two of the more virulent members of the qun had met with unfortunate and fatal accidents just a month apart at least the official investigation findings had labeled them accidents perhaps the remaining members of the qun felt otherwise for since that time zilin had encountered no interference from any of them and the opening of china to at least some capitalist freemarket profit methods had begun that is until six weeks ago from one of his many sources it had been made clear to him that a rising youngin chinese terminology that means fiftytwoyearoldbureaucrat by the name of wu aiping who had within the past year been appointed as the head of the scientific and technological institute for national defense had contacted one of the members of the qun wu aiping as zilin knew well had the ear of the communist party chief and the defense minister tremendous amounts of money were being siphoned into the institute because they were all agreed a modern defense was of paramount importance for the new china that made him powerful indeed much more so than any single member of the qun who were nevertheless all highranking ministers it was wu aiping who was spearheading the fight against chinas turning away from strict marxistleninist ideology zilin was passing graveyards on either side it was as if the entire history of china were buried along this road endless families who had endured it all weather changing dynasties invasions by the manchus the japanese and the gwai loh of so many nations and still china endured it had been battered and beaten decimated by the stupidity of the manchu government and much later the warlords like chiang and the demigods like mao it occurred to zilin now that despite his best efforts to the contrary his beloved country had been regressing in almost every area since the end of world war ii and still regression threatened was there to be no end to it he asked himself the silent spirits of those buried all around him seemed to fill the air with a concerted murmuring no more they seemed to whisper in his ear there must be an end for china to survive into the twentyfirst century there were tears in zilins eyes as he came to the crossroads and took the right fork around the turning stood wofosi the temple of the sleeping buddha the place once renowned through all china for its rare trees was among the oldest in the beijing environs the temple itself was built by the tang and although it was said that a sandalwood statue of the buddha already rested in the spot in the yuan used pounds of copper to cast a new and more splendid one seven thousand workmen were involved in the task it took them two attempts and a total of ten years to accomplish what would be impossible to do today due to the prohibitive costs true to the heritage of the spot zilin had brought a very uptodate school of forestry to the long deserted annex building but as for the temple itself that was left intact for him inside he became utterly lost within the tranquility of the place there was no door thus birds and small forest animals made use of the interior birdcalls echoed from the rafters seeming to hover in melody on the bars of thick sunlight there might have been a great many places that zilin could have used for such moments of quiet contemplation but in none of the others did he feel the manifestation of the buddha with such strength of purpose what validity has communism he thought now in the presence and power of such universal law he sat with some difficulty on one of two camp chairs on either side of a stone table in which the wei qi board was set a game was already in progress zilin turned his eyes to its familiar configuration but his mind was still elsewhere wu aipings solicitation of the qun coincided to the week with zilins initiation of the final phase of his hong kong schemata that did not bode well zilin was too old to believe in coincidence at least anything on this scale though his security had been excellent the schemata had been running for many years it would therefore be foolish to assume that some hint of it no matter how small would not have leaked out zilin addressed himself once more to the wei qi board it was composed of nineteen vertical and nineteen horizontal lines the game was played with small oval stones of cool shell with a curiously silken texture that never failed to delight him as he scooped them up from within their side bowls fingering them between the pads of thumb and forefinger as he thought black and white they were arrayed much like armies in ancient times here on the board they were placed on any one of the in or intersections of lines in this complexity of territories routes liaisons strong and weak lines in which the two contending forces must strike unite within themselves extend and recover if each was to seal off sections of territory and thus gain the winning advantage over the other zilin saw a microcosm of the real world there was a stirring from the mouth of the temple and zilin looked up to see a figure in silhouette against the sunlight streaming in obliquely behind him even without any visual details zilin could imagine the slightly dumpy body almost comically wreathed in its illfitting rumpled suit come on come on zhang hua he said youre so late i almost started without you the other man hurried to the chair opposite the one on which zilin sat he wiped his wide mongolian face with a linen handkerchief then blew his nose into it he pushed his wirerimmed spectacles back up the almost nonexistent flattened bridge of his nose i must make a note to myself not to be late he said apologetically one of these days zilin laughed goodnaturedly then seeing the look on the other mans face he said look here zhang hua we are friends as well as senior minister and junior minister we have worked together on official as well as clandestine affairs forhow longtwelve years now it seems to me that lateness is your only vice so be it then all men should have one viceso long as its a minor one dont you think so i wish i had none shi zilin but my dear zhang hua that is pure foolishness i do not trust the man who professes to have no weaknesses i think what does that protestation hide no no you must understand that minor vices protect us from the major ones he reached out to place a black stone on the tian yuan the single most important of the nine xing or stars intersections that divide the battleground into territorial zones tian yuan was in the belly the middle of the board in its new position a series of consequences rippled forth from the piece heretofore hidden strategies were revealed new possibilities opened up others closed off each piece could have up to four qi or breaths to surround an enemy stone on all sides was to deprive it of all its qi this was the move zilin had just made the dead white stone stared up at the combatants youll have to take care of your casualty zhang hua a message was delivered to your office this morning the aide said as he removed his stone and scanned the board for his next move he recognized the upper right and left quadrants as veritable minefields of huo yan at first glance they appeared inviting seeming only to be innocent yan eyes but zhang hua recognized them as lethal traps the difficult huo yan were a trademark of shi zilin this friday at nine you are summoned to appear before the premier zilin grunted bad news did the summons give a reason or name anyone who might be present no even worse zilin looked up from the board his eyes locked with zhang huas my friend we must assume this summons is at the instigation of wu aiping i am afraid so zilin glanced down you havent moved zhang hua had not taken his eyes off the senior ministers face shi zilin i am frightened that man terrifies me i understand zilin said and it is good that wu aiping frightens you it means that you understand the full depth of his threat to us and all we have worked so long to create he smiled his confidence terror is a human emotion my friend you must learn to respect it rather than be afraid of it when you come to understand even such a primitive emotion as terror you can then use it he nodded yes zhang hua use even that fear paralyzes me yet zilin confided we both know the meaning of real fear it was bad enough when we had only to deal with the russian navy and air force in vladivostok and several other lesser far eastern ports these threats along with soviet forces in siberia have been a hammer over our heads since the end of world war two zilins ebon eyes were deep and lustrous reeling zhang hua into the whirlpool of power that emanated from the old man like a furnace at peak power but now comes a series of more frightening developments over the last three years the russians have begun upgrading their fiftyodd divisions seven of them armored along our northern frontier in eastern siberia where we are particularly vulnerable they have deployed just under one hundred tu bombers and one hundred fifty ss mobile missiles with nuclear warheads the bombers by the way known as backfire by the americans have a range of five thousand miles carrying nuclear weaponry either bombs or airtosurf ace missiles and that is not the worst of it the united states in its infinite wisdom built the largest airfields and naval installations in the entire southeast asian region in cam ranh bay and da nang now that they have fled vietnam the russians have taken over those bases from them soviet personnel now administer manpower and materiel overseeing the entire region for a time only reconnaissance aircraft were launched from there but recently you know we have photographed tu mediumrange bombers at the airfields naval patrols from cam ranh bay have increased from eleven thousand five hundred ship hours at sea in to twentyseven thousand just last year now the soviets can strike at us from the north and the south they have a virtual ring of military strength surrounding china we are in a noose my friend and in a worldwide view the russians also have striking power into the strait of malacca should there be more of an escalation in the mideast war it is through that strait that all the oil tankers bound for the south china sea sail under air cover from six expanded and modernized airfields in afghanistan the russians can send battleships and destroyers into the northern indian ocean they also have a potentially huge auxiliary ground force in the vietnamese army which numbers roughly one million soldiers zilin spread his hands over the battle arrayed upon the wei qi board this china noose must be our first concern zhang hua how unimportant a presence is wu aiping compared with that mailed fist so brilliantly designed and executed by general anatoly karpov i wish i had your confidence minister no zilin thought i do not believe that you would want this crushing pressure my friend but then he knew that everyone wanted to sit wherever he was not that too was human nature in truth zilin wondered whether he had as much confidence as the younger man was giving him credit for certainly he had fended off attacks against himself before he was the last scarred warrior from the old days true he had had some close scrapes had run up against any number of cunning opponents but wu aiping was somehow different from the rest perhaps it was because he was from another generation the thought that men such as wu aiping might form the generation of chinas future caused zilin to shudder inwardly how different this man was from the legions of the countrys youths at zilins own school of forestry or even at the nearby university preparing themselves for chinas new tomorrow indeed there was good reason to fear wu aiping perhaps in all of beijing he was the only man who could undo the years of work on the hong kong schemata and given the ghost of a chance zilin knew he would do just that zhang hua had taken a white stone from the shallow dish on the side of the board on the lower left quadrant he found what he was looking for and placed his stone down on an intersection he had completed zhang an extension giving back two sources of breath to a stone of his that had been under attack on the adjacent intersection why should wu aiping bother you my friend zilin said when you move with such precision and daring because this is wet qi when my stone is deprived of its four breaths i only take it off the board i am still alive you are wrong my friend zilin said silently and that is the difference between you and me you cannot see beyond the board you do not understand the lifeapplications of this strategy that is why you are a fine player but not jian he selected a black stone and in the lower left corner of the board was about to place his piece on the intersection he did not look up and his keen ears heard no sound but his sixth sense picked up zhang huas increased tension by playing this stone here zilin would have struck lightly this pu would prevent six white stones from uniting but after due consideration he decided to play his stone elsewhere on the board zhang hua took no time for his next move playing his white stone on the intersection to prevent his opponent from returning there he breathed an inaudible sigh of relief but general karpov is not all we have to worry about zhang hua he said now behind and above karpov is another man in his way he is far more dangerous to us yuri lantin it is he who sees chinas destruction as a necessary first step in russias goal of world domination if we cannot neutralize yuri lantin then we are doomed but our assault on him must be delicate consumed by stealth from a quarter impossible to defend we must discover his killing ground and set him there while his mind is focused elsewhere zilin took up his black stone and struck it at the open intersection thus creating huo yan a movable eye he had taken all six of zhang huas stones he could not have accomplished that had not zhang hua played at i see the parallels zilin thought each moment of each hour of each day brings change change frightens most people but in change i see the essence of strategy like an artist putting color to canvas i observe that often movement in and of itself is enough of an attack i have learned to use everything not moving can sometimes be an attack i have just proved that yes wei qi and life are inseparable for those who can see it for those who can use it for those bold enough to steal the light as laotse wrote the jian excels at saving there is no useless person nothing is rejected jake chased shadows down a narrow twining street he heard exotic birds calling from feathered fans of darkness this became the sound of his mother beckoning him he leaned close to hear the thick phlegm blocking the back of her throat the peculiarly chilling aqueous rattle as she died around her dirtstreaked neck the talisman enclosed within its soft chamois pouch its power could not save her shadows and light played over it holding it up to the light he could almost see through it almost the sky was lavender he saw clouds in its carved face an animals cloven hoof on the obverse cool to his touch a long time ago chasing shadows down a narrow twining street littered with rubble and paper snakes watch them move turn and twist gyre upward as the wind took them chattering of treed monkeys hanging and swinging baring their yellow teeth mandarins ivory the chattering became laughter light and liquid he saw the girl outlined in a patch of pearl gray followed her down chasing her shadow to lands end the sea beckoned wavelets crashing against rotting wooden pilings the scent of salt and phosphorus fish scales innards drying in the sun gulls wheeling calling aboard the ferry he lost her in the crowd shadows milling black sunlight falling a sense of motion of shoving pushing heard her laughter and followed it down the length of the boat another shadow resistance was thinning the undertow of the crowd slackening enough so that he found he had gained some semblance of forward momentum saw her near the bow long hair flying in the wind soft lips half parted a glow in her eyes the gentle rise of her breasts the outflung length of one leg her slender ankle and the pointed toe of her shoe the innocence of her pose created the eroticism of the moment intensifying so that he felt the stirring inside himself not merely in his groin all over he was suffused with longing his penis was stiff and quivering as if it were his whole body her browned arms were bare she stood naturally but the rail pressed against the small of her back arching her rib cage her breasts her eyes were so full of promise his mind was full of mariana and as he approached he opened his mouth her name on the edge of his lips the pulse in the vulnerable hollow of her throat revealed her longing he pulled her to him his longing overwhelming it was as if he had stared at her from afar for all his life but had never possessed her her heat set him on fire her mouth opened under his lips so soft tongue hot and questing curling around his stroking he was so hard it hurt groaned into the abyss of her calling out her name at last bliss sat up in bed gasping like a fish out of water she was the first thing he saw bliss its all right jake im here he blinked as she came over to him and used a towel to wipe the dripping sweat from him she did this as though she had done it often its easier now she said as if divining his thoughts there are fewer bandages he watched her with his hooded copper eyes she was eurasian she could easily pass for pureblood chinese among the gwai loh but subtle fillips here and there about her face betrayed her ancestry to the discerning eye was it her grandfather or her grandmother who had been austrian he could not recall but seeing the hint of the steelgray motes in her ebon eyes the strong sweep of her jawline the shape of her ears he could discern the caucasian artists brushstrokes her long thick hair was drawn back from her sleek head in a wide gleaming plait her large eyes were turned up sharply at their outer comers her cheekbones were high her lips thick and sensual he started as he felt their kinship to the lips in the dream a quick pang of guilt struck him like a sharp slap to the face could i have some water do you think she turned away to pour from the carafe and he put his palm up to feel the burning of his cheek she revealed her bare neck to him and he felt the flush increase she wore a simple sleeveless silk blouse in teal green collarless with a scooped neck the flesh between her collarbones was creamy below her waist was cinched in a blue leather belt her green linen skirt looked fresh and neat drinking the water she handed him he tried to find in this stunning woman the little girl he had played with so many years ago felt the guilt again like a sharp adders bite his stomach roiled why have you come back he asked her silently why now why at all what day is this thursday she told him she cocked her head to one side giving him a judicious look you look infinitely better better than what she laughed and he saw her small white teeth everything about her made him long to draw them both back into his dream than yesterdays dim sum ive got to get out of here are you hungry id eat you if you were a step closer he said then realizing the second sexual meaning he became embarrassed the dream that is im starving then the prognosis is excellent for your getting out of here if she had picked up on the unintentional doubleentendre she gave no sign of it or was it unintentional jake asked himself freudian slip seemed a better definition i mean right away bliss leaned over rang for the nurse i think youd better get some solid food in you first jake sighed he was already restless the four white walls seemed to crowd in on him he thought of the dantai the black empty space inside him was that the loss of the dantai he felt or his estrangement from mariana was it that he no longer loved her or was david oh right was it that he was no longer capable of loving anyone what had happened to him along the blackened banks of the sumchun river it was possible that he no longer knew probable that he did not want to know it was as if he had taken a surgeons burning scalpel and cauterized his own terrible wound sealing all the emotions attendant to it away in some dark cobwebby corner of his mind mariana from the day he had returned from the sumchun river they had not touched each other emotionally they had kissed made love even on occasion exchanged kind words none of it meant a thing ashes in his mouth a taste he was never rid of well youre different anyway wasnt that what david had said wasnt that what mariana had implied when night after night she had whispered to him from the dark jake what is it what happened to you in the north whatever happened dont you think i can help you with it he had made no reply again and again how could she know that he had already taken care of it put the surgeons implement to the wound seared it down and away away jake away from mariana was that what had happened to them sumchun river or was it nichiren now she was gone and he searched inside himself for an answer found none only felt the adder coiling in his guts nipping at him where was mariana only knew he wanted to find out what had happened to her he wanted to know that as well what was waiting for her in tokyo in toshimaku ohenro house who was waiting for her there nichiren his worst nightmare come true darkness revolved around her like a top set in a windowless space she felt as if she were blind the darkness was absolute until it became a pressure against her forehead and her eyes for a time she had had trouble breathing that was when her panic was at its height when she was convinced that she had somehow been traduced she had gasped into the darkness later when she had settled down talking to herself in calm rational sentences she had begun to hear the soft hum of the air conditioner and it was a little less like being buried alive senses returning and she decided to work on the zen exercises jake had taught her when they were first married she got off the wooden chair and sinking into the lotus position on the bare floor she began by ridding herself of as much carbon dioxide as she was able increased her breathing in increments try to emulate a baby she could hear jakes voice strong and firm a baby breathes deeply fully it is only when we become adults that we forget how to breathe we breathe shallowly at the tops of our lungs only relearn the way of breath inhale as deeply as possible then exhale with your mouth open hear yourself sigh continue even after you feel you have expelled all breath go further you will not die it wasnt funny that was precisely how mariana had felt the first few times she had tried it breaking off gasping now she breathed fully and felt herself calming even further in the absence of the babble of her terror she began to think more clearly she remembered the tremendous noise the percussion against the walls of her dark world sounded like an explosion the floor had moved slightly she had been certain of that what had happened she had expected him to return to her to explain it all but there had been nothing silence darkness and finally the pressure provided by her rising terror like being buried alive he is my husbands enemy she thought why did i believe him but she knew the answer to that one it was obvious he had proved the truth of his words to her with a startling and terrifying example and in that electric moment he had turned her world upside down she no longer knew who her enemies were where was jake what were they doing to him a month ago she would have wondered if she really cared they had drifted so far apart he had built a shell around himself a loveproof box impervious to anything she had used to get through until she had come to hate it resent it she had thought she hated jake but the danger to which she had been witness showed her how much she still loved him whatever had happened to him in the north she knew that he had not changed underneath she was committed to him forever she had taken her marriage vows with full recognition of what they meant the depths of responsibilities they entailed in her youth she had imagined that she would be daunted by those responsibilities but when the day of her own marriage dawned she was certain in her heart that she welcomed them and she still did what she had been shown that dreadful night had proved to her that it was the shell he had erected that she had resented not the man behind it jake where are you she whispered into the blackness abruptly she felt a million miles away from him she reached down underneath the hem of her dress extracted the chamois pouch from inside the waistband of her panties opened the drawstring with fumbling fingers poured out the contents into her cupped palm the jade was slightly warm from her own body heat jake she said closing her hand around the object feeling closer to him now knowing how important this artifact was to him why was i told to bring it she asked herself what is its importance why do his enemies covet it so there were no answers to her questions only more questions unscrolling along the horizon of her mind when will he come for me mariana wondered when will he answer all my questions as he promised he would where is nichiren general daniella alexandrovna vorkuta was putting the last of her papers into her slim briefcase when there was a polite knock on her office door the generals office was on the fifth floor of the enormous dirty ocherfacзaded building at dzerzhinsky square built ironically in neorenaissance style home of the komitet gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti the room was less of an office than she felt she deserved it was nothing more than a tenbytwelvefoot rectangle with two windows of four panes each which overlooked the square dominated by the bronze image of felix dzerzhinsky this soviet hero a pole of aristocratic upbringing who had turned revolutionary became the first head of the soviet secret police founded in just after the bolsheviks toppled the tsar of russia today his statue served as a reminder to the masses of the true state of man the notion of the revolutionary ethos still served the kgb well though its practical applications at home had long since been interred deep in the frozen earth with not even the salute of one soldier to mark its passing general vorkutas office was much the same as those of the other highranking functionaries of this most powerful bureaucracy in the soviet union it was small dark drab furnished with several depressingly heavy wood items poorly made in rumania or czechoslovakia the ceiling was low and in need of repainting dark whorls and spots marked its surface the accumulated result of cigar and cigarette smoke emitted through endless hours of meetings interrogations and solitary strategy sessions for the past nine months she had sent a series of requisitions through channels requesting new furniture it had been promised it had never arrived still like clockwork at the beginning of each month she sent in her requisition forms daniella vorkuta ground out the last of her blacktobacco cigarette in the unlovely gunmetal ashtray that lay like a wart on the mahogany surface of her scarred desk the day was heavily overcast with low racing clouds dark with the precipitation that the morning broadcaster had predicted as if to underscore this gloominess she had left only one lamp burning a black metal floor model with double shades pale light spread across her desk but no farther the general herself was in shadow vchoditse daniella said and the door opened inward a uniformed courier stepped smartly across the room to her desk he was carrying a small leather briefcase this just arrived for you comrade general he said in clipped tones he was looking at a spot just above her head general vorkuta signed for the case she waited until the courier had departed before using a small brass key she carried on a long chain attached to her belt inside she found four stiff sheets of paper covered with what looked like an archaic hieroglyphic scrawl in fact it was a cipher that she had devised herself some years ago when she was with sluzhba aktivnykh meropriyatiyi the active measures service involved in disinformation and ciphers it had been just an exercise then now it had become much more daniellas heart beat fast it was the latest report from medea her attention narrowed she had been waiting for this her excitement level doubled now to settle down and mull over the new intelligence dark shadows poured through the opening filling up the small office good morning comrade general the words were spoken in a deep bass taking the cue daniella smiled and returned the friendly informal greeting ignoring the ice particles flurrying in her lower belly anatoly decidovitch karpov came through the door for a moment his bearlike bulk hid the figure just behind him but then the second mans superior height came into play daniella carefully put her hand over the four sheets of precious paper general karpov head of the first chief directorate walked silently across the bare worn floorboards sinking down into the hard seat of the single chair that crouched like a gargoyle directly in front of daniellas desk he was not a tall man but he was an impressive one nonetheless he had broad shoulders and a barrel chest his muscles bulged impressively even though he had just celebrated his sixtysecond birthday karpovs thick straight hair was pitch black though daniella knew it remained so because of his twiceweekly diligence with the dye bottle his powerful face was lined and pitted with age his high prominent forehead feathered by his thick eyebrows his clear brown eyes peered out from behind wirerimmed glasses penetrating and intimidating but when he smiled there was an ingenuousness about him to which daniella responded he wore a dapper dark blue suit pinned to the left lapel were the army medals he had earned on the line of which he was so proud she was pleased to note that his tie was tethered by the black onyx tack she had given him for his birthday last week her eyes shifted to the other man as karpov said you know comrade yuri vasilevitch lantin i have heard of him of course daniella said carefully lantin was a member of the politburo and the central committee one of a handful of muscovites who held positions of stratospheric power within the highly structured soviet hierarchy daniella knew her boss well knew that he had not idly made the trip in from the first chief directorates modern headquarters of glass and steel along the moscow ring road his own office on the top floor of the halfmoonshaped structure with its view of the surrounding forest was far more impressive daniella knew than her own cramped and musty office that karpov had chosen to bring lantin to dzerzhinsky square was important power was on parade here power with incalculable dimensions and it was very clear on which side of the room comrade yuri vasilevitch lantin was standing she steeled herself for what was to come patiently karpov lit a cigar with a solid gold lighter this was not an imperialist luxury daniella had been acquainted with karpov long enough to know its significance karpov and yuri andropov had been in command of the red army forces in hungary in ruthlessly fearlessly so daniella had been told the two of them had dealt with the complex and highly volatile situation to commemorate that bravery the two friends had exchanged gifts now whenever karpov flicked up the flame he kept andropovs memory alive inside himself karpov blew out a cloud of aromatic cuban tobacco smoke and peered at the end of the cigar pursing his thin lips after a moment to see it briefly glow cherry red i have brought comrade lantin here today because he has a special interest in certain matters that fall within department ss sphere of concern by that daniella knew he meant kvr interests of which she was in charge but even the initials kvr were never spoken aloud whether within these thick walls or without so karpovs rather heavyhanded circumlocution was perhaps understandable specifically nichiren lantin spoke for the first time and daniella spent some time analyzing the tones one could she had learned tell much from voice tones lantin was standing against the wall his head obscuring the center of a standardissue portrait of lenin hung there either by one of the previous tenants or more likely daniella thought by some cretin in the supply bureau his long legs were crossed at the ankles his hands clasped loosely behind his back he wore a charcoalgray suit that made karpovs appear old and out of style by comparison he might for all the world be watching a sculling contest on the banks of the thames daniella watched his face it was long slightly saturnine he might be in his middle fifties quite young for such an exalted post but it was impossible to be certain his long thick hair shone in the feeble lamplight he had a mole on one cheek that made him seem even more attractive than did his deepset eyes the cut of his jaw the almost rakish line of a superbly manicured pencil mustache only his lips thin and somehow cruel even in repose conflicted with this magnetism nichiren is run by general vorkuta karpov said careful to keep the upper hand in this threeway conversation i devised the idea of employing a known lonewolf terrorist to further our own ends in this way i felt sure we could get er extractions accomplished that otherwise might have the potential to cause us a certain degree of international embarrassment daniella shot him a sharp look as he went on nichirens a damn sight more efficient than the bulgarians and more reliable than any of our arab contacts daniella pushed the blob of an ashtray across the wooden expanse toward him we have had an astounding rate of success with him over the short term she said in her best businesslike tone in ghana chad angola in lebanon syria egypt in nicaragua guatemala in all these places and more we have run him in and have used him to extract certain revolutionary leaders exacerbating hatreds ensuring polarities fomenting further stages to the incidental revolutions that will one day combine ideological combustibility lantin broke in i believe that is the term general karpov uses in his monthly reports to the presidium it has a certain ring to it my colleagues are pleased with it he inclined his long sleek head slightly as they are with the work your singular agent has accomplished now was the time to concentrate hardest daniella knew compliments were rare within the sluzhba or the service as it was colloquially known among its constituents she also knew that if the politburo had wanted to congratulate her on her direction of nichiren karpov would somehow have managed to interpose himself between her and those above preferring to seem the angel that he had allowed lantin to come to her office was a bad sign thank you comrade she said putting on a smile i work hard for the sluzhba it is good to hear that ones accomplishments are appreciated in other more rarefied circles karpov studied the dark end of his cigar its frozen ash you know comrade general we often have a tendency to believe that there is no power outside of this building we are russia i myself have heard this phrase used often along these corridors he nodded his head and perhaps there is some truth in that he looked into her face his dark eyes locked on hers up to a point comrade he rolled the ash off his cigar he did not have to elaborate that yuri lantin represented the larger power outside the walls of the sluzhba the real might of mother russia daniella understood his implicit warning your agent lantin said was almost extracted himself in a raid last week on his own home ground this is most disturbing his forefinger probed at the lower edge of his thin mustache especially since it was via a quarry team led by jake maroc maroc maroc karpov almost sang it as if he were learning a new language his eyes studied the ceiling he pulled deeply on his cigar blew smoke upward in a lazy spiral nichiren destroyed five members of the team daniella said but not maroc lantins tone had turned hard and daniella opened her ears she wanted to know what that meant damaged but not down karpov said in a tone that managed to be an indictment considering the past track record of this man nichiren i find it unsettling that he allowed this team inimical as it was to him to get so close and on home ground daniella felt lantins eyes like a flashburn on her skin and shifted her gaze from karpov she saw something there something odd something that did not belong in this room which she filed away for study at a future date she did not want to muddy increasingly difficult waters at the moment one would have thought his sources better than that lantin went on he seemed never to blink daniella found herself wondering whether he wore contact lenses that would at least partially explain the extraordinary presence of his eyes accomplishments are one thing but most of his have been in the past i believe comrade vorkuta that it is time to subject your nichiren to a test of sorts daniella was about to protest but remembering karpovs warning she bit back her harsh words what sort of test would you suggest she said instead something definitive lantin possessed a languorous ness she found impossible not to admire a possibility presents itself that is as timesaving as it is elegant and what might that be daniella said matching his tone lantin came away from the wall he seemed to fill up the room with the aura of his persona no one could fail to listen to his words this is what you will do comrade he said softly send agents into his vicinity have them stay close to him observe him on audio and videotape if you deem it necessary i want to know conclusively that he still has the killing instinct then you will give the order have nichiren extract jake maroc general karpovs cigar had gone out he placed it in the ashtray on daniellas desk three oaths tsun stared out across the harbor at aberdeen leaning against the railing of his great high junk he watched the swells of brackish water the low black sky hanging like a shroud over the south china sea the aftermath of the allday squall he was undisturbed by the weather in his left hand he gripped a slip of fine rice paper that had been carefully folded four times despite that obvious care its outside was stained here and there a terracotta brown bespeaking its long journey from creator to recipient on the paper were five vertical lines of calligraphy that might have been hakka but were not just like me three oaths tsun thought unconsciously his huge fist contracted crushing the thin paper within its grip his heart beat fast in his chest and his blood sang in his veins dragons heart that was what they had called it then it held a special meaning for them a meaning no one outside their circle could possibly fathom so it has begun he thought but perhaps it is already too late dragons heart that was how the coded calligraphy was headed it was what had galvanized three oaths tsun it was what caused him to send number one son to fetch formidable sung with all due haste protocol demanded such an honor for one such as formidable sung all the bobbing lights strewn throughout the harbor had no effect on three oaths tsun rather his thoughts returned to the urgency of the oath he had sworn long ago dragons heart his summons to the final act had commenced the moment number two son had come aboard the stained ricepaper message curled like an adder in a metal tube sealed with a gob of red wax or perhaps he reflected it had actually begun the moment the tube had first been sealed so far away he shrugged no matter what must be would be done well he could tell himself that from now until the sky dragons ceased to wake and in their battling give forth thunder and rain the truth was it would be a hollow victory family three oaths tsun thought life is nothing without family at that moment he heard the slight sounds behind him felt the infinitesimal swaying of the junk as they came on board silence and the lapping of the tide which was he knew no sound at all he looked down at what he clutched so tightly in his fist the fingers of his left hand seemed suffused with an abnormal strength fire from the words inscribed on the paper by the spirit of the white tiger i will do what is required i honor my obligations he convulsively ripped apart the thin paper so delicate a medium for words that could perhaps change the world into the bay with them floating like motes of moonlight out into the trough of the south china sea lost for all time yet indelibly etched in his mind he took three deep breaths and turned slowly from his water view soon he knew he must be off if he was to make his rendezvous no one not even his number one son knew who it was he met within the maze of jungled waterways upriver sung pohan known for some time only by his triad name formidable sung stood silhouetted in the moonlight he was a pear of a man with wide hips almost no neck and legs so bowed they might have been comical on another man not on formidable sung he was the head of the k triad he came now over the creaking deck turned and spat heavily over the side of the junk the dragon boat race on sunday he said my brother says bet bet bet on t y chungs boat i say no we will make money with three oaths tsuns he stood in front of the other watching carefully all true emotion hidden away far behind his mask of a face i think i had better come to the source and find out where to play my hardearned taels after all chungs boat won last year three oaths tsun held his face expressionless by the celestial blue dragon t y chungs captain cheated to gain that win this year my men have orders to keep their lane clear under ail circumstances this is beginning to sound very fornicating serious formidable sung sat on top of a large coil of rope the way you two are going at it there may be nothing left of either of you for any of the tai pan houses to pick over i think you exaggerate three oaths tsun struck a match to an ivory pipe he had been tamping down he took several quick puffs then satisfied he said feuds are a way of life here theyre often a good way to stimulate competition he said this carefully because there was so much hidden emotion behind it business feuds were one thing and he was correct they were a way of life in hong kong but this matter with t y chung was something different it was quite personal quite terrible to contemplate formidable sung grunted you acquire donnelly and tungs tanker fleet t y chung acquires fan man metalworks you acquire the tang shan godown chain t y chung acquires southchina electronics how much money i wonder did he spend in trying to block your acquisitions how much money did you spend in trying to block his acquisitions there must be a limit to what even tai pan such as you and t y chung can expend at some point your cash reserves will become dangerously low stretched as thin as that in waters made so perilous by the dungeating communists dire warnings of the future is courting disaster and the sharks circling all around make it a lethal proposition sharks such as sawyer and sons five star pacific and mattias king you mean three oaths tsun took his pipe out of his mouth he was most pleased to lead the conversation away from the difficult subject of t y chung fornicate unnaturally all gwai loh tai pan formidable sung said as sure as a dog will defecate in the middle of the road you will have to contend with the first two but as to mattias king and company that is another story entirely three oaths tsun said nothing i have heard a rumor he wondered what price the cantonese would exact for his information he leaned down would you care for a drink he produced a bottle of johnnie walker from out of the shadows this fornicating weather makes a desert of ones mouth formidable sung said taking the bottle by its neck and drinking from it as a sailor would do he passed the scotch back to his host watching him as he tilted the bottle up the formalities over with formidable sung said i have a third cousin who is not a part of the triad he is in fact a captain of a trading ship recently he came to me with a problem it is this his voyages are being plagued by a series of cargo thefts nothing too serious he made it clear to me but enough so that his masters have said they will take the future losses out of his pay now my third cousin assures me that he has done everything in his power to trace down this thief or thieves to no avail accordingly he came to me i told him that i would help him even though this was far from my own business formidable sung gave a bray of a laugh rumors three oaths tsun said knocking out the dottle of his pipe on the outside of the rail one often pays a high price for something that in the pure light of day turns out to be worth nothing at all he blew into the stem to clear it of tobacco residue one must be most circumspect i have found when it comes to rumors formidable sung nodded in commiseration without a solid source a rumor is as useful as fornicating rats aboard ship i myself would not consider paying a copper for a rumor such as that that is why i consider sources before i consider rumors i would not allow my friends to do otherwise either that is a strict rule i think another drink is in order three oaths tsun said when they had finished the round formidable sung said i have heard that mattias king and company will be leaving hong kong perhaps as soon as this autumn leave hong kong this interested three oaths tsun so completely that he feigned indifference that is ludicrous perhaps so to you and me but we are not gwai loh if the tai pan of mattias king feels sufficiently threatened by the communists in our future despite their assurances of this fiftyyear reprieve he might deem it the prudent move to make it would cause too much instability here their holdings would be at risk by the spirit of the white tiger think of what it will do to the hang seng the market will plummet like a stone it will be the autumn of all over again formidable sung nodded the hang seng dropped almost two hundred points in ten days when the communists began their scare campaign regarding our future its recovered quite a bit since then of course but what if that gwai loh tai pan knows something we dont its possible heya if ive learned one lesson in my sixtyseven years it is that anything is possible what if the fornicating communists dont honor their word what if they march in here before then where will we be three oaths tsun considered this for a time his eldest son would soon be on his way to america to be educated properly and to get his green card this was one of three oaths tsuns hedges against the fornicating communists he asked the cantonese for the name of his third cousins ship and counted himself the winner in that exchange behind him noisy wallawalla made their way between the junks of the hakka floating city if what you have heard is the truth then we should prepare by decreasing our stock holdings but slowly formidable sung said too swift a move will set off panic selling he lit a cigarette threw the match overboard well also see a scramble between sawyer and sons and five star pacific he was speaking of the two most powerful westernrun tai pan houses behind mattias king company you know as well as i do that under those conditions five star pacific will make a run at sawyer five years ago they attacked sawyer through proxy acquisitions via dummy corporations the old man just about fended them off then dont i know it three oaths tsun thought who knows whether hes still got it now personally i think hes vulnerable three oaths tsun almost yawned but inside his heart was beating fast yes how so utilities formidable sung said in a knowledgeable tone five stars got the new territories all sewn up now that theyre about to sign the pu lo agreement that areas been hotly contested for almost seven months now barring a lightning bolt from buddha i think sawyers utilities can get eaten up using the right moves three oaths tsun crossed his arms over his chest put his head back against the cabin bulkhead he might have been falling asleep theres much to pass along this night he thought but all this is beside the point it seems to me formidable sung said all very interesting a mi tuo fo but not what i was sent for i have no doubt no three oaths tsun was staring out to sea a tanker black as pitch broke the silver line of the south china sea as it lumbered on its way perhaps to japan moonlight spangled its path fore and aft like a deserted highway i have at last heard from our source but we are not yet ready formidable sung said i have also had word that the next summit has been postponed a week three oaths tsun said seemingly changing the subject that is bad the rose stretched his arms over his head plans have to be set commitments made i agree it is unfortunate but i am afraid that it is unavoidable not for the k its not its fornicating bad enough to deal with shanghainese chiuchow and the rest of that pack of diseased hyenas dew neh loh moh do you expect me to jump through hoops as well this idea has been madness from the first is it madness to want a future for ourselves three oaths tsuns eyes blazed do you think i would commit myself to something i thought the ravings of a madman of course not but trust sung pohan he said using the s childhood name if we are to have any future at all we must all trust the source that is the only thing that can bind us together that has a prayer of making us whole again you have been witness to the power would you willingly turn your back on such a chance formidable sung turned his head and spat heavily over the side on whom should i place my taels come sunday he said by way of an answer my boat will carry the day formidable sung grunted and turned away thinking perhaps i should bet on t y chungs craft as well just to be on the safe side when three oaths tsun heard the car door slam as number one son drove the cantonese home he lumbered to the rail of his junk he rubbed his leg the weather was changing his wound told him that he thought of formidable sung holding all of them together is like trying to take hold of the four winds he thought especially now it is all as fragile as a house of straw dragons heart it could blow away in any sudden gust and it will be over just like that by the eight drunken immortals that must not happen climbing down the rope ladder with some difficulty he settled into the small wallawalla that number six son was holding at anchor by the side of the junk in the shadows out of sight of everyone especially formidable sung time three oaths tsun thought there is just enough to make the rendezvous where is he where is who david oh watched the volunteer make the bed someone had taught her how to make hospital corners he has not been moved he has not checked out he turned to face bliss you know fornicating well who im talking about jake maroc hes not here bliss smiled sweetly i know that i can see his clothes are not in the closet where did he go the fu is missing that was what she had come to tell him missing jake had said i dont understand its gone from your flat she said mariana has taken it but why bliss did not know that was why she was here the fu was more important than any single life save jakes the fu was no secret from her jake had let her play with it when they were children it had been precious to him then too but for different reasons you must retrieve it she had said he had stared at her that is why youve come back it is in japan now toshimaku yakuza territory nichirens as well wont you tell me who you are he had asked you know who i am i want to know who you have become she had laughed at that perhaps out of selfdefense i am bliss here i am but he had only shaken his head i know only a little girl if your memories are strong jake then you know me bliss for now you must trust that i am a friend i do not think i would know about the fu otherwise if nichiren knows of it if he has it now that is why you must go to japan now what about david oh ill take care of things here he stared hard into her eyes and bliss knew he was deciding whether to trust her what do you have to lose she had said whatever i know ive told you bliss said to david oh youve told me nothing then you already know the extent to which i am involved jake and i grew up together we were childhood friends and you came back now just like that ill tell you something sad mr oh she said sincerely death and injury have a way of breaking down the barriers of time they also reveal to us our own mortality life is finite so are the fruits of friendship it is a pity that tragedy causes us to see that youll pardon my suspicious nature he said lighting a cigarette i was born with it bliss smiled i am not offended you dont know where jake went it was as if he had switched gears another preset tape loop running i came in just before you did she spread her hands this is what i found david quizzed the volunteer but she knew nothing at all excusing himself he went back out into the corridor at the nurses station he put them all through their paces none of them were even aware that jake had left the room let alone the hospital one phoned the doctor in charge of the case to inform him nothing it was as if jake had vanished off the face of the earth david oh turned back saw bliss emerging from the now empty room she smiled at him shrugging he flipped the powerful transceiver on a bright light on the ether zooming across the curve of the globe crackle and hiss in his ears and he adjusted the earphones when the settings were fully adjusted he began the complicated phases of the recognition code for this hour day week month year he waited with patience until he heard the string of numbers spewed out in return contact nichiren source said have you secured mariana maroc yes where is she still in tokyo i want her out of there too many potential leaks in a city that size moving her around from place to place someones bound to see her i know where to take her then good see to it crackle of interference right say again i missed the first part is she all right i assume so yes havent you spoken with her i havent been with her much is there a reason for that nichiren hesitated and the voice picked it up immediately you should have no personal feelings about this thats not possible shes his wife what of it one cannot bend discipline to ones whims discipline either is or is not there was a pause during which nichiren felt sweat spring out along the back of his neck tell me how you feel about her if you lie i will know it keii kisan is dead her husband is the reason for that i cannot stand to be in the same room with her all the more reason for you to do just that there was no admonishment in the voice that was one of the reasons nichiren never lied to his source stay with her until the resentment leaves you you have been taught to feel nothing but the game when you play wei qi it is just the same with this think of the game the usagigoya was two blocks off yasukunidori it was tiny as befitted its name rabbit hutch but it overlooked the sumida river where it was crossed by ryogokubashi this was kamisakas place of sanctuary and in all the world the only other person who knew of its existence was nichiren kamisaka who was in nichirens opinion at least a glorious mixture of shy and aggressive had debated for months before finally capitulating still she was hesitant as she took his hand and led him up the stairs to the apartment door she would not let the key out of her hand she was first over the threshold then she had turned around and bowing as a true host should formally invited him inside of course she could not have afforded the rent on even this small usagigoya on her own and there was no question of going to her father for the money it was to flee his autocratic rule that she had need of such a sanctuary in the first place besides he would have interrogated her for hours about her reasons for needing such a large monthly sum of money kamisaka was a clever woman though she was only nineteen she had gone to her older brother a very successful lawyer in exchange for his patronage with no questions asked she had agreed to apprentice gratis in his understaffed office three days a week while she finished school she had only one year to go whatever burden it placed on her she remained uncomplaining her greatest joyonce she had gotten used to the spirit of another human being sharing her sanctuarywas to make nichiren bitter green tea she had learned the art of chanoyu the tea ceremony earlyher mother had seen to that kamisaka had taken to it like a carp to a sparkling new pond in it she said she experienced an utter peacefulness and with nichiren she found it particularly comforting he was a mysterious figure in her life more than twenty years her senior obviously welltodoshe had a superb eye for tailoring and the manner in which people spent moneyand perhaps most important of all he had the bearing of the ancient upperclass traditionalist sometimes she felt positively bourgeois in his presence as if she were back in the eighteenth century and she a merchants daughter had through some cultural aberration come in contact with a samurai but when she made the tea ceremony matters of money and class distinction faded only the appreciation of an exquisitely detailed courtesy held sway on the other hand kamisaka was crazy about his body the muscled presence of him against her silken smoothness was like a balm to her frazzled nerves the pain in her lower stomach which glowed like a fierce and unrelenting sun all the while she was forced to kowtow to her fathers dictatorial whims was totally obscured by the cloud that was her lover though she was but recently engaged to be married she had been to bed with no one other than nichiren her husbandtobe was not of her own choosing but rather had been another of her fathers ironwilled dicta it was to be a marriage of families keibatsu her father had said in response to her reasoned protests will make both our families stronger your marriage to shizukisan will be good for everyone involved as a last resort kamisaka had tried hysterics but her mother had soon put a stop to that pulling her aside to admonish her that no civilized lady of culture and breeding would think of acting that way toward her father and her husbandtobe now kamisaka did not have to be concerned with marriage shizukisans horrible death on the subway tracks a week ago had put her entire family in mourning inwardly kamisaka had blessed her karma while she said her silent thanks to the kami of her ancestors to whom she had prayed for deliverance dusk in tokyo the neons threw back the encroaching darkness turning their corner of the sky the pale streaked hues of the inside of a clam shell when nichiren was with her here she lighted only the bedside lamp its lowwattage bulb through the ricepaper shade produced a glow that warmed them both but now when she was here alone she was obliged to keep all the lights on even in the middle of the day and no matter what she did it seemed cold in fact within the past week kamisaka had become frightened of her own feelings at class whether it was during lectures or exams she found herself thinking of nichiren like woodbine he seemed to have entwined himself about her spirit she did not feel lifeless without him merely dull and purposeless but these were concerns for her own soul she knew that she must never articulate them to himor anyone for that matter so it was with a terrible shiver of fright that she received his news kamisakasan he said softly i must go away it is likely to be for a long while kamisakas heart froze and her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth he had told her this beforehe was always going away on one of his mysterious journeys somehow this had added to his appeal for she would create her own romantic fantasies of what he was doing heroically righting some wrong or some such that she knew in her heart to be absurd yet these simple daydreams of him had made her love him all the more on each return as she stared into his extraordinary eyes kamisaka saw that this trip was different somehow she was able to penetrate all his careful layers of metallic deceit she knew that a long while might very well mean forever she felt her pulse in her throat and she fought the urge to open her eyes wide like a panicked animal emotions gyred so intensely inside her that she felt abruptly nauseated she longed to close her eyes she felt the desire to weep at his feet and at the same time rail at him like a harridan she did none of these things however recalling her mothers words that such behavior was not within the province of a civilized lady of culture and breeding which kamisaka certainly was instead she bowed her head and murmured i wish you good fortune nichiren watched her kamisakasan he paused for a moment and in the silence he could hear the mournful hooting of a barge on the sumida over the muted clatter of rushhour traffic the sound made nichiren melancholy longing for the countryside where he had been brought up will you speak to me kamisakasan she shook her head the cascade of her long thick hair coming down across her shoulder obscuring part of the front of her kimono but i must her long slender forefinger against her pursed lips stopped him she came against him on the bed her flesh was hot beneath the thin silk that slithered sinuously between them a barrier to their awakening desire nichirens callused hands came up resting lightly on her shoulders with great care he moved them down taking the kimono with them his lips left hers still wanting his tongue licking out into the hollow of her neck then down to her bare breasts they were small and high with exceptionally responsive nipples under his tender ministrations they seemed to grow to the length of a finger joint kamisaka moaned with her open mouth her eyelids fluttered closed she had the neck of a swan the lamplight burnished her taut flesh as nichirens mouth moved downward her eyes opened she loved to watch him while they made love her own pleasure seemed to soar while she watched his muscles ripple the sight of his naked body was such an erotic stimulus to her that she often found herself flushed and wet with excitement while he was dressing shaving or climbing into the shower his body was the stuff of which kamisaka had dreamed while at school she had watched the male athletes working out in their uniforms of shorts and sleeveless mesh shirts long flat muscles much like those of a kenjutsu sensei or the distance runner rather than those of a wrestler or bodybuilder kamisaka had often seen the mountainous musculature created by pumping ironit seemed that many of her female classmates carried with them magazines filled with color photographs of such oiled figures posing like selfabsorbed peacocksand she could not see the attraction she loved to dig her fingers into nichirens muscles feeling with detailed precision almost as a doctor would just how far they would give and at what point they resisted her absolutely when they were joined she liked nothing better than to bite him the twin satisfactions of being hotly penetrated while at the same time feeling his firmness between her bared teeth never failed to open up her orgasm like a giant flower within her turning her limbs and her pounding heart to liquid she would not allow him to make love to her with his mouth unless she could slide his thick length between her parted lips she adored the sounds he made when she withdrew him slick and quivering from her prolonged kiss and blew her hot breath upon his engorged crown too she loved to feel his scrotum tighten at the onset of his storm she would then clamp her fingers around the base of him using her searing tongue to lick all around the enpurpled head until he thrashed upon the bed entangling them both in the flowered sheets he would spray her with the beads of warm sweat that flew from his hair as his head whipped back and forth on the pillows before returning to its place high up between her shadowed thighs she would feel his own tongue flicking out tracing her feverish inner flesh opened to him like the petals of an asagao the heat would infuse her just as if she had stepped into a furo a hot bath and she would relinquish her hold on him plunging her mouth down to the root of him feeling the shock waves rippling through him multiplying until they became a part of her own tidal wave of lust kamisaka was not a passive lover and she detested women who were she was certain that she could tell this fact about them just by engaging them in a conversation of her choosing she did not believe in lying back in wait for anything in lifeespecially pleasure though she had been trained well and therefore to a gaijin might appear meek and acquiescent on the surface nothing could be further from the truth it was just this surety that had drawn nichiren to her before kamisaka he could not have imagined spending the night with a girl of her tender years let alone seeing one regularly but kamisaka had reminded him of a basic tenet in life and that was that everything was mutable just as anything was possible this night her ministrations were more tender than usual her murmured words to him sweeter even than he could remember their being before in the midst of his driving passion gripped as he was by her fingers and her working lips tongue and palate nichiren felt an entirely different emotion ascend within him instead of distancing him from his ecstasy it rather plunged him deeper into it he felt more passion more pleasure than he had ever before experiencedmore in fact than he had ever thought possible kamisakas serpent tongue flicked out curling around the huge crown of his member he felt ineffable softness gliding all around him bringing his passion to a peak without allowing it to overflow his mouth was filled with her most delicate flesh he was suffused by her scent which was musky and fresh at the same time with every breath he inhaled her in with him so that he was reluctant to let go and exhale her velvety thighs rose up like the columns of buddha on either side of his head the fluting of the muscles along their inner faces transmitting her excitement to him in palpable waves he moved in even deeper so that he engulfed her as she did him with this new emotions ascendancy nichiren entered kamisaka in a wholly different fashion from what he was used to now he was inside her without having penetrated her how was this possible it was not often that nichiren asked himself a question relying on his fully developed instincts to provide him with answers as he moved through life and in this totally open state nichiren felt her fear as tangibly as if he had come upon a bird with a broken wing in the midst of a dark forest he held it up to the light peering at it as the curiosity it was he hit upon its nature at the precise moment that understanding of his own emotion flooded through him then the building storm of sexual release of his and kamisakas manufacture overcame them both and for a time drove all thought from his mind in the aftermath kamisaka exhausted emotionally slept she did so on her right side lying slightly curled up facing nichiren for a long time he lay awake beside her he did nothing but watch her tracing with his eyes the lines of her body providing from memory the completion of some where the inadequate light could not he felt her breathing as if he were on a shoreline stretched in the surf at the mercy of the suck and pull of the tide the gleam of her long hair held the same mysterious glisten of sunlight spread upon the ocean at the horizon he wanted very much to touch her but he did not he feared that he would wake her and he could not bear to bring this moment to an end he contented himself with feeling the warmth of her breath upon his wrist but he knew that feeling could not last long time was racing past too fast slowly carefully so that he would not wake her he rose in absolute silence he dressed outside on the sumida the barge or another one like it hooted sounding like the cry of a child in a moment he was gone embracing anonymity

off the windows as the crowded bus rocketed in almost absolute silence on its way into tokyo it felt odd coming back here so soon after the explosion memories of the dantais high spirits were strong inside him at times over the past several days he had felt their absence so acutely that he had become momentarily disoriented in tokyo jake took the subway into toshimaku and checked into a small inexpensive hotel he knew that was quite out of the normal traffic flow though this was a westernstyle place it had only one john on each floor and no shower at all that was all right with jake he had decided the best place for him was in a sento as was the case with most cheap hoteru this one was located just around the corner from a public bath he passed through the sliding glass door marked male bought a ticket and a small thin towel that would double as washcloth he went into the first of the tiled communal rooms where a female attendant handed him a wicker basket in which to place his clothes this was then put on an open shelf no one here thought about theft in the next room were the open showers and lower down on the whitetiled wall two sets of faucets for washing it was important to do all ones cleaning up here before stepping into the pool room naked he padded over to the line of faucets scrubbed himself carefully he felt the places where his body was still sore and swollen though all the bandages were gone along with the worst of the discoloration he made a complete inventory of his aches his mind felt dislocated almost as if he were in another mans body surely since the raid at ohenro house he felt as if he were living someone elses life what had happened to his own his wife was goneperhaps inexplicably to his archenemy his fu was missing a girlno scratch that a womanhe had not seen for years had come back into his life also inexplicably and the dantaigone gone gone his fault alone blindly they had followed him and he had shown them death the shock and fear were like the taste of raw gunpowder in his mouth mandy choi had saved him from death who had pulled him from the rubble which one of the dantai had died to free him he would never know now and somehow that one slim fact seemed more horrible to him than any other he winced as he soaped across his temple the worst place he touched it again gingerly to get a sense of its depth he closed his eyes he had to remind himself where he was what he was doing here mariana find mariana find the fu he went through into the next room it was quite a bit larger here excruciatingly hot water was fed into the bottom of a pool by an open pipe at the far end a faucet dripped cold water only the faint of heart congregated there of course all gaijin were expected to sit near the cold water naked jake chose a spot midway down the pool and eased himself into the steaming bath he groaned softly to himself as his tense muscles reacted to the heat on his right was a high wall above which sat an attendant in a high chair who like a magistrate oversaw both the mens bath in which jake was soaking and on the other side of the wall the womens pool sweat drifted through his thick hair sliding down his damp cheeks and chin he was aware of the other bathers around him only dimly through the haze of steam rising from the almost still surface of the pool when he shifted position the temperature of the water dictated that he do so with the exaggerated slowness of a drunk and indeed he felt lightheaded from the intense infusion of heat disconnected except from the heat followed that down through the tunnels of his memory in his seventh year in a spring unseasonably hot he and several friends had used the opportunity a holiday had afforded them to flee the island it was ta chiu the time of the spiritplacating festival and they had taken the ferry out to the tiny fishing island of cheung chau jake and his friends had plunged off the old rickety wharves the first chance they had while barebacked men erected the sixtyfoot bamboo shelters for the festival the children had engaged themselves in a cannonballing contest seeing how far each could leap out into the water after lunch they had walked up the dusty paths toward the line of bamboo shelters inside they could see men constructing ninefoothigh papiermache images of the festivals triumvirate of reigning gods in the center was the whitebearded sage he was flanked on the left by the fiercelooking demongod and on the right by the glowering warriorgod in full battle dress so cleverly worked were the papiermache pieces that the children were held spellbound as the figures came to life before their eyes in the hazy twilight lights came on and torches were lit a procession of women brought the long poles on which were placed the freshly baked buns with a great deal of cheering and commotion the poles were lifted on high so that the buns rose into the darkened heavens there to be consumed by the hungry souls of the island victims of nineteenthcentury pirates children gathered around the bases of the poles in increasing profusion the climax of ta chiu was almost at hand the souls had been given their time to feed now it was the livings turn at a signal from one of the old men designated as judges the children were loosed to scramble up the poles and if they could get that far take what was left of the buns and eat them as their prize thus gaining good luck in the year ahead jake and bliss leapt up adjacent poles the firelight sparked and crackled all around them as if they were in the midst of a fireworks display far off the glinting of the ocean brought them a sense of the world outside their juk saan bamboo mountains bliss was agile but jake had strength and more important stamina at the top of the juk saan he grabbed at the bun tore it from its stake then putting it between his teeth he shinnied back down on the ground he was surrounded congratulated but bliss had no such welcome she had managed to climb threequarters of the way up when her strength had given out jake broke away from the crowd and tore his bun in half reluctantly bliss took the piece he gave her this means you will have only half the good luck you have earned for the year jake shrugged maybe good luck should be shared he said pressing the baked dough on her maybe that way it multiplies itself happy with that thought bliss bit into her piece they munched together later when they had missed the last ferry back to the island jake called home and gave his mother a list of all the children who were with him so she could pass the word to their families she had been calmvoiced but even through the phone line jake had recognized her concern he told her not to worry because of the unseasonable weather there seemed no need to seek shelter the festival had broken up inside the bamboo shelters only the tall gods stared out unseeing and immobile the children found places to lie down and make themselves comfortable jake and bliss fell asleep together but something awakened him several hours later it was deep in the night the lights had been extinguished and only the remnants of the torches remained guttering and briefly flaring jake looked around as if expecting to hear a repetition of the sound that had brought him out of slumber or had he dreamed it it was not certain no one was about he stared upward the stars hard as diamonds glittered down on him with the ethereality of dragons eyes heard a sound he turned his head it seemed to have come from within the shadows of the bamboo shelter moving bliss arm which had been draped around his waist jake got up cautiously he went toward the shelter inside he walked around the bases of the statues peering in every corner perhaps a dog he thought but there was nothing it was as if he alone was awake on all of cheung chau then he caught a slight movement and looked up had one of the statues moved but that was impossible they were made out of papiermache jake had seen them being constructed himself and yet had not the warriorgod been looking straight ahead all through the ta chiu now his gaze was lowered almost as if he were looking straight at jake you look at me as if you knew me jake jumped the warriorgod had spoken have you no tongue young tadpole ijake peered up ward you cannot be alive i saw you being built you saw my image now i inhabit that image you are made out of paper and glue jake insisted oh pragmatic child is there no more room in this world for miracles with that the warriorgods right arm moved there you see jake reached up and pulling on the fingers of the warriorgods right hand tugged until the arm broke free bouncing down beside him god god jake said what god there is only one god shadows moved as the armor plating of the statue swung open a man stepped out from the hollow innards of the image one god his expression was perplexed and who taught you that young tadpole it is certainly not a chinese idea my parents the man clambered down until he sat upon the papiermache foot of the god he had a narrow face and a high forehead what was left of his hair was very long and wispy jake had seen the style before in a picture book and knew it was from another age i am jake he said jake maroc jews the chinese said softly your family is jewish jake nodded do you have a name fo saan jake peered hard at the man fo saan means volcano is that so fo saan said what does your name mean i dont know well perhaps it is time you found out now his head hung with the burden of the baths heat and his thoughts he felt entangled in a vast web of a design beyond his knowledge he was moving with painful progress from one delicate shining strand to another without a glimpse of the overall pattern he knew he was doomed unless he could discern that pattern and make it work for him instead of as now against him jake closed his eyes sinking down into the past again fo saan was an artist but one unlike any he had met since fo saan knew about the ocean for instance he had shown jake what lay beneath to create the changing colors he had described the merging of sea and shore the gradual rise of stone caused by the grinding upheavals of the earth they were jake had soon discovered the sources of fo saans power he knew how to harness the forces of nature to draw upon them when he needed them do such things have interest for you fo saan had asked him that first hot night jake had thought of how difficult it sometimes was being raised a gwai loh in hong kong of course bliss was his friend she was eurasian who else would play with her how many alleys had jake walked out of his way to avoid after the first beating he had received in one at the hands of the chinese what was it really that fo saan was offering him if you pick up a weapon fo saan had said some time later you must first know what it is you wield he had drawn a long sword its edge so sharp that jake could not see it that was the first thing fo saan had taught him about it there were many others to come before he would allow jake even to wrap his hands around the hilt jake was to learn breathing balance form grounding before he ever took hold of any weapon he had to learn to think of his body as if it were an army to understand its weaknesses as well as its strengths its limitations as well as its frontiers as he worked daily with fo saan after school his body filled out stretching and hardening the muscles building themselves around flexible bone and tough sinew it was not that his parents did not notice the changes in him just the opposite in fact but his mother fearful from the first street fights he had inevitably gotten into saw another person emerging and wisely she was loath to interfere with its progress that this was perhaps an atypical response from a parent is not surprising since she was far from being a typical mother and had from the first seen in jake the kernel of uniqueness she now saw budding daily in front of her if you possess allies fo saan said unite with them if you find yourself in enemy territory do not linger if you find yourself imprisoned you must hold your body still and concentrate with your mind until a way out presents itself to you if you find yourself in death ground you must fight to the end but in all of this you must remember that there are some roads not to follow some enemies not to strike some cities not to assault and some ground that should not be contested years later jake had come to realize that fo saan had been paraphrasing sun tzus the art of war jake wondered now whether he was striking out on one of those roads not to follow if so he knew where it would inevitably lead to death ground where ultimately the only possibility was to fight to the end jake felt a stirring of the scalding water looked to his left he saw a young japanese with a weasels face tattoos covered his chest shoulders upper arms and back like a fantastic shirt i shouldnt be here weasel face said not after the mess at ohenro house that information was costly he glanced around even though there was no one in their immediate vicinity you should have told me why you wanted to locate nichiren i didnt know it was to blow him halfway to hiroshima he was the one using explosives weasel face guffawed buddha i would too if you were coming after me i need your help again jake said weasel face looked away neh no way its important otherwise i wouldnt be after you so soon after the last bit i bought from you i know what youve got to contend with see i dont think you do you havent a clue what makes you so smart anyway jake recognized the japaneses nervousness and decided to back off a bit the thing is he said carefully its become personal im not surprised weasel face said what do you expect after you killed nichirens best friend hes not going to do any bowing in your direction for a while jake had no response to that ten thousand us no soap if its a matter of money its not weasel face broke in its a matter of my own neck see he sniffed theres nothing more i can do youre lucky i met you i figure i owe you that much i cant do it myself thats tough you should have thought of that before you let him slip through your fingers jake thought a moment if the japaneses source could locate nichiren once it could do it again how about i guarantee not to involve you you get ten thousand us in your locker today you walk out and thats it weasel face turned his head youre already here jake said sensing that he was close youve made this commitment im asking for nothing more yeah so what are you asking for the name of your source for the information you sold me last time about nichiren about nichiren you must think im dim no but youll be a helluva lot richer in ten minutes jake shrugged what do you have to lose i cant go to your source i cant involve you in any way fifteen thousand have him ten thats my limit okay weasel face knew that he would never make so much money so easily again in his life my source for that info was inside the komoto clan who inside the clan now youre getting to the nub of my livelihood that name hasnt got a price jake nodded he knew the boundaries as well as the next man nearly two hours after entering the sento he emerged feeling at least more resolved this was ground that he knew in his heart must be contested if it meant that for the first time in his life he would forsake fo saans teachings then so be it whatever the price he must accept it now while there was still the option to turn back his joss was his just as his resolve was his he was its creator it was still pouring the murky afternoon having given way to a dull featureless twilight neons streaked the pavement and streets but the insistent rain washed all color from the reflections with a pang jake was reminded of the moment when the dantai had crossed the road to enter ohenro house he passed up the biggu makku at the local mcdonalds but he did look with some nostalgia at the teenage americans who despite the inclement weather were grouped around its familiar bright yellow and red faзade they seemed so carefree as they laughed raucously the boys clumsily flirting with the girls he dined on sushi washed down with kirin beer and later the steaming hot slightly fishy tea typically served at sushi bars it was dark when he finished late enough for him to begin it did not take him long to find it such gambling establishments abounded but were accessible only to those who knew about them because he was unknown to the place and perhaps also because he was a gaijin he was required to pay a heavy entrance fee inside jake fought his way through the billowing pall of cigarette smoke mingled with the sour stench of sweat and in the losers case fear around a low cypress table that gleamed from hours of hand polishing the gamblers knelt like penitents before the altar these were mostly middleaged businessmen still in their dark suits crisply starched white shirts and dark ties it was hot and close in the room but none of them appeared to notice those who ran the game were barechested their spectacular irezumi rippling as their muscles flexed with the rapid motions as they raked in money or paid it out jake fighting dйja vu found a place at the table and began to play he started out cautiously and within an hours time was slightly ahead then in the opinion of those japanese around him he got bitten by the gambling bug and seeking to increase his winnings commenced to bet heavily and imprudently within three hours he was wiped out but not yet ready to quit he rose rather shakily from the table and spoke softly into a waitresss ear she shifted her tray of hot sake and pointed the way through a curtained doorway in the rear of the room the sarakin was just three blocks away his latenight office lights washing out into the rainslicked street he was an enormous man fat hung from beneath his jowls and his eyes seemed lost within the heavy folds of his wide round face he had small pudgy fingers that he kept laced across the globular expanse of his great belly how can i help you he inquired in english i need a loan jake said in japanese the sarakin whose name was fujikima grunted heavily his small brown eyes squinted as he scowled what have you for collateral ive got plenty of cash in the bank jake lied he put an apologetic smile on his face but considering the hour it is not available to me tonight my luck is about to change i know it ah fujikima said a gambler he smiled i have a special fondness for gamblers the smile abruptly dropped away have you your bankbook with you im afraid not uhm you are living here you have a permanent address a job i come through four or five times a year jake said thats why i need the account here what bank jake told him the sarakin shook his head poor risk you have nothing at all to give me i dont think it would be wise for me to my passport jake said digging into his jacket pocket he placed the document on fujikimas scarred desk he grabbed up a paper and pencil this is where im staying i guarantee ill be here at ten tomorrow morning with the cash the huge japanese stared down at the passport and the printed address look jake put a note of pleading into his voice i cant go anywhere without that passport and you yourself said you had a soft spot for gamblers the price will be high i understand fujikimas hand covered the passport sweeping it off the table ten am sharp tomorrow he looked into jakes face now how much do you need ten minutes later jake was back at the table for a time his fellow gamblers saw he was able to hold himself in check and he made a number of sensible moves then he became overeager and following on the tail of a winner lost everything he had borrowed from the sarakin the veterans all about him observed that he left whitefaced and shaken and they gossiped among themselves speculating about him for some time until those running the table reminded them of why they were there the gambling resumed at an even more frenzied pace and jake was forgotten by all but a few he was not however forgotten by fujikima and when at elevenfifteen he had still failed to show the sarakin picked up the phone he dialed a familiar number and when he heard the moshimoshi on the other end asked for mikio komoto komoto was the man for whom fujikima worked he was also the man who ran the gambling establishment in which jake had lost so much money the night before mikio komoto was a yakuza oyabun he had a reputation to protect as did the sarakin using information provided by fujikima he immediately dispatched two of his men to jakes hotel thus jake awoke from a deep and dreamless sleep to find a silencedcaliber automatic pressed muzzlefirst against his temple get up one of the men said in harsh guttural japanese get up now the road not to follow he was on it now and there was no turning back the quarry maintained a number of extensive rural properties in virginia they existed for a variety of purposes ranging from combatsimulation training to what the agency liked to call recuperative reorientation where agents were treated for everything from shock to sprained backs the movie house where unfriendlies were shipped if they proved recalcitrant looked more like a dude ranch than anything else a wooden fence in the western style surrounded the sixtyacre property there were stables two riding circles with jump bars for english style horsemanship and a plethora of winding shady trails through the surrounding hills for western riding with all this equestrian paraphernalia it was quite possible to miss the low windowless concrete structure built as solidly as a bunker into a hillside that gave the place its name gerard stallings however made it a point to watch the concrete monstrosity as he urged his chestnut stallion out of its stall the movie house served as a constant reminder to him of the darker side of his profession it both frightened and reassured him it was a symbol of the quarrys ultimate might and the proof that good triumphed over evil that made stallings feel very good indeed until several months ago his only recreation had been riding it was a passion he had grown up with as a kid in texas he rode a horse better than he drove a car and he was tops at handling any auto made by machine or hand not only in his own view but in the opinion of quarry staff as well lately wunderman had begun teaching stallings how to work a computer at first stallings had balked he disliked on principle any activity that did not take place outside in fresh air but wunderman had persevered pointing out that stallings could quadruple his problemsolving capacity by delegating some of the complexities to the computer he had given stallings a handson demonstration and stallings was hooked now he used it as an intellectual toy devising new ways around seemingly unsolvable problems however stallings had vowed not to take time away from his horses so when rodger donovan wanted to get hold of him he was obliged to drive out to the movie house sign out a horse and ride out after the agent donovan was uncomfortable on horseback he had never had anything to do with them as a child consequently he had an adults innate fear of something so large which could at the drop of a hat throw him into the tall grass nevertheless he was determined to get it done this way rather than use his beeper to call stallings in donovan knew full well that was the cowards way out and would decrease his already low standing in stallings eyes in stallings view you werent a real man unless you rode and rode well eventually he found stallings sprawled beneath the shade of a mature oak cowboy hat pulled low on his face he appeared to be asleep unmindful of his untethered horse which was cropping contentedly at the savory grass donovan decided to take the unobserved moment to dismount which for him was rather more of an ungainly slither he took the reins of his horse and walked her to stallings stallion where he bent and took those reins as well he began to walk the horses over to the tree dont do that donovan stood stockstill he doesnt like to be tethered stallings lifted his hat stared straight at donovan why dont you leave well enough alone donovan dropped the reins of stallings horse because he did not know what else to do he patted his own mount on the side of the neck startled the animal snorted swinging her head so hard against donovan that he staggered back a pace always let your horse know where you are stallings said getting slowly to his feet they dont see the way humans do youve got to remember that or one fine day youll get kicked right in the butt thats something youre not likely to forget not with six weeks in the hospital with a broken thigh bone donovan stood a bit apart from his horse now the thought of getting back on it filled him with dread youre moving out he said glad to change the subject whereto tokyo japan huh stallings spat well i havent been there in six years time i stretched the muscles of my japanese anyway he came into the sunlight reaching out to give his stallion a sugar lump the horse lifted its head and whinnied it nuzzled stallings palm long after the treat was gone whats up jake marocs wife mariana stallings stood as still as a statue the stallion nosed him several times perhaps wanting more sugar but stallings ignored him youd better explain yourself were talking about a quarry dependent its unfortunate i know donovan said trying to make this as easy as possible the old man made the determination the call she got that night was from ohenro house nichiren donovan shrugged maroc himself told david oh that his wife had no friends in tokyo form your own conclusion about the call its still all circumstantial but donovan could see that stallings was not at all sure its too dangerous a situation for us to take a chance remember the old mans iceberg hes made the determination that its real the computers helped us on that one mariana maroc must be terminated if were under attack im off with a leap stallings mounted his stallion jerking on the reins he brought its head up its nostrils flared even donovan unschooled in horses could see that it was a magnificent specimen the travel agents have your instructions along with all the other normal stuff passport visa currency backup documents who am i this time get rid of that cowboy hat donovan said it wont fit what general vorkuta liked least about moscow was its landlocked status she had been born in the thrumming port of odessa on the extreme northwest edge of the black sea her father had been captain of a fishing fleet that consisted of sixteen vessels used for fishing and four used strictly by the kgb for what they liked to call external security but which was nothing more than spying rumania bulgaria and turkey constituted their sphere of influence the committee for state security had contacted nikita makarovich vorkut soon after his acute business acumen increased his fleet from eight to sixteen in the beginning it was he who had trained the kgb apparatchiks to sail and fish as professionals would afterward they had merely asked for his advice from time to time he was not strictly speaking kgb but he was vetted just as if he were they trusted him they said but all along they had his daughter so it was not surprising that she enjoyed coming to this dacha it was on the water though not in odessa itself the dacha with the seablue tile roof was just outside yalta on the crimean peninsula that jutted squarish tailed south into the black sea it was just about equidistant from bucharest istanbul and rostov which gave general vorkuta the sensation of being at some kind of nexus point but perhaps that was only a consequence of her childhood in comparison to moscow this place seemed small and isolated every time she came it seemed she enjoyed the quiet and salt air more but this morning as the general alighted from the black zil limousine that had picked her up at the military airport at odessa she cursed the changeable crimean weather it was raining a steady downpour as thick as wheat the sky was close and as gray as slate houses and trees indistinct through humid mist everything inside the dacha was clammy the atmosphere had about it an unpleasant unused quality the general called for the windows to be thrown wide open despite the downpour she ordered the heat put on to dispel some of the pervasive dampness then she stepped outside onto the wide screenedin porch that overlooked the sea wind and rain had whipped the water into a whitecapped froth it too was gray totally indistinguishable from the sky as she stared out south to where the beginnings of turkey lay nearly three hundred miles away she saw a gull wheel high above slanting down through the rain it cried out diving close to the skin of the unquiet sea a windblown wave rose up and flicked at it immediately the bird rose and vanished into the gray film that passed for sky general vorkuta stared after it certain she had seen it shudder at the moment the chill water spattered it comrade general yes daniella vorkuta turned around general karpov stood in the center of the dark living room he wore the brown and red army uniform that was his dress outside dzerzhinsky square in this space he seemed powerful magnetic he filled up the room the way yuri lantin had filled up her office so pleasant to see you here he cracked a smile danushka he held out his arms to her and she came into them his lips settled over hers her body melted into his in daniella had been working in department s an enormous unit within the first chief directorate in charge of the recruitment training and direction of kgb illegals sent to be set in place in foreign countries she had been in charge of the werewolves the legendweaving division responsible for creating credible cover fictions for the agents in that year oleg lyalin a high functionary of department v in charge of assassination and sabotage which had recently been absorbed by department s defected and went to ground in london with some of the kgbs darkest secrets on the square that was a hard enough blow but when some two months later daniella spotted a brace of facts minor but curious in lyalins dossier she began to dig deeper perhaps only she a werewolf trained to spin lies of a certain kind and therefore able to spot them could have noticed the discrepancies three weeks of increasingly furious work led her back to an inescapable conclusion amassing her damning evidence she took her bulky dossier to general karpov then head of department s within twelve hours he acted decisively and ruthlessly what daniella had discovered was that lyalin had been a british mole for more than two years before he defected soviet xenophobic paranoia swept department s concentrating itself on the highranking officers of department v who were either summarily executed after intensive debriefing beneath the same highintensity lamps under which they had formerly interrogated exposed aliens or were reduced to training raw recruits from the foreign intelligence school comrade karpov made certain that department v was no more and for his heroic services to the state the general was given an added star for his shoulder boards and the chair of the first chief directorate it was karpov of course who took all the glory and honors for the discovery of lyalins treachery but he did not forget from whence his information stemmed and as soon as was practicable he moved colonel vorkuta into the newly formed department which was taking over the functions of the now disbanded department v but it was not merely gratitude that had motivated karpov nor was it solely the recognition of her talents he had lusted after her from the moment she was first brought to his attention by a member of his staff she had been nineteen then a clerk in the active measures service but already she had devised several brilliant ciphers for agents to use she had dazzled him with her thick blond hair cool gray eyes and soft inviting lips at the time karpov had never been unfaithful to his wife he had been married for thirtyodd years and in all that time had never contemplated having an affair the sight of daniella vorkuta had changed all that however the general was too canny a career man to be swayed merely by lust his ambition was his allconsuming master only within its service would he take daniella vorkuta for his own from time to time he called upon one of his aides to check up on her progress he was informed when she was sent into europe to recruit for the first chief directorate she had the talent and the spirit to rise on her own but occasionally the general deemed it prudent to put in a quiet word here and there moving her from service to service as it suited him within six months he had her sent back he did not like it when she was so far from him also he enjoyed the way she ferreted out the bad seeds and deadheads from her working environment she was a pistol and he admired that in a sense he was molding her in his own image though neither she nor oddly he himself realized it daniellas coup allowed him to rush her upward openly he placed her in a subordinate butand this to his way of thinking was the crucial element adversary position to the man he had chosen to be the new head of department a man who karpov was not at all certain could do the job within eighteen months colonel vorkuta was in a position to become the new head of department just as karpov wished she had already proved her ultimate worth to him and even better she was in the precise place to do him the most good the politburo took a dim view of a great deal of lateral movement within an apparatchiks career and karpov had no desire to attract their attention at this stage accordingly karpov had called her into his office one morning and outlined his plan for her head of department and that of course was to be only the beginning if the general had waited his good time to have her now totally in the service of his own career he had his opportunity he was determined to make the most of it daniella declined the more she demurred the more the general became inflamed his gaze went back and forth between those pouty lips and those cool gray eyes she seemed to him a wild mare of dazzling strength and agility he needed to tame her he found much to his surprise that he had never wanted anything so badly in his life he found in fact that when she left his office he could do nothing but think about her for a man in his position that could be disastrous i must have her he thought i must he could of course have ordered her into the affair but he had to admit to himself that he would soon have loathed and discarded any female so totally acquiescent he knew that daniella was far too important to him to risk that kind of situation in his heart he wanted her to say yes of her own volition that day he canceled all his appointments and extracting her dossier from the library took it home to his flat his wife was off for two weeks visiting her sister in riga karpov had the place to himself he fixed a drink and carrying it into his small homey study sat in the leather wingback chair and cracked the file three hours and two drinks later he thought he had found the answer daniella had been born and raised in odessa as it happened her dacha was nearby on the black sea a return home thats just what she needs he thought for daniellas part she had every intention of sleeping with general karpov at the very first opportunity she found his power his size and his manner very attractive but as her father had taught her one should never give away what one can sell she had marked karpov as a high bidder she would have to be deaf dumb and blind not to have recognized the passion of his gaze she liked that more than she cared to admit for daniella was also driven by ambition and she knew full well that personal passion could easily deflect discipline karpovs inky eyes sliding over her made her shiver inwardly the idea that this man who embodied so much absolute power within russia and without melted inside when he saw her was a heady aphrodisiac indeed odessa he had said expansively late one friday afternoon i have not been near the water for a very long time daniella amused at the tack of the conversation said my dacha over looks the black sea she shrugged but i rarely get time enough to make use of it what about this weekend karpov said as if it were a spur of the moment thought daniella sighed unfortunately i have far too much work work he said take it with you if you must daniella laughed do you mean you are inviting me to spend the weekend with you at my dacha karpov unsure as yet of her personal preferences was careful therefore serious in his reply is that too revisionistic for you she had another good laugh at that on sunday morning karpov had offered her department daniella wanted the kvr and a promotion to general she told him that she would not settle for less as it turned out she did not have to in his youth on his way up karpov had had many women spread their legs for him none however had the effect on him that daniella did he had never thought of himself us a crude man in bed certainly his wife had never complained neither had any of the girls out of his youth daniella showed him that he had a lot to learn about the art of making love she did not shame him rather he was awed it was as if she had taken him by the hand up to a familiar door and going through it with him had showed him a whole new universe the depth of pleasure he experienced with her seemed boundless then she showed him how to do the same thing to her after that he gave her everything she wanted and counted himself blessed at that she was brilliant at her new work brilliant in the bedroom as well karpov was on a roll then moonstone the generals plan for the encirclement of china was approved and he was given limited jurisdiction over certain select elements of the gru in order to carry out the directive yuri lantins oratory within the presidium had helped carry the day for karpov now the two worked closely together since lantin was heavily connected with the gru and had personally cleared the way for the generals crossover responsibilities within moonstone it had been karpovs lucky day when moonstone had crossed lantins desk comrade general karpov said again he whispered it into daniellas mouth laughing it amused him to hold secrets from lantin that was one of the main reasons he had wanted to take him into daniellas office he wanted that undercurrent flowing all about the other man he wanted to call daniella comrade general while thinking danushka he knew daniella knew yuri lantin for all his prodigious power did not know that gave karpov a degree of control in the face of a power that he quite frankly might otherwise find overpowering he swung daniella around watching her face as her cool gray eyes caught the slategray light her cornflower hair was pulled tightly back from her pale face accentuating the flat planes of her cheeks the narrowness of her strong chin her ears were bare of ornament though at one time they had been pierced now you have met the other end of moonstone he told her oh but i almost split a gut when you first saw him comrade general daniella seemed less amused than he moonstone is one thing she said nichirens quite another what does yuri lantin have to do with the kvr karpov chuckled swinging her back and forth from the fulcrum his laced fingers made at the small of her back yuri lantin has to do with everything inside the sluzhba you are head of the first chief directorate she said eyeing him my dear danushka surely you understand that there is an authority above the first chief directorate remember what i said the sluzhba is a world unto itself but only up to a point it is important for you to know our limits she turned away and pulling apart his fingers contemplated the sea she felt lightheaded at the thought of someone alien peering over her shoulder she shivered slightly karpov came up behind her pressing his warmth into her back what is it why such black thoughts out here so far from moscow not so far from central she said is that it he spun her around so that she faced him she saw the concern on his face is it lantin danushka he was always there isnt it better that youre aware of him now i dont want him screwing with my operatives but nichiren belongs to all of russia my dear his prowess and fame have spread too far for you to hold on to him for yourself dont you see that he has become a kind of celebrity outside the sluzhba as well as inside it do you think lantin picked up moonstone and read it with the care it deserved rather than throwing it into his out tray by accident he recognized my name from the monthly reports he remembered me because of nichiren operatives should not become celebrities daniella maintained certainly not my operatives youll have to learn to live with it karpov said just as youll learn to live with your new knowledge of yuri lantin his hands came up cupped her breasts lightly in a moment he began to squeeze until he felt her nipples come erect she loved having her breasts caressed daniellas head came back until the thick sheaf of her hair was draped across his shoulder karpovs tongue licked out at the side of her neck following down the soft line to the point of her shoulder i dont want to talk about him anymore karpov said thickly about whom daniella whispered he pulled apart the front of her blouse reached in and scooped her breasts out he rolled her nipples between his fingers until he heard her breath panting through her open lips he dropped to his knees and daniella hiked up her skirt he smoothed his palms over her stockinged thighs he licked the tops of them sucking at the bare flesh his broad thumb stroked back and forth across her mount making her moan when her pelvis began to roll toward him he grasped the waistband of her panties and pulled them down to the middle of her thighs his head lifted and his mouth settled over the core of her daniella held her breath at first she felt only his hot breath tickling her hair then little by little she became aware of his active tongue as it opened her up petal by petal when he reached her innermost layer she was already lubricating furiously her fingers pushed through his wiry hair as she brought his head harder against her she rocked against the stimulation feeling the buildup of pleasure through her veins and muscles the ecstatic engorging of her tissues her thighs began to tremble and the hard muscles of her lower belly to ripple with the onset of her orgasm she was breathing hard her nostrils flared she rolled her hips at the last instant as she hovered on the brink with her contractions already beginning to build up he took his tongue and lips away daniella gasped in frustration he moved lower his tongue flicking out at her other orifice daniella groaned deeply and pulled apart her buttocks with her own fingers she felt her pleasure double quadruple oh yes she chanted oh yes she felt as if a fire were consuming her loins an erotic tickling racing all through her insides she could no longer keep from touching herself used her fingertips high up in her folds finding just the right spot she screamed a short high cry as karpovs maddening tongue replaced her fingertips then his whole mouth was encompassing her and she felt herself being sucked up into him the wet friction was too much she cried out to the rhythm of her bodys contractions as wave after wave of ecstasy engulfed her her hips lurching heavily against him in searing contact she sank down half conscious sliding her hand inside his trousers she found him as hard as iron he trembled as her hand closed around him she felt for his scrotum then drifted her fingers over the entire length of him as she reached the head she heard his thick groan felt his penis give a warning lurch quickly she drew just the head out of his trousers slid her lips over its silky girth just in time at the contact he reared up and she felt him wildly inundating her mouth and throat as her tongue continued its soft whipping afterward unthinking she encircled him within her arms dont he said his eyes flying open you know i cannot stand restraint daniella wondered how he could think her holding him lovingly in her arms was a form of restraint she watched him while he fell into a thick slumber she thought of love sad that she had not felt that pure emotion since the last time her mother had kissed her cheek karpov began to snore and she sat up staring past his furry shoulder to the black sea but the beautiful view seemed full of ashes perhaps im tiring of him she thought or was it the weight of medea the razor edge of the terrible deadly game she had constructed for herself she spun and went inside to her study she sat beside an inlaid stone table she had had clandestinely imported from beijing some years before when medea had begun its face was an inlaid wei qi board she took up a black stone and played it judiciously now she switched sides searching for a counter for white but the war game was complicated enough when one was concentrating only on ones own strategy taking both sides she had never completed a game what was displayed before her now was the same one she had begun over three years ago daniella felt a shiver roll down her spine lantin she saw him in her minds eye standing in her office in that offhand almost negligent manner of his she wondered what was locked away behind those charcoal eyes if he was insinuated this deep inside the sluzhba would it be long before he sniffed out medea daniella knew that she could not afford that idly she took a handful of stones shook their coolness back and forth in her hand she put her head back and closed her eyes sex often had an interesting effect on her it allowed her to concentrate deeply what to do about lantin there had to be a way to neutralize him his absolute power made that a problem but daniella knew that all problems had an answer one only needed to discover it the thing to do with lantin she knew was what her father had taught her an enemys strength is more quickly defined than his weakness he had once told her if time is of the essence you will not be able to afford to search out his weakness instead determine his strength and then devise a way of using it against him the gray pall was lifting through the windows patches of cerulean sky could be seen high up as the clouds began to tear themselves into tatters in a moment daniellas eyes opened she stared down at the board wondering if she had found the answer reaching out she made whites last move in the next round the onehundredsixtysecond move black would win by five points the game was at last over and a new one had begun the minutes ticked slowly by jake used the time to deepen his breathing slowing it as he did so he centered his being sinking down into a lower layer of consciousness where fo saan had taught him all six senses were heightened when one used ones eyes in this state for instance one could take in the whole room one could react and move faster as well it was a state he strove to maintain throughout all potentially dangerous situations he knew this was one of those the two yakuza had had a car waiting they took him further northwest deeper into toshimaku through the clutter of ikebukuro skirting the sprawl of rikkyo university on the left right onto the yamatedori for just about a mile took a left into kanamecho immediately the blocks were bigger the houses more expansive lawns appeared stone gates high bamboo fences within sight of the universitys baseball grounds they had turned through an iron gate in a twelvefoot bamboo fence boxwood trees and cryptomeria rose above the martialseeming fencetop they were old and well cared for jake had gotten the barest glimpse of a house before thick foliage screened him out they got out and he walked on round stones of varying diameters through an expanse of carefully raked ochre pebbles he passed one cluster of three rocks all of varying but complementary sizes he had been hustled into the house as if he were late for an appointment down a narrow corridor papered in gray and white he passed several fusuma on either side but all the doors were closed outside the lintel of a room he was made to take off his shoes he went through an open shoji into a sixtatami room the walls were painted a traditional natural clay color the ceiling was of cedar planking along the right wall was a tokonoma an alcove on its slightly raised platform stood a slender vase of clay with a mauve glaze containing a single white and crimson day lily behind it hanging on the wall was a scroll its calligraphy read where flies the generals banners there is his army where points the general there advances his army when the general punishes a criminal the heart of the army is sternly controlled in this way are battles won jake wondered if he was about to meet the general a shoji along the left wall opened and one of the yakuza who had come to the hotel appeared he held it open as another figure emerged into the room this man took short exceedingly athletic steps as he crossed the lintel track of the sliding screen he stood in front of jake with his legs slightly spread and in so doing managed to turn a simple room into a court of law he possessed an undeniable presence jake studied him he was thickshouldered and narrowwaisted his barrel chest gave grudging way to a thick bulls neck and a scowling moon face with just a hint of stubble from shorn hair he had small ears that lay close to his head dark triangular eyes below startlingly thick eyebrows his mouth was wide and almost lipless he was nattily dressed in a dark sharkskin suit of sleek european cut striped rep tie and pale pink shirt a small gold lapel pin was the only ornamentation jake could see until the man lifted a hand a gold band in the shape of a dragon encircled the marriage finger of his left hand my name is mikio komoto the man said without preamble the sarakin from whom you borrowed the money works for me you have caught me at a most disadvantageous time i have very little for the likes of you mr richardson he lifted jakes passport flapped it back and forth as if he were fanning himself what am i to do with you you ask for a favor and then have the bad manners to refuse to pay that favor back you gamblers are all alike like gluttons your eyes are always bigger than your stomachs here he had used the word hara which meant both stomach and a kind of overall attitude that the japanese respected most fully jakes heart beat fast he had been right this was the man he had come to see oyabun he said bowing in the traditional yakuza manner will you allow me to apologize to you and to your sarakin in the proper fashion mikio komoto said nothing so jake began to move toward the other man the yakuza at the shoji reacted komoto made a cutting gesture with the edge of his hand his black eyes looked at jake as if he were a lizard on a rock jake dug into his breast pocket and produced his wallet carefully he counted out enough yen to repay what he had borrowed from the sarakin the night before including the usurious interest he added another one hundred thousand yen this pile of bills he set before komoto i apologize for the inconvenience i have caused you oyabun he said bowing again in the ritualized yakuza manner but between the money i lost last night at your gambling den and the repayment of the loan i believe that i have paid well for a moment of your time komoto signed for his man to take the bills and when the man had done so the oyabun said toshisan show this iteki out he dropped jakes passport on the tatami where jake had left the money he turned to go i know who you are oyabun jake said it is important that i speak with you komoto turned partially back you think i am impressed with your grasp of my language you think i am impressed that you know some of the rituals you are iteki a barbarian i do not have conversations with barbarians i take their money if they are weak as you are weak it is about nichiren that i am here oyabun i know nothing of nichiren keii kisan was yakuza oyabun you are yakuza oyabun your clan and kisans are bitter rivals for toshima w hadnt you better listen to me mikio komotos eyes sparked and jake could feel his intrinsic energy building dangerously when the oyabun spoke again his voice was cold enough to freeze the room yakuza business is yakuza business perhaps you think that you are clever in having been brought here let me disabuse you of that thought you have been quite stupid in certain extreme cases i have been known to do more than merely take a stupid barbarians money if an iteki crosses me i kill him he almost spat out the last sentence the sneer was clearly etched across his face iteki he repeated toshisan take this barbarian and his passport and get them both out of here theres a smell in this room i dont like his disconcertingly high voice seemed to travel only the distance it needed to reach her it was perfectly modulated she had been moved several times always blindfolded consequently her sense of disorientation ran deeper than the darkness where am i mariana said unlike jake she spoke no japanese and only a smattering of cantonese have you eaten today have you been fed well yes to both questions she said but i havent much appetite there was silence for a time i feel like a rat in a cellar she said i dont understand i have seen no light in some time im sorry a flare like a sun and mariana threw her arm across her eyes she heard him moving away from the door through her slitted eyes she saw nothing but the crook of her arm so many questions chased themselves through her mind she did not want to ask any of them until she could see properly it disturbed her how vulnerable she felt without her sight it is important to maintain the utmost secrecy nichiren said that is the reason for all the movement the windowless rooms the danger was very great and now nothing has changed what was he doing all sound had ceased where am i she asked again the answer is irrelevant to you his voice was matteroffact somewhere in tokyo she heard him closer to her i am beginning to regret doing what you told me i dont understand he said in his heavily accented english you are alive the fu is safe i have been incarcerated in pitch blackness for days without companionship or explanation she said with some vehemence how else do you expect me to feel frankly i never gave it any thought he said in an almost puzzled tone i have done what i had to in order to protect you from your enemies and what if youre lying to me i did not lie to you that night you saw what you saw that is the truth i dont know what is the truth anymore she said raggedly will you cry now her head lifted the glare was almost totally gone now do you think id give you that satisfaction it seems to me that is what women do when they are under stress he was dressed in a sootgray lightweight linen suit of superlative lines the conservative collar of his snowwhite shirt seemed to dig into the muscles of his neck his black hair was thick brushed straight back from his wide forehead he had a feline almost triangular face besides jakes he had the most extraordinary eyes mariana had seen in a man what she saw swimming lazily in their depths frightened her though she would admit such a thing to no one he looked neat and trim she could see that he was very fit despite her fear of him or perhaps because of it she felt anger rising in her youre an idiot she snapped then she noticed his hands the edges were so overgrown with calluses they were positively yellow patinaed like ancient ivory this was in sharp contrast to his fingers which were so long and delicate that she found herself filled with envy to look at them nichiren regarded her with a disconcerting calmness of spirit we must go now he said after a time go she said go where away from tokyo he said as if this in itself were a sufficient explanation there was nothing for jake to do now but wait he had walked several blocks until he came to a stationery store there he had purchased a small notepad and a ballpoint pen nearby he found a nawanoren pushing aside the beaded curtain he went in and sat at a table in the corner near him a couple of old men were drinking beer and playing a spirited game of go it was the time after lunch and before dinner there was no one else about jake ordered a kirin and shioyaki midway through eating the saltcrusted roasted fish he called for another beer the old men were far along in their game and play was slowing jake took out the notepad and pen and set about drawing an outline of mikio komotos house from memory before seeking out the stationery store he had taken a complete tour around the environs of the estate so he knew roughly its size and more specifically its shape inside he placed the halls and rooms he had passed going in and going out toshi had escorted him out through the front door next he assigned each room a function then he began to take educated guesses about the rest of the house this was not as impossible a task as it seemed on the surface traditional japanese homes were built within a rigid structural system space was at a premium even the richest businessman was limited by the land available to him too each room was some multiple of the size of a tatami so it was easy enough to break down an interior there would be no oddshaped rooms or surprises the japanese sensibility moreover was centered on confluence clean lines moving one to the other in uncluttered fashion given these absolutes the possibilities were reduced to a strict set of definites one other fact in jakes favor was that komotos rooms would be in a separate wing of the house no woman save perhaps the cleaning lady would be allowed in there this was the area that interested jake the most when he had finished his diagram he studied it for some time he wondered now whether this was all worth it what if komoto did not know where to find nichiren but obviously he had done so before why not again there was no use worrying about it jake decided hed find out soon enough he got up paid the bill on his way out he took a look at the setup of the game the two men were playing he saw the road to victory that they did not he wished real life were so easy to define outside it was still light he walked until he found the several shops he was looking for in each he made purchases when he emerged from the last he found that he was near a movie theater he went in and watched a revival of a film about the last great japanese tattoo sensei who apparently found his female clients skin more receptive to his needle if she was engaged in sexual intercourse while he was working his magic on her it reminded jake of the difference between fiction and reality finesounding words fo saan had once told him are not true beware the man who has honed his ability to talk he is a liar on the other hand art is truth art takes nothinga blank page a white canvasand makes of it something affecting art can only be defined by the emotion it engenders in the viewer it does not presuppose it does not contend like the great seas and rivers of the world art is one of the lords of the ravines its power stems from keeping low jake had expected fo saan to whip out brush and ink at some time but such had not been the case instead when jake asked if art was so powerful wasnt it to be part of his training fo saan said it is your training it had taken jake some time to understand that that was all right one learned in increments anyway that was the meaning of chahm hai to sink in absorbing lessons fo saan contended was the only way to learn one thinks he had said one morning i learn with my eyes i learn with my ears i learn with nose i learn with touch one even thinks smugly i learn with my mind he pointed go down the incline keep going jake did as he was bade the fog was so thick that jake soon lost touch with all landmarks he felt the earth beneath his bare feet turn to dry loose shale then to thin strawlike grass and finally as the incline increased to sand the sand too changed in texture as he descended from coarse to fine with a start he found himself in the water he sniffed heavily wondering how it was that he had not scented the sea before entering it then he looked up and saw that he was surrounded by an opalescent swirl he saw no sky no cloud no sun he turned fully around and found that he was out of sight of land the fog he called out to fo saan tentatively at first then cupping his hands beside his mouth more loudly his voice sounded strange and muffled an odd tone he recalled from nightmares when he was trying to shout and only a raspy whisper emerged with his feet and the bottoms of his legs submerged he could feel nothing with sight smell hearing unreliable he concentrated on touch but he soon found that he could not even tell at what level the water had risen about him until with a gasp it seeped over the waistband of his shorts how had he managed to go out so far he had no idea until that moment he had been certain that he had moved only a step or two he decided that the tide must have taken him but why then hadnt he felt its insistent tug panic welled up in him deprived of the use of his senses he felt lost and isolated in the most absolute sense he tried to calm himself by the use of reason but with its reliance on the usual flow of sensory data his mind seemed to have shut down he could not think he did not know what to do he shouted for fo saan the odd sound of his voice frightened him the resulting silence frightened him further he began to thrash around trying to make for shore but the tide had him too deeply and now would not so easily let him go he felt trapped in quicksand the ocean lapped around his chest then at his neck when he felt it rising above the level of his chin he shouted at the top of his lungs you cannot learn with your eyes a voice said in his ear because you cannot trust what you see fo saan he screamed where are you you cannot learn with your ears the voice went on because you cannot trust what you hear fo saan im drowning you cannot learn with your nose or from touch because you cannot trust what you smell or touch therefore do not think a mi tuo fo fo saan bamahk feel the pulse what pulse jake thought as he snorted salt water out of his nose his eyes stung and he felt heavy beneath the water in the grasp of the tide i will die he thought bamahk he went under then just as if the tentacle of some monstrous sea creature had clamped him about the legs desperately he kicked out holding his breath the tide spun him it was dark an inchoate roaring in his ears sounded like absolute silence he wanted to take a breath and could not he was in an alien world inimical to life his life in that moment he felt the balance of life and death it was as if he hung suspended between two massive entities they had no physical form merely a psychic presence the darkness and the light he knew from which side emanated that anarchic roaring he wanted no part of the darkness and thus he turned away from it bamahk felt the pulse not from any of his senses not from his mind from his heart suspended in the heaving primeval darkness he had let go all his senses he had ceased to think and had only begun to feel and had found the pulse it was like a river of silver in the darkness it was like a monkey bridge across a violent chasm unthinking he followed it and it brought him home gasping on the shore he had felt fo saans presence close beside him he had felt the blanket settling over his shoulders and gratefully had wrapped it around his shivering self you found the pulse jake wanted to respond but his teeth were chattering too much now you know where you must look to find the truth fo saan said now surrounded by the night jake moved silently around the perimeter of mikio komotos compound if you invade another mans house fo saan had said you must not rely on any one sense or on senses at all bamahk the pulse that fo saan had caused him to find was of course qi if one could describe it one might say that it was the ineffable combination of the will and qi intrinsic energy what fo saan had been intent on teaching jake to achieve was hao ran zhi qi the immensely great immensely strong power jake sought the pulse now and finding it entered mikio komotos domain the elements were with him the moon was a pale inconstant shadow alternately blurred and snuffed out by lowriding clouds that hinted of more rain the old trees seemed to spread their branches welcoming him into pitch blackness crouched in the deepest shadows jake wound a piece of gauzy black cotton around his nose and mouth to muffle any breathing sound he rubbed lampblack beneath his eyes across his forehead down the exposed upper part of the bridge of his nose he took off his shoes and socks he listened to the wind in the willows and cryptomeria he emerged from his impromptu hiding place using seuhnfung or steps with the wind which fo saan had taught him rather than trying to make no sound and failing he sounded like the soughing of the wind through the trees in this manner he came to the west side of the house this was where he had been brought earlier in the day mikio komotos wing he passed up the side entrance after several moments of contemplating it it was bathed in a powerful overhead mini spotlight that way was certain suicide he moved farther along past the manicured hedges beyond he saw what he had not this afternoon an exquisite private garden it was narrow but far longer than the length of the wing a tall closely linked copse of mature cryptomeria rustled at the far end jake crossed the garden using the stepping stones to negotiate the pebbles this path ended at a flat rising stone this was the last step up onto the engawa a porch of cedar planking jake crept up onto it the wall directly in front of him was a fusuma beside it was a window the lights were out in this room though they blazed in other areas of the house jake took out a small jar of liquid silicone and applied it with a mimikaki a japanese earpick something like an outsized qtip to the upper and lower tracks of the sliding door using a knifeblade inserted between the door and the wall jake quickly found the hook catch and flipped it up cautiously he slid back the fusuma an inch or two the moon emerged from a cloudbank and he ceased ail motion until its wan watery light faded before another onrush of clouds when he had opened the door just enough he went in sliding it shut behind him he sat with his feet in the air wiped the dew off their soles with a cotton rag then he donned a new pair of tabi japanese socks worn indoors wearing them he would leave no footprints he flipped on a penlight in the electronics shop where he had purchased it the salesman had cautioned him against its flagrant use this culture the creators of the miniaturized the portable the tiny electronic marvel was becoming increasingly alarmed at its accumulated fallout discardedbattery pollution jake played the narrowbeam light around the room nothing here for him it was a long shot that there would be he would now have to go out into the hall he went silently across the tatami with his hand on the shoji he took a deep breath centered himself sought again the pulse finding it he drew the screen toward him and came face to face with a diminutive wrinklefaced japanese his eyes opened wide then in perfect parody his lips mirrored his eyes he was just about to speak when jake grabbed him by his shirtfront pulled him over the threshold and into the room slid the shoji shut at his back he used his thumb which was far more effective than the multipurpose knife he carried sliding it under the small mans chin he found the arterial nexus and put pressure on it the mans eyes bulged name jake said in japanese eased off with his thumb kakachikachi tiles i dontackk the ball of the thumb had disappeared in his flesh jake kept up the pressure for a sufficient amount of time files he repeated kachikachis oversized head bounced up and down he winced with the pain take me to where they are together they went out into the hallway it was dark and deserted it was long past the time when business would be conducted in this house save for an emergency it was doubtful whether komoto himself was even here at this hour jake had been two rooms away as it turned out he drew out a length of nylon cord and placing kachikachi on the tatami bound him hand and foot he used the cotton rag to gag the japanese then he set about finding out all he could about nichiren there wasnt much that was always the risk he had known that the information concerning nichiren was volatile there was always the chance that it was communicated through the clan strictly verbally he read with mounting disappointment through the sparse notations nichirens womanizing his frequent erratically timed trips out of japan his comings and goings within kisan territory and more specifically within keii kisans compound it was clear from the last at least that nichiren did not live there or even stay overnight scratch that as a potential hiding place then he came upon a handwritten notation the others above were typewritten it took him some time to decipher the cramped kanji nichiren had been observed twice coming down from the japan alps north of tokyo the first time it seemed he had been seen totally by accident one of komotos yakuza on vacation had spotted him from a roadside restaurant as nichiren stopped across the highway for gas canny komoto had then kept a watch and sure enough eleven days later nichiren had been spotted along the same road this time it had been determined that he was descending the road out of tateyama but apparently further than that komoto had not come nichiren had disappeared for three weeks and when he returned to japan he stayed more or less within the tokyo environs at length komoto had given up the stakeout deeming it too costly in time and manpower for a more than dubious end yet this was just the chink in nichirens armor that jake had been seeking he returned the file and leaving kachikachi bound on the tatami went back down the hall exiting the house as he had come in he retrieved his shoes and socks just in time it had begun to rain uniformed soldiers were everywhere the premier had a thing about them zilin considered it a fixation the premier had been the one who gave the orders to bring down the gang of four zilin remembered it well the premier had watched while the dispatched soldiers did their work ever since he had ascended in rank he had made certain that everyone knew he had not forgotten the incident power is fleeting like a roman emperor the premier had his praetorian guard no doubt zilin thought the premier was safeguarding himself from what had happened to his predecessors what had occurred once in china could occur again well that wasnt so far off the mark if wu aiping had his way there would be more ideological blood spilled across tian an men square mine zilin thought tai he dian the hall of supreme harmony the hall of the premier was so vast that it was chilly even now in the middle of summer when all other places in china were hot and sticky the ceiling was so high it was lost to view the mist of the centuries seemed to hang in the air to film the hard wooden furniture as if with a new coat of lemon oil it had an odd distinctive smell that rippled at zilins memory brushing against the pasthis past but at the moment he could not bring it to mind as he approached the far end of the room he could see that wu aiping was already present the minister sat folded up on a carved ebony chair like a praying mantis all angles and sharply delineated lines the premier on the other hand round and squat sat behind a high wooden desk that had the appearance of a western judges bane this physical elevation he affected as a personal manifestation of his power it was in the purest sense zilin mused an anticommunistic gesture we will mouth the word comrade to each other when we are obviously nothing of the sort the hierarchies of power are ubiquitous they defeat us all in the end if we are not cautious most cautious poor karl marx what an unquiet time his spirit must endure considering the liberties his followers have taken with his precepts as zilin settled himself upon the mean seat of an ebony chair he reflected that never had the communists and the roman catholic church been so close not in spirit but in the interpretations of their precepts historically both of their ideologies had been corrupted in the name of purity by those who craved power death and destruction were wreaked under their aegis they were both bastions of sanctimonious power and i zilin thought am hardly blameless a sudden wave of despair overcame him with the intensity of pain though i did not lift a hand my guilt is the same i looked on mutely as blood was brutally spilled across these streets i now walk i remained silent when voices of righteousness were raised explaining the bloodshed as right and necessary to expunge ideological disease from the corpus of modernday china death in the name of holy purity that has been our crusade for so many years we are a poor selfdeluded people in that moment he thought of abandoning the ren the plan he thought of as his harvest despair was a powerful emotion it could undo the work of decades and it would here and now zilin knew unless he could find his way through it certainly he had known despair before zhang hua knew that he was subject to bouts of profound melancholy and knowing zilin as he did would put it down to a lack of family for he knew that zilin had no one then once again as he always did zilin remembered that it had been his silence that had brought him this far only he of all the old leaders still lived only he of all the old men of his youth still retained a grasp on the slippery reins of power nonaction is action he had been taught that long ago when he had learned how to play wet qi silence is a voice heard somewhere interpreted by someone without it he knew that his ren would never be on the verge of fruition he knew the personal rewards it would bring him as well as the lasting benefits for his country he could not allow anyone to stop him not even wu aiping ministers the premier intoned i greet you in the name of china and the revolution we are here today to discuss business that is both vital and difficult he cleared his throat shuffling papers in the interim shi long zhi he continued wu long zhi has asked for a formal hearing regarding your external policies in hong kong rather than reiterate what he has submitted to me i will ask him to address the issue himself slowly wu aiping unfolded himself from the chair he was tall for a chinese just under six feet he had the kind of odd extension of his rib cage that in this part of the world at least might be construed as a deformity his large eyes were like beacons flashing in the night he was the junior of the other two in the room by at least three decades but that did not decrease the forcefulness of his personality quite the contrary in fact since few in china would expect such intelligence from one of his age the public announcement of our compromise policysocalled by shi zilinwith the faangwailoh british regarding the future disposition of hong kong has been a source of great concern to me and the leading members of my academy as you are aware we were against capitulation to the foreign devil in any manner at all this socalled compromise smacks of the myopia of the manchu dynasties which allowed the invasion of the middle kingdoms sovereign territory in the first place it seems to me and to my colleagues as well that the longer we delay in taking over hong kong the more face we will lose and the more unlikely it is that we will succeed in our takeover bad enough to lose face to a civilized man but to do so to faangwailoh is intolerable comrade premier since you have allowed the formulation of hong kong policy to be dictated by shi zilin we have been giving nothing but mixed signals to the west the impending defection of mattias king and company is just the latest example i dont believe we can afford that kind of vacillation if we are to make hong kong our own again we must be allowed in there as quickly as possible to ensure that businesses will run smoothly as we move our troops in and make of it a special administrative control district in this the party chief and the minister of defense concur he produced sealed packets here are their signed statements the premier took time to read both documents at length his head lifted shi tong zhi with an effort zilin rose he had not wanted to bring his walking stick in here so he was obliged to grip the arms of the ebony chair with both hands comrade premier with all due respect to the minister wu long zhi knows nothing of policy inside hong kong he knows nothing of the mil lions of chinese there born and raised under the capitalist system he has no conception of the difficulties that await us in inculcating those millions should we decide to impose an entirely different social and economic structure on them we would be does that mean we may not turn hong kong into a part of china wu aiping had spun on zilin we are all dedicated to a certain way of life shi long zhi all of us there is no room for a compromise when it comes to hong kong that part of china was stolen from us by the barbarians they have it still to this day with all due respect zilin said hong kong is already ours nonsense wu aiping exploded it is a den of capitalist vice and corruption which provides us with millions each year funds we desperately need for heavy industry funds i might add that go in no small part to kam sang ideology shi tong zhi wu aiping hissed purity of purpose all this talk of money smacks of heresy and ideological backsliding you have opposed me in this just as you have obstinately refused to back the kam sang project iand many like mefind your views objectionable in the extreme his eyes blazed that is why i have petitioned the premier to have you dismissed from your post as the head of the hong kong policy unit huang xiao is more than qualified to replace you huang xiao zilin thought to himself is one of the qun comrade ministers the premier said there has been much turmoil of late within the government regarding these issues so much so that we have reached a dangerously divisive state wu tong zhi is correct i see a return to the days of when the manchu were in power feudal lords bickered among themselves the militant boxer tong rose on mighty wings to power previously unimaginable in the meantime the faangwailoh stole our land from us this cannot be allowed to happen again it has been decided although the work of shi tong zhi for the state over a span of many decades is admirable there are particulars in wu tong zhis petition worthy of merit therefore it has been decided that shi tong zhi will have a period of thirty days to resolve the problems inherent in the present hong kong policy at that time a second hearing will be convened on these premises if the present work of shi tong zhi is not deemed satisfactory or is proved in some manner deficient then huang xiao will be appointed in shi tong zhis place it is so ordered on his way out of the tai he dian zilin saw the smile of satisfaction on wu aipings face zilin could feel the noose tightening around his throat he knew he was under attack as surely as if wu aiping had lobbed a grenade under his desk at that moment zilin felt his age he wondered if his twin enemies time and the proximity of power had conspired at last to bring him down he had been so long with both wu aiping could be their agent perhaps my time has come he thought if so my ren my harvest was only the dream of a dying man the japan alps run almost directly through the middle of honshu island unlike the european alps whose current foliage was in large part dictated by glaciation during the ice age their asian counterparts were only slightly affected indeed their narrow vshaped gorges were sculpted by heavy rains and melting snow thus their exquisite heavy foliation rich in broadleafed deciduous trees such as oak and beech too the japan alps are a haven for a wide variety of species of flora as opposed to europes ice ageravaged alpine region the northernmost of the japan alps is the hida range to the south where its mountains abut the sea of japan is some of the most treacherous terrain in all of asia the range consists of twenty peaks six of them major averaging over ten thousand feet sacred tateyama is one of these it is bounded in the north by shiroumayama and by the immense fivepeaked massif of hotaka or highcrest a matterhornlike monster to the south tateyama too has many peaks one of them oyama is the home of an eighthcentury buddhist shrine another is known as tsurugi its eight sharply jutting peaks gave rise to its name the sword among japanese mountain climbers it is the origin of the phrase to climb the sword which is akin to crossing the rubicon on tsurugi it is said there is no turning back once you have begun today parts of the sword are accessible by car bus and even cable car it is still however a remote and many say an unfriendly place certainly none of the tourists who daily are driven up the single narrow tortuous road to the series of overlooks would contemplate staying overnight let alone building a residence there for this reason among others nichiren had decided to make tsurugi his retreat from the world which meant that it was his only true home it was to his stone cabin on the north face of the sword that he took mariana now he had chosen the site because it was away from the tourist routes it was also the most forbidding what glacial remnants still to be found in the upper reaches of the hida range were here winters brought swirling winds heavy snow and shrieking ice storms drifts could easily reach six or seven feet in january and february but the clear days were a pearlescent blue that could be matched nowhere in the world and when the sun struck the rugged pitched slopes of the sword the resulting rainbows off ice and snow made his heart soar wounded by the world nichiren periodically had to return here to heal to be made whole again in the summer it was a dream the oppressive weather that blanketed japan was left far below in valleys indistinct with heat and humidity the direct sun was extremely hot at this elevation but it was a clear piercing heat like the first step into a furo one felt cleansed by it and within the dappled shade of the stands of oak and beech the crisp coolness never left the slopes even in the middle of august nichiren had brewed tea he sat drinking it out of a rough clay mug as he sat on the edge of his houses engawa this traditional part of any japanese house was a loggialike porch it was just such a spot on which he used to play as a child only one stone step up from the outer garden the engawa served many purposes it was left open in the summer to catch the warm breezes that at lower elevations at least cooled the interior of the house in winter it was closed off from the elements thus increasing the houses floor space but it had a further more social function it was bad manners ever to let someone pass bythe mailman for instancewithout offering a cup of tea or a bite of sweet cake to lift the spirits to ask a casual acquaintance inside the house was to begin a long train of formalities that would both violate the privacy of the house and be wildly inappropriate the engawa then served as a middle ground or neutral territory where casual courtesies could be observed all these multiple layers of meaning passed through nichirens mind as he sat gazing out at the majestic mountains to the north occasionally he dipped a pair of chopsticks into a jar of homemade umeboshi soft pickled plums red from fermentation with the mintlike shiso leaves these he put on a bed of white rice to make hinomaru bento the risingsun lunch eating with quick sharp flicks of his chopsticks presently a second shadow crossed the polished wooden floor of the engawa mingling with his own he did not turn but said are you hungry i have lunch for you here im tired mariana maroc said she wore a kimono that nichiren had found for her inside the house because of her small size it fit her well it was in earth tones umber sienna rust the autumn equinox displayed through the superb weavers art on her feet were snowwhite tabi and dark wooden geta she moved and nichiren turned he watched her you are not clumsy he said you do not walk like a caucasian is that a compliment an observation only she came and sat down next to him carefully folding her kimono beneath her knees the bowls of rice and umeboshi the tea mugs were between them drink nichiren said softly you must be thirsty i want jake marianas pellucid beauty was marred now by the dark circles beneath her eyes as livid as bruises worry and lack of sleep had combined to defeat her natural loveliness nichiren pointed do you see that great peak to the north it is called shiroumayama white horse peak in winter it takes on an equine shape but that is not how it got its name early in may the snows along its slope retreat leaving what farmers below see as a horseshaped patch of rock each year when they see this natural seasonal clock they know it is time to plant their rice long ago they gave it the name mountain of the paddy horse you may not know that shiro has associated with it two kanji characters one means paddy field the other white some clerk somewhere long ago made a mistake and so we call it by a name it was never meant to have mariana shrugged as she took up her tea and sipped at it it seems easy enough to have it changed back nothing in life is easy nichiren put aside his bowl least of all attempting to correct ones mistakes mariana looked at him she had the sense that he was speaking about something else entirely she felt in him an odd kind of melancholy that sent a tiny shiver an undefined ache through her the kind one gets by hearing an owl hoot on a silver autumn night when will i be able to see jake she asked holding herself with her elbows there is danger all around nichiren said obliquely in the time she had been with him mariana had gotten used to this odd manner of his speech she had learned quite quickly that one could not cut through his tangents rather one had to learn to interpret them that was what you told me when you first contacted me in hong kong i told you the truth he said pouring more tea enemies are generated from the unlikeliest positions in wei qi as in life that is a difficult lesson to learn you showed good judgment in following my directions i simply had nothing to lose mariana held herself more tightly but jake must be out of his mind with worry perhaps that is not such a bad thing marianas head whipped around she glared at him putting into her eyes all the anger bewilderment and fear she had been feeling ever since his call had pinned her into this nightmare nichiren must have felt something because he stirred as if abruptly uncomfortable if you would use your mind instead of your emotions you would see the wisdom of my words he paused deliberately as if to allow her to come to her own conclusions if your husband does not know where you are then his enemies cannot either mariana was silent for a time it was impossible to refute his logic nichiren put his head back against the square wooden post one of six that ran the length of the engawa filtered light played upon the smooth planes of his face he was quite handsome mariana thought his was a proud face with lines somehow purer than any human face had a right to have i want to know something she said were you at the sumchun river when jake was there he sipped at his tea is that important it might be she said it might explain a lot of things i see he placed the cup between them if i said yes it would wrap it all up in a neat package you would have the easy answer to your problem nothing in life is easy she said meaning to mock him but somehow failing she was angry at his intransigence but he restrained her harsh tongue in some manner unfathomable to her she found herself wanting to understand him as if by this she would be better able to understand jake you have a good memory he said to go along with your good judgment why wont you tell me anything she said abruptly exasperated for the same reason adults dont tell their children everything they want to know im a child she flared thats how you see me if you continue to jump to conclusions he said reasonably i will not be able to speak with you at all in the silence the furin at the end of the engawa turned as the breeze took it its light tinkling showered them with sound words are only words he said after a time they can be believed or not what are you saying that you would not believe my answers to your questions why dont you try me i have no desire he said to be called a liar jake she thought what are you in the midst of to their right the furin moved again in the sudden wind its three slim metal bars coming together below the ellipse of the bell in a tinkling cascade that echoed softly all along the engawa and out into the garden in the stifling heat this ethereal chiming was a sound on which to concentrate its otherworldly presence was like a repeating mantra an escape from the debilitating lethargy all around them the furin sang its song of summer the air conditioner in the nissan was inadequate jakes suit jacket had long ago been laid out like an exhausted warrior along the back seat his shirt with open collar was dark with sweat stains under the arms down the front and back about midday already far north of tokyos urban sprawl he stopped at a roadside stand to eat a lunch of eel teriyaki the traditional summertime fare because it was stamina food he stretched his legs while he ate he was on a small thoroughfare lined with woodframe houses many of the doors were thrown open in an attempt to lessen the heat old men sat in their underwear along the engawa fanning themselves with slow automatic motions while their minds were engaged with games of go beneath a large boxwood where he stopped to be out of the intense sun the stirrings of the furin could be heard lacing the air with melody lightening the oppressive humidity as was the common custom he urinated into the bushes at the side of the road before climbing into the nissan the stop had done nothing for the temperature of the interior though he had been careful to park it in the shade it was stifling as he started up still heading north the japanese alps dominated the horizon ahead of him jake watched the countryside flash by in varying shades of green he felt a sudden lessening of the heat at the same moment the hues outside cooled down to a more subdued level clouds had come in behind him darkening the sky jake knew he was taking an awful chance if komotos information was false or old he would not find mariana if nichiren was in hiding somewhere else he would not find her here yet the more he thought about it the more logical this mountain retreat seemed for the situation it was isolated and therefore more easily defensible than any quarters in tokyo also after the raid on ohenro house it would be logical for nichiren to be wary of another such penetration he hoped he was right but he was aware too that his desperation was forcing him to make immediate choices that in more normal situations would have required some deliberation he was he knew all too well in the wrong terrain for this kind of spontaneous action thus the danger was acute the mountains rose up all around him now several times he was obliged to pull onto the verge horn sounding to race around the slower tour buses that were becoming more frequent as he headed into the hida range rains coming he thought turning down the howling air conditioner he was already several thousand feet up and there had been a palpable change in the humidity as well as the heat he opened the window gratefully despite the threat of a downpour cool air fanned his face and he felt immediately refreshed the first drops began potsupotsu jake thought it was said that the japanese were a tactile race their language more concerned with describing how things feel rather than how they smell or taste potsupotsu was one of those words meaning a few drops here and there jake knew that if it got bad he would have to stop this road was not made for travel in slick weather too many of the verges were far too near the cliff face he grunted squinting upward at the roiling cloudbank the sky had darkened considerably low and fulminating in a moment deep rumblings began shit he said with a crash he seemed to hit a wall of water the world turned graygreen and indistinct all around him he switched on the wipers at high speed zaazaa he said to himself its raining cats and dogs time to seek shelter several miles up he pulled into a small village apparently others on their way up had the same idea for the street was jammed with silver tour buses and cars parked or idling in the midst of the downpour jake pulled into a space between a toyota and a sleek mercedes he cut the engine and rolled up his window enough so that he would not get drenched summertime he thought glancing skyward how i used to love it as a kid now its different he shrugged resignedly well its not a season for adults he watched disinterestedly as the door of the mercedes swung open and beneath an elegant blue and green striped umbrella a young blond woman in a white sleeveless blouse and navy linen skirt herded a sixyearold girl made in her image across the pelted street and into a tea shop its windows steamy with humidity thunder rolled again crossing from left to right like writing across a page two cars down from the parked mercedes four men got out of their rented subaru they were large and it appeared that they needed to stretch their legs they passed a cheap black nylon umbrella from one to another as they did leg stretches knee bends twists and the like they could have been mountain climbers or jake felt the tension come into his frame he wiped away the mist that clung to the interior surface of the windshield like fog he started the engine the wipers came on at once clearing the windshield further now he was certain and his heart beat fast he had recognized one of the men getting back into the blue subaru they were all back in the car now the rain was lessening and it began to back out of its space kgb first chief directorate kvr for hours now they had heard the deep basso rumblings of the thunder emanating from the deep blue swirling clouds below their eyrie the storm filled up the crevasses and valleys like a surging tide obscuring all but the alps upper peaks nichiren had gone inside to work on the three games of wet qi he had set up they were all in complex middle stages and after a few moments of superficial study mariana had abandoned any idea she might have had of working out the vectors of attack and defense besides the boards and pieces reminded her of jake she returned to the engawa though the air was cooler now and in the long oblique bars of shade even chilly the crimson sun seemed impaled on one of tsurugis bloodstained spires she stood leaning against one of the wooden pillars staring down into the murk of the storm at length she realized it was rising up from the valley floor along the ridged sides of the peak soon they would be engulfed in rain the nissan slewed around a corkscrew turn and began its slide outward toward the void beyond the rock face that shot down to the floor of the valley six thousand feet below steering into the slide jake began to finesse the car back onto the pavement he kept very still not wanting to add his shifting weight to the forces already in play back on the road he floored the accelerator muscling the nissan upward in heavy weather like this he knew there were likely to be mudslides falling rock at the very least the shoulders would begin to crumble away he had lost some time and now could not see the subaru hastening up the mountain the storm seemed to be following him reintensifying as it rose up tsurugis face premature night had settled in its embrace heavy and cloying hissing rain beat down defeating even the wildly arcing wipers at least he knew they could not pull over there was only one road to the series of lookouts he could not lose them the car screeched around another hairpin turn his stomach wrenching with the centrifugal force in this weather he knew they would not see him even if they suspected they were being followed he cursed as he nearly spun out again weathers getting worse he was almost talking to himself he leaned over turning on the heater and the defroster to help clear the windshield rains on its way up mariana stood in the open doorway looking in at nichiren who was bent over the middle board he took a black stone settled on the move he placed it down removed a white piece from the board then he looked at her storms have a way of gaining in intensity this far up he said but dont worry well be safe enough here mariana laughed softly she was not immune to the irony of his reassuring her about a storm after what she had been through a storm could not kill her even as a child i loved lightning she said my father would often have to come and get me out of the fields in the middle of a storm if i had not yet seen the flash for which i had been waiting i would cry my brother always said i was a brave child you were attuned to nature more than he nichiren said in such a neutral tone that mariana did not know whether she had been complimented or rebuked nichiren she said he watched her as carefully as if she were a doe in a forest glade the silence stretched itself and still she said nothing he did not prompt her she changed her mind several times before she said perhaps its time to leave he shook his head and her heart sank i cannot bear this enforced isolation anymore i cannot bear to think of what jake is going through her eyes beseeched him i want to be with him dont you understand his head swung away into the shadows of the room but not before she caught a glimpse of his eyes a curtain had fallen as heavy and secure as lead what is he thinking she asked herself if you leave here now you will surely perish she could not see his mouth moving there was so much darkness within the house her agitated mind was snagged on the spike of one phrase i dont understand why is my life important to you i am the wife of your enemy i have my instructions he knelt on the tatami shadows poured across him he looked toward the doorway saw her small figure outlined in kimono and geta with some astonishment he realized that his resentment had faded outside she might be jake marocs wife but this was tsurugi and here she was something else he did not know what instructions she echoed perhaps you are not a man after all perhaps you are only a marionette when someone pulls your strings you jump she regarded him levelly in school in biology class i was once given a frog it was dead but i was taught that when i poked it with a sharp instrument i could make its muscles work thats you a dead frog words he said returning his gaze to the game board words mean nothing actions are everything he played a move you play this game jake plays it as well i cannot understand why life is to be lived not to play games with you cannot move people around in the same way you place these black and white stones on the board life just doesnt work that way nichiren looked up but that is precisely what someone is doing your death the capture of the fu that was how they were planned and didnt work because of a judicious countermove mariana was becoming claustrophobic just what is jakes fu in ancient china nichiren said the emperor created a fu to his specifications it was carved out of jade or ivory in the design of his choosing often more than one would be made the fu was a royal seal imparting to a great extent all of the emperors power he gave them to his most trusted ministers so that they became his arms thus his power was extended tenthousandfold and jakes fu all fu are created in power those who wield them are given the power i assume it is the same with this fu assume then you dont actually know how could i he said turning away i am a dead frog stallings had picked jake up in tokyo toshima m it was the logical place to start it was where ohenro house was where the confluence of the kisan and the komoto yakuza clans territories created violent eddies where nichiren was most protected and most powerful while in japan jakes presence had startled stallings somewhat as far as he had known jake was still in a kowloon hospital yet it had made sense to him to find him here though it was the biggest break stallings could have hoped for it had also presented a problem stallings did not make the mistake of underestimating jakes abilities and he had wondered how long it would take jake to tumble to him it had been a source of worry that jake had not become aware of him until he thought about the crushing pressure the other man must be working under to have his wife disappear perhaps with his enemy was a burden stallings was grateful to observe from afar it was a curious feeling for him to be on the other side of the field from jake maroc it disturbed him more it frightened him but he felt the fear was a healthy emotion his fear would protect him from making a mistake when it came to jake and he was grateful for it he had had a bad moment when jake stopped in town it was so crowded that he had had to park in a spot that gave him only a partial view of the nissans rear but it had been enough for him to see jake pull out now as he followed jakes nissan into the alps he grinned with the sheer exhilaration of the moment he manhandled the car slewing it around a sharp turn he was driving without headlights it would have been safer to use them but he could not afford that luxury jakes nissan was being driven at erratic speeds for long stretches of time it was out of his sight because of the roads many switchbacks he knew that if jake slowed through one of the blind spots his own headlights would glare in jakes rearview mirror he might as well send him a warning signal the narrow road the slick tarmac the soft shoulders the increasing possibility of a mudslide the poor visibility all combined to bring out his skills his grin widened it was all he thought about that and the kill outside it had gone quite silent in the interstices between thunder rolls the wind had died in deference to the swiftly oncoming lowpressure system i asked shhh the harsh sibilant sound checked her she saw him silently uncoil like some lethal animal in an instant he was standing by her side she watched his eyes which seemed focused on the middle distance after a time she realized that he was listening intently sometimes he whispered the rocks carry the oddest soft sounds upward i can hear animals foraging as much as a thousand feet below or birds crying she was certain these were not what he was listening for now what is it a car he said moving out into the deepening twilight i hear a car where there should be no car as soon as he had pulled in jake jumped out of the nissan the downpour drenched him immediately he scrambled up the rocky scree to where the subaru sat at the very lip of the last and highest outlook it was deserted theyve gone up jake thought its the only direction possible this far up there were still patches of icy snow now beginning to break up with the soaking rain ousting wind howled all around him it flung sleet into his face the temperature had plummeted and his soaked shirt clung to his goosefleshed skin in icy sheets often he was obliged to grasp the bases of tree trunks as the wet weather undermined the icy crust of the mountainside he was not dressed for this kind of work and this made the going even slower jake was now desperate if mariana was with nichiren then the kgb team would find her he could not be concerned as yet with the question of why the kgb would want nichiren dead mariana was all he thought about he scrambled upward his clothes shredding along the way as he stumbled and fell layered shale crumbled beneath his scrabbling soles tumbling down the mountainside with a clatter silenced by the ferocity of the storm eventually he reached a kind of plateau and stopped so abruptly that he was almost pitched headlong into the void this strenuous exercise combined with his anxiety over marianas safety to weaken him he was not yet over his bout in the hospital he took several deep breaths as he began to climb again skirting a shallow glen to the left here the mountain wall was not so steep and seemed to be composed of firmer rock so that he had little trouble negotiating the humped incline it was quite a bit darker now but lightning had begun to flicker illuminating the landscape for seconds at a time with the incendiary light of a dragons fiery exhalation jakes head was pounding and his shoulder had begun to pain him with short sharp jolts like surges from an open electric line he kept his breathing deep even though he felt a disconcerting tendency to pant in rapid shallow spurts this frightened him more than anything else in this rapidly deteriorating situation because it meant that he could not fully depend on his body he knew that if he did not have control of that he was surely lost and so was mariana dont think about such things he berated himself but as he felt the fire in his chest as he continued to fight the urge to bark out his breaths in order to suck in more oxygen he began to lose faith in himself im too old he thought ten years ago or even five that stint in the hospital would have meant very little but now dont think he told himself fiercely just get yourself up there where the long gun rests go on dont look up just concentrate on the next step and the next thats right keep going old man old man old man old man and with this goad like a litany in his head releasing all the anger and pride in himself he gathered his reserves of energy and struggled up the remaining feet of the rocky cliff jake threw himself over the last outcropping rolling in the sleet and freezing rain along what seemed to be an endless meadow he kept himself low and squinted into the gloom searching for shadows and found the russians sooty wraiths crouching within a clump of foliage just afoot back from the lip of the meadow which at that point fell away into the canyon far below at an almost vertical drop already chilled to the bone he snaked his way toward them on his belly and knees he used his elbows to drag himself forward without raising his body up at all the grass here was thick but certainly not tall enough to hide him completely he was within a hundred feet of them when he heard a series of shots he jerked his head to the right and dimly saw across the chasm to the other escarpment the outlines of a house a figure running through the grass beyond the chasm who was it the sleet made identification impossible he rose up then a gun spoke with a report like the rolling thunder hanging suspended far above nichiren had pushed her back inside the house with a calculated admonition to stay there under all circumstances mariana had watched him steal through the garden and into the meadow that led to the edge of the deeply veed chasm three hundred yards away she strained to follow his route as he began to fade into the sleeting evening moving cautiously out to the edge of the engawa to keep track of him until the very last instant when she was totally alone she turned and following his direction went back inside bolting the front door she stood in the center of the room shivering alone with the three unfinished wei qi games for some reason now she wanted desperately to understand the game jake had told her that a players strategy in the game was the same as his strategy in life she circled the boards slowly narrowing her concentration thus the fusillade of shots that slammed through the wood of the back door caused her to jump violently and cry out her mind numbed with terror blanked out entirely allowing the animal organism to take over to protect itself it ran with a harsh shout of anxiety mariana ripped off the bolt on the front door threw it back so violently that it rattled on its track she stumbled in her geta and moaning in frustration kicked them off in tabied feet she ran out into the storm her blind instincts taking her on the same course she had seen nichiren use minutes before the kgb stalkers catching sight of her followed along behind with cool unhurried steps guns in their right hands hanging loosely down at their sides across the chasm the storm was still making a great deal of noise but even had it been a silent evening they would not have heard jakes approach fear and the adrenaline running through him caused him to grin his lips pulled back as if in a terrible rictus he reached them where they knelt at the crest of the ridge the heavyset man nearest him turned just as jake went into irimi nage the entering throw they crashed together the russian towered over him gaining false confidence in his illusory position of strength jake moved into the others rush instead of resisting it this motion of evasion metamorphosed smoothly into one of centralization in which irimi nage began to control the adversarys energy transferring its force to jake the full weight of the russians two hundredplus pounds was against jake who following the dictates of the maneuver used the energy thus transferred to him like a wave dipping his upper body down and then rising with the increased energy flow locking his right arm beneath the left of the russian this rising up put the russian off balance and his upper torso began to bend backward against the inviolable force of jakes strength combined with his own energy turned upon him now at the apex of his upward thrust jake kept his torso erect but swiftly bent his knees lifting and uncoiling in a blur like an arrow shot from a bow the russian had no balance left his legs still drove forward in a momentum that was now false as jake bent his upper body painfully backward as he collapsed horizontal to the ground jake delivered a vicious liver kite to the unprotected area and the russian did not rise when he struck the ground with a heavy thump jake whirled groaning with pain his left hand arcing upward and across in a bowstring strike that swept the second russians aimed weapon from him he grabbed the others still extended right hand with both of his at the same time he stepped backward with his left leg leading the russian toward him in a circular motion the russian recovering his wits drew back his left fist to deliver a blow to jakes head as he passed close to him but jakes left hand had dropped away from his hold and now he lifted it at the last instant blocking the heavy strike while the russian was thus occupied jake jerked smartly down on the others right arm and using his right leg as a fulcrum stepped forward with his left leg beginning a reverse spin that pitched the russian forward swinging quickly around jake chopped heavily at the exposed neck and the russian stumbled as if over a stone he slammed facefirst into the rockstrewn grass jake was already up and running toward the smeary gray outline of another figure crouched at the edge of the ridge nichiren felt a presence behind him he was concentrating so heavily on the figures several hundred yards away across the expanse of the hazy canyon that it took him some extra time to believe what his senses were telling him he was very close to the verge of the cliff face having spent some considerable time working his way through the underbrush that curled like hair along the edge he had not found the russians and he had just made the decision to back away toward the cover of a long stand of cedar when he heard the shots he wanted desperately to return to the house but he was caught in this trap any overt movement on his part would put him squarely in their sights he was in the process of moving slowly back from the edge mariana changed all that her terrified charge out toward him caused him to rise up involuntarily because of his intense concentration he had not sensed her until she was quite near him now he feared that she had lost all sense of where she was on the escarpment and in her frenzy would hurl herself into the abyss before she could stop herself he saw them then two bears coming after her in the standard semicrouch they were armed one carried what appeared to be a longbore assassins rifle there was very little time nichiren threw two shuriken small steel blades and the russians went down one two like cardboard soldiers in a shooting gallery he turned and ran after mariana she was far ahead twisting through the underbrush now and again lurid lightning illuminated her headlong flight nichiren was faster than she and he knew the terrain he made up the distance between them with astonishing rapidity he was very near now and he knew he would be able to get to her in that instant he heard the charged explosion of the rifle andit seemed to him laterin the exact same instant saw mariana hurled sideways crashing into the heavy thicket of beech trees and underbrush at her side buddha he thought the shot came from across the chasm sleet had turned pink the frozen rain on the breast of marianas kimono was running in red rivulets nichiren saw where she had been hit and his eyes closed briefly there was a flutter at the side of her neck her eyes opened fixing him with their intensity marianasan it was the first time he had spoken her name she opened her lips to say something but at that moment earth turned to mud by the storm gave way beneath their weight instinctively nichiren lifted an arm curling fingers around the bole of a pale beech mariana had fallen to a stone outcropping no more than six feet below him with his free hand he strained forward for her she thrust something into his fingers he stared at her those eyes their depths revealed to him her spirit a color dancing in the gloom the ferociousness of her emotion fluttered his core like a leaf he reached for her knowing that he did not want her to die no jake cried in a frenzy he leapt upon stallings wrenching the weapon from his slickened hands he tried to drive the open steel stock into the arched throat in order to crush the larynx and the cricoid cartilage at once but he felt as if he had been beaten for a week with a billy club his mind was fuzzy his reflexes nonexistent stallings butted him then followed it up with a vicious rabbit punch that sent jake to his knees mud filled his eyes he made a blind grab for his adversary stallings who had no time for this swept up his rifle and loped down along the moldering scree christ he thought what a mess what the fuck are the russians doing here anyway but there was no one to answer his question and anyway he had completed his mission this was no time for problemsolving he knew jake would be up in a moment and he had no desire to tangle with the man again with a sharp intake of breath he started down the slope into the glen in a moment he had disappeared into the sleety rain jake coughed and spat flecks of blood he was panting and dizzy there was a ringing in his ears a wounded animal he fell back against the bole of a tree when he had recovered sufficiently he rose up scrambling forward toward the edge of the escarpment he heard a roar saw part of the far mountain wall give way the storm was lessening now and visibility was grudgingly returning he saw the woman in the stained kimono tumbling in a tangle of arms and legs six feet down she hit an outcropping and lay faceup in the freezing rain arms outflung as if embracing the storm jakes heart lurched painfully in his chest and his bowels turned to water mariana how he wished now that komotos information had been wrong he saw her bloody slowly losing consciousness pinned to the rock face dying for his sins his omissions his selfishness all the days since he had returned from the sumchun river pressed back down on him all the time they could have spent together and had not all the love they could have shared and had not all the life she had offered him that he had not taken he had ceased to love her at the moment he had ceased to like himself it had begun at the sumchun river and it was ending here mariana was dying and he was impotent to help her separated from her by an abyss as he had been for the last three years he was not close to her but someone else was who he saw a hand reach out toward her to push her over the last brink he saw her slip a little bit further toward the void if only she would look up and see him then he heard a sound as of a great wind rushing mariana his scream echoed into the diminishing storm falling away into the abyss marianas body followed it into the deepening gloom no more than a mote in the air suspended on the rushing winds jake lifted his tearstreaked face from the awful empty space yawning below him his clawed fingers dug into the earth turned to mud he slipped a bit as he focused on the second figure climbing like an ape from an outthrust beech the figure stopped in its journey to safety and their eyes locked across the eternity of the chasm between them jake and nichiren suzhou shanghai summerautumn o summer spring in precisely five years before shi zilin was born the chinese sued for peace with the fanatic superbly disciplined japanese forces as set forth in the treaty of shimonoseki japan gained possession of the island of formosa and freedom for korea in breaking up the solidity of the chinese empire japan had emerged from war as a powerful nation one with which the whole world was now forced to contend if through the intervention of russia germany and france japan did not retain her hardfought foothold on the liaodong peninsula not so very distant from beijing itself still they perhaps gained something more important a key clause of the treaty allowed the japanese to establish industries along the china coast at the designated treaty port cities even the usually astute english tai pan who had set up immensely profitable companies in shanghai had not thought of such a thing the tai pan were in the business of trading buying goods from the vast interior of the asian continent passing them on to the rest of the waiting world while taking their chunk of the profits factories in shanghai it was a fantastic concept for at that time save for a few foreignowned silk shops industry was totally unknown in the international settlement sanctioned by the mostfavored nation clause of britains own treaty with china signed in the tai pan of shanghai rode on the coattails of the canny japanese turning to industrialization with enormous zeal thus the japanese were highly significant in chinas history just as they were to be in zilins life though he and his two brothers had been born in suzhou he had migrated to shanghai by the time he was in his teens always suzhou was in his memory however it was a city of the most spectacular gardens he had been born near one of the most famous of these and had been named after it the forest of lions nowadays of course these gardens all belonged to the public but in shi zilins younger years they had all been privately built maintained and enjoyed they were owned then by mandarins who had retired from the stressful conflicts surrounding court life to the north or were simply rich local officials in either case they had bought plots of land in suzhou and had proceeded to build their gardens these yuan lin were naturally much more than gardens they were villas but there were villas of this sort scattered throughout the country what distinguished the villas of suzhou were the yuan the gardens the gardens were made for contemplation rather than for show the same buddhist tenets that found their way across the south china sea to japan in the formulation of the zen gardens there were already at work here the garden that shi zilin remembered best was at the end of a shaded narrow lane barely wide enough for two people to pass one another one entered through a wooden door set into a stone wall that ran entirely around the yuan lin truly great yuan were rare the jian of such a one was required to be architect poet painter sculptor all in one such men even in china were scarce indeed throughout the ages the term jian had had many meanings in other times it could have meant general of the army grand champion of wei qi celestial guardian in this period of chinas history it meant creator the object of the yuan was to establish as many varying perspectives as one could within the boundaries of a severely confined space this particular yuan seemed at first dominated by a ting a summer pavilion of exquisitely delicate beauty near its westernmost edge it was zilin had once thought like a tender young girl caught in contemplation and like a natural and therefore imperfect reflecting surface such as a lake it revealed more of the underlying spirit of the subject than ever a manmade mirror could but as one spent more time in this yuan one began to see the ting not as an isolated element but as one of many ways of experiencing the profound peace of this place zilin had often heard the refrain shang you tian tang xia you su hang in heaven there is paradise on earth suzhou and hangzhou not far from the summer pavilion was a gently sloping hillock from which one gained anotherand entirely differentperspective of the yuan originally zilin had thought the jian incredibly fortunate to have found a piece of property with such a feature since suzhou was set in the middle of a plain and was otherwise entirely flat only later did he come to understand that the hillock was artificial stones had been dragged here then covered with soil and vegetation to give a perfectly natural appearance these surprises were part of the yuans charm as well as part of his growingup process hu shi were another such these stones from the lake so pleasing because of the natural erosion that had pocked and scarred their surfaces softening them were also not what they had seemed they had been placed at the bottom of lake tai hu by the jians own hand when he was a young man for many long hours zilin would sit by the small pool surrounded by stands of dwarf bamboo and miniature lemon trees in the tranquility of the spotted carp that swam lazily therein he began to see through the artifices of the world to its sacred inner heart here though he was not to know it for many years to come his philosophy of life as well as his future business acumen were formed had the jian of the yuan known that such a process had sprung from his own creation his joy would have known no bounds as it was it would be altogether fair to say that he had at least an inkling of the changes beginning in the young zilin certainly he knew of the boys specialness one hot afternoon in the torpor of summer he stepped from the shade of his ting and walked in dappled sunlight to where zilin sat by the side of the carp pool the cicadas were singing their shrill song in hard sharp bursts stunned by the stifling heat birds clung to branches even the high fleecy clouds were unmoving in the white sky the jian crossed over the crimsonlacquered bridge he had painstakingly constructed by hand went across the islet on which he had set the pool in the distance now slightly hazy in the heat he could make out the line of hua chuang these polygonal lattice windows were his pride made of earthenware dried fired then carefully whitewashed each had taken him nine months to produce each was as dear to him as a child perhaps this was because he had no progeny of his own his wife having died in unsuccessful childbirth many years ago he had never remarried everyone who comes here now he said believes the yuan is entirely natural in years gone by when i would attempt to explain my art i found the reactions not to my liking he smiled at the openness of the boys upraised face all preferred to believe in the perfection of nature he took zilins small hand in his except you of course his face screwed up why do you suppose that is hm zilin thought for a time he watched the carps sinuous movement through the murky waters and wished that he had their facility in moving through life perhaps elder uncle he said using the honorific it is because i prefer to believe in the perfection of the human mind for a long time then the jian continued to stare at him the boy spoke more like an elder scholar than did many of the elder scholars of the jians acquaintance i think he said finally that you will find perfection an eternally elusive commodity in this world younger brother zilin lifted a hand but is this yuan not perfect elder uncle the jian smiled to you perhaps younger brother he squeezed the boys hand and that pleases me greatly he shook his head but as for me i have been around far longer than your ten years it is possible therefore that we have differing ideas of what perfection may be then you are not happy here the jian smiled again happy yes younger brother but not content there is a vast difference between the two he let go zilins hand and picking up a smooth pebble dropped it into the pool the carp moved as they did at feeding time then finding no food returned to their laze you may find after some time that life is a continual seeking a seeking after perfection zilin wanted to know well perhaps for some yes others understand that perfection is not of this world and is therefore impossible to attain should that stop you from trying elder uncle i dont believe so no he lifted a finger but there are somemuch like myself i imaginewho do not wish to find perfection why not because only in a state of contention can life exist i sometimes think that death is the only state of perfection of which we are all capable what of the buddha then i am not the buddha the jian said thoughtfully and neither younger brother are you he seemed sad now as if darkness were falling over him like the mantle of night you will make mistakes as you grow up everyone does but always you must remember to go on and to learn from your mistakes you are a fool only if you repeat them not if you make them the sun baked them for the rest of the afternoon neither spoke again for those long hours each preferring the silent contemplation for which this special yuan was built summer edged into autumn and soon school studies occupied all of zilins waking moments too there were rumors within the family that they were moving south in the winter perhaps all the way to shanghai when he next had a chance to come down the narrow shaded lane zilin found the wooden door to the yuan locked this was most unusual and with a beating heart he ran all the way around the walled villa to its front entrance a strange man opened the door in response to zilins knock he was dressed in the robes of a priest of the local monastery yes pardon me elder uncle zilin said trying to peer around his bulk but i am looking for the jian of this villa the priest smiled but you are looking at him zilin was stunned i dont understand i used to come here all the time i oh you must mean the previous owner previous the priest nodded he was a rather ferocious gambler i understand he lost this yuan iin in a game of fan tan subsequently it was purchased by the monastery he stepped back into the doorway but you will still be welcome here younger brother he smiled slyly perhaps there is more learning for you here than there is in school zilin was appalled but the jian he said plaintively where is he the priest shrugged i have no idea his round face broke into a smile again now shall we come inside there are always lessons to be learned but zilin was already running down the dusty road a dog barking at his heels though he had made every effort he had never been able to find the jian perhaps it was just as well the jian belonged within his yuan and zilin preferred to envision him there amid his bamboo and lemon trees his irises and oleander he had the long lean face of a sage but always there was brown earth beneath his nails embedded through his constant pruning the knees of his trousers were always wet with soil as a child zilin had despaired that he had not taken something tangible even something as small as the smooth stone the jian had dropped in the pool that steaming august afternoonaway with him as a remembrance now he was glad that he had not what the jian had planted within the yuan was meant to stay there besides he had brought away with him something far more valuable than a childs trinket of the past he had his ideas spawned by the yuans very concept these ideas had made shi zilin into a very rich man in his yuan the jian had skillfully used artifice to create something more powerful and more lasting than illusion that was what most people had failed to see that was why they had been so disappointed when he had revealed his secrets now they saw only illusion but zilin had seen the truth the jians artifice had created moods and feelings those who entered the yuan ignorant of its secrets were moved and thus changed the young zilin grew to understand that he could apply the same skillful methodology to his entire life if one gave people what they wanted he had decided it did not matter one whit if it was all artifice left to their own devices people believed what would benefit them the most all this thought stood him in good stead when it came time for him to leave suzhou shanghai was perhaps the most fortuitously situated city in all of china it was the only major port in central china that was not cut off from the interior by mountains further it was the natural seaward outlet and thus the gateway to the lush yangzi basin one of the richest regions on the entire continent it was fortuitous too that zilins father a brilliant industrial engineer had been promoted out of suzhou and transferred to the one place where his skills would be most efficaciously utilized shanghai until the treaty of shimonoseki the demand for industrial engineers was necessarily limited and perhaps one could say that zilins facility for being ahead of his time was something of a hereditary trait in any case the economic revolution the japanese had begun in the city in enabled the shis to journey from the tranquility of suzhous relative backwater to the bustling modernized eastern metropolis already chinas most populous city besides more money and prestige for his father shanghai provided excellent schooling for zilin and his brothers he and his youngest brother attended futan university while the middle brother preferred the shanghai university of science and technology zilins horizons were greatly expanded he learned english his friends became many he was exposed to foreign devils and to the opinions not only of his elders but importantly of his peers none of this information however superseded that which he had gathered in the jians yuan rather it reinforced it the chinese did not rule all of china and had not done so for some time to zilin the opinions of his peers regarding the intrusion of the foreign devils were as useless as those of his elders the older men believed in a kind of confucian patience the middle kingdom belonged to the chinese they believed and eventually chinese would again hold sway throughout the country in the meantime they counseled tolerance when it came to dealing with foreigners on the other hand zilins contemporaries were almost universally militant preferring to strike back at the foreign devil in revenge for humiliations both real and imagined privately zilin saw them all as myopic fools he had another idea entirely the jian had taught him to contemplate mistakes rather than to dwell on themto use them in effect as history lessons and as he grew and gained in knowledge that was precisely what zilin did with the recent history of his people what struck him immediately was that the chinese had through their own weaknesses lost control of their country to the foreign devil the westerners had been clever enough to take advantage of every internal rift within the factionalized chinese political system and thus bend the chinese like a willow to suit their own needs in the middle of the eighteenth century the empire was experiencing almost unprecedented prosperity the population had ballooned by approximately million within the space of fortyodd years agricultural reforms were instituted and new crops such as maize and tobacco were introduced both state and individual business began to employ enormous numbers of salaried workers in silk metalwork pottery and the like but along with prosperity came the desire to expand and this the empire did waging war in the southwest against the burmese and in central asia against the eleuths wars for underindustrialized nations such as chinaeven successful ones as these werecan often produce more negative results than positive ones in this case the power of the ruling manchus was severely weakened and in response opponents to their regime grew in strength feeding off the manchus weakness the secret societies were rising now china had more than internal strife with which to contend the tsars of russia had but recently invaded siberia to the south england had founded the empire of india and the dutch had formed the netherlands east indies both areas longtime havens for emigrants fleeing the poverty of the chinese provinces of fujian and guangdong were now due to the recent population explosion inundated with chinese through these emigrants and via other sources chinas new neighbors were well aware of its plight and they sat poised to take advantage of the cracks beginning to break apart the manchu dominance the english who by had been in canton for quite some time were busy illegally exporting opium the profits from which helped to balance their heavy trade deficit that year a mandarin by the name of lin zexu decided to make an example of the foreign devil by so doing he hoped to shore up the manchus swiftly eroding hold on the country the english who were well acquainted with war wasted no time in retaliating western gunboats sailed up the xijiang leveling chinese forts at its mouth by june of the english had taken shanghai and nanking the ensuing treaty opened five strategic ports to english trade and perhaps more importantly ceded them hong kong it was at this point in their history that in zilins opinion the government should have asked the foreign devils to keep their forces in china proper to help return political stability to the country the manchus could have used the british then just as the british had used them but the court had never paid much attention to foreigners and there seemed no good reason to do so now it was far too busy handling the moslem uprisings that broke out in yunnan and turkestan near the end of the decade soon it had an even more serious threat to its existence with which to deal a chinese faction known as the tai ping was rapidly gaining power so well led were they that soon they had taken over guangxi province and by the violence had spread into hankou just a year later the tai ping leader hong xiuquan declared nanking the capital of the tai ping tian guo the heavenly kingdom of great peace he began to issue edicts and soon was leading his army north to take beijing while the manchus were thus occupied the british and the french having already decided to expand their lines of trade in china used the countrys inner turmoil to mount another military campaign the court in beijing had just time enough to repel the tai ping when they found themselves face to face with the loaded guns of the foreign devil in the south the tai ping were massing once again in october of the british and french troops marched on beijing still the chinese did not fully comprehend the european threat thus the foreign devils forces were ordered to sack the summer palaces a friend of zilins was there and related to him later what occurred moment by moment the most valuable art objects and pieces of highly wrought furniture were methodically set aside to be shipped at some later date it was subsequently learned to queen victoria and napoleon iii that done the soldiers were let loose to plunder the rest at will but the looting got somewhat out of control and in order to stem the madness the english officers ordered the buildings torched after that the court had no choice but to accede to the foreign devils demands it had been brought home to them at last that their sacred capital so far to the north away from whatever was occurring in hong kong shanghai and canton was just as vulnerable to attack as its southern cities the treaty of peking called for eleven new ports to be opened for foreign trade in addition foreign residents were granted certain privileges such as the right to organize concessions freedom for missionaries and extraterritorial rights in return the europeans used their own military might to join with the governments in defeating the tai ping revolt by july nanking was once again back in manchu hands but the governments hold on its country was severely weakened again zilin was convinced the manchus were guilty of not understanding their foe had they planted a sufficient number of spies within the tai ping they would have found the faction riddled with internecine rivalries after its defeat at the gates of beijing they would have seen that they had no need of the foreign soldiers now sun tzu has written that one who confronts his enemy yet who because of the arrogance of exalted rank and honors or for a few hundred pieces of gold fails to employ secret agents is no general and no master of victory the manchus were obviously no students of sun tzu meanwhile the court became concerned with the progress the french were making into another neighboring country annam war erupted in chinas southwest provinces in two years later the french were granted trade rights in two towns on that frontier now the dissection of a oncegreat country was all but complete increasingly the europeans were controlling the countrys customs they now had land on lease and their concessions won at beijing included the building of railway lines throughout china the last step was for the country to be carved into spheres of influence this was done just before the turn of the century the russians got the north the germans shandong the british the yangzi valley the french the southwest but the yi he tuan the most powerful and xenophobic of the chinese secret societies was on the rise the westerners called them boxers their revolt in beijing on the eve of the turn of the century led to foreign powers for the first time occupying the imperial palace that in turn led to the revolution eleven years later and the founding of the republic of china zilins views differed markedly from those of his peers he was neither xenophobic nor complaisant when it came to the foreign devil for he saw their presence in his homeland as perhaps no other chinese did there were ways in which the europeans could be used just as they had used the chinese zilin had learned that in the jians yuan where the ultimate power of artifice was brought home to him why he thought should i wish to be rid of them when they can be so useful to me and to my country after the boxer rebellion had been put down europeans in china experienced a period of unprecedented prosperity but in everything changed irrevocably the japanese victory over the russian empire was like the tolling of a great temple bell its reverberations were heard in china giving new spirit and determination to the revolutionaries there the chief of these was sun zhongshan whom westerners came to know as dr sun yatsen he was born in canton and had the support of the southern chinese bourgeoisie but far more importantly he had the backing of chinese students who had been educated in the west and of the expatriate chinese who were rich enough to fund him and the association he founded the tong meng hui and then his party the guomindang sun zhongshan was clever and he utilized every blunder of the government every discontent of the common man to his and his partys advantage thus the guomindangs power waxed as the manchus in beijing waned when the qing empress cixi died in the government could not have been in poorer shape no adult qing existed to whom she could pass the reins of power instead she designated the twoyearold puyi as her successor it was inevitable that such an illconceived notion should throw the court into the most intensive bout of infighting it had seen in more than a century supporters of the regent the tiny puyis father contested bitterly with those of the courts most powerful general yuan shikai in august the government such as it was decided to nationalize the railways it was a direct blow aimed at the hierarchy of chinese capitalists like a shot from a pistol the move was a signal for revolt so widespread and virulent were the uprisings that the court was forced to appeal to general yuan shikai for support but the general scenting the changing winds of fortune preferred to side with the revolutionaries he knew whereof he spoke for in december of that year a delegation of officials from all the farflung provinces met to elect sun zhongshan president but just over thirty days later he willingly gave way to the general he was seemingly proved correct for yuan shikai was able to effect the abdication of the last of the qing emperors just one month later for this deed he was appointed temporary president of the new republic but then the good general betrayed the revolution the fantastic lure of ascending the emperors throne himself and founding a new dynastic line proved too much for him to resist he dissolved the guomindang and the parliament that had been formed in early yet renewed internal strife ultimately denied his ascendancy and in he died still nothing more than a coarse military man a paper government was formed in beijing again warring factions kept it from being of much use or strength several times sun zhongshan tried to form what he called a national government in canton finally he was able to stabilize guangdong province winning it over to his cause all this served as a backdrop to zilins love affair with the wild mai that night july as the westerners reckoned it he met her in shanghai amidst the heat and high emotion of the first true rumblings of the revolution that was not to be realized until eighteen years later at that meeting the chinese communist party was founded but even the fact that history was being made all around him did not dim zilins burning image of her so near yet so far away from him in the audience he fell madly in love with this uncharacteristically wildspirited revolutionary woman she was very young not yet twenty and an orphanwhich zilin always felt had accounted for her decidedly unfeminine attitudes but instead of shunning her as most other males within the party did zilinat the meeting more out of curiosity than any real revolutionary spiritfound himself drawn to her he was twentyone and in almost all ways more worldly than she but he had lived a highly cultured rather upperclass life she had not and perhaps her ability to live by her own wits formed much of the bond between them she knew of artifice herself that night even zilin did not suspect the true role the communists were to play in the future of his country but his uncanny nose for history had led him here and although at the time he was more smitten by mai than he was by the spirit of communism still he was here all the same afterward as he plucked up his courage to approach her he got his first good look at her she was small with a tawny litheness that reminded him more of a young boy than it did of a woman not that she was unfeminine it was just that there was so much power within her and power was the sole province of men at least zilin had thought so until that night are you a member he said shouldering his way up to her it was the only thing that came to mind he had had very little experience with women i am sun zhongshans assistant her eyes were shining with the absorbed heat of the meeting but she lacked the fanatics glossy fervor that had previously caused zilin to shy away from those possessing the revolutionary spirit i didnt see him here zilin said but i observed many russians she cocked her head do you find that odd i find it interesting i would like to know more he flashed her a quick nervous smile the hall was rapidly emptying out leaving behind only the sour smells of sweat and overexcitement why dont we go somewhere and talk mai said soon she said her hands around a large porcelain teacup the guomindang will merge with the chinese communist party it will make us strong it will make us unstoppable the table was littered with the remnants of rice and sauteed garoupa flashfried shrimp chicken with straw mushrooms mai laughed abruptly looking at the debris between them this is the best ive eaten in years she patted her narrow waist i am stuffed its a good feeling isnt it zilin said theres a certain contentment after a fine meal she eyed him her face lost its smile im not so sure that is good contentment breeds complacency there are far too many wrongs being perpetrated in china for that ever to occur would you lose your dinner then and insult the chef it is his handiwork you pass judgment on now for a moment mai thought he was serious and a severe rebuke was on her lips but as she let her eyes roam his face she saw the merriment slyly surfacing and she was obliged to laugh perhaps you are right zilin she said there is a time for everything but when you have been forced to flee your homeland as i have done with zhongshan humor becomes brittle and an almost forgotten commodity i would think that a time of adversity was the ripest time for humor she nodded silently acknowledging his thought in japan where we were forced to flee when zhongshans bitter battle with the traitor general yuan went against us there was little in the way of humor we found the japanese to be a strange and terribly cold people yet they gave you asylum when even your own people feared to do so they must at least be courageous how is it mai said that you have an answer for everything zilin laughed not everything else i would already be a tai pan of enormous wealth and power instead of what i am and what is that he looked from her beautiful face to the bobbing lights along the crowded quay just a man filled with all manner of strange ideas they both experienced the clouds and the rain with exquisite intimacy though zilin had never before made love he found that he was not frightened with mai there was a certain comfort as if her fierce power which spilled over into this quarter as well held enough courage for them both if she was fiery in her approach he was tender and this mixture this true yinyang thrilled her utterly previously her demeanor in bed had caused her male partnerswho to a man were unused to such aggressiveness in a femaleto either lose their rigidity or attempt to match her spirit with a transparency she found totally repugnant thus though mai had previously experienced sex she had never before that night been lifted up to the ecstasy of the clouds and the rain her cries at being so transported caused zilin to lose all control himself filling him with the most divine pleasure afterward lost within each others limbs they spoke in the most honest manner free of all traces of artifice of which they had never before been free even with people they had thought close to them it would not therefore be incorrect to say that each found the meaning of true love at the same moment mai who had for as long as she had known sun zhongshan been in love only with the concept of the revolution of the three peoples principlesnationalism democracy and livelihood and zilin who had known as his only love the concept of artifice each now saw deep within that hot summer night that their concepts of the world and of life had been somewhat parochial that instead of only one burning overriding love in ones life rather a hierarchy of loves could exist each in harmony with the other to two so highly selfmotivated people it was a revelation of the highest order within three months zilin had been introduced into the world of sun zhongshan within six months he and mai were married for zilin zhongshan was another revelation the doctor of medicine had been educated in such diverse institutions as an anglican boys school in honolulu and a medical college in hong kong it was apparently at the former academy that he had come under the influence of both western thought and christianity zilin did not know the man well enough at that stage to talk to him openly of his own private plans for the foreign devil but in heated discussions among the three of themthough sometimes other party leaders such as hu hanmin and wang chingwei sat inzhongshan often took the western point of view it was especially during these times that zilin absorbed his words like a sponge it was particularly fascinating to him to hear western philosophy and economic and political theory filtered through an eastern mind especially one as brilliant as the doctors thus it was not surprising that zilin soon fell under his spell these discussions however were not without their abrasive side when it came to the subject of the russian communists zhongshan and mai disagreed violently perhaps it was the anglican teaching that hadas mai saidcorrupted this side of him the fact was that the two of them approached this admittedly emotional issue from different levels zhongshan saw the communists almost from a religious point of view mai on the other hand saw them merely from a historical perspective the russian communists she argued over and over held the true revolutionary spirit of the times they were superbly organized they wielded incalculable power and they were willing to aid the guomindang through the newly formed chinese communist party there was never bitterness between the two they had far too much respect for one another but the doctor was often exasperatingly resolute in his position often citing the opinion of his military assistant chiang kaishek who was virulently opposed to what he saw as communist intervention in the internal affairs of china one evening late in autumn with rain pounding against the windowpanes and the sky devoid of stars or moon mai finally threw up her hands in disgust youre impossible she cried angrily why even zilin has come to see the light about the communists the doctor had turned his head his clear eyes regarding zilin oh so you tell me young man just what it is you see in this godless group zilin was thinking of artifice again well sir it seems to me that the russian communists possess two valuable commodities that in my opinion the guomindang cannot obtain anywhere else and these are zhongshan said coldly first they can organize the guomindang as no chinese is now able to do your organization will thus be more efficient and at the same time more streamlined money continues to pour in from overseas i know sir but any measures of economy that we can adopt can only be for the better he paused to clear his throat second and i think even more importantly communism can become a powerful rallying cry for the poor you were born in canton sir so i dont have to reiterate how terrible the economic conditions are in the southern provinces hong kong annam burma india are all being flooded with emigrants from china seeking a proper means of livelihood this has been so for decades perhaps if the guomindang merged with the chinese communist party that would give you the added centrism to rally the majority of the country to your cause frankly i dont believe you can wrest control of china any other way i was proud of you tonight proud zilin did not understand what mai meant they had returned home from their meeting with zhongshan and mai had immediately wanted to make love the clouds and the rain was particularly piercing mai particularly frenzied yes dear she stroked his cheek i was watching him while you made your speech even though i was almost as surprised at it as he was i think you broke through his armor good zilin said i like him i believe that what he wants for china is right id like to see him succeed mai laughed squeezing him i knew id win you over you are a true communist behind your faзade zilin had sobered dont misunderstand me mai i have no allegiance to communism im purely neutral about it as a concept but as a means to zhongshans ends i think the russians can be tremendously useful mai pouted then its all a fake your zeal is just part of your theory of artifice there were tears in her eyes zilin sat up pulled her to him listen mai what does it matter how i feel the important thing is that zhongshan be made to see that right now the communists can be his saviors in china that is the only thing that is real after a time of silence mai halflaughed halfcried into his chest and i thought she whispered that i was getting to know you later when she had had time to think about what he had said she turned to him in the darkness the real obstacle to the guomindang and the chinese communist party merging is not zhongshan himself but chiang kaishek zilin thought about that for a time he had met chiang several times had spoken with him at length twice and had come away from both meetings with a bad feeling in his stomach tell me what you know of him he said softly hes thirtyfour she began he was educated at a japanese military academy and got his field experience in a japanese regiment of the line he returned here in time to take part in the revolution against the manchus he fought with zhongshan against general yuan they are very close too close in my opinion why do you say that because mai said thoughtfully i sense another loyalty in him beyond the one he evinces for zhongshan do you think he is in the employ of an enemy of the guomindangs no i am certain hes not would he betray zhongshan not while zhongshan was still alive mai said i think what chiang learned in japan besides the art of warfare was a loyalty to chiang kaishek i think his ambition ranges far beyond this revolution privately he does not hold with zhongshans ideals for the people though he says he does he is a strong man with a strong mans visions zhongshan needs a strong man now he will need one once he gains power he will always need protection mai yes mai nodded and her dark hair flowed down across her face obscuring one cheek but protection from whom that is what i continually ask myself they tried to sleep after that but it was impossible the clock on the mantel across the room kept them awake as if it were the tolling of a bell outside on the street the cries of the fishermen along the quay floated in the rainheavy air like passing clouds after a long time zilin rolled over mai yes darling if as you have said my words have opened the door then you must make certain it stays open you know that i will try good he said because i have an idea that will take chiang out of zhongshans hair and perhaps make him change his ways all at the same time dew nek loh moh by all the gods how zilin laughed once zhongshan is made to see the wisdom of using the russians you must suggest to him that he send his most trusted military aide chiang kaishek to the ussr to learn proper military organization borodin will be only too happy to comply if chiang balks as he most assuredly will suggest to the doctor that he tell chiang that it would be far better for chiang himself to learn the new organization and return here to implement it than to allow the russians to come here and do it for him mai was already laughing it continued unabated until the tears were rolling down her cheeks she threw her naked body onto her husbands hugging him laughing again like thunder rolling off the walls of their small room in zhongshan using the argument zilin had proposed to mai that night indeed sent chiang kaishek to russia to gain knowledge of their manner of organization and a year later he merged the guomindang with the chinese communist party with the aid of soviet advisors and materiel a new betterequipped revolutionary army was created its constituents also members of the party the revolutionary spirit was in the air and renewed optimism buoyed them all because mai was increasingly tied up in working on doctrine with zhongshan zilin set about getting to know other key members of the guomindang his own work as a clerk in the harbormasters office was sufficiently nontaxing for him to spend his off hours any way he pleased it did not take him long to attach himself to hu hanmin hu was already fortytwo much closer to zhongshans age than most of his other followers he was a tall slender man with a gentle face and a normally soft voice that he could transform into the orators fierce shout when the need arose he was a lawyer who had met zhongshan and mai while he was at school in japan his keen analytical mind had been caught immediately by zhongshans revolutionary spirit and they had become fast friends because of this and because he was so good with people hu had risen quickly within the guomindang of all of zhongshans major supporters it could be said of hu that he was most like the doctor he was like zhongshan essentially a humanist he felt for the people of china even as he believed in them his failing if it could be said to be one was that he failed to perceive the campaign for victory in military terms he was often derided for this by chiang kaishek who perhaps quite accurately perceived in him his most serious rival in the natural succession of the nationalist government what zilin liked best about hu was his quick mind he was most often the one at the protracted political meetings who was able to wade through all the tangled webs of various arguments to get right to the heart of the matter but in fact what he responded to most in hu on the subliminal emotional level was the mans openness of spirit zilins father had had little time for his family as the rapidly westernizing city of shanghai put more and more pressure on his time for many years he was the only chinese with enough training or the expertise to get many major projects done in fact for the first three years after he and his family had moved to shanghai he was in constant demand by the japanese and the europeans as well consequently he left the house early and returned late almost always when the rest of the family had long since finished dinner it was quite an untraditional family in that regard and he had had to prevail upon his wife to obey his wishes in this and not wait for his return to get the children fed still she herself would not eat until he had come home she felt scandalized enough that the children did not wait the elder shi did not see it as a sign of disrespect but merely as a signature of the changing times in any case hu had time for the young zilin seeing in him no doubt the spark of genius that was already beginning to surface thus it was that many evenings the two would stroll the twisting back streets and long curving dockside known as the bund discussing every subject under the sun late one afternoon near the end of hu broke off their conversation he had turned uncharacteristically melancholy staring out at the harbor forested with black masts spars and rigging it was cool and relatively dry though far warmer than the twentythreedegree weather under which beijing was suffering to the north there was snow coming out of the siberian steppes but here the swollen red sun sinking like a thrown stone turned the ships to spiky silhouettes zilin could see the mighty dredgers still at work at the mouth of the harbor where they had been all day long out of necessity trade had been halted for them but none of the tai pan raised a word of protest vast sums of money were spent each year to keep the constantly building silt from making the harbor floor impassable for the oceangoing steamers so vital to the china trade zilin returned his attention to the older man his affection for hu had grown steadily since they had first met and he did not like to see him so low elder uncle he said after a time zhongshan tells me that it is a western custom to share a burden among friends hu turned refocusing his eyes on zilin he smiled but there was a grimness to his gesture that chilled the younger man it may be the custom younger brother in other more barbarous cultures to be so disrespectful of a friends feelings as to share pain he shrugged the ways of the world are odd indeed yet there is perhaps some good i may perform zilin said gently in matters of internal guomindang policy it might prove useful to turn to someone on the outside someone who is able to render a fair and impartial opinion now hu was forced to laugh by all the gods zilin you are quite a remarkable young man are you certain you never studied before the bar you would make a superb lawyer with your powers of persuasion i would like to help elder uncle he said seriously the dredgers were packing up now dusk had fallen across the city within its murky mauve light the muddy water seemed pristine and full of promise an opalescent glow had risen along the sweep of the bund as the night lamps were lit and the cooking fires from the houseboats flared up it was overhung by a smudge of smoke that painted a newly risen crescent moon bluishpurple they began again to walk there is truth to your words hu said at last yet i do not wish to involve you have no fear on that score zilin prompted mai has already seen to that all right hu relented how well do you know ling xichu zilin shrugged enough to talk to him now and then in my opinion hes something of a bully boy he employs force without being fair but he has taken to the bolshevik methodology quite well it seems hes a quick study at least he also perceives himself as my chief rival you and i i think understand that to be chiang but ling does not believe chiang can muster the support to become head of the guomindang and you do well hu said what is your opinion i think chiangs dangerous but i must admit that my opinion may be a bit weighted on this matter mai hates and distrusts chiang she fears that he is capable of betraying the revolution chiang hu said echoing mai thinks only of chiang he shrugged but i think that is a function of a military officer a commander in warfare cannot think too much about his men or else he would never send them out into battle to die on the other hand ling has no cause to feel that way yet he does all the same he opposes me now in the guomindangs central committee he has sided with chiang in pushing for an allout military campaign northward through the provinces to take beijing though the army has made great strides since chiang returned from russia i feel we are still unprepared to take on the government and if we fail now after so many past defeats i fear it will be the end for us zhongshan has just so much stamina left in him he puts in twentyhour days he pushes himself beyond the tolerance limits for even a much younger man than he leading a major military campaign now must surely kill him young boys passed them running calling to one another great sacks of rice were being laded to be ferried off to one of the tai pans great swift steamships tea as well was piled high upon the docks awaiting its turn to leave shanghai and somewhere inside those cases was no doubt a fortune in opium zilin watched this activity while his mind whirred through all that his friend had told him you must continue to oppose them in the committee he said do not use rhetoric that might inflame them to retaliate in kind but rather use cool words that prove your levelheaded response he looked at hu then privately you must meet with zhongshan tell him just what you have told me if he takes on this campaign before the army is ready before all the support is coalesced and if he perishes on the long northward march his dream of revolution will die with him for if he begins the march at the head of the army and cannot finish all the spirit will fall from his soldiers and the power of the guomindang will ebb away zhongshan knows well the wisdom of patience hu stared at the crates of tea as if he had never seen such cargo before you know he said with great deliberation i was supposed to chair a committee meeting tonight but at the last moment it was canceled all gods bear witness it was a good omen otherwise i would not have been able to meet you there was no need to say more zilin smiled and they strolled on around a turning out of sight of the myriad ships that lay at anchor resting for the night a week before the chinese new yearin the beginning of mai woke him out of sleep it was deep within the night a full moon bathed the street outside in blue light a drunkard was singing a garbled chanty and farther away voices were raised in argument zilin yes what is it he fought to clear his mind of sleep i am worried about zhongshan hus cleverness has saved him from attempting the long march what has happened now hes ill there were tears in her eyes seriously ill now zilin was concerned but ive heard nothing of this even from hu she shook her head you wouldnt hes kept it from everyone except me now ive told you i dont know what to do mai he said holding her youre not a doctor theres nothing you can do except bring him to one its all been done she turned to him and in the cool halflight he saw how pale she was theres nothing any of them can do hes dying she nodded zilin i am so afraid if hu hanmin does not take over i fear for the revolution chiang is an animal who will do everything in his power to destroy the communist party as soon as zhongshan can no longer hold him in check i dont even want to say it she broke down then sobbing against him her body shaking like a leaf in a storm hell be gone soon she whispered i cannot believe it its too soon too soon for the moment there was nothing zilin could do but hold her and give her what comfort he could in a while she had calmed enough for him to say then you must use all your expertise to ensure that hu gets the support he needs to take power theres not only chiang to be wary of but ling xichu as well mai was weeping again shaking her head back and forth i dont know zilin i dont think i have the strength left without zhongshan now think mai he whispered harshly what would he say if he heard such antirevolutionary words hed most surely reprimand you his strength flows through you i know i feel it so do the others that is why they are jealous of you well the time has come for you to wield that power to its fullest he stared into her pale tearstreaked face thinking that he loved her more now than he ever had and finding that a most wondrous feeling your enemies are just waiting for you to falter they will say of you that you are of no use after all like all women you fall apart at the first crisis you break into tears as no man would and kneel sobbing broken before zhongshans memory this is not the course he planned for you mai it is not why he has brought you close to him why he has shared all his innermost thoughts with you why he has trusted you above all others even his beloved chiang do you not see that zhongshan leans on you fully as much as you depend on him and perhaps now it is your strength that helps sustain him perhaps without that his disease would already have finished him yes mais voice was but a sigh her head bent until her damp forehead pressed against his collarbone she was like a longdistance runner who at the edge of exhaustion was beginning to find inside herself the courage to go on to draw on her conviction so that she could finish what she had had the audacity to begin thank you my husband she whispered yes in april of that year zilin received a promotion to chief clerk at the harbormasters office at the end of the workday he hastened home to share his good fortune with mai he had been diligently setting aside a portion of his pay and instead of donating it to the party as mai had often suggested he had begun to invest it he and his two brothers had pooled their money purchasing land in areas of the city not yet fully developed but that they felt would soon become valuable in this manner they had already sold off two lots within six months tripling their seed money with the profits of a third chunk of real estate combined with zilins increased salary he had an idea to buy a quartershare in a steamship his brothers did not think that such a thing was feasible but zilin was already formulating a plan mai was not yet home when he arrived at dusk he went immediately to his desk and taking up pen and ink began again his calculations estimating the potential profits from part ownership in one of the great oceangoing ships thus absorbed he did not immediately hear mai when she came in but the absolute silence at length caused him to raise his head from the orderly rows of figures he had written in his neat hand across the page mai her face was white her body rigid zilin came around from behind the desk and gripped her hands in his they were as cold as ice by all the gods what has happened mutely her eyes sought his and there was within them such a depth of sadness and despair that he knew without her telling him that zhongshan was dead he went to beijing alone she said tightly after a long time i wanted to go with him i pleaded with him but he was unshakable in his conviction zilin saw then the immense courage inside her the determination not to weep it was as if he went there to die as if he felt death coming and did not wish to die here among his family zilin felt a loss in the center of his being it was as if some comforting hand to which he had grown accustomed over the years had abruptly disappeared perhaps as always he was thinking of the revolution he said thoughtfully mai looked at him our memories of him are all the more powerful i think since we were not exposed to his last frailties his inevitable last weakness rather we remember him strong and whole and eager to continue the battle still mai whispered i fear for us all with sun zhongshans death came the inevitable quest to succeed him from within the ranks of the guomindang as was expected hu hanmin emerged as the strongest candidate his voice raised in the forum of the central committee was one of reason and patient common sense of course ling xichu opposed him at every turn speaking out for immediate military mobilization but curiously chiang kaishek a most vocal proponent of such a move was silent he sat stolid and unmoving in his seat surrounded by his retinue in an almost judgmental attitude as he observed the two rivals in constant debate zhongshans widow of course had no say in anything but zilin felt disturbed by this most uncharacteristic stance of chiangs he was after all a man of action and he mai and hu had all expected the general to make his move immediately but other events conspired to take time away from zilins contemplation of the internal struggle within the guomindang negotiations had begun with the american tai pan barton sawyer with regard to buying into his fleet of steamships thoughts among the shi brothers had settled around one of the british tai pan who were generally more powerful by dint of having been in china the longest but in the course of his work zilin had observed that one tai pan had been over the past six months consistently late in his harbor duties barton sawyer of sawyer sons this he argued with his brothers was the soft spot they had been seeking at length the three of them agreed delegating zilin to make the approachment thus while the debates raged within the guomindang zilin dressed in his finest clothes sat in the vestibule of sawyer sons offices in the american concession an officious young westerner sat at a desk making portentous motions to convey the importance of his position to the barbarian chinese seated in the waiting area after a suitable amount of time the young man who was unsuitably dressed for the climate told zilin that he could go inside barton sawyer was a largeshouldered beefyfaced man his coloring was so red that it momentarily disconcerted zilin zilin bowed then quickly took the americans proffered hand as he had seen westerners do many times and squeezed itwhich he had found in his careful observance was the proper response to the pressure he felt most of his brethren would merely have winced at having their hand squeezed and pulled it away sawyer smiled well you sure know how to shake hands he had a loud bellowing voice that privately disturbed zilins sensibilities but outwardly he showed nothing where i come from in virginia a mans known by his handshake my daddy was known not to do business with anyone less he had a good solid handshake it was the americans conceit to believe that everyone they came in contact with knew the location of their birthplace as if a continent on the other side of the world would be an open book come on sawyer said jovially raising a hand lets sit and be comfortable he directed zilin to an overstuffed sofa that had obviously been imported from the west zilin found it exceedingly uncomfortable but he was determined to make the best of it here inside the foreign devils world he must learn to acclimate himself he told himself now sawyer said his voice still booming though the two were close together how can i help you no tea no civilized conversation to stabilize relations to get a feel of the spirit of the other man zilin was momentarily astounded but then as he recovered he vowed that it would be the last time the coarseness of a foreign devil would so nonplus him it has come to my attention that certain er monthly tithes required by the city of shanghai have not yet been paid by your firm i now i recognize you sawyer snapped his fingers you work in the harbormasters office his face darkened since when are the mandarins sending clerks to make their collections i am not zilin said softly here in any official capacity youre not the american began to eye him more carefully you mean youre not here to demand payment no sir sawyer leaned forward withdrew a cigar from a perfumed humidor he bit off the end spat it sideways onto the carpet and lit a wooden match he puffed heartily for a time savoring the tobacco well hell son it seems to me then youve got a nerve wanting to see me he began to rise i havent got the time youll have no time at all zilin said if you cant make next months harbor tithe thats none of your business sawyer said coldly i dont discuss the affairs of sawyer and sons with a chinee westerners call this pride zilin said calmly he had not moved or perhaps it is prejudice i had heard that the americans were somewhat less provincial in their thinking than their british brethren the british are no brethren of mine the american said quickly no zilin went on i imagine not the english tai pan with their new faster steamships are beating you at every turn consequently your profits over the past years have dwindled so drastically that for the last six months you have been paying overhead with bank securities now you are having difficulties making your loan payments sawyer squinted down at him you sure know a lot for a little chinee i may be small in stature zilin said but my minds another matter altogether sawyer stared openmouthed at him for a moment before he burst into a fit of laughter which turned his face so red that zilin feared blood vessels had burst ah ooo sawyer wiped at the corners of his eyes and sat back down beside zilin well well well he said i do believe we have a rare find here a chinee with a real sense of humor zilin nodded thank you he said but really i would prefer it if you called me by my name this thinking and speaking like a foreign devil was taxing indeed he thought all right the american tapped his cigar ash whats your business mr shi that is besides clerking my brothers and i have a certain amount of seed money zilin began pausing almost immediately to take a breath dew neh loh moh he thought my heart is beating so fast it is sure to burst we would like to use it to buy into your shipping line for a moment zilin was certain that sawyer was going to hit him all color drained from his face and zilin was appalled at how ghastly he looked now look here mr shi naturally zilin hurried on there are certain guarantees my brothers and i are prepared to make as our first contribution to the firm and as a gesture of our goodwill this is all out of the question sawyer said sawyer and sons is an american firm pure and simple if i sell out therell be nothing for my son andrew and his son after him if you dont relinquish part of the firm now mr sawyer i fear that your debts will eat it all up long before control passes to young master andrew what kind of a legacy is a bankrupt firm its out of the question as compensation for the share in sawyer and sons zilin went on my brothers and i are willing to infuse the company with more than muchneeded capital first we can guarantee that the firms property will not be touched by the communists or the revolutionaries there is going to be some kind of explosion throughout the country in the next several years quite naturally foreign concerns will be a primary target of such unrest second because i have access to all the harbormasters records sawyer and sons will be privy to every shipment offloaded and laded in the port of shanghai you will in effect know who is shipping whatand how much of it and to wherebefore any of your competition third we will guarantee the safest and fastest method of bringing opium from the interior of china through shanghai and into hong kong where you ship it overseas sawyer spent some time grinding out his cigar when he next spoke both his bantering tone and his anger had fled him taking the last first mr shi how in the name of hell can you guarantee such a thing zilin smiled my youngest brother makes his living now captaining a lorcha along the rivers he knows them all knows the growers the best fields and how to get the best prices out of them currently he is a freelance but that will change of course when we sign the deal how much money are you prepared to kick in zilin told him sawyer did some rapid calculations his pulse racing zilin knew the sum to be inadequate it would just about cover the next two months overhead including loan surcharges and harbor taxes sawyers answer was predictable enough sorry mr shi some of the deal sounds fair enough but the capital falls far short of what ill need in thirty days time ill be back in the same position only the poorer for it for having signed over to you a percentage of the firm not zilin said if you get the harbordredging concession within the next ten days now youre talking nonsense sawyer said manias and king the oldest and largest of the british tai pan houses has that locked up theyve done so for as long as i can remember you can just forget about that one id prefer not to you see i am privy to information that even tai pan do not possess sawyer noted zilins tone and nodded we are in your country mr shi i take your point please continue the dredging is not yet complete tomorrow morning when the english captains wake they will find their dredgers deserted not a crewman will be found aboard that wont stop em for long mattias and king know your people money buys an awful lot from the coolie mr shi hell die for an english shilling yes of course he will zilin agreed so the captains will find makeshift crews and taking them on board they will also take a number of young revolutionaries whose zeal for destruction is frightening in its singlemindedness in short there will be fires on board the dredgers will be lost or surely have to shut down pardon me for saying so mr shi but the schemes not worth its weight in nuisance value sure the tai panll lose money and time he shrugged his beefy shoulders but so what theyll get the ships back in working order sooner or later unless its soonerso soon that they will have no chance to do itthe dredging concession rights will revert to the harbormaster you see there is a time limit in the contract it was put there by mutual agreement between mattias and king and the city when the contract was originally awarded the job must be done within six days time or too much business is lost once the rights return to my office the harbormaster will call for sealed bids among the tai pan who are interested with my assistance sawyer and sons cannot fail to receive the concession since the job must be finished immediately money will be forthcoming within a fortnight of completion the tai pan stared at zilin as if he had suddenly grown wings well ill be goddamned if you havent thought of everything he sat down slowly lost in thought when he judged that the american had had sufficient time he said there is one additional provision i knew it the american said now comes the kicker nothing of the sort zilin said i wish only that you take my middle brother into the firm you may interview him and so determine which position and at which level you wish to start him thereafter he may move up in the firm solely on his own merit within two years however if he should prove satisfactory to you i wish him to be transferred to your offices in hong kong i can live with that sawyer said but look if he slacks off or cant learn the trade or is caught with his hand in the till or passing company information to a competitor hes out on his ear thats my decision as tai pan of sawyer and sons zilin smiled i leave his fate in your capable hands mr sawyer he stood up a last stipulation of our deal is that the firms name shall not be altered in any way we shall be silent partners at sawyer and sons now the american could not keep the smile off his face hell lets go out and get the best meal money can buy eh mr shi he knew shi would like that since that was how the chinese sealed a successful business deal between themselves he laughed and this time it did not seem nearly so loud and coarse to zilin you just may turn out to be the best business partner a man could have zilin looked up from his work at the harbormasters office as he heard a clatter at the front door voices were raised seeing mai he put down his quill over the shouts of others she ran to him she was out of breath as if she had been running a long distance husband she gasped it is disaster a total disaster we are all undone he held her trembling body mai what has happened everyone in the office was gaping at them ling xichu was found murdered late last night this morning the authorities arrested hu hanmins first cousin he is being accused of political murder what of hanmin you know him as well as i he just spoke before the central committee i felt certain that this week they were going to elect him president now he has withdrawn his name from nomination there was a breathless silence and mai was weeping the worst has happened chiang at last spoke up he denounced all political murders he spoke out for a strong united leadership no one not even hu raised his voice against him the committee is voting this evening they want a president and oh husband i am sure it will be chiang of course mai was quite correct the central committee of the guomindang elevated the general and thereafter the canton national government came under his control as had been his intention all along he consolidated power around himself and when he judged it sufficient he announced in june of the northern expedition both mai and hu tried to oppose him rationally preaching caution but the forward momentum that chiangs militarism had injected into the movement was too infectious thus the long march toward what many hoped was freedom for the chinese people was begun during that year and the beginning of the next chiangs nationalist army rolled through the central provinces picking up support as it went by the beginning of it had taken an additional three provinces in the east all the while mai worked with hu and the communist party in trying to ensure that zhongshans ideals would not be lost in the growing imperialism of the generals victorious army zilin on the other hand had steeped himself in his growing assets in view of the increasing unrest of the country he prevailed upon his brothers to sell all their land holdings and though their profits were perhaps not as large as if they had waited longer to divest themselves of these assets still he felt more secure with their money elsewhere that elsewhere was an increasingly larger share of sawyer sons with the shi brothers help the sinoamerican company had prospered to the point where it now outshone all but two of the firms held by the british tai pan zilins brother inside the company rose even more quickly than zilin had anticipated sawyer who zilin had learned was an excellent judge of character soon insisted that the young man work directly with him and when zilin reminded him of his promise to send the man to hong kong the american was reluctant to do so hes invaluable to me here mr shi he said think then zilin said how much more valuable he will be heading up the hong kong offices in the spring of chiang returned to shanghai in triumph yet he came back to find that the guomindang had a new president elected in his absence still chiangs power had increased to such an extent that his return sundered the guomindang into two separate factions mai was distraught to see the flower of zhongshans dream thus rent and she did all in her power to bring the two warring sides together to no avail bad blood had been spilled and there was no way to reverse the tide that was pulling the revolution in two just after the chinese new year zilin awoke in the middle of the night he had been dreaming but as was sometimes the case he did not remember of what he was in a sweat he turned to mai for comfort but she was not there he got out of bed and pulling on a robe went through the rooms he found her at the front door two soldiers and an officer in the nationalist army were with her what is this this is nothing to concern you the officer said imperiously general chiang wishes to speak with mrs shi she is my wife zilin said responding to the look in mais eyes everything that concerns her concerns me this is the business of the central committee of the guomindang the officer spoke as if by rote in the name of the general i enjoin you from interfering he turned on his heel now mrs shi you will come with me i wish to speak with my wife before she but the soldiers already had hold of her and she was out of the apartment zilin he heard mais voice my husband wait he cried but the officer leveled a pistol at his chest be good enough to return to sleep mr shi he commanded your wife will be returned home when the general is quite done with her she is safe in our hands he closed the door behind him in a moment the paralysis wore off and zilin rushed to the window out in the street he could see the soldiers hustling mai into the darkness just before he too slipped from sight the officer glanced upward his white teeth gleamed in the streetlight he lofted the barrel of his pistol as if in salute or warning then he was gone zilin was in a fever his heart was constricted as he rushed into the other room to dress hurriedly his mind was in such a whirl that it was not until he returned to the front room that he heard the pounding on the door thinking that it had all been a mistake after all and the officer was returning mai he leapt at the door and threw it open hu hanmin stood there his face was as white as rice paper i have just come from the party headquarters we have chiangs army at our front door they are making arrests and gunning people down as they flee executions they are calling them chiangs broken with the party hes taken the guomindang on its own mais worst fears have come to pass he glanced where is she zilin i fear shes in danger buddha zilin cried the armys taken her he grabbed his friend come on hanmin we must stop them before she gets to chiang they clattered down the steps and ran out into the street a voice from the shadows halted them in midstride going somewhere gentlemen zilin recognized that voice even before he saw the figure of the officer emerge from the shadows of the street his pistol was pointed at a spot just between the two men in this as well general chiang was correct he felt certain that given time hu hanmin would show his face here he smiled and now he has he gave a barking command and his men appeared they held mai between them let her go zilin said he took a step toward them but the officer pointed his gun and he stopped let her go hu echoed let her go and i will go with you willingly those are not my orders the officer said obviously enjoying his position of strength he smiled besides i dont care if you come willingly or otherwise he redirected his voice hold her up his men obeyed tightening their grip on mais wrists they stood apart from her and abruptly zilin knew that the officer had never had any intention of bringing her to chiang no he cried springing forward even as the officer discharged his weapon mais eyes were upon him and there was no fear in them as the bullet pierced her heart zilin thought she sighed no he cried again breaking into a stumbling run the officer made no attempt to stop him he was enjoying zilins grief too much thus he did not see zilin change direction at the last instant and veer toward him in his rage zilin grabbed the pistol out of the officers hand and pulled the trigger pointblank the explosion echoed in his ears and he felt the heavy recoil then he was staring at what was left of the officers face a raw red pulp muscles jumped in useless reflex as the corpse tumbled to the ground with the unconscious precision of the cornered animal zilin turned and squeezed the trigger twice more as the soldiers let slip their dead charge to come to the aid of their commander after they fell too zilin emptied the weapon into them then he went to where mai lay in the dust and knelt beside her her eyes were closed and there was very little blood if he closed his mind he could pretend that she was merely asleep book two wuwei hong kong crimea beijing tsurugi tokyo washington summer present andrew sawyer awoke with the dream still fresh in his mind he sat up in bed stared at himself blankly in the large marbled mirror on the opposite wall he saw a long face his fathers cornflowerblue eyes the meticulously clipped mustache was as snow white as was the thinning crop of hair on his head vaguely he ran a liverspotted hand over his face when he wondered had his hair receded so much had it been at the same time his mustache had turned from the dirty blond it had been all his adult life where had the years gone he rolled over the satin sheets fumbling for the china carafe of water on the night table he poured himself a glass and drank thirstily i must call peter ng right away he thought as he gulped down the liquid peter surely must know a good sam ku sawyer put the glass aside as he did so his gaze fell upon the back of his hand how fragile the skin appeared how marked by time how deeply the visible veins pulsed how close to the surface he was not a man normally given to thoughts of mortality as tai pan of sawyer sons for more than forty years he had always been concerned with the running of the family business not even the death of his first wife mary in the typhoon had stopped him for long today at seventy he would have had no thoughts about the passage of time had it not been for the dream and the death of miki he had been twentyeight when mary was taken from him joss one could call it that but miki had been only eighteen months old when she died for many years the thought of remarrying had not entered his mind he surmised that but for the urging of peter ng his comprador his chief and most trusted advisor he might never have thought of it again but ng had argued for the family a tai pan needed an heir to whom he could pass on the reins of power but it was not until ten years ago that he had met someone for whom he felt anything susan welles had been thirty years his junior and their marriage had caused something of a scandal in the crown colony it made sawyer remember the potential scandal from which shi zilin had saved him many years before in shanghai of all his extended family inside the company only loyal peter ng had been genuinely happy for him but the marriage had little happiness to it a year later susan died in a difficult childbirth the baby girl whom sawyer had called miki lived for eighteen months before succumbing to the plethora of infant diseases with which she had been born it was about miki that he had dreamed sawyer reached for the phone and dialed a familiar number im sorry to disturb you so early peter he said into the mouthpiece but i must see you immediately he listened for a moment no the office will be fine then angry at himself that his distress had made him forget his manners he added how is jocelyn and the children good fortyfive minutes then showered shaved and powdered dressed impeccably in a lightweight linenandsilk suit the color of cafй au lait sawyer waited for his chauffeur to open the rolls back door he stepped out onto sawyer place the only street in hong kong named after an american around the corner was the wide thoroughfare of connaught road central already busy even at this early hour of the morning sawyer looked up at the sawyer sons building across the street to his right was connaught tower to his left was the building that housed the firm of mattias king company rivals from the founding of hong kong by the west as he went up the pink marble steps to the brassfitted solid mahogany double doors sawyer was never more aware of the mutability of life when he was young he had seemed immortal lately it had seemed as if only the company would be immortal for the most part he had ignored all the hysterical talk of the chinese takeover in he had taken his lumps with all the rest when in the hang seng dropped a hundred points virtually overnight but unlike many of the other tai pan who continued to sell in the days that followed sawyer had instructed his firm to buy his wisdom had been apparent a year later when the hang seng surged upward following the realestate scare and sawyer sons found themselves major shareholders in a dozen new ventures all beginning to prosper again after the yearlong economic tailspin caused by the communist announcement privately sawyer thought the chinese were mouthing a lot of hot air they had face to recover and they were going about it with a vengeance making the queen grovel before them well that was all well and goodas far as it went but the truth of the matter was that the communists could no more run a complex business community like hong kong than they could walk on the moon if the colony should close down the amount of revenue that china would lose yearly was enough to stagger the mind the communists were not fools whatever else they might be sawyer had been proven right the announcement this year that an interim period of fifty years had been granted to the colony during which nothing would change had come as no surprise to him yet the jitters within the colony had increased since the second announcement not decreased as sawyer had felt certain they would privately many businessmen did not believe the communists did not trust them at their word even the new signed agreement meant nothing after all they argued practically speaking what was to stop the chinese army from ignoring the fiftyyear grace period and moving in on the stroke of midnight january others were calmed by the fiftyyear reprieve they felt that whatever would ultimately befall the colony after that time could not possibly hurt them sawyer knew that was a false hope hong kong had always prospered on the backs of familyrun trading houses that meant the continuity of succeeding generations building on what had been accomplished before in his heart of hearts this fiftyyear hiatus did nothing to assuage his fears for hong kongs future if the rumor that mattias king are moving their operations out of hong kong is true then god help all of us he thoughtincluding the communists to see the oldest and most prestigious of the tai pan houses abandoning the colony could not help but sound a death blow for investor confidence in his office which took up nearly half of the tog floor of the building sawyer let himself through the outer doors into his inner sanctum through the plateglass windows that stood ten feet high across the northern end of the room all of kowloon crouched at his feet hazy through humid gray mist across victoria harbor a star ferry pulled away from the pier beneath the old clock tower where years ago the trains had come and gone sawyer turned hearing soft footfalls in the anteroom in a moment peter ng entered the room he was a small dapper chinese with a wide face and clever eyes that saw everything as usual he wore a charcoalgray rawsilk suit and black patentleather loafers good morning tai pan he said in his high singsong voice i brought us breakfast good morning peter thank you ng placed a pair of styrofoam boxes down on sawyers rosewood desk he dug out plastic chopsticks and they sat across from each other rapidly eating rice gravy and bits of tender pork they drank tea out of plastic cups this was ritual with them being at the office so early often meant a crisis was at hand and sawyer had found that calm and orderly thinking were the best ways to combat a crisis bad news tai pan ng said setting aside his empty box chinese never talked business while eating i have just heard that mattias king will announce their relocation to bermuda this afternoon sawyer closed his eyes he sat very still but his mind was whirling with the possibilities now laid open to him the hang seng will take a nosedive on monday thats for certain ng said the only question is how far it will plummet and whether we should be ready to sell monday morning sawyers eyes flew open never sell peter never this colony is our lifeblood mattias king is running scared i cant believe that theyve so overreacted but there it is they can get an enormous tax break in bermuda being servants of her majestys government so from that point of view theyll lose nothing but otherwise my god think of the opportunity it affords us with mattias king gone sawyer and sons will be the largest and most prestigious of the western tai pan trading houses they are going to say that the move will in no way affect the amount of trading they will be doing here in the future face said sawyer coldly you and i and every trader in the crown colony know that theyll no longer have the clout they once had once they pull up stakes theyll be outsiders the best deals will be closed to them there are still the chinese houses to worry about ng pointed out between them t y chung and three oaths tsun have the shipping and warehousing industries just about sewn up here and five star pacifics heavily committed to utilities both here and in the new territories at a guess the fluctuating market will be harder on tsun hes got some tricky financial problems hes gone into this kam sang nuclear power plant with mattias king in china their pullout might put him in a precarious position the communists as well ng said if the hang seng nosedives on monday oh it will of that you can be certain and we must be prepared to take advantage of it the war between t y chung and three oaths tsun may be to our benefit warsof any kinddrain their participants resources pak hanmin tsuns utilities arm yes through pak hanmin and the kam sang deal tsun seeks a foothold in that area only a project having the size scope and longevity of kam sang could hope to do it for him sawyers eyes were alight perhaps we have found an achilles heel in our powerful enemy dont you think chung and bluestone will have the same idea sawyer finished up his breakfast why dont we wait and see hm peter ng began to clear the remnants of the meal off the tai pans desk how stupid the communists are to vacillate this way a fiftyyear grace period is no decision at all it certainly will not help property values i think sawyer said that they have no clear idea how to handle this situation it is new to them and the communist chinese historically cannot deal with new situations will they send troops in or wont they will they become involved in the running of the colony after or wont they will they eventually nationalize all industry or wont they personally i dont think they have a clue but theyll come around eventually theyre great pragmatists after all they need us as much as we need hong kong they have no need for the land they have no expertise in business administration nor even worse for them in dealing with the rest of the world no for the time being at least they require middlemen to do their business for them that way face is saved all around they need the device of this new administrative district that hong kong will come under when the lease expires the british will have to bring the governor home no matter governors here have no power whatsoever the chinese have it all anyway but hong kong is chinas only real channel to the wealth and the industry of the west mattias kings decision must be an unmitigated disaster for them the important thing is that we make it a triumph for us both men were silent for a time around them now they could hear the office awakening phones burred softly lights blinked on banked pbx consoles hushed voices could be heard doors closing softly heels clickclacking down corridors tai pan sawyers eyes were closed again yes peter what was it you wished to talk with me about sawyer sighed miki miki last night she came to me in a dream her spirit has met another spirit whom she wishes to wed though miki had been a baby when she died spirits were of course ageless to the chinese way of thinking even spirits became lonely craved happiness desired completeness this was what sawyer meant but that is wonderful tai pan ng said leaning forward dreams such as the one sawyer had were fairly common in china among parents who had lost children ng thought it interesting though hardly surprising that his tai pan had had such a dream gwai loh were not supposed to be in touch with such ephemeral emotions but sawyer ng knew was very attuned to chinese culture her spirit will be happy now did she tell you whom she wishes to marry here is the mans name sawyer said pushing a slip of paper across the desk we shall need a am ku to tell us the address of the family as well as to make the arrangements for the ghost wedding this is a fortuitous sign ng said taking the slip a most favorable omen tai pan i know just the sam ku with luck this dead mans family may have already come to her about miki it happens that way sometimes the dreams occur to members of both families simultaneously he got up ill phone her right away when he was alone sawyer put his hands flat on the polished rosewood when in a moment he lifted them up he could see their imprints a part of him slowly fading into the air just like miki sei an his secretary stood in the doorway obviously she had just come in tai pan is there anything i can get you andrew sawyer shook his head slowly nothing the dacha was so still that she could hear the water and the wind it was late but still light something for which she had always treasured the summertime a bird cried its sound seeming to echo like thunder across the vast bowl of the sky down in the cellar she recovered her notebook from its hiding place behind a pair of bricks in the west wall it occurred to her that the dark niche beyond was just such a spot as those in which russians often hid their religious ikons daniellas mother had been a practicing russian orthodox a fact she had never dared reveal to her husband it was not lost on daniella that what she was doing now was precisely what she had seen her mother do many years ago it was no accident that she had chosen this type of hiding place for her most precious possession the danger also was akin to that which her mother had endured in her long years with daniellas father never to tell him of her innermost beliefs her bastion from him now in a way it was the same with daniella and karpov she sat at the wooden refectory table and placing the sourcebook and the cipher side by side began her translation an overhead lamp with a green steel shade cast her in a cone of concentrated light she worked swiftly and efficiently because it was a code of her own design she required a minimal amount of time again she was reminded of her mother who so clandestinely that she even managed to fool her husband toiled for the church inside the religious underground she joined others who were determined to reestablish the power of the russian orthodox church by installing a patriarch who would be independent of the will of the communist party on occasion daniellas mother had taken her to her meetings this religious inculcation a secret shared by mother and child drew them together it was as if daniellas mother had taken her to the opera or the ballet russe slowly daniella had developed an appreciation for religion perhaps even at that age she had been fascinated by the enormous power an idea could wield capitalism and perhaps communism too were passing things god was not that was not something her mother had had to tell her she had discovered it all by herself and had never forgotten it because history confirmed it all political systems were temporary because they were creations of man she did not think god was when she was finished transcribing she closed the notebook and returned it to its sanctuary careful to make certain that she put back both bricks precisely as they had been then she returned to the table and began to pore over this latest of her medea intelligence reports medea was a project that had been running for just over three years us chief operative was a man whom daniella had herself recruited she had made contact with him in the course of another much more routine project it had concluded satisfactorily at that time she had researched all members of the opposition one zhang hua a ranking chinese communist official had as it turned out a younger brother in hong kong daniella immediately put him under surveillance within a span often days she had a complete detailed picture of the familys movements with that in mind she contacted zhang and made her pitch he refused that was no surprise daniella then ordered the brothers wife picked up and held zhang held out for fortyeight hours before terrified he capitulated daniella had not released the brothers wife until she had received and evaluated the first piece of intelligence still she had been skeptical that was only natural so zhang had fed her three further bits of intelligence at roughly monthlong intervals all had proven to be of a very high grade indeed in the beginning daniella was tempted to take her triumph to karpov and thus earn herself a medal but almost immediately she had second thoughts and the more she thought about it the more she was certain that she could have her kudos and her own private pipeline into beijing as well as the medea intelligence was transmitted she first very carefully screened it passing on one tiny chunk at a time testing the waters the day she ran the raid on the heavywater installation in sinkiang was her most serious test her people arrested three engineers who had somehow been turned by the chinese that put her under karpovs scrutiny of course he wanted to know her source it was easy to lie and the fabrication she gave himthat suspicions had filtered up the line and had eventually been reported to her officewas perfectly plausible she did indeed get her medal and kept medea to herself now as she read this latest report she was very glad that she had it told her that there was a bitter internal struggle being waged within the chinese government over the eventual disposition of hong kong basically there were two camps the traditional hardliners wished to assume complete control of the crown colony in they still smarted under the way in which sovereign chinese soil had been extorted under the most heinous duress from the empress in they felt shamed that others ran a corner of their country so successfully and that it was assumed worldwide that the chinese communists could not it was imperative if china was ever going to stand shouldertoshoulder with the other major powers they felt to prove that it had the modern business wherewithal to do it on the obverse of this coin stood the socalled modernists these the medea intelligence reported were more basically chinese in naturethat is truer to the spirit of the nation than to the communist ethos they believed that because the trappings of communism afforded them power in the most populous country on earth they were reconciled to using it but only superficially the modernists were convinced that if china was ever to rise into the twentieth century as a viable power it had to adopt the ways of the westat least for some time to come it also needed vast infusions of capital to disrupt the freewheeling daytoday dealing of the chinese in hong kong was to risk cutting off this supply of money into china or at the very least severely hamstring it to the point where it would be all but useless over the past six years or so daniella knew from her own research the communist chinese had become much more active in business within the crown colony their profits were burgeoning as were hers since she had instituted her pilot program there but that she had known from the beginning was merely a start which was precisely the reason for her institution of medea now she came to the kernel of the report one of the modernists an official of the highest rank was mounting a hong kong operation its objectives appeared to be twofold according to medea one was to ensure that the modernists would eventually have their way in the crown colony the other was purportedly to gain control clandestinely of all monetary and bullion transactions passing through hong kong and macao to control hong kong it was daniellas fondest dream but until this point it had in all reality been an untouchable one karpovs almost obsessive drive to get moonstone on line disturbed her even more so when lantins intervention had begun to make it a reality the soviet unions wanton display of military force throughout asia was in her opinion at least a dangerous course to take karpov and lantin seemed like a pair of teenage hoodlums playing chicken in an old jalopy only the car they were up against was the property of china and the vehicles were loaded with nuclear warheads daniella knew there must be another way to gain control of china besides threatening her borders hong kong was that way as soon as she had made sure of medea she was certain of it if medea could get her inside the communist chinese operation she knew she could gain control of it once she was overseeing the bullion traffic in and out of the colony she could have it all all that wealth flowing into and out of macao it went unreported it was untraceable tradinghouse profitsat least partiallywere washed that way vast amounts that bypassed even stockholder dividends and which found their devious way into numbered swiss bank accounts that could be opened only by the tai pan themselvesthis was how trading had been done in hong kong for more than a century to have at ones fingertips the ebb and flow of such wealth was a dream come true with such knowledge daniella could tap into the resources of any trading house in hong kong their secrets would be open to her the tai pan would do her bidding rather than be caught out daniella reread the passage her pulse rate began to climb oh she thought oh oh oh dare i believe this at all the thought of gaining control of such an operation and turning it to her own endsto realize her dream dizzied her she fought to catch her breath this is pure gold she thought if it is correct if what proof was medea offering she took several deep breaths so that she could finish the report without the cyrillic letters swimming before her eyes information sketchy as yet she read but i caution you not to confuse lack of detail with lack of veracity intelligence gleaned from highest possible source operation somehow revolves around nonnational westerner named john bluestone he is one of the jive tai pan heading five star pacific one of the top trading houses in colony bluestone daniella thought good god how is that possible she read on this fact photographed directly from officials file print enclosed daniella turned to the last sheet a highresolution blackandwhite photograph enlarged to eightbyeleveninch size from a drawer she extracted an oblong magnifying glass carefully she ran it over the blowup she stopped when she came to the chop the signature seal of the official of the highest rank whose brainchild the hong kong operation was carefully she copied out the ideograms reading the result over to herself shi zilin she said out loud now she had her proof three oaths tsun was seated at the best table at the chiuchow restaurant in causeway bay at his right hand sat a stunning chinese woman with a flat highcheekboned face that successfully rose to dramatic heights employing only a minimum of makeup it was a face that looked equally as wonderful in bed in the early morning as it did beneath glittering lights at night to three oaths tsuns left was the twentyfootlong case filled with row upon row of swallows nests whose prices ranged anywhere from four to one hundred hong kong dollars as he had done many patrons picked out their choices which were then made into the most indescribably delicious soup picking the right nest was of course an art as was every culinary element in china and three oaths tsun prided himself on being a master he had just presented his mistress neon chow with an emerald necklace neon chow worked for the governor and during the day she was as demure as her job demanded one of the things she adored about three oaths tsun was that he seemed to enjoy her in her natural state she had squealed uninhibitedly when she opened the box and had not waited to put her present on before launching herself across the littered table throwing her arms around three oaths tsun eeeeya but its beautiful she cried a lock of thick black hair had come undone and now swept dramatically across the side of her wide brow three oaths tsun looked at her and felt a stirring not only in his sacred member but further northward in the area of his heart he was constantly amazed at how this young girlshe was just twentythreeaffected him just by a movement of her exquisitely graceful arm just by touching his shoulder in private or by laughing and thus filling a room when they were out she could elate him past his wildest imaginings and when he thought we experience the clouds and the rain oh ko three oaths tsun summoned the waiter and barked an order for tie quart yin a fine oolong tea known as iron goddess of mercy it was so strong and expensive that it was served in cups the size of a thimble im glad we have this time together she said i was beginning to think that you were tired of me what does that necklace tell you presents are all well and good she said drawing her lips into the pouty shape that drove him wild but you have been spending so much time with bliss i was becoming concerned business matters need not concern you heya what business could you have with your own daughter what are you deaf the pout intensified but now he was inured to it his mind had switched gears which was bad for neon chow and she knew it you treat me like a child sometimes i am not a teenager i have a very responsible job she tossed her head i do not think the governor would speak to me in this way then open your jade gate for the governor three oaths tsun said shortly governor or no governor he is still gwai loh i had no idea you were so enamored of their fornicating barbarian ways neon chow knew that she had pushed him over the edge i am sorry that i am jealous her voice dropped to a husky whisper when i am not near you i think about you constantly if i wish to be near you more do i deserve to be treated like a sack of garbage three oaths tsun grunted that meant hed think about it if she was good neon chow drank in the look on his face and put one perfectly sculptured hand over his her eyes were as dark as the night as lustrous as the gemstones in her new necklace the nails scratched his skin with great delicacy even a certain amount of modesty i love my present neon chow said fingering the emeralds where they lay glowing and mysterious in the hollow of her throat i love you beneath the table three oaths tsuns sacred member began again to unfurl rage the red heart of darkness consumed him in the aftermath of the storm he gathered his strength about him rage was like a cloak warming him healing his wounds or at least soothing their pain he saw the outlines of the stone lodge on the far side of the chasm and knew he wanted to be there he followed the ragged lip of the scree to his left for several hundred yards when he was certain there was no way around there he retraced his steps and eventually found the rubble and mudstrewn slope down into the shallow glen gray mist clung like coils of gauze and he went down into it skinning the heels of his hands as the loose earth gave way beneath him he fell back continuing his slide downward reaching the floor he went quickly through the mist his breath was hot and his heart hammered mercilessly rage there was no sky no horizon the world had turned nacreous giving him the sensation of being inside a shell echoes piling one atop the other of his progress a falcons cry the dree dree dree of insects the swift rustling of a stoat or badger through the underbrush a mosaic of elementalism jake was oblivious to the beauty all around him climbing out on the far side of the glen he went across to the spot where he had first seen mariana on the way the blood on the high grass stained his trouser legs he saw the flat rock where she had fallen the rain had washed it clean he lifted his head nichiren he called where are you red red rage building nichiren he howled like an animal im going to kill you he stopped before the house the front door was open the engawa was deserted a soft tinkling and jake turned his head furin the bells of summer children playing on the shoreline laughing carefree alive hot tears slid down his face mariana he thought mariana ive killed you inside he looked around he saw two wet qi boards set up in midmatch saw a third on the floor the black and white stones scattered to the four corners of the room he went to one lifted off a white piece it was so easy to kill a stone just take it off the board but a human being was another matter the thought that mariana was gone confused him what would life be like without her for three years he had all but ignored her they had made love infrequently never once in all that time had he felt anything save a certain localized relief when he came the stone man isnt that what she had called him once finally she had turned her confusion and frustration into rage to try to get through to him why am i here if youve got nothing to give me jake she had screamed when we got married we were in love i with you you with me or at least i thought so my god in heaven dont you see whats happened to you the sumchun river has destroyed all the love all the humanity you had inside you whatever it was that made me fall in love with you is gone jake do you understand jake the stone man the quarrys the place for you all right better by far than the filthy streets of hong kong would the marocs have felt the same way he did not know they had spent so much time talking to him about his dead mother and father he had had a sense of them though he could not even bring the image of his father to mind they had given him the piece of the fu it was his legacy they told him his link with his past proof of his parents love for him whether the marocs had made up much of what they told him he never knew he suspected that it made no difference his sense of what his parents had been like was all that mattered how he wished that they were here now his sense of their loss flooded through him again mingling with the pain he felt for mariana oh buddha he thought i have nothing again i have nothing darkness all around him this place was filled with shadows what it needs is a little light he thought just a spark in a corner he found a stack of kerosene cans all but one was full rage it made coherent thought an impossibility he ripped open the cans hurling the liquid all over the place again and again until there was no more left then he backed to the front door out onto the engawa only the slight tinkling of the arm to keep him company memories clawing at him lit a match and threw it boom like thunder echoing down the mountainside greasy ball of black and crimson rising upward dissipating the clinging mist turning it lurid colors jake sat on the shaking ground hands clasped around his drawnup knees watching the flames lick up engulfing the stone as they ate away at the ancient wooden beams the house groaned in giving up its long life jake was crying again he was sorry for what his rage had made him do just as he was sorry for what his spite had made him do he felt ashamed once as a very small boy long before he met fo saan he had stoned a frog to death he had come across it on the bank of a river it was huge ugly squatting like an idol unmoving at first jake threw a stone at it simply to see it move but when the creature did not oblige jake grew inexplicably angry he threw another stone and another his anger turned to rage at the stupid frog now he threw the stones to hit it and still the animal refused to move then quite suddenly it couldnt move it was dead that same feeling of shame and remorse now engulfed jake and he put his head down resting it on his forearms how much time passed he could not say perhaps he slept in any case nightmare images rode his mind mariana wreathed in flames calling to him mariana on the rock bleeding he reaching out to her straining shoving her off into the abyss mariana watching him as he made love to bliss squeezing her breasts opening her thighs nuzzling her mount with his lips mariana at a river ford twisting thighdeep in eddying water her blood flung into his face blinding him his hand around a smooth stone his arm arcing his fingers letting go the stone striking her splitting her face open no his head started up had he screamed out loud had he been dreaming his face was covered in sweat and he had begun to shiver night surrounded him starlight covered him in luminescent blue he sat still he listened to the crickets hum the foraging of nocturnal predators he heard the wind roving through the grasses rustling the treetops he began to gather his thoughts he saw that it had been foolish to come here on his own it was obvious that he needed help but this wasnt hong kong he had no real friends here no one he could turn to certainly he could not allow anyone in his network of informants to see him in this state they needed to respect him if they were to continue working for him he breathed deeply and thought of fo saan what was it that he had once said there will come a time my son when you will find yourself in enemy territory pitted against overwhelming odds when even your friends have become your adversaries enemy territory was surely where he found himself now hadnt stallings killed mariana stallings and the quarry why why was mariana with nichiren the two impossibilities seemed linked stallings was not the villain he was a company man who had given the orders beridien donovan wunderman the last thought was chilling but jake could not discount the possibility how much was he ignorant of with so many unanswered questions he could make no hasty assumptions take no rash action he had a score to settle with the quarry but there was a tangled web to be unraveled first patience and nichiren his first target only one thing was certain he was effectively cut off from quarry headquarters if you dont know who to trust trust no one the filthy dangerous backstreets of hong kong had taught him that important lesson early on when you find yourself in enemy territory pitted against overwhelming odds fo saan had counseled seek aid if you believe there is no one to help you that is the time to change your patterns of thought know that aid may be found in the most unlikely places jake pondered this he sought every avenue old and new each time he arrived back at the same conclusion there was only one person in japan to whom he could go for help on the face of it it seemed an absurd notion but he thought again of fo saans words and they buoyed him well what do i have to lose he asked himself at first light he was already making his way back down the mountainside known as the sword zhang hua pushed his thicklensed spectacles up against the bridge of his nose as he came into the drab office the gesture did no good the glasses slipped down his wide nose a moment later outside through the poorly made panes of glass the steamy expanse of tian an men square wavered as if seen through the haze of a mighty trucks exhaust are you feeling better today comrade minister he asked as he dropped a sheaf of dossiers into the wire basket on the desk shi zilin grunted all but ignoring him he was engrossed in a raft of communications flimsies that zhang hua had observed had been handdelivered to him a moment ago by uniformed courier you look well zhang hua said watching zilin carefully sorting the flimsies into two stacks in truth he thought the minister looked decidedly unwell his color was pale and zhang hua was certain he detected an increase in the tremor in the old mans hands perhaps the acupuncture treatments were no longer working zilins eyes darted upward clashing with zhang huas intense gaze and like a child caught out the assistant averted his gaze slightly you are sweating my friend he said focusing his attention are you unwell im quite all right comrade minister come come zilin said reaching out a hand we neednt be so formal among ourselves eh zhang hua he saw the direction of his assistants gaze close the door and sit here near me my friend when zhang hua had complied zilin closed the dossier cover on the flimsies he had been reading his old black eyes studied the younger mans face the passing years had dimmed none of their intelligent luster he lifted up a cloisonne pot and a matching cup from a low wooden table at his side have some tea that will serve to restore you he poured handed over the cup the tremor in his hand was particularly noticeable it is tepid im afraid i no longer tolerate the heat as well as i did in my youth the tea cools me now as it used to warm me years ago the two men drank together he looked into zhang huas eyes i made a decision early in life to become a celestial guardian of china those who follow me must accept that burden i know lao shi but this situation with wu aiping cannot fail to generate dire consequences for us i fear that he is too powerful for us he is so young for one with such enormous power he is the head of the most powerful academy in china their sole purpose is to find the military deterrents to the danger from the soviets all along our border the gun aligned against you could not have found a better leader his militancy has an appalling following in beijing it appears to be growing each day if wu aiping should prevail he shuddered openly as his words drifted off zilin sighed putting aside his teacup i saw this future my friend oh i dont mean wu aiping specifically but certainly someone like him yes he is strong he may even defeat us but we must not stop trying without us china is doomed we are its future i knew that a long time ago just as i knew that i was needed to help shape it but i also understood that to do so required enormous concentration and sacrifice i could not have it all as those others who rose and fell on the hubris of their selfaggrandizement did chiang mao all the others felt that their selves could encompass the world they were wrong only i have survived from that time zhang hua because of my dedication not to myself like a buddhist monk i had my god to which i dedicated my entire life to serve china as i did i was required to divest myself of as it were all earthly possessions all for a time the only sound the two men heard was the whirring of the metal fan standing atop the filing cabinet across the room as it swiveled they in their turn could feel the clammy air brush across their faces sometimes zhang hua said with a slight tremor in his voice it is important to know when one is outmatched my friend is that what you believe of us now after all our time together have you so easily lost your faith faith is something one must never give up zhang hua said out of the corner of his eye he watched the tremor in the senior ministers hands i did not mean to give you that impression good now finish your tea zhang hua i promised your father i would take care of you and i am a man of my word he closed his eyes again and thought about sacrifice all the manipulation he had done and still continued to do all the human lives he had set dancing to a rhythm only he controlled was this the future he had truly envisioned for china he knew that it was talking of sacrifice was all well and good but one only understood its true nature after one acted how long has it been he wondered since i have experienced true happiness he considered this for some time but still the answer eluded him stallings had wanted to go riding he had even gone so far as to call the stablemaster at the movie house to prepare his stallion then he changed his mind right in the middle of a spoonful of wheaties and strawberries he got up and canceled his appointment left his halfeaten breakfast on the table and drove to the office on h street he had slept on the flight back from japan but not soundly he had dreamt of being pursued he was in a dark forest on horseback he was making his way from the scene of a termination somehow he had been found out branches whipped at his face and shoulders though he tried to duck the trees continued to scourge him until he was raw and bleeding on every exposed area then his shirt began to be flailed away he became convinced that he was being punished but for what he had carried out his assignment without a slipup he had killed again then it occurred to him that he had killed the wrong person the thought terrified him and that was the moment when he became aware that he was being pursued how was that possible he had been so careful as always still he could hear the clatter of horses hooves behind him he urged his own mount on this served only to intensify the scourging he made no swifter progress with the pounding of the pursuit loud in his ears he dug his heels into his horses flanks bending lower over the creatures whipping mane he shouted to it striking it on the side of its neck to increase its gait shadows climbed his back pressing in on him from all sides he could not see the sky blood was flowing freely from his lacerated skin in hot streams the faster he went the more severely he was punished why the sounds of pursuit grew louder and stallings turned his head to look back saw the riderless horse nostrils flared eyes glowing demonically he had screamed so loudly that two flight attendants came running one of them the young woman with the auburn hair and the beauty mark at the corner of her mouth stayed and eventually gave him her phone number so it hadnt been a total loss the dream haunted stallings at home taking a hot shower to wash the grime of travel off him eating indifferent chinese food out of cartons sticky with soy sauce and monosodium glutamate making love with donna the auburnhaired flight attendant at the health club as he worked out with free weights and nautilus unlike other dreams of his it had not faded away into the night or even into the clear light of day that was why he had canceled his ride had leapt into the car before finishing his breakfast the dream would not let him be it had somehow struck a familiar tone even as it had engendered a deepseated fright in him why he was about to find out seated in his windowless office stallings activated his terminal the quarry had had built for it a xicor computer several generations beyond what was normally in business use the gpr mainframe was housed in a temperature and humiditycontrolled dustfree environment deep within the bowels of the quarry building stallings closed his eyes for a moment recalling the long line of access codes that would pass him into the deeper and more secretive layers of the computers memory he thought of the riderless horse he thought of catching mariana maroc in his sights of pulling the trigger one two three the bullets popping in the sonic static of the storm squeezed out into the night he saw her flung across the heath surprise in her wideopen eyes lost her in the storm for moments then found her stretched against the rock jake on him now saw her take the long plunge into darkness he thought of the riderless horse and the russians up on the sword it was ironic stallings thought if jake hadnt taken care of them so efficiently mariana maroc might still be alive maybe the riderless horse the russians what the hell were they doing there if they had penetrated the operation but wunderman had made no comment at the airport when he picked stallings up debriefing him in the car on the way to stallings federalperiod clapboard house on s street in georgetown it was just a block away from dumbarton oaks and stallings had very much resented the senior officers intrusion on his own peaceful turf his home was his home period he never took his work there besides the auburnhaired flight attendant was on her way although as it turned out the spectre of the riderless horse had made that encounter something less than sublime stallings opened his eyes saw the monday access open graphic glowing on the screen the gpr had seven access levels graded by the day of the week monday was the least sensitive sunday the most sensitive agents and officers obtained access codes to more sensitive levels as they rose within the quarry hierarchy stallings as one of the inner council of five which included the president had access up to and including the seventh level though he had never bothered to delve that deep thursday was his most familiar ground the area he used most often when deliberating one of his thorny field problems now after three hours at that level he found it inadequate he could find no answer for the presence of the russians he sat back and pressed his thumbs into his eye sockets massaging gently looking into those phosphor lights still bothered him it was that they were not just russians he thought now or even kgb operatives there were always a contingent of those wherever he was he had learned to live with them as a poor man learns to live with cockroaches in his tenement apartment no these men had been something special department s kvr that was general vorkutas area and stallings macho man though he was had learned to respect that particular womans intelligence and field acumen units under her command had ruined two of his prior operationsand tried for a thirdover the last two years in angola lebanon andwhich was itguatemala yes he had difficulty with those central american countries they all looked alike to him the first time had been the most hairraisingthat race down the guatemalan mountainside in a car ten years past the time it should have been condemned but the third time in angola had been the worst two slugs in him shoulder and upper arma third missing his head by a fraction all kvr all designed by general vorkuta stallings had quickly learned respect for her he swiveled his chair around punched out another access code friday access open his fingers flew over the keys like stroking the flank of a horse he went through the procedure of accessing kvr operations backtracking wunderman had said to him is often the best way to work the memory bank if youve got a problem in the present its often got a tail in the past thirtysix in this list and he began the tedious task of going through each file in detail found the guatemalan operation rechecked the date to make certain it coincided with his operation routine information until he came to the end and discovered an electronic footnote did a search but could find no trace of it on this level fingers dancing saturday access open found it down here matas sandinar dieshere the readout gave a date of some three days after stallings operation had gone awryof acicote poisoning stallings stopped there disconcerted he had read the news reports of the death of sandinar who was then the republics president it had been of a massive myocardial infarction heart attack what was this about a poisoning stallings thought this over sandinar had been a strong and bitter antagonist of carlo guerrerra stallings target after sandinars death guerrerra had gained in power fully doubling his ragtag insurgent armyuntil six months later stallings had reentered guatemala and terminated the rebel leader he went on accessing the kvr operations on this level found angola and again a footnote not on this level he quickly checked for lebanon could not find it and went deeper sunday access open the electronic asterisk surfaced like a cork chojo mtuba dies of asphyxiation due to crushing of cricoid cartilage date given was one week after stallings operation published reports had mtubas death due to a fatal fall from a horse that had reared unexpectedly shying from a snake again as in the guatemalan operation mtuba had been the general of the faction opposing insurgents led by stallings intended target these were but two of stallings many operations but what stuck out for him were the notations of assassination they were so written and so placed as to seem to be the instigation of the quarry but that was patently impossible to order the termination of sandinar and mtuba was unthinkable totally against quarry policy stallings remembered the russians on the sword the riderless horse he went on and found lebanon it was buried in a series of noncompatible files like a gemstone in rubble if he hadnt been still learning to use the computer he doubted whether he would have found it at all he wondered why it should be here as far as he was concerned it had been little more than routine yes he had discovered the kvr team on his tail but after guatemala he had been on his guard and he had picked them up shortly after he arrived he had planned a feint and had employed it to perfection using the russians own favorite weapon disinformation thus while the kvr team was waiting for him to show at what they believed was the rdv point he was across the city putting a bullet through mahmed aiqassars head from three hundred yards termination complete the end of one of the most powerful and feared prosoviet faction leaders in the middle east in and out in thirtysix hours and how do you like that one general vorkuta why was it here on the seventh and most sensitive level eventually through more donkey work he found out he wished he hadnt the answer was buried in an adjacent file another electronic asterisk since this was the deepest level there was obviously nowhere else to put it mahmed alqassar he read terminatedhere it gave the correct dateas directed double agent for timothy laine stallings eyes bugged no he thought it cant be timothy laine was director of the central intelligence agency in a kind of cold frenzy stallings returned to the lebanon file thinking could i have killed one of our own agents how could it have happened went to the end of the file it stopped in midsentence he tapped the access file key over and over but got nothing he scrolled the screen it went blank then remembering his lessons he tapped the control bar and was confronted with this continuation of file strictly classified eyes only quarry director use access code for yahu what stallings asked himself in the name of christ is yahu it took him three calls the last to a linguist and a trip to the library of congress to find out yahu it seemed was a burmese word in their culture it was the term for the eighth day of the week what came into jakes mind now was a fragment of the calligraphy on the scroll hanging in mikio komotos house when the general punishes a criminal the heart of the army is sternly controlled he suspected now that it was the generals mentality so expressly spelled out on that banner which controlled komoto he knew he desperately needed to understand the man before he was to confront him otherwise he knew after what he had done inside the yakuza oyabuns house he would have no chance in the encounter komoto would punish him as an example to his troops it was to komotos house that jake had come as he drove out of the alps this was because the oyabun was the only one of jakes enemies who had the potential of being turned into an ally much of this depended on what kind of man komoto was beneath his outer mask and this was what would make the next several hours so tricky and so hazardous jake would have to play much of this by ear changing his tactics as komoto revealed more and more of himself if he was a greedy man jake could use that if he was a moral one that too could be an advantage michi the path jake would have to find the right one if he was to have any chance of finding nichiren and the fu shard that mariana had taken from him it was somewhat earlier in the evening than when jake had last been here he approached the house the same way this time however he saw two cars at the side of the house one he recognized as komotos this one was nearest the lightbathed side entrance now he came again to the manicured hedges beyond he found the private garden curious about its unnatural elongated shape he detoured down its long length at its far end he found the answer it was not a total surprise beneath the boughs of a slender cryptomeria jake discovered a marumono it was strung up by a length of cord he raised a hand set it in motion swinging back and forth like a pendulum it set off memories in him like the ripples made by a stone thrown into a still lake the marumono was one of three traditional targets for kyujutsu a dowel stuffed with straw or cotton batting then covered with tanned hide for centuries the bow and arrow had been the chief weapon of the japanese soldier the samurai alone were allowed to use sword and bow and arrow the common man used pike and staff as his weaponry kyujutsu was the martial art of archery the reason the marumono was hung stemmed from archerys origins which according to fo saan at least emerged with the warrior on horseback thus in training one learned to hit a variety of targets including moving ones this was marumono the most difficult of all of them in feudal times every samurai household had a variety of yaba or archery ranges for target practice jake saw that times had not changed all that much making a sudden decision he returned to the front of the house and after walking steadily up the stone pathway knocked on the door in a moment it opened toshi stood framed in the doorway he blinked when he saw jake he looked as if he had seen one of the guardians of hell his hand went to his waistband he pointed a snubnosed at the center of jakes stomach jake stood very still he thought about raising his hands over his head but keeping careful watch on toshis face he decided to make no move at all instead he worked on his breathing he did not like guns he had never trained with one but this was not why he had a healthy fear of them it had been his experience that men did not use guns rather boys played with them in the hands of an accomplished assassin the long gun was an effective tool of the trade otherwise jake had found firearms useless handguns were bulky difficult to smuggle through airport security erratic and worst of all addictive they were the lazy persons solution to managing perilous situations with a gun one didnt have to think one pointed and shot the same solution for all problems lazy thinking besides it was dangerous to rely so heavily on any mechanical system the boys attitude again it was reflected most heavily in the mystique of the gunfighter regarding toshi jake saw that he was no different from all the rest he was in love with his gunin love with the power it gave him over others always seek out the weakness of spirit in your opponent fo saan had said jake knew he had found it in toshi that did not make him any less dangerous only somewhat more manageable i want to see komotosan jake said youll see what i tell you to see toshi said iteki he waved his in jakes direction maybe i should shoot your kneecaps one by one his smite was like the rictus of a corpse that way youll understand how you must look up to us tell komotosan that i have an urgent message for him toshi laughed tell him yourself the muzzle of the gun described a circle up to jakes heart down to his groin you apparently consider this house open to you so go on past me see how far you get his face was getting darker as blood began to suffuse it jake thought that soon he would have to intervene or risk getting shot tell komotosan tell komotosan what jake saw a figure in the darkness of the hallway just behind toshi he saw the yakuza stiffen but he had already recognized the voice i do not seek to cross you oyabun jake said remembering komotos threat now you whine at me mr richardson what next will you grovel at my feet and ask forgiveness the distaste in his voice was obvious i thought that you did not have conversations with barbarians there was silence jake knew he was playing an exceedingly dangerous game komoto could have him killed here on his doorstep and no one in japan would ask a question but jake knew he had no choice time was precious to him and he needed to prick beneath the traditional armor of the man this is hardly a conversation komoto said i hear only the sounds of the crickets and of my own voice this is what i came to tell you jake said knowing he was playing his last card my name is jake maroc i killed keii kisan with a jerk of his shadowed head the oyabun said bring him inside take him to the sixtatami room and hold him there until im ready toshi did as he was told his cold eyes staring hard at jake daring him to make a move against him when jake did nothing he reached out with his free hand and violently dragged jake over the threshold he kicked the door shut and said shoes jake took them off and stooping at toshis silent direction stowed them in the wooden closet beside the door when he looked up komoto was gone toshi took him down the dimly lit hallway through an open fusuma into the same room to which he had first been taken toshi stood him opposite the tokonoma no doubt on purpose there was an extraordinary stillness throughout the house it was as if the night had closed in all around them he became aware of a small purling and looking across the room saw the bottom of the scroll fluttering he shifted his gaze saw that the shoji screens out to the garden were open the darkness had a physical presence there seemed to be no stars no moon rather a velvet blanket flowed into the room from outside the heat of the day had not yet dissipated and that too seemed an element of the blackness jake closed his eyes he could hear his own breath and in a moment toshis he tried to judge the others emotional state by the depth and rhythm of his breathing he could feel the tenseness coming from the yakuza in waves he would have to remember that when komoto entered the room he was dressed as a samurai from the eighteenth century would have been he wore a loosefitting darkcolored silk blouse and the traditional black hakama the divided skirt of the archer he did not even look at jake merely jerked his head at toshi and said outside the yakuza reached out with his free hand and pushed at jakes shoulder jake went across the room the other two men following outside he found himself in the kyujutsu garden he was at the near end he saw several bows lined up on a rack they were all between seven and eight feet tall the traditional longbow made out of sections of bamboo beside them was a yadate a cylindrical stand bristling with arrows he felt toshi coming up behind him and feeling the other mans hand on his shoulder wondered whether he should take him now but he saw no point in that it was to be kyujutsu he had already learned several important things about komoto jake knew him better now than he had before if he took toshi down now he knew that source of information would come to an end and he could not afford that they took him down to the far end of the garden the marumono swung slightly from the cryptomeria you know what to do he heard komoto say the voice seemed odd and floaty in the darkness as if it emanated from a wraith jake felt a cord being wrapped around his wrists he grimaced as toshi jerked it tight knotting it then toshi turned him around so that he was facing the other end of the garden so far away the end where the bows and arrows stood at attention waiting patiently toshi no longer held his gun instead he had a length of rope in his hands he backed jake just behind the marumono so that his back was against the bole of the cryptomeria then he bound him to the tree so tightly that there was no possibility of movement the marumono hung just in front of jakes face obscuring his vision lying is a punishable offense he heard komotos voice drifting toward him as is breaking and entering assaulting a clan member yakuza business is yakuza business oyabun do not grovel iteki komotos voice had turned disdainful you were warned and you ignored that warning i cannot say that i am surprised you are a barbarian now you must take your punishment jake felt komotos presence moving away from him but not toshis in a moment the yakuza reached out set the marumono to swinging in its arc across the plane of jakes face back and forth ticking off the seconds the night was still hot ticklock the marumonos arc an endless time when there was nothing to see nothing to hear jake felt himself back on cheung chau thighdeep in the south china sea surrounded by mist calling for fo saan then he heard the sharp buzzing the sound quickening with terrifying rapidity until it cut through the heaviness of the night the first arrow struck home david oh put the key into the lock of jake and marianas apartment in hong kong islands mid levels the door swung inward and he stepped over the threshold he smelled a commingling of scents hints of past cooking of marianas perfume a light film of dust lay here and there out the windows dusk was almost done streetlights shone and far below in the harbor slow junks were moving back to port their sails black wings against the last amethyst light it was dinnertime he went slowly through the rooms david oh was at a loss to say what he was looking for something out of place perhaps a clue to marianas motivations a hint of where jake had disappeared to surely jake had maintained security with mariana therefore what could she know what secrets could she tell nichiren about their inner workings still david ohs stomach would not stop its uncomfortable fluttering the coppery taste of fear would not leave his mouth he felt as if he had been swallowing blood all morning he was praying to all the gods that jake had not gone off to japan on his own he came out of the bathroom nothing he wandered into the kitchen through the panes of glass he looked down on a small driveway below which the garage entrance lay the expanse of oilstained concrete was unutterably ugly compared with the mistshrouded view of the island and beyond the harbor kowloon a great dusky jewel glowing in its setting of the south china sea he turned back into the room glassware and china sat in the sink unwashed there was one plate with bits of food still stuck to it at the round wood table beside it was a wineglass still partially full taking hold of the thin stem he lifted it up to his nose and sniffed a fullbodied red mariana jake would have preferred sake she left in a hell of a hurry he thought that wasnt like mariana she was neat and very disciplined no dirty dishes in her sink yet here they were he peered again into the sink the food scraps in these plates seemed less dried out he poked a finger and broke the scummy skin definitely less dry someone had eaten here after mariana left but who not jake he would already have been in tokyo david oh leaned over peering more closely at the jumble of dishes greasy and oily spots were always the best places to start around food that made it easier he took a roll of professionalwidth magic tape out of his jacket pocket ripped off two twoinch strips these he placed judiciously over the raised rim of two of the plates he counted off thirty seconds then peeled each off with a slow steady tear it was important not to jerk since this could distort the tape quickly now he reapplied the tape strips to a clean plain white index card he returned to the window and stared at his handiwork what he saw beneath the protective covering of the tape were two perfect fingerprint impressions he pocketed the card and went out of the kitchen thinking maybe this is nothing at all something in his gut told him otherwise fornicate unnaturally all our enemies he said into the empty rooms grinning toshi came to pull the marumono away from the left side of jakes face the arrow that komoto had loosed at him in the darkness had punctured the target with such force that it had pushed it back because it had struck the marumono at the point in its swing where it had just cleared jakes face the target had thunked heavily against his ear and cheek toshis hand reached out feeling at the back of jakes trousers how are you doing brave iteki he said have you soiled yourself yet he grunted no well we have time to prove you the barbarian you are he withdrew from jakes sight set the marumono to swinging again this time because of the added weight of the arrow its arc was through a narrower range it barely cleared jakes head on either side darkness the oppressive night closing down the heat seeping up off the ground jake could feel the beginnings of dew wetting his toes ticklock a leaden pendulum before his eyes silence jake thought of the south china sea lapping at his legs he thought of fo saan and wondered if what he was building for himself was a house of illusions terror lurked just around the next dark corner of his consciousness but if it was an illusion it was all that stood between calmness and fear he drew it to him like a steel curtain cloaking himself angry whirring splitting apart the night scarcely time to breathe he could feel his body closing down at its extremities and it worried him that was the result of the tendrils of fear creeping through the interstices of his illusion perhaps he was not safe at all dont think breathe he told himself breathe but it was difficult knowing what was buzzing its way toward him through the blackness thunk like a pistols report and an instant before he had felt the stirring of the tiny breeze presaging its arrival death the marumono slapped him sharply on his right ear two arrows were now in its center he was certain the point had missed his cheekbone by only a millimeter or two he felt the sweat trickling down beneath his arms across the small of his back someone was laughing toshi stepped into his field of view drew the heavy target away from him hot night he said and laughed again jake felt a stinging and blinked his eyes rapidly to rid himself of the sensation sweat rolling into them toshi felt at jakes crotch this time he could not keep his disappointment from showing sweat iteki he said jake could feel another presence komoto came slowly down the long lane of the garden he held a longbow in his left hand he said nothing merely watched jake with hooded eyes as toshi checked to make sure the bonds were still secure this time he said at last i will use this he held up a length of cotton it was a blindfold then he turned and went back down to the far end of the garden this will be good toshi said setting the marumono swinging and stepping away the target was now so heavy that its arc did not clear jakes head but merely swung from one side of it to another jake tried not to focus on them but he kept seeing the serrated blades of the two arrows sticking through the center of the target if he extended his head forward his nose would brush against them he felt the tunnel that both separated him from and linked him with komoto he was totally at the oyabuns mercy perhaps that had been the point of this from the beginning a lesson in humility an example of power jake knew that mikio komoto held his life in the palm of his hand but he had known that from the moment he presented himself at the oyabuns door this evening now the moment of truth was at hand beneath it all what kind of man was mikio komoto jake could guess at it but in a moment he knew he would come face to face with the answer calmness fo saan had said will eventually teach you all you need know about victory he thought of that now repeating it as if it were a mantra that would keep him from harm heard the far off rustling rushing up on him with appalling speed heard the sound equally with both his ears and knew that it was headed at the center of his face ticklock the marumono swung he marked its movements in increments of darkness lighter darker lighter side center side if the arrow struck during one of the lighter moments he was dead ticklock lighter darker lighter thock utter darkness and jake felt the target swinging in toward the bridge of his nose with less of a motion than before he focused saw the point of the third arrow aligned with the two others dead center it was some time before the marumono was taken away from in front of his face and when it was done it was not toshi standing there perhaps we have allowed the punishment to fit the crimes mikio komoto said if i committed any crimes at all jake said in a reedy whisper it was desperation that drove me to them nichiren had my wife i needed to know where they were that is why i went to the sarakin to get to you i hoped that you would help me more lies komoto said coldly what could an iteki like you have to do with nichiren i want him now my wife is dead it happened last night up on the sword tsurugi komoto seemed surprised you were up on tsurugi during the storm jake nodded i found nichirens hideaway stealing into my house komoto said attacking one of my men that is what you did i do not want to hear any more of your iteki lies he began to turn away it is the poor general who refuses to listen to information that could be vital to him the oyabun spat who are you to talk of what generals do and do not do i know that a good general must use all the resources available to him if he is to taste victory komotos black eyes narrowed what talk i killed keii kisan in front of nichirens eyes words komoto said shortly all i hear from you are words then let me prove my words by deed komoto stood stockstill he did not want to show his consternation he was canny enough to know that he had been outmaneuvered he had no choice but to honor jakes request now otherwise he would lose enormous face he called to toshi unbind the iteki yes oyabun his wrists as well when toshi had complied komoto grunted and said bring him along at the other end of the garden komoto stopped and faced jake you will show me in deed now only a samurai could have felled keii kisan only a samurai could have penetrated ohenro house under the nose of nichiren jake chose a longbow toshi made a move to stop him but komoto waved him off a samurai should be adept in many disciplines jake said kyujutsu is one of the most important but i am not telling you anything you dont already know neh he selected an arrow with a serrated tip went to stand in a line with the hanging target will toshisan set it to swinging thinking this a bluff komoto signed for the other man to do as jake wished but oyabun do you think me incapable of defending myself he snapped do as you are told then come back here komoto turned back to jake at this distance with no light and using the marumono i think this is a feat that the student of a fine sensei could perform even that man would be eaten alive by keii kisan he held out his hand you must use this in it was the blindfold jake took it just as toshi returned he considered the challenge for a moment before replying it is obvious that you are kyujutsu sensei oyabun tell me could you have taken on keii kisan oneonone without doubt komoto said your ignorance is showing again iteki dont you feel embarrassed it seems obvious to me jake said ignoring the others remark that you will not be convinced by a feat any less awesome than the one you have just now demonstrated jake stared hard at him will you then oyabun stand against the tree in the spot where i was standing komoto felt himself suffused with rage the bastard iteki has done it to me twice he thought very neat i cannot possibly refuse him the oyabun willed himself to relax such a deed he said would surely convince me of the truth of your words however i must insist on one stipulation toshisan will stand by your side his pistol will be against your left ear if you cannot duplicate my feat he will blow your brains out instantaneously jake watched the small smile spread across the oyabuns face their eyes were locked he felt the power struggle within which they were waging a psychological war but also for the first time he felt another emotion emanating from the yakuza chief respect grudging yes and tentative but genuine nonetheless it was a foothold jake gave a slight bow i accept your stipulation of course you do iteki komoto said of course you do he gave a sign toshisan affix the blindfold as the yakuza moved to obey jake said tell me your exact height oyabun five feet six inches tall for a japanese neh he seemed suddenly in good humor jake wondered whether it was the oyabun own form of illusion he had no way of knowing whether jake knew the first thing about kyujutsu let alone whether he was of sensei caliber jake stared at him fixing his form in his mind all right he said to toshi the blindfold settled across his eyes make certain it is not too tight he heard komotos voice say we do not want anything to discomfort the itekihe laughed againin his last moments of life jake held his breath what do you mean he could feel toshi close behind him whatever you do i think i shall have toshisan blow your brains out that was not our agreement agreements are for civilized folk komoto said his voice diminishing as he went down the garden lane not for iteki even an animal possesses honor jake said but he could not be certain that the oyabun had heard him he felt toshi moving around to his left side in a moment he felt the cold steel of the gun muzzle nestling in his ear iteki toshi said softly you are doomed no matter what you do my orders are to shoot before you even release the arrow jake made no response he fought to ignore the others words he suspected that they were putting all the screws to him now working on his fear komoto would dearly like to see him break to prove the inferiority of the barbarian jake vowed not to give him that satisfaction even so there was a nibbling at the back of his mind they might not be lying these might be his last moments he closed his mind to all outside influences he concentrated on feeling the longbow in his hands from its center all the way up to the kata the shoulder at the end against which the tsuru the bowstring was wound for some distance the string was of hemp and very hard this was a war bow rather than a ceremonial one so much the better jake stood very still he began his breathing centering himself his mind expanded as he sank into his surroundings with his mind he felt the surrounding trees the tunnel down which he would in a moment loose the arrow he felt the stirring of the night a shallow inconstant wind that he need factor in only at the last possible instant he heard the chirruping of the insects the buzzing of the white moths around the house lights he became one with the garden and in so doing found bamahk the pulse it pulled him forward in a line straight and true to the spot where mikio komoto was standing jake felt the shortarced swing of the marumono from its piece of hemp he took up ashibumi the archers stance he breathed deeply and rhythmically from deep down in his lower belly where the japanese believed all power dwelled hara he raised his left hand fitted the fletched end of the arrow to the bowstring yugame he brought the bow up into the firing position then allowed it to float down following the dictates of bamahk he could feel komotos presence as clearly as if he were only a foot away instead of a hundred yards jake began to draw the string back so that the arrow was parallel with the line of his mouth this was kai the last of the three most crucial steps in kyujutsu concentration was at its most intense now while the muscles strained to keep the bow drawn to its maximum the mind centered on the target swinging back and forth back and forth ticktock steel moving in his ear toshis sibilant whisper so long iteki ignore everything but the arrow the bowstring quivering with tension the power building in the bamboo bamahk feel the pulse ticktock the marumono swung with its bristling cluster of arrows across komotos face hanare the release zanshin was now operative that quality which allowed the kyujutsu sensei to guide the flight of the arrow all the way to its target it was akin to followthrough in the other martial arts in sports the release meant little if there was no followthrough after it zanshin heard the ziikk of the arrow hitting home then the satisfying thunk jake had been waiting for he released the bow and took the blindfold off the tickling in his left ear was gone he looked first at toshi who stood with his gun pointed at the ground his eyes were wide and staring jake turned his gaze to the far end of the garden the oyabun stood in front of the slender cryptomeria at his feet lay the marumono on its side like a discarded ragdoll its cord had been neatly severed by jakes arrow which was embedded in the tree a millimeter above mikio komotos head the gleaming black zil limousine hurtled down the chaika lane left open along major moscow thoroughfares for such official government traffic in its back seat general karpov and yuri lantin sat side by side it was dusk the streets through which they passed seemed dusty with a surfeit of sunlight as if this city were uncomfortable with such largesse could it be that instead it longed for the heavy blue snow of the long wintertime the rimed beards of those on line to visit lenins tomb the crystal exhalations of breath in the chill black mornings it was the end of the working day even among the elite of the kgb one night a week instead of returning home to his bachelor apartment on kutuzovsky prospekt lantin would invite general karpov to dine with him lantin had the reputation within the sluzhba of being something of a gourmet though he was a muscovite his taste in food was eclectic his current favorite restaurant was aragvi named after the coursing river that was well known and loved by all georgians but lantin it seemed was not the only one enamored of the place each night regardless of the weather long lines would form just after work and on into the deepening night as muscovites waited for a chance to eat at this excellent restaurant of course lantin and karpov were weekly led directly into the place always they found their table waiting gleaming with spotless cutlery lantin ordered lobio tkemali as soon as they sat down and the two of them munched on the tender kidney beans in a sour plum sauce redolent of fresh coriander while they perused the menu thick icecold vodka was poured the bottle placed in an ice bucket at karpovs left elbow well yuri karpov said taking off his glasses as he set aside the menu what will you have tonight the satsivi lantin said selecting the most famous of georgian walnut dishes made with roomtemperature poached chicken smothered in a rich sauce combining ground nuts coriander cinnamon vinegar and egg yolks for his part karpov chose a lamb dish made with the fiery adzhika a combination of hot and sweet red peppers blended with coriander and garlic and the inevitable khmeli suneli the recipe for this last marinade varied from family to family its secrets guarded as closely as any kgb dossier basically it consisted so lantin informed his guest of varying amounts of black and cayenne pepper mint basil dill parsley savory dried coriander and dried ground marigolds to impart to it its characteristic golden hue karpov downed vodka reached for the bottle to refill his glass lantin gave their order and the waiter left he drank only mineral water he sipped at his glass with a kind of affectation that in karpovs mind at least was a wholly feminine trait secretly he wondered how he could rid himself of lantin despite the others help he did not think of him as an ally personally he despised the man he was using lantin to ensure that moonstone would be put into action karpov knew that it was one thing to install all that firepower around the circumference of china quite another to implement it karpov was no fool he knew that what he was proposing as moonstones ultimate aim was fraught with danger but the risk was a calculated one as a military man he had to deal with calculated risks every day he had been trained to make such decisions and further to trust implicitly in his own judgment he knew that even with lantins support there was still opposition in the presidium to moonstones ultimate use old men and frightened wives that was how he thought of them the power inside russia had too long been in the hands of elderly men who had the timidity of women they should leave the running of this country to us how many times had he said that to his wife karpov abhorred having to align himself with someone like lantin he had no respect for the man look at his hands karpov thought now pouring himself another vodka they are soft a womans hands all he knows is a desk and the old halls what does he know of command of fighting has he ever killed a man no never he would shit his pants at the stench at the sight of blood leaking the filmy sightless eyes yet he has the power i need to take moonstone to its end phase to just that end he said now i trust you are pleased with moonstones penultimate phase lantin continued to contemplate his mineral water as if it were the elixir of life i did not mention that forgive me my colleagues and i were quite impressed with the latest havoc wreaked in malipo county in yunnan by the vietnamese army how many chinese casualties were inflicted its difficult to say with any degree of certainty karpov said while the vietnamese are excellent at carrying out the orders we give them they nevertheless have a perhaps forgivable propensity for exaggeration in the area of their prowess on the line nothing should be forgivable when it comes to soldiers and war lantin said crisply he put down his glass and looked at karpov i agreed to this phase of moonstone because i could see the vision behind it using the vietnamese to invade certain designated border districts of chinaareas chosen by us for their strategic purposehas a certain elegance about it its easy enough to send out propaganda via thachhe was speaking of vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thachregarding chinese aggression in malipo and ha tuyen province since all foreigners are unilaterally barred from these areas independent verification is impossible using our word against theirs is a timehonored tactic we can easily exploit to its fullest potential however any degree of unreliability from the vietnamese could be detrimental to the entire moonstone timetable we cannot afford any defections or dissatisfactions before that occurs i would expect you to send your executioners in there and weed out the troublesome elements karpov winced inwardly at the word executioners that was but one example of what he detested about the man he bandied about terms without a full understanding of them he was preparing his answer when the food came and he waited until they were alone again you need have no worry concerning the vietnamese i lantin lifted his head let me correct a notion of yours i have no worries about the vietnamese or even about moonstone those worries are yours and yours alone as i was saying karpov plowed on i have placed my own people as observers within every vietnamese unit ordered into action each agent has explicit instructions on how to deal with dissidents the terminationshe put some emphasis on the word in order to gently correct lantins erroneous terminologyare to be public and instantaneous i imagine with the native population that kind of vulgar display is needed to get the message across karpov stared at lantin for a time he was thinking of the mortar blasts the cannon and smallarms fire that had just hours before leveled two towns killed hundreds of men women and children he thought of the crippled soldiers drowning in their own blood the maimed children the pregnant womenthe loss of two lives at once then he contemplated this smug creature savoring his dinner just across the table hatred clawed at him like the talons of an animal trapped inside his belly so far he said with all the calmness he could muster there have been no incidents not one good lantin said clearing his plate i want it kept just that way he looked up from his food his face was flushed as if he had recently had sex can i interest you in dessert there are some most enticing selections here karpov who had been mostly pushing his food from one side of his plate to the other declined with extreme politeness he wondered whether he should send a team into lantins apartment tonight and do away with him forever but for the fate of moonstone which would thereby hang in the balance he found himself sorely tempted over thick chocolatebrown coffee lantin said i want to talk about general vorkuta karpov sat very still a tiny ball of ice began to form inside him a voice whispered that they had come to the crux of tonights dinner meeting karpov like a child with his hand in the cookie jar wondered if he had been caught did lantin know of his affair with daniella if so how would he use it against him but it seemed he was wrong i have yet to make up my mind about her lantin sipped at his coffee allowing his pause to become a silence it was as if he were assuming that karpov knew what was in his mind from the outset how so this was at last squeezed out of karpov and he hated himself for ithated lantin even more humm it was not clear whether this was a sound of contemplation or a simple clearing of his throat i remain unconvinced regarding her attitude again lantin was saying too little now karpov was truly on his guard knowing that by supplying an answer to these minuscule interrogatives he would be unearthing a wealth of information for lantin to pore over alternatively saying nothing would be even worse karpov finally settled on as noncommittal an answer as possible i have always found her to be a loyal and intelligent agent perhaps lantin said but that is no answer she guards her department with a zeal i find disturbing to me it borders on xenophobia either that or she has something to hide nonsense karpov said immediately watch it he told himself no telling what hes searching for yuri the department i have put general vorkuta in charge of is among the most secretive in all the sluzhba i need not remind you of that i have given her a difficult row to hoe as it were and she has performed admirably i really think you have overreacted lantin shrugged as if it were of no real import to him perhaps but i have had no small experience with the manifestations of the guilty consciences of my fellow man just to make certain i am sure you wont object if i have my office keep an eye on her for a month or two of course not if that is your wish speaking of guilty consciences karpov wondered whether lantin was indeed unsure of daniellas loyalty or whether this was his way of flexing the parameters of his power in karpovs direction certainly he would be foolish to suspect daniella and if the latter were the case karpov could see no better method than lantin had selected damn to hell his meddling karpov thought i cannot possibly go that long without touching her on his way home in lantins zil he considered telephoning daniella to at least warn her immediately he thought better of it that was just the kind of activity he could not afford at this stage in the game he had moonstone to consider lantin was the key to moonstone until that unfortunate circumstance changed he would have to stay in line every step of the way but karpov vowed when the final phase of moonstone is under way and i no longer need lantins backing i will have my revenge i will not only have it but i will savor it as i saw him savor his rich meal tonight i will feed him poisoned meata fitting way for comrade yuri lantin to die and then i will take daniella and together we will dance on his grave hello rodger antony beridien said the shades were down in his office and through the regular interstices between the white house lit up like a fountain could be seen glowing in the washington dusk beridiens huge head turned like a hawk at his assistants approach the lack of light in the office threw his heavily browed eyes into deep shadow ive been wanting to talk with you about our iceberg he said ive been at the computer since five this morning donovan sat down in a leather chair that looked like a sling and was about as comfortable what have you come up with beridien grunted quite a bit here take a look at these he slid an accordion sheaf of computer printouts across his desk his eyes watched his assistants expression as he flipped through the maze of lists tables and charts it appears to me as if our iceberg might be nichiren himself how could that be hes a known freelance thats just what weve been supposed to believe donovans head came up disinformation that means that the russians precisely beridiens fist hit the desktop with a resounding thump this icebergs beginning to have shape as well as size rodger and the more it becomes visible the more recognizable its source becomes karpov a good guess but a wrong one beridien was obviously enjoying his position of power this was donovan had discovered what to a great extent motivated the man he did not like it but in time he had learned to live with it youre still just learning the intricacies of the kgb bureaucracy those two and a half years when state had you stationed in paris may have been fine for other international matters but not for this one this oration spewed out in beridiens familiar dark basso tones was a familiar trademark one of his most successful attributes according to the president beridien he had often said behind closed doors could sell anyone anything at any time even normally hostile senate subcommittees but living with it every day donovan knew that it helped to mask a mind capable of taking every opportunity no matter how minute and turning it to his advantage without letting you know he had done so no beridien continued nichiren is far too elegant a dupe to have been manufactured by karpov he picked up a crystal owl and held it in his palm until the glass warmed to his touch then he put it aside it appears that far from being the freelance assassin he has appeared to be nichiren is being run by a specific source and i believe that source to be general daniella vorkuta the kvr was nothing before she took it over now we must fight it tooth and nail for every minor mission he shook his head as if he had just made up his mind i think general vorkuta has submerged an iceberg under us and day by day is allowing it to surface donovan glanced down at his watch its time for your weekly physical if we could continue this on the way wed save time they went out into a corridor with bare walls painted the color of clay there were no doors off it at its far end a brushedbronze elevator door opened at the touch of beridiens palm print inside there were only two buttons beridien pressed the lower one and they dropped down the shaft six floors below the door opened onto a sterile white suite of rooms one of which was a fully outfitted operating theater with all the latest equipment including laser scalpels cryonics and pathology facilities the agent on duty took their plastic id cards and fed them into the slot of a terminal then watched impassively as the two men went into a cold white room containing an examining table a crash cart filled with innumerable vials bottles and tubes all mysteriously labeled in the language of the physician a small semicircular sink in one corner and a footpedal garbage can beside a breuer bentwood chair on which to hang clothes were a doctors scale and an optometrists eye chart a young nurse in a crisply starched uniform greeted the two men right on time mr beridien she said as if he were a child doctor is ready for you shes always ready for me beridien growled vulture did you say something mr beridien the nurse said just as if she hadnt heard him beridien waited coldly until she went out now that we know nichirens source its more imperative than ever to terminate him with all due speed he told donovan how do we accomplish that maroc was supposed to be our great white hope when it came to nichiren he was beridien said until the sumchun river im beginning to suspect he came back from that mission only half an operative his men were massacredby nichiren i suppose although his debriefing was difficult and ultimatelyfor us anywayinadequate perhaps we should have suspected sooner and had him replaced all that speculation is useless now beridien said coldly you cannot bleed for your soldiers and expect to lead them into battle at the same time i want you to remember that rodger the next time you feel the twinge of empathy donovan thought he made that phrase sound like the plague what is really important is what happened up there i mean apart from the massacre donovan was curious how do you know anything did because of marocs attitude beridien said simply i know my operatives maroc was always a welladjusted misfit he laughed shortly i know that sounds like a contradiction in terms the president certainly thinks so but then he hasnt had the experience ive had in this shadow world anyway maroc was with stallings our best agent in fact in many ways he was better he had a curious flair for administration as well we never got such a wealth of firstclass intelligence from our hong kong station as when he ran it he was a born leader operatives flocked to him just to have a chance to be in his units donovan noted how beridien constantly spoke of jake maroc as if he were dead all that changed however the moment he returned from the sumchun river mission he lost personal contact with david oh and apparently with his wife it was as if he had cut himself off from those he loved most in life if i didnt know better id say that he had been preparing to die marocs psychological profile makes no mention of a death wish donovan said in fact if memory serves the conclusion our doctors came to was just the opposite his will to live was exceptional beridien nodded beginning absently to undress all the more reason to wonder what really went on up there he turned hung up his shirt that brings us back to square one our iceberg nichiren we go after him then we get to general vorkuta rodger i want her out of that position shes turned the kvr into a lethal weapon i think wed better try a little disinformation of our own to see if we can rattle karpovs cage enough so that the discomfort compels him to do something hed rather not such as get rid of general vorkuta that would be good beridien acknowledged but its going to take some research and quite a bit of time meanwhile weve got to terminate nichiren with all possible haste send stallings back out again he likes to be in the middle of all those midgets beridien lifted himself up onto the examining table this is a pain in the ass you know that i would think donovan said as the doctor appeared through the door that youd be used to it by now you were the one who made it mandatory that the head of the quarry have a physical exam every week and that he be accompanied during the examination by a ranking officer the doctor a woman of forty whom donovan secretly desired drew the hospital gown through beridiens white arms she had a fine strong slavic face heavy breasts and good long legs donovan wanted to climb those legs one day she presented them both with a professional smile but otherwise gave no indication that she thought of them as anything but objects she poked and prodded at donovan once a month a day he kept circled on his calendar i think ill make a note to myself beridien said next week ill send wunderman down to be examined in my place the doctor gave him the same stern look she would give to an overly rambunctious teenager beridien laughed finally feeling as if he had put something over on her there was one light left burning in its amber glow the planes of mikio komotos face appeared as hard as rock marocsan the words were the extent of the change in his attitude but for a japanese that was significant he had come back down from the utter darkness at the far end of the garden like a stone emerging from the depths of a well jake was aware of his coming presence then the outline of his bearlike body the light illumined the loose shirt and hakama finally as he stopped a pace in front of jake the features of his face resolved themselves out of the night his face was closed there was an idiomatic japanese phrase for it but jake could not bring it to mind he carried his harahis intrinsic power in tangible form nothing else was required he showed his hands crossing them was the arrow that jake had fired i believe this is yours as if in a dream jake reached out took the missile from the oyabun he had not fully thought out his actions it began to dawn on him fully what he had set out to do and more importantly that he had succeeded this arrow was part of a samurais specialized weaponrythis particular samurai in quite a real sense it was part of his heritage certainly it was never given away except in acknowledgment of a deed of extraordinary merit jake recalled that in feudal times it was said that senseithat is to say mastersof particular martial arts who met for the first time exchanged bits of their personal arsenal to seal treaties for the daimyo their overlords jake bowed domo arigato komotosan he noticed that toshi was no longer around he and mikio komoto were alone in the night the high black trees overarched the pair filled with nesting birds and chirruping insects they swayed in the night wind giving motion to the garden as if it were a trough in some vast moonlit sea time the oyabun said to drink they got drunk on suntory whiskey inside seated on the tatami with a small welloiled boxwood table in front of them they talked of matters great and small just as if they had been friends all their lives and not as they had been an hour before adversaries keii kisan komoto said is well gone to his ancestors he was aggressive tough and by far the smartest member of his clan he was giving you trouble i think komoto said in a judicious tone it is safer to say that nichiren was giving us trouble toshimaku had become a source of friction between my clan and kisans it is my belief that this was nichirens doing why jake poured them both more whiskey what does toshimafu possess that is worth this bloodshed other than traditionally being an extension of komoto territory nothing then i seriously doubt that nichiren would have been involved hed have no reason to counsel an aggressive policy and every reason to keep the situation calm on his home ground i doubt it komoto said our information is that nichiren is a deepcover agent of the kgb jake stared at him he tried to control the fluttering of his heart my intelligence is that hes a solitaire terrorist then youre a little behind the times jake thought about this for a time at length he said how long have the soviets been running him komoto shrugged ill show you the entire file three four years were not absolutely certain but we know his control general daniella vorkuta kvr jake thought buddha no wonder they were up on the sword fleetingly he wondered why the quarry had failed to pick up this intelligence the oyabun stared into jakes face i would say that either youre very drunk or very surprised if i was any drunker jake said i wouldnt even understand what you were saying mikio komoto laughed this is barbarian whiskey he cried were just beginning to get to the real stuff toshisan bring on the sake for nichiren it was meinichi the death day dressed in a seagreen kimono with a snowwhite doublewheel pattern he trudged with deliberate slowness up the steep winding dirt path through the pines and cedarstheir summits like fujiyama lost in gray misthe ascended from the tiled roof of the railway station to the northwest of tokyo at his back the great metropolis spilled across the island in shades of hard insensate gray compared with the mist swirling through the branches above his head here and there boys in shinto robes swept away the dust of the centuries with bamboo whisks their first duties at the temple one first had to learn humility the first step on the path to oneness with all things near the summit of the hill he turned to the left away from the crimsonandblack temple buildings here the path ended at a stone gate beyond was the graveyard though it was yet early morning he could discern through the mist the kneeling figures at prayer before the stone markers of their ancestors the chanted prayer lifted up penetrating the mist in a way the sunlight could not he let the holy words inundate him as he trod the narrow paths until he came to the familiar stone marker there he knelt and placed just in front of the stone the sticks of incense he had carried with him from the city carefully with a prayer on his lips he lit them one by one until their burning essence melted into the mist his head was bowed his thoughts were only with his mother on the stone before him were two lines of ideograms but he had no need to look at them their message was engraved upon his heart forever meinichi though its meaning was death day was composed of two ideograms that separately meant life and day this seeming contradiction was easily explained in that in choosing to remember the anniversary of an ancestors death in making the physical pilgrimage to the burial site by thought and deed one had in effect returned the dead to the world of the living at least for this short period of time each year it was also a time for the family to gather to renew ties perhaps stretched by the farflung migrations of various members nichiren felt a great sadness that there was no one else here family which as with all japanese meant so much to him was reduced to one bitter tears squeezed out from beneath his lowered lids lay trembling for an unspeakable moment on his cheeks before sliding down staining his kimono yumiko had been dead for many years but through the miracle of meinichi she was alive again within nichiren he remembered her face which over the years had lost none of its porcelain beauty rather the youthful exquisite features had softened the skin gradually becoming patinaed just like a treasured ningyo as a child he had seen many of these dolls within their glass cases in shop windows against which he had pressed his nose staring until his eyes crossed he could remember inexpensive dolls of rice paper hanging in his room during the years that he was sick much later he had learned that these were yumikos guardians against the evil that she was certain had befallen him during those long days when he lay besieged by high fever her hands would be busy constructing new paper dolls to help ward off further illness then when he had recovered sufficiently from his bouts of illness she had set about to make him so strong in body and in spirit that sickness would be unknown to him in the years afterward for nichiren yumiko had been both mother and father she had never remarried in fact he could not remember her having a lover in the house rather she had buried herself in the arcane texts she often spent weeks tracking down in the far corners of japan often he would lie in bed at night with her hypnotic chanting in his ears an odd kind of susurrus that mingled with the insects percussion and the nightbirds alto trilling to bring him sleep small and beautiful she had nevertheless possessed a fierce indomitable will tetsu no kokoro her iron spirit there was even in the golden glow of remembrance only the barest vestige of gentleness about her though she was loving with him she never coddled him or fondled him overmuch in fact she barely touched him nichiren could recall only one time with any clarity he had come home carrying a dog he had kicked either in anger or in frustration over his ostracism at school he was already under mitsunobus tutelage and had lashed out with the toe of his shoe only once and broken the poor creatures neck yumiko had taken one look at the animal and had ordered him to drop it outside their property then she had taken him into the house and beaten him she had no physical strength to hurt him but something perhaps a fingernail or a ring had caught in his skin and he had begun to bleed when she saw this a look of the most profound horror had transfigured his mothers face she had cried out from the depths of her spirit and pulling him close to her rocked him with her arms close about him in time he had felt the hotness of her tears crossing his lips he heard her unearthly shout ringing in his ears and he shuddered never had he heard such an exclamation from a human throat it had contained such a degree of despair and selfloathing as he had thought it impossible for one person to contain that moment was perhaps more significant for both of them than either knew it bonded their spirits in some unfathomable way what yumiko required of him he did but he had always done that now he did more what she believed he believed he did so with at least some knowledge of what he was doing he loved her to him she was life he would do anything to ensure that she never cried out like that again his mother remained in his memory the most beautiful female he had ever seen time had not diffused his memory rather he recalled yumiko with a clarity that one usually reserves for picking through old photographs it was not until she died when he took her to be prepared for burial that he saw her naked the one memory of her he wished he could expunge was when he drew back the shroud and saw below a face that even death could not ravage the hideous disfigurement of her small body meinichi on this day for as long as he knelt here beside her grave yumiko lived again he felt close to her felt her spirit settle about him like a mantle across his shoulders awakening to the pale sunlight of the early morning he had been uneasy as he dressed in his ceremonial outfit for this occasion his unease had remained unabated he had dreamt of mariana maroc in his dream she had kissed him she had held his head tenderly she had spoken into the shell of his ear with such tenderness that in his dream he had wept and had awoken with a start ears straining mightily to hear her words what had she whispered to him that moved him so he found that he very much wanted to know the syllables floated tantalizingly just beyond his recall he could actually feel them but he could not hear them now that he felt yumikos spirit girdling him he was no longer aware of the unease and he sighed a little as he used to do as a little boy he recalled again the day she had cradled him crying after a time she had asked for an explanation why did you kick the dog to death she had asked him he had taken some time with it not really knowing on the surface of it but understanding that his answer might be important i got angry he said at last angry at what at whom yumikos liquid eyes had searched his depths the kids at school they tease me because i am an outsider they say that i am not japanese at all always it is them on one side and me on the other yumiko had looked at him steadily did you make your feelings known to them over and over they laugh at me call me names throw stones at me sometimes then why did you not take your anger out on them why take the life of an animal thai has never harmed you he had hung his head in shame i am afraid of them fear yumiko said sternly has nothing to do with it it is solely a matter of honor sensei would tell you the same thing you know it in your heart there were no more tears now no touching yumikos tetsu no kokoro had returned with such force that each word she uttered seemed to him like a burning bullet implanted in the center of his brain you will have no honor until you have faced them until you have made them see the error of their ways meinichi nichiren breathed in the death day breathed in the memory of yumiko breathed in tetsu no kokoro the living legacy with which she had provided him he had not needed his source to remind him of this day it had surprised him that the subject came up at all when he accessed the overseas line late last night at the grave of your mother you will kneel to light the incense sticks and say the prayers for the dead source said just as if this was to be a business rendezvous nichiren had bridled meinichi is a private ritual an affair for family only you have no right to intrude on the contrary source had said i have every right there is another ritual that you must perform and only i can guide you nichiren listened very carefully to what source said next after it was done he said how do you know this it is incredible i know everything there is to know about you source said in the electronic tones that made it impossible to determine even the gender of the voice that was after all how you were recruited in the first place i control you being under discipline has given you purpose other than the dubious function of an assassin life cannot be measured in the number of people one has terminated that is purposelessness pure chaos the end of all things nichiren had said nothing he was oddly thinking of mariana of how close he had come to saving her life of how he had failed by the merest hairs breadth betrayed by the wind and the rain and the crumbling earth nature it was obvious that he was far better at taking lives than he was at saving them he heard echoes of his mothers words in that thought sunlight stroked his back like yumikos strong hands bathing him when he was too ill to do it himself he looked up past the small stone monument he saw the rows of others here and there like dots of color placed by a careful painter people moved along the narrow aisles otherwise the cemetery was all grays and greens nichiren glanced to his immediate right as source had said there was an open plot reserved for him someday how did source know i know everything there is to know about you nichiren moved closer to the empty plot digging out a small gardening trowel from beneath his kimono he measured precisely six centimeters from the left corner of the plot along the bottom edge another six into the plot dug his trowel into the grassy loam no one was watching everyone possessed inward eyes at a cemetery lost in memories he dug down to the depth of the tools blade then he used his fingers not wanting to damage that which source told him lay beneath the earth waiting for this day waiting for him he came to the top of the package dug carefully around its edges like an archaeologist nearing his find at last he unearthed it an oblong perhaps two meters by one wrapped in rice paper the outer layers he saw as he dusted the package off had been painted with some preserving substance because they were decomposed only here and there it occurred to him that this artifact must be quite old dating perhaps to just after world war ii because there was no plastic sealer which surely would have been used had the package been from a later time he opened it and found inside a ningyo it was a paper doll such as yumiko used to make in fact it was undoubtedly one of hers though it was yellowed with age he recognized her style of handiwork break the doll that was what source had told him to do last night but how could he the ningyo had been made by his mother could he destroy that he was under discipline you are a killer source had told him years ago when he was recruited you destroy life with a heartlessness that is awesome it is also quite terrifying that is not i can tell you why you were brought into thin world you are not the avenging angel your mother thought you were and taught you to be you are not a beast in the night i am nichiren he had said she gave you that name as well she believed in me she was the only one she believed in death in death alone i believe in you nichiren broke open the doll and inside found the haunch of a tiger it was a piece of lavender jade the carving deft and flowing with his breath hot in his mouth he took the chamois pouch that mariana maroc had pushed into his hand and opened it dropped what was inside into his palm beside the haunch of the tiger shoulders neck fiercely grinning head the two pieces of lavender jade fit together forming a whole animal one half of the fu power growing i must humbly apologize on behalf of the tai pan peter ng said but it was impossible for him to accept your invitation himself tonight three oaths tsun smiled it is of no matter he said in his most civilized tone i have known you almost as long as i have known andrew sawyer mr ng i know that you speak for him he flipped his hand palm to back in any case it was imperative that this meeting take place before monday peter ng nodded the tai pan caught the sense of urgency in your invitation and acted accordingly i trust these arrangements will be satisfactory oh most satisfactory mr ng most satisfactory indeed it was just past nine the two chinese were sitting in three oaths tsuns officestateroom aboard his junk moored in aberdeen harbor above their heads the summer night was vying for dominance with the confluence of neon and incandescent light with which the colony glowed three oaths tsun closed his eyes felt the gentle rocking of the junk beneath him all will be well he told himself through the triphammer beat of his heart have faith in a moment one of his daughters appeared carrying a tray filled with teapot and cups small plates chopsticks and platters of steaming seafood it is said mr ng that hakka food fortifies the spirit as no other in the world three oaths tsun opened his eyes watching his number two daughter set out the meal with perfect precision i have trained them all well my children he thought i hope that you are hungry mr ng peter ng dapper as always in a charcoalgray linen suit with white shirt whitepolkadotted dovegray tie and black tasseled loafers inclined his head i am always hungry this time of night honorable tsun he said despite the slight queasy feeling in his stomach it happened every time he stepped onto a boat no matter that the junk was at anchor no matter that there was only the most infinitesimal rocking motion just the thought was enough to give ng the jitters as a small child he had been thrown into the water by his older brother it had been a harmless prank but peter could still recall with supraclarity the sensation of swallowing water of sinking down into the trough of a wave of drowning in airless darkness the tai pan who had become aware of ngs afflictionan odd one for an islandbound chineseon a business trip during which the two of them were obliged to take the ferry to macao had once suggested he see a psychiatrist ng could never bring himself to do so he could not see how a gwai loh invention could be of use to him now as he set himself to eat his hosts food he steeled himselfor more accurately his stomachagainst the inconstant fluttering as was the custom they spoke only of trivial matters while they dined the weather tsuns children ngs family and so on both carefully ignored any business matters even ones that might not directly involve either of them at length number two daughter returned to clear the dishes and replace the empty teapot with a full one she also brought a full bottle of johnnie walker black and a pair of oldfashion glasses now peter ng thought it is just a matter of time the tai pan had called him into his office just after he had received the call from three oaths tsun things are beginning to heat up he said to ng there was a soft smile on his face an indication that he was in the midst of serious thinking it seems the honorable tsun wants to meet me tonight he looked hard at peter i want you to go in my stead this will serve two purposes it will indicate to tsun that i am willing to listen but am not necessarily eager it will also put him off guard he may reveal something to youeither deliberately or inadvertentlythat he would not to me and if he has a proposal for us oh he has a proposal sawyer said sitting back in his chair i have no doubts about that remain noncommittal peter that is i think essential tsun will want to make a deal as quickly as possible i believe monday when all the commodity markets open is his deadline even if his offer seems good make no positive response if we decide that what tsun has is of interest we will wait until the last possible momentlate sunday nightto indicate our interest by then we will no doubt be able to negotiate better terms than the ones we might get right away now as his host poured chrysanthemum tea sweetened with rock sugar into their cups and three fingers of whiskey into the glasses peter ng fought for control the food he had ingested though light weighed on his uneasy stomach like a lead weight he took three deep breaths and downed the sweet tea feeling better at once mr ng three oaths tsun said your company and mine have never had much in common that is public knowledge in the areas where our trade has overlapped we have been vigorous competitors there has never been a hint of animosity however correct me if i am wrong his pause went unanswered three oaths tsun gave a little nod of satisfaction i believe that both our houses have remained strong competitors for many reasons not the least of which is our resiliency times dictate a constantly changing business environment the world over this is especially true here i think you will agree with me over the past ten years we have seen a succession of business and political upheavals that have literally changed the face of hong kong they have also obliged us to alter our perception of our future the defection of mattias king and company will force other even less palatable changes on all of us i am afraid it is a certainty ng said that at least the shortterm effects will be disastrous for the entire business community oddly ng thought tsun smiled at that well perhaps not everyone need suffer mr ng i beg your pardon peter strained to gather in every nuance hidden within his hosts words i am prepared to let you in on a secret three oaths tsun said but first i would appreciate a er token of your tai pans sincerity i think my presence here at such short notice would indicate that perhaps tsuns tone however indicated that he was acceding nothing however i would also wish to know whether or not andrew sawyer is willing to risk a great deal in order to make a fortunea literal fortunein the coming months ng considered a moment thinking of his instructions money he said at length is the source a businessman who does not want to make money is dead and buried in the ground yet one learns over the years by painful process to temper onesshall we sayquest for capital with the wisdom of caution so three oaths tsun thought you have said nothing but that in itself tells me a great deal we shall have to go on from here when a river finds a rock in its way too large to move it alters its course of course he said now temperance forbearance patience the rich mans credo i understand completely he turned to look at the clock on his desk well i see that i have kept you late into the night that was not my intention please accept my apologies ng panicked he knew a dismissal when he heard it he knew too that if he returned to sawyer emptyhandedknowing that there was a deal in the offinghe would be handed a red envelope containing his severance trusted member of the house or no the tai pan would find no forgiveness in his heart for such a foulup honorable tsun he said a bit too hastily it occurs to me that perhaps i have not made myself sufficiently clear you must forgive me i am not as quick on my feet as is my tai pan my ancestors were slow and patient men and they taught me to behave as they did by the eight drunken immortals three oaths tsun thought this one has a golden tongue his humility would send any gwai loh digging into his pockets for money to offer him patience is ail well and good he said easily to show there was no offense taken but every so often we see kai ho and recognizing this gap we must enter swiftly or forever be left behind it is my opinion that the tai pan thinks along similar lines ng said holding the relief he felt close inside him good three oaths tsun nodded then let me tell you in all confidence that mattias kings decision to leave the colony has augured a change in certain business plans of theirs particularly longrange plans ngs pulse rate picked up considerably he thought he knew what was coming and he sought to rein in his excitement at the prospect as you may know three oaths tsun continued mattias king and i are each onethird partners with the communists in the kam sang nuclear project in guangdong province mattias king have informed me that they are pulling out of course they offered me a buyout price first through my pak hanmin arm but quite frankly the expense over the long haul is just too great a risk to my other businesses therefore i am offering their onethird interest to your trading house ngs mind whirled with ten thousand questions why sawyer sons out of all the houses why not for instance five star pacific the major utility in the new territories werent they the first logical choice had mattias king really offered their share to tsun was he lying about why he hadnt taken it himself on and on but peter knew that he could ask none of these questionscould in fact evince no interest whatsoever kam sang he said carefully has quite a large price tag if i understand correctly three oaths tsun nodded six billion dollars us ng nearly choked on the whiskey he was drinking dew neh loh moh he thought that is an unbelievable price tag to put on an energy source but three oaths tsun went on the potential for profit is literally unlimited if we can get kam sang built and on line ngs eyes narrowed is there a problem the future of hong kong and of much of southern china depends directly on the kam sang project three oaths tsun said our energy sources are limited at best you know as well as i do the disaster that can befall us without the water piped in to us kam sang is designed not only to provide us with electricity but also with water unlimited water ng sat up straight i have heard nothing of this you would not have it is a closely guarded secret kam sang is designed to provide us with inexpensive desalinization sea water into drinking water three oaths tsun nodded no more rationing for hong kong no more shortages water all the time and the problems the soviets three oaths tsun said they have already tried twice to sabotage the project there is no reason to think that they will not try again there is your major risk but it would increase a hundredfold if the soviets should discover kam sangs secret he looked at ng you can see why i must have an answer from your house immediately ngs mind was reeling i must of course discuss this with the tai pan mr ng three oaths tsun said rising i am speaking of hours not days peter nodded rising too i understand completely good three oaths tsun gestured my number three son will see you off the vessel ng bowed thank you for your hospitality tai pan i am always grateful for interesting companionship at dinner mr ng three oaths tsun watched peter ng as he was led up the companionway to the deck in a moment he called softly a figure came down the narrow passageway wreathed in shadows i am sorry you were obliged to wait bousehk bousehk meant precious stone no matter bliss said coming into his stateroom i had a delicious meal with ama bliss had fallen into the habit of referring to his number one daughter and therefore the oldest as mother you have information for me it was not a question he poured them both whiskey into fresh glasses he pulled from a drawer in his desk jake maroc is in japan ahhh he turned we have set him on his way he handed her a glass to jake marocs joss they drank together i feel odd about it she said as if we have manufactured jakes joss what an extraordinary thought bousehk you know as well as i that joss is not manmade it is rather part of the intrinsic nature of all things there was some fear in her eyes perhaps she hesitated a moment perhaps you would tell me now why you instructed me to send him to japan his face darkened you are an instrument of the yuhnhyun used thus the word could mean either a ring or a circle i could not love you more if you were my own flesh i consider you my daughter bousehk but at the same time you are special unlike my other children you were brought to me to raise and to train you are on the inside as my other children are not to them i am only what i seem to be only you of all of them know the truth he stared hard at her nothing must alter the yuhnhyun he held her eyes for an interminable time then he glanced down at the calendar on his desktop by now he said changing the subject and so sparing her a vocal rebuke nichiren has no doubt found his piece of the fu he seemed to make up his mind about something i did not lie to you he was sent to regain his piece of the fu but why what significance could it have in todays world it is power power that was set in place long ago power for what that i truly cannot say perhaps it will create its own answer to that question there was some silence for a time bliss put her head down as if in this posture she could think more deeply when her gaze came up she said father who else is included in the yuhnhyun for a moment she thought that he would explode with anger then something seem to strike him as if with a mighty blow and he collapsed into a camp chair i wonder he said softly what is happening to this world no one of all my family would ever dare ask me such a question and now you do a woman he shook his head father she said going to him i did not mean to anger you she knelt before him her head bowed no need he said no need my dutiful daughter but just the same he felt a glow inside him at her filial piety it was a twoedged blade the warmth of her devotion blended with the independence that was part and parcel of her training liven though he said now you are a vessel of the yuhnhyun there are matters that cannot be revealed to you why it is inevitable that jake will begin to ask questions the longer we are together the more questions he will ask is it not important to feed him the answers for a long time she believed that he had not heard or that he did not choose to answer for now at least it is important for jake to know as little as possible that is part of your job and it wont be easy but those are your orders and they must be carried out without question you know me well bousehk better than any of my other children better than my wife ever did i daresay i am a man of tradition if one abandons ones heritage one holds nothing but ashes keeping alive the traditions that have made us what we are today is all that stands between us and the end of our culture already over time the gwai loh have taken so much from us and still they want more they are insatiable like omnivores they are not satisfied until they have it all three oaths tsun looked down at her with old eyes he wished to touch her even though that was not the chinese way she was so precious to him he held so much affection in his heart for her that like his sorrow for china it sometimes threatened to overflow the boundaries he had built around it his hand twitched but otherwise did not move from its position on the chairs armrest you must never abandon tradition he said at last there will be temptation to embrace the business practices of the golden mountain he was speaking of americathe affectations of proper english society you may wake up one day to find that you covet western men their hardedged occidental looks their fast cars their philosophy you may yet find that you yearn to be accepted by them and in so doing forget the land that spawned you bliss felt three oaths tsun close beside her that should have comforted her but tonight she trembled in response to the fear and worry she felt emanating from him i will do what the yuhnhyun asks of me three oaths tsun looked at her he tilted his glass finished his whiskey that bousehk i know when stallings awoke it was already after eleven he blinked staring at his watch face for a moment then he realized that he had not gotten back to the hotel until after three a very late night of frustrations among the haunts of the yakuza he swung his legs out of bed and sat up running his fingers through his rumpled hair he could not recall just how many people he had spoken to how many differing lines he had dropped it did not matter really he had gotten nowhere well he should not be surprised even though he spoke fluent japanese he was a gaijin as a foreigner he was entitled to nothing that concerned the inner workings of japanese society oh hell he thought another day in tokyo banging my head against a stone wall as he rose he noticed that his message light was blinking he picked up the phone and asked for the front desk he was told that a written note had been left for him when did you receive this im sorry sir i come on at nine it was already here then stallings hung up making a mental note to query the night concierge this evening he padded into the bathroom and stood under a cold shower for ten minutes until he began to feel vaguely human again he dressed in khaki linen trousers and a blue and brown striped izod shirt his feet were clad in lightweight moccasins he drew on a lightweight nylon shell jacket downstairs he picked up the note on his way into breakfast he ordered orange juice toast three eggs over easy and a halfgallon of black coffee he was never more grateful that his tour had checked into the hilton after his first cup of coffee he opened the note it was in a plain white sealed envelope it has come to my attention he read that you are seeking information of an extremely specific and sensitive nature undoubtedly you are aware that this is difficult to come by and that certain precautions must be taken to ensure that repercussions will not arise should answers be provided to your questions also because the answers are as dangerous as the questions they will be expensive please therefore be good enough to be standing on the platform of the ginza station of the toyoko line subway at pm today there was no signature no other information on either the sheet of unlined paper or the envelope as to whom it had come from there was no stamp and of course no postmark as it had been handdelivered he had not been stopped on his way into the hotel late last night though he had walked right by the concierge who had given him his key out of his box no note then so it had to have been delivered some time between three and nine this morning there was one other thing the writing was definitely in a masculine hand stallings glanced at his watch it was already after twelve hed have to hurry if he was to make the deadline he thought about that for a moment was there a reason not to go he couldnt think of one if he ignored this summons and went on with his nighttime questioning he knew hed be in tokyo until doomsday still it paid to be cautious he quickly signed the bill leaving his food uneaten he had more important things to do up in his room and very little time in which to do them wu aiping was feeling a bit peaked after his long exhausting week marshaling the resources of the qun in a furious attempt to penetrate shi zilins hong kong operation so at dinner in addition to ordering ban hai zhe dried jellyfish chao ou lotus root and to end it zhu dun tang bamboomarrow soup he requested hai shen the strongest tonic known in china these sea slugs caught off the south coast and flown daily north to beijing were sundried and soaked in spring water for a week on the second day they were cleaned in order to make them dilate and thus tenderize their otherwise rubbery flesh at the very last moment they would be combined with yu du carp stomach and the whole flashseared in a soybased sauce seasoned to bring out the delicate taste of the treat as wu aiping lowered his oversized body into the chair at his reserved table his enormous eyes locked on those of the cowering waiter he called for tie guan yin iron goddess of mercy tea the rarest and most expensive black tea in the whole country he invariably drank it ignoring the common custom of switching from dragon well tea in the summer to jasmine tea in the winter wu aiping sat with his back ramrodstraight the peculiarities of his body combined with his huge eyes to give him the appearance of a giant insect this mien in turn combined with the razorlike brilliance of his mind to make him one of the most intimidating people in his government the ministry restaurant was located in the basement of the bleak concrete building just off tian an men square it was often pointed out to visitors as the national peoples congress building which was only half a lie wu aipings office looked south maos mausoleum was always in his direct sight though his guest had not yet arrived wu aiping went ahead and ordered it was not strictly speaking the polite thing to do but tardiness annoyed him the whitefaced waiter bowed deeply and swept away no doubt grateful to be away from the highranking ministers baleful presence the ministry restaurant was as was the case with all governmentrun businesses drably decorated in furniture and accessories that were purely functional but its chefs were among the finest to be found anywhere though images of sight and sound meant little to wu aiping his appreciation of the principles of gastronomy were legendary now he turned his head as a tendril of smell invaded his space at the next table a minister whom he knew only slightly had lit up a tai shan a miniature cigar whose smoke wu aiping found particularly disgusting he glared unblinkingly at the man until he became aware of the scrutiny and turned he blanched quickly stubbed out the tai shan and calling for the bill made a hasty retreat at that moment wu aipings guest entered the restaurant and was shown across the colorless room ninhaoa wu aiping said nodding slightly good afternoon zhang hua slightly dumpy looking in his illfitting rumpled suit pushed his thicklensed glasses back onto the flat bridge of his nose he was sweating profusely and he extracted a white linen handkerchief as he sat wiping his wide flat mongol face with quick practiced swipes neatly avoiding disturbing his glasses wu aiping lifted a hand please he said sit down then when the other made no move he looked up i wont bite you know the tea came and wu aiping went at his as soon as it had been poured in time he poured for zhang hua though inwardly terrified at having complied with wu aipings telephoned summons zhang hua would not give the other the satisfaction of seeing his shock he therefore made a great show of finishing mopping his face folding away his handkerchief and pulling out a pack of tian shan blacktobacco cigarettesso that he would not have to touch his tea yet he shook out a cigarette wu aiping stared at it as if zhang hua himself were of no import if you insist on smoking he said perhaps you would be good enough to do so at that table on the other side of the room zhang hua flushed and spun the cigarette in his fingers before breaking it nervously in two its just as well he recovered im trying to quit he swept the broken thing into his pocket admirable wu aiping said in a tone of voice that implied he did not for a moment believe the others lie in the space of thirty seconds zhang hua had lost an incalculable amount efface he found that intolerable and began to struggle to reverse the process i havent much time he said if you would be so good as to come to the point as soon as possible wu aiping nodded as you wish he folded his long fingers in front of him ill be frank so long as shi zilin controls his army generals it doesnt seem to matter a whit what i or the other members of the socalled qun do to reverse his dangerous policies therefore i have struck upon an entirely different tactic he smiled slightly you comrade minister will provide me withhow shall we refer to itan inside view of shi zilins hong kong operation i want to know everything and as soon as possible his hands opened like the petals of a malignant flower now would be as good a time as any to start zhang hua felt as if all the breath had gone out of him never in his life had he encountered a chinese such as this man in reflex he jammed his cup of tea against his trembling lips he was far too agitated to taste anything he swallowed convulsively abruptly aware that his mouth had filled up with liquid you must face facts my friend wu aiping went on shi zilin is an old man worse still for you hes sick his condition deteriorating every day this is our time the qun will win out you can go down with shi zilin or he shrugged what zhang hua was obliged to moisten his mouth with more tea before he could go on he was so filled with righteous indignation that he could barely see straight what you propose is a monstrous distortion of honor and trust you ask me to throw over everything i have ever believed in and worked for all my adult life shi zilin has been more to me even than a mentor he is as my father he began to get up your proposal fills me with such disgust that i can no longer bring myself to sit in the same room with you let alone share tea wu aiping almost stifled a yawn it is your choice comrade minister he said his tone casual then he threw a brown paper packet on the table it was sealed and stamped by the way would you be kind enough to drop this in the mailbox on your way across the square id like it sent right away despite his rage zhang hua could not help but look down at the package his heart seemed to stop beating he could hear the rushing of the blood in his ears echoes magnified climbing the walls of his mind here wu aiping said extending a hand to the other as he slid raggedly down into his chair you look decidedly unwell some tea perhaps he pushed a cup into the others trembling hand zhang hua got the liquid all over himself he did not feel it his eyes were stuck on the name and address printed carefully on the outside of the packet this the breath was sawing in his throat this is addressed to my wife wu aiping stretched his long neck have i got the street number wrong zhang hua looked up he ran his fingers through his hair what are you sending to my wife the younger minister shrugged if you are that interested i suppose you can look for yourself zhang hua hesitated a moment then quickly ripped the seal inside he found a simple typewritten note addressed to his wife i believe these may hold some interest for you zhang hua read it was clipped to a dozen eightbyten photographs he emitted an oath all showed him in bed with a woman in her twenties young nubile and quite acrobatic your secret life your mistress wu aiping sighed the intense indignation you so profoundly expressed some time ago interests me it means i have been correct in my interpretation of your personality you are a righteous man comrade minister you live your life guided by certain distinct tenets you are rigidly controlled as you say honor and trust are paramount in your life your kind ultimately make the best spies and i will tell you why no one would think of suspecting your integrity further once caught out by your hubris you are bound to me selfloathing and guilt ensures my hold over you absolute in your righteousness absolute in this as well wu aiping smiled a little but you can prove me wrong comrade minister all you have to do is put the photos back in the envelope and reseal it i made a joke before i can mail it myself instead zhang hua ripped the eightbytens in two then he tore the pieces again thats right wu aiping said softly now to business the negatives zhang hua could barely get the words out when do i get the negatives why i thought the answer to that was selfevident wu aiping said when shi zilin is either defeated or dead the food was coming and zhang hua grabbed the opportunity to recover some of his lost equilibrium he felt so numbed that he found it hard to think clearly he ate with apparent gusto but really he might as well have been chewing straw his heart was hammering so hard in his chest that he thought he might have a coronary right there at the table his imagination swept him away wu aiping calling for medical assistance the ambulance arriving the attendants giving him oxygen heart massage he knew why he was fantasizing this way in hospital he would not have to go through with this as an invalid near death he could relinquish all responsibilities he would be free why are you doing this to me he said the premier has shi zilin under the gun what more do you need wu aipings smile chilled the junior minister your master has been under the gun before he has not only survived but has managed to put his enemies six feet under the ground this time i mean to give him no such leeway as i told you i have studied his methodology i will crush him zhang hua be assured of that immediately that the dishes had been cleared and they had finished their final course of fresh pi pa a variety of yellow loquat imported from the south wu aiping continued shi zilins ideas are leading china down a disastrous path that will eventually cause the total westernization of our country he would crumble our ideology the very core of what makes us strong he would undercut that which allows us to stay in power to control the destiny of six hundred million souls without us there would be utter anarchy in china death and destruction looting and rioting the boxer rebellion all over again now in order to put a stop to him what i need to know first is the basis of his hong kong operation he poured himself tea waiting when zhang hua refused to respond he said come come comrade minister the hardest part is already behind you you have already taken the first step in compromising your integrity the second step cannot be nearly as difficult zhang hua seemed to give a little shake then he said shi zilin has set me up as the conduit for disinformation to the soviet kgb together we decided to make me vulnerable to blackmail through my brothers family in hong kong now i report directly to general daniella vorkuta chief director of the kvr within department s i will need to see all communications between you and this kgb functionary wu aiping said immediately it will be necessary for me to study this dialogue in detail you will provide me with the documents that will not be easy there are no photocopiesonly the originals your guilt will provide you with the spur you need to find the answer wu aiping said we might as well get something straight at the outset you will do as i say and tell no one about it as far as problems that arise and your attempts to shovel excuses at me forget it keep them to yourself now get on with it zhang hua trembled in rage at how this creature was treating him he opened his mouth to say something then changed his mind he knew that he had absolutely no choice but to go on with it because the soviets seem to be in such a sweat over hong kong he said shi zilin has determined to allow them to do much of our work for us the core of the operation revolves around the disinformation we are providing the kgb to act on and instructions to our own highly placed agent there who is he code name mitre his real name is sir john bluestone one of the five tai pan who control the trading company of five star pacific i will need the communications pertinent to mitre as well the sooner the better now what about these disconcerting fluctuations in official policy that shi zilin has been authorizing that i do not know he does not tell me everything i am not privy to the workings of the overall operation merely a number of the pieces but perhaps the documents i shall procure for you will provide at least part of the answer they had better wu aiping said sharply you will meet me tonight at eight oclock take the line nine bus all the way to the end hong miao i will be waiting for you at the tea shop three blocks west of the depot bring everything i have asked for with you otherwise a duplicate set of prints will be sent to your wife by special courier his bright eyes caught zhang huas i trust i make myself clear zhang hua nodded mutely wu aiping laughed as he paid the bill cheer up comrade minister becoming a patriot is always hard work stalling had spent considerable time in new york so he thought he was used to crowds and subways new york had nothing on tokyo he had not been underground in this city for years while there was no dirt and almost no noise the sheer number of people jamming the platforms was staggering he was soon lost within the madly jostling throng he looked at his watch a train was approaching on his side he watched its gleaming metallic face rushing at him with awesome speed it pulled to a halt and its door sighed open he jumped back as people hurled themselves forward before those passengers inside seeking egress could make a move chaos ensued as the doorways were turned into brief battlegrounds stallings stared as uniformed platform attendants began to jam their whitegloved hands against passengers backs to fit them all into the cars a warning buzzer sounded and the train doors began to close the attendants continued their hard shoving until everyone was in with a hiss of welloiled hydraulics the subway began to move out of the station picking up speed when it was gone stallings was for that instant almost alone on his side of the platform his gaze drifted across the tracks and he saw a young woman in a pink and orange kimono with a pattern of gold chrysanthemums embroidered across it standing directly opposite him she was in wooden geta and carried a janomegasa an oiled ricepaper umbrella even from this distance it was clear that she was wearing the heavy makeup of the geisha the skin of her face was dead white her lipstick a brilliant crimson she beckoned to him stallings was momentarily taken aback it was most unusual for a woman to gesture in public that way then he glanced down at his watch and saw that it was precisely he took the note from his trouser pocket and displayed it the geisha beckoned again it took him just ninety seconds to find his way to the other side of the tracks by that time a train was on its way into the station the geisha led him into it without a word inside the car he created a path for them there was one empty seat and she demurely took it he stood over her he tried not to stare she was very beautiful they were headed north in the direction of kitasenju stallings had taken the schemata for the tokyo subways that had been waiting for him in his room courtesy of his tour company and had done his best to study it on the short walk to the ginza station just after the nakaokachimachi station the geisha rose and went to stand near the door stallings followed her ueno was the next stop they had been traveling for just under eighteen minutes they went up out of the artificial light of the station into the sunlight of ueno park yappari aoi kuni da they were the first words she had spoken since he first caught sight of her stallings nodded more on the lookout for any person who might be following them either on his own or by electronic means than he was for the lush foliage of early summer children filled the park babies sitting up in carriages being fed sweet tofu by their mothers toddlers taking their first tentative steps outside between mother and grandmother three and fouryearolds racing each other down park paths their shoes banging like bell clappers against the stone paving they walked on leaving the children behind the high piping voices however continued to float through the afternoon tinging the atmosphere cherry and plum trees rose up on either side of them their wide sweeping branches now bereft of blossoms along a steep turning the geisha paused in front of bushes whose flowers were past their prime or perhaps merely still dormant these are tairin she said in her pleasing husky voice they are a largewheeled variety of asagao the face of morning i think you americans call them morning glories neh yes this particular one is known as crimson dragon a chinese name because they were imported from china during the nara period approximately the middle of the eighth century ad by the western count her delicate hand extended the crimson nails gleaming in the sunlight these unlike your own varieties which bloom until noon are in fullest blossom at four in the morning by nine they have faded thats too bad stallings said somewhat distractedly he was still on the lookout for ticks who might have picked them up coming out of the underground on the contrary the geisha said we treasure the extreme ephemerality of the crimson dragon above all others for it mirrors lifes fleeting moments imprinted so strongly on our consciousness but so soon gone can we get on with our business miss stallings had had enough of this botany lesson he had far more important matters to discuss the geisha bowed her head her blueblack hair shone the intricate coif perfectly held together by motherofpearl kanzashi sticks stuck through her hair we have already begun she said stallings looked around him startled i see no one else here he said the geisha laughed softly should there be her tone was mocking yakuza never use women to do their work i assumed you were working for someone who did not wish to contact me himself the note said the geisha had moved to a stone bench half hidden by the furious growth of the asagao she sat down why do you wish this information stallings crossed to where she sat two fingers on the shaft of her janomegasa he felt uncomfortable and edgy as if he had already lost control of the situation im not here to answer questions but to ask them the geisha said nothing for a time her eyes held his enigmatically i dont even know your name he said at last eiko eiko what what do you wish from this man nichiren he stared at her wideeyed you dont really expect me to answer that im paying you for providing all the answers but now he was beginning to suspect that she did not have any instinctively his hand went inside his jacket his fingers wrapping around the grips of a pistol i think it would be prudent to return to a more populated section of the park he said as he drew the gun but the geishas hands were already moving in a blur the haft of the janomegasa had been laid bare instead of the bamboo a thin steel blade now slashed toward him its pointed end piercing the fleshy part of his gun hand just below the thumb stallings hand went numb and the pistol clattered over the stone path to land at the geishas feet i think we should stay where we are she said keeping him skewered as she rose she kicked the gun under the bench and into the foliage come with me she leaned on the sword and stallings felt searing pain race up his arm into his shoulder socket she must be right next to a nerve he thought furious with himself he walked where she led behind the bench in the midst of the asagao they were in dense foliage totally screened from the turning path already the sounds of the park and of the city had faded away as if beneath a heavy snowfall stallings still connected to the geisha by her slender blade was getting ready to make his move no woman is going to get the better of me he thought mentally gritting his teeth he bore down on his skewered hand feeling hot flame exploding up his arm as he forced the steel to slice further through his flesh and free him he came at the geisha then crouched low the fingers of his good hand searching for purchase along the janomegasas haft instead of opposing him the geisha allowed his attack ceded control of the blade to him and in his moment of surprise delivered a vicious liver kite that left stallings dazed and without strength he found himself on his knees his head bent so far forward that he could feel the folds of her kimono brushing back his hair he tried to rise but felt her hand on his shoulder the fingertips digging in to find the neural plexus his entire left side went numb he held his bleeding right hand on his thighs it lay there like a broken bird incapable of movement stallings was breathing heavily it seemed as if he could not get enough oxygen into his lungs there was a blackness around the edges of his vision and as he recognized it he became afraid many times during combat he had come to comfort fallen comrades as the battle raged on around them they had spoken in whispers over the screams of the falling shells but he had heard them well enough they had told him what it felt like to fight for life what it felt like as that life was ebbing from them how they had struggled to reach out and regain it how they had striven to hold on to life even as death overcame them there was death in the air now with a feverish shiver stallings recognized its dank presence knew that it was close death had come in the form of a geisha an unlikely enough figure the geisha stood above him her right hand cutting off the life from his body stallings wanted with all his might to rise up and slash her down he wished to see her sprawled in front of him he felt humiliated that such a frail creature had brought him down he was a warrior after all and if he was to die he wished a warriors death not this then stallings felt a hand in his hair and his head was jerked upward so that he was staring into the geishas painted face my god he thought shes beautiful beautiful and deadly her eyes were darker than the night her lips a perfect bow behind her he was aware of the clouds racing by the sky changing from a deep cerulean to a gray as heavy as lead losing all depth it was as flat now as painted scenery whatever you know the geisha said you wont tell me youre a professional there is nothing to tell you even to speak this much caused him excruciating pain nothing thus twisted the geishas features turned hard and ugly there is everything stallings coughed breath like flames rising up into his throat the womans grip felt like the jaws of a steel trap then the geisha reached down between his legs her long delicate fingers unzipped him uncomprehending he watched as her hand disappeared from view then unimaginable agony enveloped him for a time that seemed to him an eternity until he began to wish for death and in the cessation of that exquisite pain head bent sweat rolling from him like water he confessed his sins just as if he were in the sanctuary of a church they wanted mariana maroc dead his voice was as cracked and dry as a winter reed they sent me after her you are her murderer the geisha acknowledged did you not ask the reason for your proposed act appalled at what he had done stallings murmured his expiation i didnt ask but i suspect that it was because she was with nichiren they suspected her of tipping him off to her husbands raid on ohenro house she was murdered because it was suspected she was with nichiren again that pain so acute that it electrified every nerve ending so intense that it seemed to come from the very core of him his chest was heaving in great erratic bursts when it was over the sound of his heartbeat was like painful thunder in his inner ears all he could do was shake his head though you were the agent nichiren was the cause of her death the geishas voice was as ethereal and tender as a night wind through sweatstreaked bleary eyes stallings watched with horror the change coming over his adversary her free hand went to her perfectly coiffed hair and tugged on it the wig fell smothering the sleeping asagao blossoms beneath it ahhh the hoarse cry was tugged from stallings throat he could see through the heavy makeup now as if a window had abruptly opened into the others soul this was no geisha this was no female at all who his words stumbled over his whirling thoughts who are you the black eyes shifted back into focus your discreet queries were heard last night mr stallings i have many friends in this city they brought your interest back to me there was an electric fierceness in those eyes that held a certainty of purpose i am nichiren and i am your death stallings watched with stupefaction as those long crimson nails clove the intervening space when they touched his flesh he closed his eyes for as long as it took all feeling to flee him shanghai spring summer what zilin remembered most from that frightening time were the rats and the stench in the deep shadows at the back of the godown the wharf rats were everywhere their constant squealing was a miniature cacophony reiterating the tiny boundaries of his world in the bleak aftermath of mais death zilin had taken his only true friend hu hanmin with him to barton sawyers back door for refuge he would not endanger his family by going near them now and no one knew of his business affiliation with the tai pan the american had been loyal to his beleaguered silent partner and had conducted the two fugitives through the maze of alleyways surrounding the bund into one of sawyer sons myriad godowns they had gone threading their way carefully through the rows of crates and fiftypound bags of opium during the days the intense humid heat liquefied the poppy resin causing it to ooze here and there through the burlap casings filling zilins small world with the sickly sweet stench twice a day one of sawyers cooliesalways the same onewould bring a bag on his shoulder that looked just like the ones stored in the godown he was always careful to coincide his visits with the periods of maximum activity within the warehouse there was no opium or tea inside his bag but rather food and drink for zilin and hu which the two consumed with almost greedy intensity this sustenance constituted their only physical contact with the outside world and they were determined to absorb it wholly barton sawyer never came to see them but every so often the coolie would deliver to them a note in his handwriting in this way he kept them abreast of outside events he informed them when the hunt for them was at its height and as it slowly diminished within six weeks general chiang had more to worry about than two hunted men missing for so long according to sawyers reports the guomindangs leftist leaders under wang jingwei broke away from the mainstream as chiangs faction had done some months before chiang was far too busy rallying support for his cause within the splintered group to care about them thus there came a time when the coolie appeared without his customary burlap burden from the dense shadows he called to them beckoning them outward slowly they emerged into the dense stifling night the coolie led them blinking heavily in the flaring streetlights to the office of the tai pan where sawyer was waiting with a tencourse feast in celebration of their release from sanctuary it was almost six weeks to the day since they had been incarcerated however after the joy of reunion and freedom harsh reality set in the time was long past when zilins absence from his job at the harbormasters could be explained away three weeks ago another man had been hired to take his place sawyer offered zilin a job in the firm but under the circumstances and after careful consideration he declined his middle brother was already securely ensconced in the companys hong kong office zilin had no wish to put all his eggs in one basket the essence of good business practice was to diversify but he had no desire to take a job without prestige and even more importantly connections within the city thus he bided his time carefully scouring the list of opportunities as they presented themselves money was no problem since he and his brothers had invested in sawyer sons the company had returned to profitability having been handed the dredging concession by zilin the tai pan had taken the opportunity to heart his system was more efficient and more economical than the one employed by mattias king company for years thus the harbormasters office was delighted with the firm and as a result bestowed upon them three new shipping routes too sawyer had used to maximum effect all the inside information zilin had brought him while he was still within the harbormasters office all of this combined with the uninterrupted runs of opium traffic zilins younger brother was providing the firm and the constant innovations zilins middle brother was creating in the south to take sawyer sons from sixth among the tai pan companies to second only to mattias king company within the space of three years per the contract zilin had worked out with barton sawyer the shi brothers owned twenty percent of the firm with an option to buy ten more within five years from the date of the contracts signing in august the chinese communist party began an organized and quite militant plan to drum up support within the army there was an uprising in nanchang in which many chinese were killed and wounded but almost nothing accomplished near that time zilin found a job it was in the customs office a spot on which he had set his eye for some time customs he had known from his days within the harbormasters could be an almost explosively profitable department to be in he had tried several times to gain a transfer in the old days but there was never any room now the unrest and the killings had made room and zilin was swift to answer the call his credentials and experience made him an ideal candidate and he was chosen from among more than fifty applicants long ago zilin had fashioned for himself a business personality as meticulously constructed as an exoskeleton it was all tied into his theory of illusion that the master had taught him in a faraway suzhou garden he exuded the essence of the earnest and hardworking young man quick to learn and to adapt new principles to old none of this was in reality false it was simply not all of him of his burning ambition which drove him constantly he showed just a trickle and it was always for the firm for whom he worked at the timenever for himself as an individual in truth zilins new job was neither difficult nor particularly demanding for him and yet as in all things he was able to make the most of it because he was so swift to learn his superiors acquired the habit of giving him more and more of the work they themselves should have been doing in this manner zilin became privy to all the most closely guarded secrets of shanghai trade and as had been spelled out verbally in their agreement he regularly passed on many of these tidbits to barton sawyer thus increasing both their profits certain choice snippets however he kept for himself and his brothers in order to build their own company diversification zilin thought it is the only road to success by he was a wealthy man by that time a central nationalist government had been declared at nanking following the communist partys abortive attempt to take canton general chiang was coming under increased attack as he tried to solidify his support among the fractured remnants of the guomindang dissidents provincial political leaders and the communists as may be supposed the latter opposed him the most virulently they had gained newfound vitality from two new leaders who had recently surfaced with the power in their fists mao zedong and zhou enlai in the middle of they had set out on the long march that covered more than twenty thousand miles from the south to yenan in the north perhaps it was fitting that zilin should have met his future wife on a bright sunshiny sunday the very day mao and zhou led their victorious army into yenan the air seemed scrubbed as fresh as spring one of those quite rare days in china when the oppressive summer heat is temporarily banished it was an odd day perhaps to be at a cemetery but since mais death zilin made this pilgrimage fortnightly without fail after conducting zilin and hu hanmin to the sanctuary of the godown barton sawyer had made certain inquiries and at length had gained custody of mais remains according to zilins wish she had been buried here it was a picturesque spot south of the central district quite near the ramparts of the labyrinthine old town across the river the long hua temple rose its central pagoda the only one within the precincts of shanghai in the other direction beyond the ziccawei or southwestern district the qiuxiapu the garden of the purple clouds of autumn stood solemn and somehow gaunt the long hua temple had drawn zilin from the moment he had discovered it as a teenager it consisted of four buildings his favorite was the hall of the celestial guardians perhaps later it occurred to him that that was how he saw himself in any event he came here now to be closer to mai since her death he had not looked twice at any other woman he had not felt the rain and the clouds often his body ached in the secret places where mai used to caress him as if with a singleminded will of their own did they not know that she was gone this particular sunday with a brisk cool wind blowing in from the huang pu river zilin dressed in a dark pinstriped business suit entered the precincts of the cemetery clutching in his white fists the joss sticks that he ritually lit in front of the grave while he knelt reciting the buddhist sutras that should have been said at the funeral mai had never had she had been interred without ceremony of any kind during the black days of zilins incarceration with the rats and the opium now he felt that he must make up for that indignity the cemetery was rarely crowded this was not the favored place for the dead being so far from the bustling central district also many gwai loh had been buried here missionaries and the like as he walked to the site of mais grave zilin became aware of another presence he turned his head saw a slim woman standing with her head bowed before a stone marker with a christian cross surmounting its crest in her hands held before her at her waist she grasped a small but exquisite bouquet of pink and purple flowers she was dressed in black she was a western woman with dark eyes and hair ordinarily zilin was singleminded in his duties here he rarely saw or thought about anything else but mai during these painful journeys nevertheless he paused there on the stone path staring openly at the woman just as if he were a mannerless gwai loh what was it about her that caught him was it the gentle arch of her spine that threw her shoulders back as if in defiance of her sorrow was it the way several strands of her pulledback hair fluted against her cheek in the summer breeze or was it perhaps the way the soft sunlight struck her at precisely the right angle throwing into relief her high cheekbones her sensually curving lips all or again none of these things zilin had never before found beauty in a western woman it had simply not occurred to him that he could be attracted to a gwai loh in truth the thought frightened him he had long ago put away any qualms he might have had about moving among caucasians doing business with them or even in one or two cases becoming friends with them but this was another matter entirely with a concerted effort he tore his eyes from her slim form and moved in almost somnolent fashion to the end of the curving pathway where he knelt and lost himself in the ritual with a start he realized that someone was standing just behind him the shadow rippled across his shoulders eclipsing the slowly smoking joss sticks how much time had passed he asked himself stupidly all the sutras were done he lifted his head and stared directly into the smokily burning eyes of the slim woman he was immediately lost pardon me she said in passable cantonese i hope i have not disturbed you i wanted to wait until you were finished are you her eyes searched his face and when there was no reply forthcoming she plunged bravely on i seem to be lost a taxi brought me here but i have lost my bearings are you going back to the central district she smiled slowly she pointed back to where he had first seen her my brother is buried here he was a missionary her voice trailed off she was terrified that she had somehow intruded on a private moment and had offended him unalterably zilin came out of his daze slowly he cleared a throat abruptly clotted with emotion dont worry i am quite finished he got to his feet my wife im so sorry he saw that she was and this threw him even more he swallowed heavily and i about your brother she smiled again it was the shy smile of a little girl he was very happy here his work fulfilled him they were through speaking for the moment the silence that engulfed them was thick and uncomfortable the hooting of a boat came to them over the water zilin took it as an omen certainly i will take you back to central with me but if you have some free time theres a temple near here long hua a beautiful place from my youth perhaps a brief tour through it will relieve us both of mournings heaviness the slim woman looked at him do you really think that wise what would people say zilin was a rarity in that he was almost unconscious when it came to the subject of gossip which was such a passion of the inhabitants of shanghai in fact all of chinathat it had developed into something akin to high art for instance it never occurred to him that because of his stature within the city as well as his considerable wealth there were constant rumors circulating about him speculation on his private life and the like what could they say he said a little bewildered he was coming to realize that she had this kind of effect on him she laughed outright and the sound pierced to the very core of him oh any manner of thing knowing the chinese passion for gossipmongering she smiled easily a clandestine lovers tryst perhaps zilin reddened but that is preposterous yes she agreed still smiling isnt it she shrugged but one cannot control the minds of othersor their tongues of course zilin knew better his whole life was dedicated to the science of doing just that it occurred to him that their roles had somehow become reversed during the course of this conversation she was speaking to him as if he were the gwai loh and she were a chinese how odd he thought and unsettling are you afraid of what others say about you he asked she laughed again if i were i would never be here now china it is said is no place for a proper lady which my family and my friends suppose lam are they wrong in my country no gentleman would dare ask that question perhaps that is why you are here he said half joking no she was abruptly quite sober i came to bury my brother who died of malaria but is that the truth she wondered i buried him more than a month ago my mourning period is over besides michael was happy his life fulfilled thats more than i can say for my own she thought of what zilin had said abruptly she made up her mind how can i go anywhere with you sir we have not been introduced a thousand pardons he said reddening again my name is zilin shi he deliberately westernized his name putting his surname last so as not to confuse her well shi zilin she said using the proper eastern form i am pleased to meet you my name is athena nolan she had dark skin for a gwai loh deeply tanned and free of wrinkles her eyes were almondshaped and the deepest pure brown he had ever seen she said they were hereditary her mothers eyes her mother was hawaiian descended from the family of the islands first sovereign kamehameha i her father was an expatriate englishman a strongwilled man who like his father before him had traveled extensively throughout the world but it was his political bent that had led him to the sandwich islandsas captain cook had named his discovery in some one thousand years after polynesian explorers had settled themwith sanford b dole the current territorial governor all of this zilin learned some eight days after their initial meeting which ended in the trip back to town after all their bold talk neither of them had wished to compromise the other even if only in appearance for his part zilin was disappointed with himself from the time of his youth he had known that he was a maverick his ideas always ran ahead of his contemporaries now he was ashamed that he seemed trapped within the web of his societys mores this feeling was shortlived however for just over a week later he met athena again at a sawyer sons gala in fact it was barton sawyers eldest son andrewnow nineteen and a working member of the firm who introduced them it gave them both pleasure to take this formal introduction completely straightfaced as if they had been total strangers zilin bowed formally to athena then taking her hand in his he kissed its back in true western fashion athena appeared delighted it is a pleasure mr shi their eyes laughed at one another but not their mouths and forever after their first meeting at the cemetery was to be their secret somehow in zilins mind at least it made up for their timidity that clear sunny day athena saw in zilin everything for which she had escaped her stultifying life in hawaii lately the rolling turquoise surf the lemon sunshine the whispering of the palms the limegreen sunsets of the islands had begun to cloy sticking in her throat like syrup she could not sleep she was restless and irritable all the time she was interested in no one the news of michaels death had been her reprieve she had used it as an excuse to get out and over the protestations of her family sail to china had her father been at home she knew she would never have had the nerve to go but he had been on the mainland on a political mission zilin represented the embodiment of the exoticism she had avidly read about since she had first entered school he was supremely intelligent and not a little bit unknowable she felt his inner strength as if it were a palpable caress on her arm and always having wanted such a core of power within herself prized her proximity to it now tooand perhaps most important of allshe was bathed in the glow of his own captivation with her she saw her effect on him reflected in his ebon eyes and inwardly she trembled at its depth she was in love with him and with the fact that she could so immediately tame such an arcane and potent personality now she could admit to herself just how frightened she had been to take this journey because she had seen it as her only salvation she had closed her mind to the fear her many years of study had made her feel as if she could embrace any nation on the globe she had read in fascination about many delving into the myriad manners and mores of the cultures of the world actually being in china had been another matter entirely but now basking in the heat of the emotions in zilins eyes she realized how silly she had been to worry at all china wasnt really so strange after all basic emotions were the same in people no matter where they lived love could bloom in the most exotic of climes he said something and she laughed as she did so her arm brushed against his the contact was like electricity racing through her she laughed again drunk on this marvelous feeling of course he wanted to know about her name she smiled at that and he marveled at how such a small movement could transform a face i am often asked that question mr shi it was my paternal grandmothers name she was greek she met my grandfather in asia minor they were archaeologists following after schliemann at hissarlik troy zilin looked blankly at her i am afraid that i have not heard of troy or homer either homer he turned the odd word around on his palate as if it were an unfamiliar wine no she brightened good now while you teach me about china i can read to you from homer and teach you about ancient times in the west he did not so much care for the iliad not because of the poetry which he could certainly admire but for the story line which reminded him too much of the warlike past of china on the other hand he loved the odyssey reveling in the long convoluted quest he delighted in odysseus cleverness at outwitting his plethora of foes insisting that athena stop before reading him the solution to each puzzle so that he could match wits with the ancient hero and he sighed with knowing contentment when odysseus revenge was consummated altogether a fantastic tale he said when on a cool night some months later athena at last set aside the book it was an old and frayed copy in the original greek from which she had been translating as she read aloud to him but he was not so much thinking about homers poetry as he was about athena she absorbed information like a sponge and whats more retained it all there was nothing she had learned from him concerning chinese history that she could not repeat to him at a moments notice he had encountered no chinese womanor man for that matterwith her thirst for knowledge in all areas of human endeavor he was used to specialists who stuck to their particular fields and now it began to dawn on him that his list of true friendsnot acquaintances or business associateswas so short because none of them were like him but athena was her knowledge was of the worldher concept of life truly global in nature in an odd way zilin found himself contemplating her as the practical embodiment of his buddhism buddha taught that the individual was one with all things the reason he saw that athena was so at home in chinahe knew then that she would be so no matter where she lived or traveledwas that she felt as one with the world zilin was convinced that chinas eternal weakness was her insularity that stemmed from the traditional chinese horror of the gwai loh rather than seeing that there were important things to be learned from the foreign devil the chinese had closed their eyes to anything and everything not indigenous to the middle kingdom thus had they failed to understand thus had they been defeated thus had the feared gwai loh come to china and taken all that they wished zilin knew he was in love with athena he knew that he had lost his soul to her this frightened him more than when he had stared death in the face that night when mai was murdered for all his ecumenical thinking he was after all a chinese at heart he had never been with a western woman before had never felt the clouds and the rain with one it was no wonder then that he trembled constantly when he was in her presence he drank little yet felt as if he had consumed a vat of rice wine it was the physical contact that terrified him the most he felt quite irrationally he was sure that when he touched her his love would shoot right through his fingertips and his very essencethe history the uniqueness that made him chinesewould be lost forever in short he was convinced that in loving her he was sacrificing something else dear to him yet he could not break away from her by day he was able to maintain his concentration at his job his obsession with his lifes work ensured that he regularly met with barton sawyer and increasingly andrew as well delivering to their safekeeping the valuable secrets he had gleaned from customs too he regularly met with his youngest brotherthe middle brother was too far away in hong kong to attendto make business decisions that would swell the coffers of the shi business his father died and some weeks afterward his mother now the family consisted of the three brothers and by night this was what zilin dreamed of already in his subconscious mind athena had been made family this was the source of his disturbance not an evening went by when he did not see her that she was not on his mind one could only think about business so long he saw hu hanmin rarely now the scholar was back with the communists and though he had made several attempts to bring his friend with him zilin had no taste for it again zilins unusual mind allowed him to see what others could not that communism was no better or worse than any other form of government its theories thought so innovative by hu and his lot were in reality meaningless communism was devised by men and had to be implemented by men long ago zilin had come to the conclusion that pure theory and the human being were two mutually exclusive elements this had been proven to him again and again during his tenure as a communist when mai was alive the party was not ruled by adamantine theory but by men who had about them all the vices other men had they were avaricious selfaggrandizing venal callous and worst of all monomaniacally powerhungry perhaps sun zhongshan had been different but he had been plotted against opposed and in the end defeated by those inside his own ranks man was not content to read theory and act on it he felt obliged to interpret and zilin had learned that interpretation meant corruption communism was an ideal that could never be achieved at best he thought it was an imperfect tool through which a small band of powerful people could control a vast number of less powerful people its tenets could defeat the masses far more easily than it could exalt them he told this all to athena one night over dinner he had never done anything like this with anyone certainly he would never have exposed mai to these thoughts they would have hurt her too much for much the same reason he had not done so with hu either at the time he had no idea why he did so but later he knew that he had been testing her he had wanted to see if she would react at all negatively he had wanted to see if she would fail to understand had either thing occurred he could have broken off their relationship in good conscience you are not an idealist then she said after he had spoken his piece her eyes had about them the peculiar soft focus that he had noticed in them now and then when she was deeply involved in a puzzle or in communicating to him a particularly thorny western concept michael my brother was an idealist as i told you once he was a missionary he loved what he did she looked away out the window at the boats bobbing at pu dong on the other hand i could not accept what he did i dont believe in proselytizing the catholic proselytizers accompanied pizarro to peru they came with cortez to mexico in both cases entire civilizations were destroyed wholesale dont forget i come from a family of archaeologists the problem with proselytizers is that they leave no room for those who disagree with them she turned her head back from the watery wavering lights of pu dong i suppose the same could be said for your small band of powerful people at that moment zilin knew that he would marry athena when in manchuria became a japanese protectorate by dint of military perseverance zilin again had occasion to take note of the japanese in some ways they had never been far from his thoughts in studying them he had seen how clever they were at picking over chinese culture and mores lifting what they felt was the best from this area and from that then incorporating these elements into their own society zilin felt certain that a culture this intelligent bore watching also he was vitally interested in them from a historical perspective since they like his own country had shut themselves off from the western world for centuries however unlike in china the meiji restoration changed all that zilin had seen how this cultural revolution had at once freed the country to embrace the attitudes and thus the business opportunities of the new century and had doomed the traditional samuraidominated culture for these formerly elite members of japanese society it was adapt or die those who did adapt were properly emasculated within the new bureaucracy compounding their problems was the swift rise of an altogether new stratum of japanese society the merchant class the restoration was making of them the new heroes of japan as trade increased and they became the nouveau riche there were lessons to be learned there zilin was certain both positive and negative but increasingly he was disturbed by a concomitant development with japans expanding infrastructure that was the new militarism japans relations with china had never been anything less than hostile but now zilin perceived that the greed of the mercantile class so vital to the new japans continued economic growth was causing a rise in militarism that used as its fuel an insularalmost fanaticpatriotism zilin saw this as particularly pernicious since the true genesis of japans aggressive expansionism lay within the business sector adherents of which were already well established in both the powerful bureaucracy and the weak government he was certain that blood would be spilled in china when early in hu told him stories of a series of secret meetings between mao and general chiang the fact that the two most bitter enemies within the internally riven country should feel the need for a rapprochement chilled his blood only an outside threat of the magnitude of imperialist japan could cause them to share a concern but as zilin had expected the talks broke off abruptly and with a good deal of rancor the guomindang and the communists were still at war it occurred to him that since the turn of the century his country had known nothing but internal strife that even if his countrymen had possessed his foresight they would be too busy battling each other to pay any attention to the longrange future of china it was a sobering thought but he had to admit one that mitigated his antipathy to communism a united china was the first step toward the future any future he was as certain that chiangs despotic road was wrong as he was about his lack of faith in the implementation of the principles of communism already he suspected the russian leadership of betraying the revolution and further he was beginning to see them not as the communist ally mao claimed them to be but as a future antagonist poised at chinas vulnerable northern frontiers still in many ways communism seemed to him to be the only viable road toward the consolidation of power and thus internal order and stability at about the same time mao and chiang broke off talks zilin and athena were married he wanted a buddhist ceremony athena said that she had no religion and so the nature of the ceremony did not matter to her zilin was vaguely disturbed by this but he was otherwise in such a state of euphoria that he did not give it much thought the ceremony took place in the long hua temple at zilins request in the hall of the celestial guardians they took their vows at the celebration afterward there was much talk among the assembled guests about maos increasing power chiangs new defensive posture the japanese in manchuria zilin was appalled at how little real concern was voiced these events so vital to him seemed part of another world to these people he turned away glumly staring out the window seeing nothing he thought of japan and russia and it frightened him just how vulnerable a disunited china really was later when he told athena of his concerns she said in her entirely rational manner you are a businessman zilin what you speak of now are political problems they require political solutions does that mean that i cannot become involved then he was thinking of the celestial guardians of his youth perhaps it is up to me to help frankly she said i think events have gotten too far out of hand for any one person to change their course now it seems to me that china is in the grip of a massive current of water where that river rushes so will china be taken but we are not helpless he protested true enough she said softly it is you and i who are helpless she watched him at the window he had bought her a new house for a wedding present for three weeks a feng shut man had padded up and down each hallway making certain the house was situated correctly upon its plot of land making certain that each room was situated correctly making certain that each hallway had a turn to the right making certain after their bed was installed that it faced correctly to the east and south not the north or west zilin she said now come to bed and when there was no response i need you she trembled as she said it the words had almost stuck in her throat what an effort of will that had taken now once launched on her chosen course she was unable to stop she threw off the bedcovers do you not find me desirable she watched his back carefully there was no movement from him no indication that she even existed he was locked within his fear of her now that the moment was at hand he felt her physical presence like a bar of iron across his chest his insides turned to water and he felt the beating of his heart as a painful reminder of the seconds passing he wondered at his core whether he could survive this whether his ancestors would ever forgive him his weakness for losing his heart to a gwai loh was that what he was terrified he would lose to her his family the tradition that bound him to china what of the family he would start with her would they be separate from the shis who had come before that was a notion he could not tolerate the familythe dynastywas paramount and absolutely sacred zilin look at me he turned at last to her call and knew that he was undone whatever would befall him in the next moments he could not resist her she lay upon the pale peach sheets her thick black hair unbound curled like the inky sea at night against the pale pillows she had fooled him she wore no nightdress or covering of any kind in the warm lamplight of the room her dusky skin glowed with topaz fire it was the first time he had seen her naked and he was stunned into immobility she was like a pool into which he longed to plunge headlong he was amazed and terrified at how deeply he wanted to lose himself in her essence she was petite but formed as no oriental woman ever could be her breasts were larger her waist smaller her hips wider in china there was the peasant woman who with her callused hands and feet her stocky frame was built for the fields and at the other end of the spectrum there was the fine lady whose skin never felt the sun whose hands were softer than silk whose feet were bound painfully in childhood so that they would be tiny and thus beautiful athena fell into neither of these categories she was fineboned her flesh glowing with health her hands were strong and capable and her feet were not golden lilies she was an alien she was smiling beguilingly at him and seeing the direction of her gaze he looked downward he was horrified by the distinct bulge in his trousers your body has answered me she said huskily even if your mouth will not she raised her naked arms to him and zilin thought he had never seen such an erotic gesture come here to me he felt as if his mind had been numbed he felt himself moving toward her across the rug but he had no sensation of conscious volition he was walking in a dream like the men old before their time lying insensate on filthy pallets pipes gripped laxly in wooden hands eyes glazed in the grip of opium he stood next to the bed staring down as athena unbuckled his belt as she piece by piece divested him of his western garb he felt more and more a stranger to himself until he was as alien as she naked he stood before her barely breathing his sacred member as hard as a pillar of teak his shame was not carried over into her eyes curiously this increased his feeling of dislocation he could not have exposed his maleness so brazenly to mai or any chinese woman for that matter then athena reached out enwrapping him with her fingers she moved them lightly up and down the shaft it felt as if he were being caressed with a satin glove his chest shuddered filling with oxygen and it seemed his body was working normally again while her left hand stroked him her right spread across his abdomen rising upward traveling with light curiosity over his rib cage the fingertips making circular patterns across his chest she connected with his nipple and he felt an abrupt lurch between his thighs heaviness began to suffuse him there was a sensation growing within him riding his emotional currents it was unexplainable to him it was like a patch of darkness at noon it should not be there but its presence was irrefutable nonetheless she drew him gently onto the bed into her perfumed precincts with a deeply felt groan he bent over her his lips opening to kiss the inside of her thigh athena would not let go of him he crouched over her in a position that was almost worshipful his hands encompassed her waist and moving lower felt the hipbones the cage of her pelvis she had fuller buttocks than most chinese women and somehow this inflamed him he kneaded them with passion as his tongue caressed her abruptly he was mad to enter her he moved around kneeling between her legs her curled fingers drew him forward come into me she whispered in precisely the same way she had said come here to me moments before her fingers slid up his quivering shaft as he moved the last several inches his flaring crown touched her moist lips and she groaned she was breathing hard her lower belly rippling with her efforts he entered slowly gently until she had encompassed his crown with her wetness as before she had done with her fingertips he slid in and out with just the very tip teasing her with the promise of what was to come he rose above her his eyes drinking her in watching the effect of the eddies his hips made on her flesh as if he were the moon and she the sea he found that he was skilled at control mai had tutored him as best she could in the pillow arts she would have remembered him as a gentle and understanding lover but hardly a passionate one would she have recognized this zilin who felt as if he had plunged into the heart of a great tangled jungle enmeshed within wildly sprouting emotions that before now he had been unaware of in himself though his pillow skills were highly honed he felt their almost mathematical precision deserting him the deeper he penetrated athena the less sure was his grasp upon the positions pauses deliberate caresses with which he brought himself and his partner to culmination rather he felt an acute sensation of racing headlong recklessly heedlessly wantonly he felt his own hot breath inside her as he moved up her felt the perfume of hers entering him as he withdrew he was intoxicated with her out of his mind he had ceded control to an abruptly willful shadow inside himself that enmeshed him in pleasure beyond his imagining thus it was that when athena her smoky eyes lidded raised her arms to him her fingers gripping his shoulders as she moaned come down on me i want to feel your weight on me when i come he mindlessly crushed himself down onto the hot pillow of her breasts oh now yes now merged with her he came upon the clouds and the rain shooting in ecstatic bursts endlessly into the furnace at the core of her being war with japan was in the air it was the beginning of in shanghai business went on as usual the citys inhabitants were used to living with tension zilin had been doing his best to keep as much of the news as possible of the worsening situation from athena hers was a soul unused to the strife of war besides she was a woman and there were matters one just did not discuss with the female of the species but athena confounded him at every turn she was intelligent and inquisitive and in her way far bolder than any chinese woman could ever be she learned most of the newsmixed of course with far too many rumorsdespite his attempts at shielding her she asked questions endlessly and in the end zilin went against his better judgment and told her most of what he knew if only to dispel from her mind some of the more outlandish gossip he and his youngest brother had had a meeting in which they had decided to begin selling all their nonliquid assetsgodowns manufacturing plants and the like if war did break out zilin did not have a great deal of faith in the chinese army not against the japanese one cold blustery february day andrew sawyer came to see him at the customs office this was a somewhat rare occurrence since zilin and barton sawyer sought to keep their business association as secret as possible andrew had grown into a strong longlimbed young man he had his fathers iceblue eyes and his mothers strawcolored hair he had towered over zilin for some years now he seemed acutely aware of this height difference for he was always careful to sit in zilins presence he did this now pulling a slatbacked wooden chair up to zilins desk he had not bothered to remove his heavy overcoat his cheeks were flushed from zilin supposed the winter wind sweeping in off the bund excuse me elder uncle i would not have come to your place of business unless i had no other recourse andrew sawyer spoke a better idiomatic cantonese than even his father did it was the language in which he invariably chose to engage zilin please think nothing of it zilin said immediately centering his concentration on the young man my work is such that interruptions are often welcome especially from you andrew zilin genuinely liked the fellow though he was young and thus prone to making mistakes he learned from every one and never once repeated them too he did not have the gwai lohs usually inherent superior attitude toward the chinese he never had to be reminded to whom this country belonged all the chinese with whom he came in contact liked him because they were comfortable in his presence andrew nodded his handsome head that is most kind of you elder uncle i know how busy you are during the day here he hesitated like an engine abruptly bereft of steam though zilin knew that he had meant to continue the thought zilin thought it was time to help him you seem troubled andrew is there something i can do the young sawyer sighed in obvious relief and his wide shoulders sagged a bit i was wondering again his voice trailed off he clasped his hands together rubbed his palms as if they itched him that is elder uncle i was wondering i know this is a terrible imposition but i his head came up and zilin was startled to see the amount of pain in the young mans eyes carefully he buried his astonishment would it be convenient if i came by to see you tonight at home privately is it all right with your father my father knows nothing about this elder uncle andrew said quickly in his tone there was pleading it must be kept that way for a moment zilin did nothing but watch the young man but this attitude so upset andrew that he began to tremble in anticipation of course of course zilin said smiling you are always welcome in my house andrew again relief was apparent on the others face would nine oclock suit you oh yes yes indeed elder uncle andrew jumped up thank you he forgot himself for a moment and grasped zilins hand my apologies for intruding on your busy day zilin watched him hurrying down the wharf toward the western structures ranged along the bund sleety rain the color of lead rattled against the shutters of zilins study as athena led andrew in zilin was hunched over his private papers busily toting up the shi brothers assets in an attempt to make some sense of what to do with them during the impending military storm he turned around in his chair when he heard athenas cadence in the room he stood and bowed smiling he had changed out of his western work clothes he wore a nightblue quilted silk coat over traditional chinese blouse and trousers so good of you to come andrew he said just as if it was he who had issued the invitation he spread an arm outward in an arc come let us be comfortable over here athena already has tea brewing they sat on zilins handcarved dragon chairs the bamboo shutters were drawn against the inclement weather at their side was a lacquer screen on which a pair of tigers lords of the earth leapt over lush foliage above their heads unconcerned by their power a brace of herons spread their wings moving through white curling clouds athena returned in a moment carrying their tea on a small exquisitely wrought red lacquer tray she did not stay and they did not ask her to in honor of the occasion zilin had called for black dragon tea instead of the usual winter jasmine this did not go unnoticed by andrew nor did the fact that because this was she the hour of the snake they sat facing southeast he was now more grateful than ever that his elder uncle had agreed to receive him the hard rain rattled the bamboo shutters moving them minutely as if wishing entry into this sanctuary zilin had had his study built in the rear of the house during the day it had the best view of the water at night it was the quietest insulated as it was from the other rooms by a long hall with two righthand turnings zilin held his porcelain cup in both hands feeling the heat penetrating his flesh he sipped savoring the teas special flavor before allowing its warmth to steal through his insides covertly he watched andrew the handsome western face so much an amalgam of his father and his mother was slightly drawn the flickering lamplight picked out growing circles beneath the young mans eyes i saw wiqin last week zilin said i was up north for a few days and ran into him he sends his best regards and hopes he will be able to travel south in the spring to see you andrew nodded the mention of his old school friend had failed to rouse him out of his morose mood your mother is well yes andrew said and a moment later thank you for asking elder uncle one needs always a strong and united family he sipped at the black dragon tea such a network is what makes an individual strong andrew without family a man sinks to a level below that of the animals a man can survive without a family but he can do nothing more he cannot live according to the tenets of buddha zilin put his hands in his lap this storm it is already li chun the beginning of spring in just over a month jing zhe the waking of insects he shook his head this violent weather does not seem right elder uncle andrew lifted his head he put his teacup aside having sipped but a little i am in a terrible dilemma it came out all at once like the first burst from a cannon and he has come to me zilin thought why did he not go to his father he recalled andrews words of this afternoon my father knows nothing about this elder uncle it must be kept that way zilin also now put his teacup aside the time for serious talk was at hand but he said nothing knowing that prompting would only increase the young mans embarrassment for some time elder uncle andrew began i have been seeing a girl he wrung his hands as he spoke his eyes were lowered i am not i am not a promiscuous person i saw this girl in good faith i had feelings for her genuine feelings but all the time i well i suppose i was unsure no one knew i was seeing her that is to say no one within the family some of the servantsno doubt ah xip was onemay have known or suspected here andrew paused to take a gulp of tepid tea all this was fairly standard zilin thought assuming he had divined the ending to andrews sad little adolescent adventure with a trembling hand the young man set down the cup it clattered noisily in the still room now the girl has told me that she is pregnant he looked up elder uncle i have searched inside myself for the aspects of love they are not there i do not love her i do not want to get married zilin tapped his arched fingertips together in an internal rhythm pardon me for voicing the obvious andrew but it seems to me that this is a problem that is easily solved go to your father and no andrew fairly shouted it out my fatherno one in my family for that mattermust ever know any of this happened elder uncle my ascension to tai pan is at stake you must tell me why andrew because the young man said averting his head the girl is chinese buddha zilin thought i take it then there is a family involved very much so yes zilin took several deep breaths to calm himself it was one thing for a gwai loh to visit a brothel he knew and feel the clouds and the rain with a chinese courtesan it was quite another to have a clandestine affair with a chinese girl of the mandarin class especially for the scion of one of the leading tai pan houses in shanghai the family had stature money influence perhaps barton sawyer dealt with the father in business perhaps he was a distributor whatever the case he would demand retribution andrew would have to marry the girl and andrew was quite correct if barton sawyer then handed over the title of tai pan to andrew the house would be put into the brides familys debt that the elder sawyer would never allow reluctantly he would come to the conclusion that andrew had already reached and that zilin was reaching now the new tai pan of sawyer sons would have to be one of the younger brothers zilin knew them both well neither was andrews equal in courage or business acumen neither in short were tai pan what is the family name jiu jiu ximin andrew was grasping his ears with his fists his voice was but a whisper yes elder uncle oh oh oh zilin thought jiu ximin was a worker organizer fully seventy percent of the chinese labor force employed by sawyer sons came under his influence he could if provoked cripple the company its a mess elder uncle i admit it andrew was rubbing at eyes squeezed shut an irretrievable mess zilin watched the minute tremors of the bamboo shutters pelted by the howling winter storm this seemed to him to be the last straw the embodiment of the creeping dread he had been feeling during the buildup of what he knew to be the coming war he had sensed all along that this holocaust would in some way irrevocably change his country andrews crisis had brought his fears for his country to the forefront he recalled athena saying it is you and i who are helpless at that moment he knew that she was wrong he returned his gaze to the young man weeping before him his mind was running at full speed come come andrew he snapped in the harshest tone he could muster that is no way for a future tai pan to act one must be strong always even in the face of blackest adversity one must never show ones fear a tai pan cannot be thought to be weak he has too many enemies who would seek to take advantage of that weakness after all a tai pan has an entire house to think of a history of growth and expansion that is sacred yes elder uncle andrew took one last swipe at his teary eyes lift your head up yes elder uncle the master of a noble house must never be seen to lower his head it is a sign of defeat there will be no defeats for you andrew not if you hope to take your fathers place one day i understand elder uncle good zilin said now to jiu ximins daughter you do not love her no elder uncle then a marriage is out of the question and rest assured andrew marriage is what jiu will demand of you he gave the young man a penetrating stare rightfully so andrew swallowed hard but he did not take his eyes off zilin zilin thought what an opportunity this young man has presented me with he has put in my path a chink in the gwai loh armor i must be careful as i insert my blade to open it further such a gap may only come to a man once in a lifetime be careful he cautioned himself not to squander such a treasure holding his mounting exhilaration in check he began to think of jiu ximin a blackeyed dragon of a man inflexible and greedy to a fault greed zilin thought perhaps yes perhaps we can trap him there he has coveted my huang cheng godowns for years why every time he passes them he almost drools a prudent forwardlooking businessman such as myself would want no part of shanghai real estate these days but there are few who understand this as yet yes the huang cheng godowns might be the answer but i must be careful jiu ximin is a difficult and clever man he will surely make us pay dearly for what andrew has done to his daughter giving no hint of these thoughts he said there are always ways around such difficult situations however it is a matter of careful negotiation and money of course i havent enough money elder uncle nor do you yet have the ability for such subtle negotiation but you shall accompany me on all meetings your posture will be one of abject humility jiu ximin will like that it will give him a sense of power over your father that must not happen elder uncle of course not andrew set your mind at ease on that score i will deal with jiu ximin and while i do so you will be gaining invaluable insight into conducting negotiations butzilin held up a fingersuch extraordinary lessons as these do not come without a price i will pay you whatever you zilins upheld hand gave him pause never transact business in such a crude fashion andrew besides i do not want money i rather desire a pledge from you i will give you anything elder uncle anything zilin smiled but not everything remember you must think of sawyer and sons first now andrew nodded your pledge is for future services there may come a time in the future when i will come to youor contact you by messenger you will know him because he will carry the rest of a token a piece of which i will give you at that time you will remember this moment and will do whatever is asked of you anything elder uncle that was your word to me andrew anything andrew sawyer bowed deeply from the waist it is as you wish elder uncle i so swear to you on my honor as future tai pan and on the honor of my ancestors in sawyer and sons all gods bear witness zilin said to himself i will make this boy into one of chinas great tai pan i am bound to him as closely as he is now bound to me because of his blunder i have been liberated from the inaction that was threatening to destroy me by ail the gods great and small he has given me my bridge to the west great buddha i may yet ascend to the role of celestial guardian of china today i have begun a lifelong struggle to lift china up from the mud into which the foreign devil and her own insular stupidity have dragged her jiu ximin was an immense mountain of a man dour in countenance with smoldering button eyes by turns taciturn and fiery in his responses he sought continually to catch zilin off guard by these apparently contradictory moods however his intense traditionalism soon made itself manifest to zilins searching mind lianhua the girl whom andrew had made pregnant was his child and he was properly angry about her situation but after all she was a daughter and therefore not particularly important to him his sons were his life their future would continue the jiu line cleverly zilin had selected a suitable chinese whose family were clearly delighted to have their son enter into marriage with the illustrious jiu their own wealth was sufficient for jiu ximin to feel immediate relief at the mention of their name he would not show it of courseand zilin had seen no reason to inform andrew of this feeling that the scare would serve him better in the long runbut despite all his bluster about andrew having to marry his daughter he would never have allowed such a thing a gwai loh even one on the exalted level of a future tai pan was anathema to jiu ximin it was enough that he had to deal with them on a daytoday basis taking their money assuaged much of his anger but allow one to enter the family never jiu ximin saw gwai loh not only as barbarians but as cultural children the chinese had been cultured for more than four thousand years in the face of that what were two or three hundred he wanted no part of them he wanted the huang cheng godowns on the fourth day of their meetings when he at last allowed a thawing note to enter the negotiating session they were served jasmine tea by a young woman she could not have been more than nineteen or twenty a year or two older than lianhua zilin watched her carefully because she was the only other person of the household whom jiu ximin had allowed them to meet in all their time at his house by definition that made her important zilin felt certain that she was not here by accident his suspicions were confirmed when the girl did not leave after she had served them but rather knelt by the side of the low table with her hands in her lap and her head bowed this is sheng li jiu ximin said casually she is a friend of lianhuas a childhood friend deliberately he took a sip of his tea his eyes never touched her now that my daughter is a grown womanhis gaze bored into andrew with an almost palpable venomshe must put aside childish needs it occurred to zilin that jiu ximin had ordered sheng li to remain simply in order to shame her he spoke of her as if she were no more than his daughters dogeared stuffed animal which now must be consigned to the pyre lianhua will have far too much to do and to learn in her new life her new family for her to carry any excess baggage therefore as part of our arrangement shi zilin i suggest that you take her do with her what you will it does not matter to me i will tell my daughter that you have offered sheng li employment at a rate of salary above what i am willing to pay her that will be the end of it zilin feeling that the girl would be better off as far away from this man as possible agreed it was not until sometime later after he had installed sheng li in the home of a chinese friend of his that he came to understand jiu ximins true motives in wanting to be rid of the girl i came to the jiu household with my mother sheng li told him one afternoon when he came to see her in those days i was too young to do much of anything in the way of real work so i became lianhuas companion she wore a brocaded silk robe that flattered her slimhipped figure her thick nightblack hair was pulled back in a ponytail that cascaded down her back when zilin had come to the door she had met him there and kowtowed when she spoke his name she always used shi zhu ren which meant shi the man in charge and used the nin form of you that one used in addressing a person of clearly superior rank we became friends she continued much to jiu ximins chagrin you see he eventually found out that my father was japanese my mother was dying and he went through her papers to see if there was family to whom he could ship her back so that he could avoid the expense of a doctor and later a funeral to all this zilin said nothing he walked beside her his hands clasped behind the small of his back the cool spring wind caused him to bend lightly into it so that he gave the appearance of being lost in thought we had no such family and jiu ximin was forced to pay for her care this sum he took out of my pay so that for the last six months i received no payment from him i did not mind it was my duty to care for my mother as she once so lovingly cared for me i would have felt somehow soiled had i been obliged to take his money for my mother without being able to replace it boats bobbed along the pu dong and everywhere the industry of the city was in evidence you have been exceptionally kind to me already shi zhu ren i felt obliged to tell you of my stigma i do not expect you to keep me or to pay my way now that i am on my own i am prepared to go my own way you will never see me again zilin watched her face it was a perfect oriental sculpture large almond eyes that seemed somehow always heavylidded a wide intelligent brow flat mongol cheekbones and a bow of a mouth she did not have the typical chinese moon face which he attributed rightly to her halfjapanese ancestry he saw a fierceness of spirita brightly glowing spark that somehow reminded him with painful acuity of maicommingled with her feminine pliancy at that moment the sun slipped out from behind a bank of bluegray clouds and bathed them both with a golden light zilin felt a plangent chord struck inside him and all his longing for a return to his chinese nature which had been complete with mai struck him full force for this time as he strolled with sheng li as they spoke in low tones he felt totally divorced in spirit from all gwai loh and abruptly he knew why he had instinctively not brought sheng li home to live in his own house there was a point at which despite all efforts east and west could not meet there was a particular nexus perhaps it was the simple concept of yin and yang that an oriental couple implicitly understoodaround which chinese and gwai loh could only circle like moths about a flame never merge sheng li he thought stealing another long look at her the name meant victory at the end of the long saturday when at last he returned her to the family residence and in the gathering twilight himself returned home athena met him at the front door to tell him that she was carrying his child for a long time athena suspected nothing she knew of course that her husband had interceded in some important way for andrew sawyer and that it must be kept a secret but nothing more during her pregnancy she kept up her studies in chinese history politics and culture several times zilin attempted to teach her about buddhism but perhaps because of her background she could grasp nothing of the innate concepts she was far more interested in pursuing her ongoing study of archaeology the field of endeavor that had fired her paternal grandparents lives she got a small crew together and began a dig to the southwest of the city near the old town by the sixth month she had cut down her hours at the site from six to three mostly because of zilins concerns by the seventh he insisted that she suspend work altogether by then she had enough of a supply of shards and bones to keep her occupied at home athena was not aware of any lessening of zilins passion toward her even as her belly expanded to its fullest she did not feel the lack of an inner connection between them because she had no idea that such a thing might exist this was not so much a failing within herself as it was a lack of understanding within a broader cultural spectrum to his credit zilin tried his attempts at explaining the unexplainable concerning buddhism were therefore bound to fail though athena could embrace the worlda remarkable enough achievement for a gwai lohshe could not perceive the underlying oneness with the universe that was the essential skein of life he did not love her any the less for it he just could not love her as completely as he wished or as he needed to athena felt a shift in the forces surrounding her she did not know what was the matter just that the atmosphere around her did not feel the same at first she put it down to her pregnant state the baby was fully formed inside her she knew that and was very active so near the birthing process her body was changing itself for what was to come nothing seemed the same to her why or when she began to suspect it had something to do with zilin she could not say with the new life so complete inside her the enormity of the change in her own life was finally sweeping through her long days at home with her shards and bones no longer held her interest and she brooded about her new life she was angry with everyone and everything she suspected the world of clasping her in its heartless fist she suspected zilin of what she did not immediately know she thought she felt a lessening of the force by which she had known him ever since they had first met she found herself thinking often about that sunny sunday at the cemetery she recalled how the sun had felt on her cheek how sweetly the birds had sung how openly zilin had looked at her and with the recalled rush of that wild stirring would inevitably follow the horde of her present suspicions she wanted him around her more and when he was not there she grew wild with longing for him her hands would cup her swollen belly as if she felt the need to protect her unborn child from her husbands desertion the thought that he would somehow leave them filled her with unreasoning terror the black spectre of being alone with her baby in the vast tumult of chinaa china stirring toward warwas more than she could bear but then she would close her eyes breathing deeply and evenly until she forced herself to sigh what is wrong with me anyway she asked herself zilin loves me he will love the baby where could he possibly be going sleep would come to her on that note for his part zilin felt no guilt in being with sheng li for one thing mistresses abounded in the china of that time but for anotherand far more significantly for himhe felt no estrangement from athena or their newborn baby whom she had named jake for her fathers father in fact because a side of him that athena could not understand was now being nourished he was a happier more alive person since sheng li had come into his lifesince they had felt the clouds and the rain togetherhis inner fear of athena had faded away he no longer felt as if he were losing something precious each time he pierced her jade gate for whatever his love for a gwai loh took away from him was returned by sheng lis deepening devotion to him less than two years after he had taken her from jiu ximin she delivered to him a boy he was a premature child by more than almost six weeks and he came into the world dangerously underweight and yellow with jaundice sheng li cared for the infant night and day dozing fitfully perhaps an hour or two a night when the child did but no more zilin tried to be with her as much as he dared but he knew it was not enough more than a year ago he had taken her out of his friends residence and placed her in a small house of her own which he paid for but there were other problems to surmount and the childs birth only compounded them the war with japan had finally come like a stormcloud at last breaking over china the battlefield encompassed shanghai and much of northern china for the time being at least the army was bravely holding its own against the massed japanese military machine but zilin knew what the inevitable end must be the outbreak of hostilities quite naturally made sheng lis parental secret all the more volatile so much so that zilin had refused to hire an amah for the infant and to help sheng li for fear that word of her halfjapanese heritage would somehow come out in the citys current paranoid climate nothing could be more lethal to sheng li also now that zilin had two sons to think about the enormously important decisions facing him were being made even more painful it was now october the japanese army had taken a majority of the larger towns in the north more ominously they controlled the lines of communication in the south they were holding the yangzi valley as far as canton and the yichang gorges what stability was left in shanghai was slipping fast the nexus point for his country that zilin had foreseen was at hand it was time to make his move he knew that he would have to do it now or it would be gone forever he thought he understood the enormity of the sacrifices he would be asking of himself but of course he knew that their effect could not be calculated ahead of time and that he would not truly know their toll on him until afterward he also knew that as in wei qi once having been made his move was irrevocable when he was with athena and sheng li and held the babies against his chest his resolve would waver his thoughts would selfishly center on the pain he would be inflicting on those he loved most in the world but weighed against that human suffering was the agony of china he knew that if he could help to relieve his country of its selfdestructive divisive bent then any sacrifice was worthwhile yet whether he was with athena or sheng li he would often rise in the depths of the night moving silently away from their warmth and the comfort of their bodies alone and apart from the world in the soughing silence of the great darkness he would weep tears of selfpity he was a man with two families but all too soon now he would have none there would be no time for selfpity then china was calling out to him as they had done almost all his life it was the japanese who finally undid him because of them because of sheng lis secret he could have no one in the house with her liqiusheng li had insisted on calling the child beginning of autumn because he had been born on wednesday the day of the august demarkationhad with difficulty recovered from his infants jaundice and gained in weight but he remained a sickly child and sheng li or zilin was always feeding him some medicine or other on a night when zilin was with neither woman liqiu became ill his temperature rose alarmingly until at the hour of the dog near eleven oclock at night he seemed to sheng li to be burning up from inside his skin was hot to the touch and dry pulled so tightly across his flesh that she could see the veins pulsing and distended just beneath the surface she used cold water then alcohol to rub him down but nothing seemed to help she began to panic she had no friends to whom she could turn and with her mind clouded with fear and a mounting dread for her sons safety she wrapped him in blankets and fled with him into the night now all the shapes and configurations of streetcorners shop faзades that had once been so comforting to her seemed menacing from open doorways and windows through which pale flickering light splashed she heard the hard brittle clickclickclick of abaci totaling the weeks take or mahjongg tiles boldly slapped down on baize tabletops tonight these sounds so integral to this citys rhythm took on a sinister quality like the snapping of giant insects mandibles the sounds made her bolt all the faster down the twisting streets past dark dank alleyways thick with the breath of the poppy past the locked and bolted faces of shanghais greatest businesses mattias king company the asiatic petroleum company the hong kong bank sawyer sons ewo brewery the britishamerican tobacco company gibb livingston company and standard oils mei foohong subsidiary which nightly lit most of the lamps of china sheng lis mind was filled with terror for the safety of her liqiu she did not think of herself or of the consequences of her headlong flight she thought only of getting her child to safety only dimly did athena hear the pounding she did not stir out of bed until the amah came in to wake her scrubbing the sleep from her eyes she drew on a silk gown and dutifully padded behind the old woman through the darkened house sheng li stood shivering with cold and fear just inside the front door the amah wrung her hands and chattered like a monkey in a dialect that athena had never been able to penetrate sheng li even more terrified now at having to confront this gwai loh who she knew was mistress of the house tried to kowtow but the baby bawling in her arms would not permit her to my lady she whispered oh what is it you want here athena asked my baby ah han athena commanded pointing the amah took the child from sheng li began to examine it with great care and tenderness sheng li stared at her with wide unblinking eyes she sucked in deep breaths and tried to still her panting at last she turned to athena and said i wish to see shi zhu ren but zilin was at that moment far from shanghai he sat in a darkened lorcha anchored along the east bank of one of the myriad northern tributaries of the huang pu there amid the cacophonous calls of the night birds the enginelike whirring of the insects he sat with his youngest brother with great ceremony zilin handed over a thick packet covered in red cloth zilins brothers callused hand closed over the packet automatically weighing it by the eight drunken immortals he said this is a great deal of money all i possess zilin said in a shivery voice save for the two houses and the money ive set aside for the women and my sons zilins brother looked carefully at him nothing left for you then where im going it will be far better money could only be suspect the younger man slipped the packet beneath his shirt inside his belt it is very dangerous what you contemplate all life is dangerous zilin said i do this for all of us you and i the other said carefully may never see each other again we are family is that right zilin said nothing staring out along the skin of the faintly phosphorescent river somewhere a fish splashed youd better take care in your dealings with mao he might eat you alive elder brother ive heard many stories usually i discount these rumors but the ones concerning mao are too numerous to ignore he will never allow you to lead i do not want to lead zilin said he leaned forward elbows on knees if we are victorious against the japanese if we can unite china under communism we will have gained a measure of success naturally mao will reap the immediate benefits his selfaggrandizing and his ego will cause him to become a hero to the country a living legend but as you know little brother legends have a way of falling to dust here everything is mutable china thrives on change i think the qualities within mao that make him a born leader will also eventually destroy him his ideas are far too radical after the revolution will come a time of reappraisal perhaps even of reactionary retrenchment he shrugged who can truly say but i will not die with him when his time comes by the spirit of the white tiger what of me you are to sail to hong kong zilin said but do not join your brother he will know you are coming he has his instructions from me use the money i have given you wisely invest and prosper but give yourself another name another name but why by the celestial blue dragon not even my ancestors will recognize me then zilin laughed theyll know by the eight drunken immortals i hope so all right zilin said ill name you myself that way they will hear and know he looked at his brother and laughed again a nickname is what you need younger brother nicknames are common in hong kong and ive just the one for you three oaths three oaths tsun of course athena did not understand until that moment she had been certain that zilin loved her completely now she knew that was not true somewhere inside her perhaps she was appalled that she could not understand what zilin had done nor find it in her heart to forgive him she was well acquainted with the custom of men keeping mistresses she just was not able to accept it in her husband she simply could not comprehend his need for another woman she felt utterly humiliated as if he had pushed her face in the mud she wondered if that was truly what zilin cravedto be kowtowed to then why had he married her surely he understood that kowtowing was for chinese again part of her was appalled by what she was thinking how could she possibly consider herself a citizen of the world if she could not accept another cultures customs as her own and at last she knew that she could absorb all the data could understand from a distance exotic customs and mores but when it came to living according to those different tenets she was as much a prisoner of her own background as were her parents or her grandparents her father for all his love of hawaii had never integrated himself into his wifes culture none of the children had been given hawaiian names they were not versed in hawaiian culture athena felt ashamed she fought against it just as she fought against the feeling of humiliation but it was a losing battle she could not stand the sound of the alien infants screaming she could not bear the sight of sheng li slim and spare and delicate standing with her head bowed as docile as a lamb athena felt red rage suffusing her this woman was everything that she was not and she had stolen zilin away from her athenas worst fears had come true with a cry she sent all the servants out of the house the bawling baby was left on a chair settled in a silk pillow then she turned back toward sheng li fury was in her heart she was like an animal mother who finds her family injured or missing zilin had he been there would certainly not have recognized her for the first time in her life athena felt all rationality desert her the chinese womans docility only enraged her all the more she struck out with her fist and sheng lis head whipped on its slender neck athena hit her again her chest was heaving like a bellows she glared down at sheng li stretched out insensate beneath her wide apart legs sheng lis coat was thrown back and athena saw the long perfect legs the delicate curve of her rump the sweet swell of her hip bared and glossed in the lamplight with an animal cry she whirled running into the kitchen when she returned she held an iron bar in her white fist it glowed red hot at its end gray smoke curled lazily off its tip the ghost of a dragon in the charged air with a great rush of wind like the breath loosed from its gaping jaws it uncoiled itself rushing downward just behind as the iron made searing contact with smooth flesh book three hsingi hong kong tokyo moscow beijing washington summer present five

down over his boat i have a feeling in my sacred member thats how you make all your decisions there came a chorus of raucous laughter twentyfive hundred says the gods of rain are with clubfoot su this day another three thousand on t y chung he won last year didnt he all gods bear witness hell do the same again today no one spoke of the whispers that had raced like sheet lightning last year though no official protest was raised it was claimed by some that t y chungs craft had illegally veered causing a neighboring boat to run into three oaths tsuns one hundred yards from the finish line that delay had ensured chungs victory to a man all the guests wondered whether this would be the moment of honorable tsuns revenge it was said that the dragon boat races dated back years legend had it that a poetstatesman named chu yuan had turned himself into an instant folk hero by throwing himself into lake dongting in a province now known as hunan to protest the inhumane policies of the ruling prince fleets of local fishermen took to the waters in a vain attempt to find and save chu yuan at last giving up their search they contented his spirit by throwing packets of cooked rice into the lake to turn away any evil spirits who might seek to harm him there were of course other stories of the origins of the dragon boat races but this was the one that t y chung liked the best now as the long slender boats with their brightly painted dragonhead prows lined up at the starting position he began to focus his attention on the building excitement of the race itself the craft had fifty oarsmen at the center of each was a drummer who would set the pace for the others the owners of the boats were either shipping magnates like t y chung or three oaths tsun fishing families cargovessel associations sports clubs there was even a police boat but each year one of the other entries was designated by all the others to see that it did not win during the last several years the rivalry between t y chung and three oaths tsun had spilled over into this annual sporting and betting event adding for those who watched a certain delicious piquancy the vying of these two mighty tai pan in the arena of high finance was the stuff of vicarious gossip their rarefied world could never actually be experienced by the crowds in the street but the dragon boat regatta was an event for everyone and because as in almost all things chinese there was an enormous amount of bettingbecause of the tai pans participation more here in fact than in the other three races combinedthey could feel a part of the intense and bitter rivalry and thus elevate themselves for the time of the festival it had also become a tradition that the principals not wager on this race and this heroic feat of abstention seemed to heighten the frenzy of betting from all other parties all that is save sir john bluestone his tall angular presence was like a shadow standing beside t y chung from time to time they spoke as if unconcerned with the confluence of gaudy tension and gaiety rising all around them with almost clockwork regularity they broke open bottles of icecold san miguel beer drinking from them in long hard swallows the line of dragon boats was bobbing in aberdeen harbor at the other end of the eighthundredyard course opened up between the masses of highsterned junks at permanent anchor here red and gold pennants were fluttering the wind is rising one of t y chungs invitees said judiciously he squinted into the face of the high rising clouds northwest and building he spat heavily it must affect the race but by all the gods how which craft will benefit and which founder well see now how the captains fare another said fornicating rain how can any real determination be made now a captains skill will be in evidence no matter the weather the fourth man said will he not have the gods with him the fornicating weather means nothing to gods it will mean nothing to the winning captain either he laughed perhaps your guts have turned to water perhaps your sacred member is as limp as a worm you can still change your bets a blind pox on your words the other responded ive made my choice and by all the gods ill not be swayed now fornicating bad weather or no fornicating bad weather oh ko thats the spirit honorable wo shall we double our wager in accordance with the onset of the rain i say it will hold off until the leaders have rounded the last turn what do you say the honorable wo cast his thick forefinger aloft his tongue came out getting a taste of the wind eeee in this you are wrong as well honorable soong all gods bear witness ill take your side wager t y chung laughed silently to hear these men so frantically involved they are like children he thought mockingly playing at fan tan or dice i have more important places to put my money only the prospect of a good wager and the exhilaration of a fine race he knew could bring so many rivals together the harbor waters took the bad blood and washed it away for as long as they all stood upon these decks that and the fact that these men all fear me all save bluestone i think the gwai loh is powerful though not perhaps quite as powerful as he believes ayaa theyre off and the wind is coming on now it is in the leaders faces the boats in the second tier are gaining fornicate all gwai loh look t y chungs dragon boat had gotten off to a poor start but the driving wind was slowing the craft ahead of it now t y chungs craft was passing that of clubfoot su it was just behind and alee of three oaths tsuns the race was already half over it should be making its move look how it lies there it cannot make any headway on honorable tsuns boat defecation and piddle soong exclaimed he is not full out he hides from the wind as the honorable tsuns shadow he is protected yes yes cried the others excitedly by all the gods hes right they were clustered at the rail gesticulating and sweating profusely the sky had turned a dense slate gray and they could all feel the warm wind on their faces the pressure was dropping fast and a dankness had come into the air three oaths tsuns and t y chungs boats were sweeping around the last turn the other dragon craft not far behind at that moment they all felt the first spatters of fat drops of rain ayeeya soong called the gods have favored me now the dragon boats were nearing the finish line the men aboard the loong wang could see the straining backs of the oarsmen wet with sweat and rain fireworks were crackling building as the race shot to its close t y chung remained beside sir john bluestone content to drink his beer and speak in low tones as if he had not a care in the world or as wo said quietly to soong as if he already knows the outcome of the race if honorable chungs boat does not make its move but it is now they could all see it clearly though just beyond the skyline was a purpleblack bruise as the heavy rains swept down across victoria peak dew neh loh moh the fornicating storm will destroy the very end of the race one thousand says it doesnt now it could be seen that the beater in three oaths tsuns dragon boat had picked up the pace considerably it was impossible to hear anything but the barking fireworks and the increasingly frenzied shouts of the bettors t y chungs craft began its final spurt with powerful unison work the fifty closed the distance until they were nose to nose the two flamboyantly painted dragons heads dueling into the voracious forefront of the whirling storm the rain hit them all like a greengray wall the island slipped away from them and for a time they were isolated from the rest of the world even the black junks in the harbor had become merely a dark gray mass their bulk turned into the horizon still the men did not seek shelter but rather bent over the railing their hands above their eyes as they strained to be the first to announce the winning vessel who which has won the honorable tsun or the honorable chung fornicate all bad weather and all those who forecast all weather i cannot tell it is t y chung came a shout from out of the steady drumming of the downpour t y chung by a fornicating whisker an oar on honorable tsuns boat broke at the last minute praise all gods forever soong shouted today i am doubly blessed not as blessed as i am t y chung thought triumphantly hsunfeng tehli temper the winds and gain profits mentally he rubbed his hands together the downpour had lessened and their world was again reappearing the dragon boats in the water rode the choppy waves listlessly the oarsmen slumped over their seats while the rain pummeled their bare heads firecrackers were exploding with renewed intensity forming a flickering smoky glow through the steaming rain champagne was being served all around and the banker soong flushed with his good fortune lifted his glass to t y chung master of the dragon boat races for the second straight year there were cheers all around while the day grew fuzzy with rain and drifting smoke from the fireworks in a moment sir john bluestone found a lull and eased t y chung out of the knot of businessmen was it merely your good joss that won your boat the race today t y chung shrugged squinting up at the tall tai pan what else but joss last year a boat swerved into the leaders lane this year an oar on the leaders boat cracked both incidents occurred near the finish line in both instances your boat benefited in many cases joss is seizing opportunity by the throat t y chung said cannily and when there is no vulnerable area available t y chung brushed lint from his superb suit one must mr bluestone how shall i say itcreate that which a throat would otherwise provide they were both being carefultesting the waters as it were that was only right and proper when one began a new business alliance hes brought all these tai pan here to lord it over them bluestone thought looking into t y chungs eyes hes gained great face by doing so especially with me here serving me notice his power is on display for me to review as if i were in an art gallery but is it all of his power that is what i must find out did you make money this afternoon bluestone asked in his most careful tone of voice how so t y chung had a quizzical look on his face that could be hiding anything you know that principals in the race cannot bet bluestone smiled just conjecture on my part i thought you might have been creating again do you think i would concern myself with such a paltry sum his face had darkened appreciably and bluestone noted this why then feeling for the nerve he saw coming into the light to win mr bluestone there was anger written across t y chungs face to ensure that three oaths tsun gains no face on such an important occasion this face i can take into business it is worth bullion it he was about to go on enraptured by his rage when he caught himself he shrugged face is face but bluestone knew that was not what he had meant to say at all the light in t y chungs eyes had meant it is worth everything now bluestone had to ask himself why the answer he thought is tsun it must be but what happened between the two to feed the hatred so and how can i use that enmity in the weeks to come when kamisaka opened the door to his knock she gasped to see him buddha she cried clutching him to her you look like youve just returned from the land of the kami nichiren knew that it had been a mistake to come here yet he had come anyway he would have been much better off traveling across town to the kisan family villa his mind knew that but his heart felt something different he had shied away from the kisan compound because he did not feel safe there here in the tiny usagigoya amid the eternal bustle of tokyo he felt a semblance of peace returning to him ever since the attack at his lodge atop the sword he had felt periods of despair engulfing him during the execution of gerard stallings it had come to a climax he should have felt some satisfaction in destroying the man who had murdered mariana maroc but he had not instead within the depths of his mind he was preoccupied with mariana herself spinning like a top set in hideous motion by the highpowered bullets he could feel the spatter of her blood like hot brands across his face he felt himself scrambling over the muddy earth in desperate search of her his determination to reach her at the very edge of the world he reached out certain that he could pull her back to safety but she had instead pushed the fu shard into his hand why and why did he now possess a second piece of the same fu unking him to jake maroc but he knew that the two of them had been linked long before this from the moment he had found his mothers diaries among her personal effects and read them incomplete though they were he had known that he and jake maroc must be mortal enemies as their mothers had been before them it was jakes mother who in trying to take nichirens father away had beaten yumiko senseless and then used a whitehot poker to brand into her flesh for all time a reminder of barbarian cruelty had not that moment blossomed into fruition at the sumchun river but now the fu source of immeasurable power jake had a piece now he had one from the same source who yumiko had jakes mother stolen a piece of yumikos fu during the attack but how would yumiko a japanese come to have it just as importantly whose power did it represent jake marocs source then why did he nichiren also have a piece their sources were poles apart these were questions he had put to his source after relating the incident atop tsurugi you are the future source said can you accept that i can accept anything but what the two pieces of jade seem to indicate which is i want no part of jake maroc i suspect that the fu shard i unearthed did not come from my mother at all i suspect that you somehow planted it this has been your idea all along to somehow link me with jake maroc if that is to be no he had fairly yelled it through the overseas line i will not have it you have no choice in the matter sources voice was calm almost emotionless first the fu shard was your mothers second you are under discipline did you think i began to lead you away from the future your mother planned for you in an aimless manner that is not my way there is a reason for all action a role for each individual to play but this is too much nichiren had said mariana falling through the spaces of his mind tumbling bloodied her blood still on his face and shoulder the look in her eyes you cannot play the god with people in this way this manipulationwhatever it isis far too vast in scope it cannot hope to succeed for all our sakes source had said you had better pray to whatever form of the buddha touches you that it does work otherwise destruction will engulf us all from what quarter from what quarter will it not america russia china they will all be caught up in it the entire world what has all this to do with me and with jake maroc when you meet all will be made known to you weve already met nichiren had said a number of times only death has been the result the fu will change all that it will bind you together it will provide you with life have faith he wanted to say but i do not believe in buddha i have no faith therefore i cannot believe you instead he had been silent thoughts chased themselves like golden fish amid bewildering coral shoals exhausted he accepted kamisakas gift and fell into her open arms staggering them both she kicked the door closed and on tahiclad feet led him into the minuscule living room with some difficulty she leaned down and threw her textbooks off the futon that had been folded into the shape of a sofa together they collapsed upon it she made a move to leave but he clung to her tea no he mumbled his face buried in her shoulder not now dont leave kamisaka felt worried and elated at the same time she lifted her hand to stroke the back of his head as she had seen her mother do with her younger brothers her heart constricted to see his obvious pain but her emotions soared to know that he had come back to her that he needed her she knew there were other sanctuaries to which he could run he had come here to her nichirenchan she whispered she kissed the side of his head she held him close what had happened to him his world was a mystery to her she read the papers she had heard of the assassin named nichiren but she could not relate that creature of the outside world and the media to this man whom she loved with all her heart and soul but now for the first time seeing him in this state she found herself wanting to knowto know everything she wanted to understand what could cause such anguish in a human being now she wanted to know what he did she wanted to know why and at last she knew that only by understanding the core of him could she stop him from leaving her again would he kill someone when he left she did not know or care his leaving was what mattered most to her she understood that her ignorance of this part of him had been deliberate with a childs stubbornness she had not wanted to face the darker parts of him once she could have accepted their relationshipthis partial happiness now she could not she realized that she had grown up in the last six months sometime when she had not been looking she had become a woman nichiren was her responsibility if she wanted his love if she wanted a completeness to their relationship she had to deal with it all and she sensed that it would somehow also be better for him but how to go about it she knelt on the wooden floor beside his body she wore only a light cotton day kimono beneath which was a thin silk underkimono though she most often wore western clothes in the street she much preferred the comfort and freedom that traditional japanese garb afforded her at home she knew there was nothing she could tell him that would ease his pain or make him speak therefore there was nothing to say now into her mind came a haiku her mother had turned into a kind of lullaby when she was a child yari tatete toru hito nashi hanasusuki of those who pass with spears erect there are none plumes of pampas grass all through childhood that peculiar litany of words had followed her down into sleep she had never truly understood the meaning of the lullaby she had merely been cradled by the confluence of shikis poetry and her mothers homespun melody years later however at a small tokyo museum she had come upon a woodblock print of ando hiroshiges depicting a procession of a daimyos retainers toward one of the fiftythree stations of the tokaido one of the two main thoroughfares that had linked edo to the provinces of japan in the days of the tokugawa shogunate in this scene she saw reborn shikis poem and immediately understood its meaning instead of the daimyos samurai passing in regal array today only the pampas grass grew its stately plumes taking the place of the soldiers spears now that same poem made her think of nichiren and she suspected that shiki had been wrong despite the sad beauty of his thought for here before her was a samurai from the days of the tokugawa shogunate perhaps he was the last one perhaps he did not even understand what an anachronism he was perhaps he needed to know still there was nothing to say through the open window she could hear the sounds of modernday tokyo the susurrus of rushing traffic the waxing and waning of the klaxons of emergency vehicles the neon glow of the tokyo night infused the usagigoya with an opalescent mixture of pink and blue tinting the walls and ceiling her cheek his hair an electric fan whirred like a nocturnal insect outside in the hall the click of shoes a brief splash of conversation then a door slamming shut silence though tokyo was all around her kamisaka made herself shed her modernday self and enter into the world of the past in edo there was only flowing patterned silk meticulously coiffed hair and the precise manners of a samurai lady with the pliancy of a courtesan on the outside the fearful shades of steel on the inside a stillness had crept into the room dispelling the cacophony from outside in the stoneandglass night there was a sense of ma of space a pause and because there was nothing to say kamisaka injected into this interval the only thing she could she reached out across the space between them lit by the ghostly reflections from the neons and touched him it was a gesture of such infinite tenderness and caring that nichiren even though his eyes were closed and his face turned away from her could not fail to understand its nature slowly he turned over on the futon until his eyes found hers she had not taken her hand from his hip this connection spoke like the greatest shout in the silent room it possessed a depth unknowable in voice communication kamisaka was stunned to see that he had been crying and that furthermore her touch had caused him to reveal this to her that acceptance of her melted her heart tears welled up in her eyes but with an act of will she forced them back it would not do at all to show him his naked emotion reflected back at him he would construe that as a sign of weakness in her and a mark of shame within himself she wished to speak now but seemed incapable of breaking this fragile ma that enveloped them both in its shell she felt that just by her touch she had drawn much of his agony out if i came back here he whispered it was for a purpose he closed his eyes to better feel the strength of her flowing into his hip from her palm fingers nails someone died in the mountains high up the weather was bad there was rain there was blood his voice was breathy and thin as if he were talking in his sleep she spun away from me her blood flew at me like rage for just a moment we were connected by that essence of her then she was gone into the storm the ground had been weakened by the rain a mudslide began taking us both down i grabbed at the bole of a tree i wanted to save her too his eyes were squeezed shut i wanted to save her too now all kamisaka could do was rock him as her mother had done to her when she was a child yari tatete she sang to him toru hito nashi her voice almost broke before the end hanasusuki jake awoke with his head full of glass shards he had been dreaming of mariana he had been in a room filled with a sourceless light he was naked it was cold in the room obliging him to keep moving even when he became exhausted ceiling floor and three walls of the room were a featureless slate gray one wall was a thick slab of glass on the other side of it was mariana he saw her moving around their apartment quite naturally she arose from bed relieved herself washed brushed her hair dressed she sat at the wood refectory table in their living room and wrote letters she fixed herself breakfast read through the looking glass in her favorite easy chair stared out the window she appeared to be waiting for something after a time jake became aware that she was waiting for him he moved until his nose was flattened by the glass barrier he spoke to her his own voice echoed back at him as if he were in a tunnel the reverberations picked up speed clashing noisily against one another mariana ignored him im right here he shouted until he was hoarse and woke up with a head full of glass shards his throat felt sore he groaned remembering his drunk with mikio komoto there was a discreet knock on the fusuma he rolled off the futon and said come in im up the sliding door opened and the oyabun came across the threshold he was shaved dressed in lightweight slacks and shortsleeved cotton shirt his tabiclad feet made no sound on the reed mats he grinned you call this up ugh jake said komoto held out a glass full of a liquid the color of oxblood what is that jake took it sniffing if you have any respect for your body youll drink it down he nodded thats it all in one swallow its the only way he laughed as jake almost gagged on the thick fiery stuff jakes nose began to run clears the sinuses too komoto said taking the glass back ill meet you in twenty minutes toshisan will show you to the bath in the space of that time jake felt if not perfect then at least halfway human the shortsleeved shirt that had been left for him fit fairly well but he was a bit too tall for the japanesemade trousers it made him sad this defect a reopening of the wound his dream had made in him mariana dying on the sword japan he thought that he hated this country now and that too saddened him they ate an abstemious breakfast of rice cakes and tea neither felt inclined to put more in his stomach at this hour where are we going he asked komoto as they went across the garden it is important i have found to leaven ones life komoto opened a car door and they got in he started the engine knotty problems are often solved in the most creative atmospheres i am tired of the gloom of my house and our weighty talk sohe pulled out into the streetwe will have some fun mikio komotos idea of fun jake soon discovered was to play pachinko they went down to the ginza losing themselves in the crowds and the enormous neon signs color ran rampant flowing across the street sidewalks building faзades climbing even into the sky together they stood before the chromeandglass doors of a pachinko parlor as a teenager in tokyo for his secondary schooling jake had been taken with them playing the steelbearing balls that clickclackclicked down the vertical glassencased field of play as they bounced off strategically placed metal nails one bought a handful of balls and using a lever snappedthis was the derivation of the word pachinkothem one by one up into the playing field the object was to win balls which one would then trade in for various prizes jake had never won anything but that had not stopped him from playing for hours on end fascinated by the garish colors the blinking lights and whizzing buzzers the strident bells and electronic tickering that were part and parcel of the game for jake it had a particularly poignant quality he had been playing pachinko all one bleak winter afternoon he had cut classes as he seemed to do more and more as the term wore on restless and lonely he gave himself up to the game seeing in this mindless symphony a form of release different from the one he found at the martial arts dojo that afternoon was filled with light as heavy and metallic as zinc he trudged home through a layer of frosty snow on campus he found the telegram waiting for him like an adder on his bed he ripped it open to find that the marocs had been in an automobile accident a headon collision with a drunk driver had killed them instantly now i have nothing jake thought reflexively his hand gripped the chamois pouch only his piece of the fu remained the last link to his personal history though the marocs had instilled in him a sense of his past of his mother and what little they knew of his father it was not enough to sustain him now the school term was only half over but jake packed up what few belongings he had and flew back to hong kong the next day he had no more interest in classes of any kind but it had been three long years since he had been back in the colony for any length of time he had lost touch with what few friends he had he was utterly alone the stateless marocs having moved through shanghai had moved through hong kong in the same manner unobtrusively and alone in desperation jake now stateless himself took to the dangerous hong kong streets there he made new acquaintances and as he practiced the expertise that fo saan had so painstakingly taught him he made more in time he even gained something of a reputation which was of course how wunderman had found him pachinko took off the moment it was introduced komoto was explaining now as they walked through the aisles lined on either side by eager men women and youths snapping balls with glassyeyed concentration music as garish as the colors on display blared from loudspeakers some say that it was created by an industrialist gone bust in the aftermath of the war there was of course no more use for the munitions his factories had produced so the story goes and he was left with a stockpile of thousands of cases of steel ball bearings komoto laughed in truth i cannot say if this was so in any event pachinko was just what we needed after the war the colors and the sounds lifted us away from the years of drabness and sorrow the entertainment was cheap and addicting it absorbed the excess time on our hands they paused to watch an old lady feverishly snapping her lever the lower half of her face was covered with a breathing mask indicating that she had the good manners not to want to spread her cold in the old days komoto said the yakuza clans mine included fought bitterly over pachinko territories he took up station beside the old woman drew out a ball he began to play but not in any manner jake had ever seen before first he grasped the machine and shook it as if getting the feel of its weight next he took a long hard look at the set of the nails on the playing field he adjusted the lever then placing the ball against it he snapped it the ball flashed upward then encountering the first nail bounced from one to another lights flashed bells rang komoto won an entire slide of balls he produced another ball played it with the same result jake watched in fascination finally he had to ask how do you do it komoto was pleased that he had entertained his guest when i was a boy i went to all the parlors with my father he was oyabun then some of the technicians began to teach me the tricks of the trade they were known as kugishi nail men every night after the parlor closed theyd go into each machine set the number of balls inside realign the nails he shrugged in pachinko balance is everything because offsetting the weight of the machine will affect how the ball in play performs bouncing from territory to territory jake thought of toshimasan the territory of contention between the komoto and kisan clans what made it special blinking lights whirring sounds a bell was ringing somewhere close at hand as someone won a slide of balls is there anything you can think of jake asked that occurred around the time of my raid on ohenro house anything out of the ordinary that might have affected the balance of power within toshimaku komoto thought a moment only shizukis death who was he a highranking police inspector departmental head of a newly formed antiorganizedcrime unit very smart cookie had good taste too from what im told he was all set to marry police chief tanabas daughter how did he die nothing very interesting though it was bloody enough he was pushed by the crowd in the subway at rush hour a train decapitated him jake could not see any connection what happened to the unit well now i dont know komoto said held in abeyance i suppose higirasan would have been the next in line for the job but he died at ohenro house in your raid jake flashed on scarred sunken cheeks black eyes burning as with a fever that was a cop he said somewhat incredulously he acted as if he were a friend of nichirens impossible komoto said but if its true then it follows that perhaps shizukis death was not accidental jake was staring at the pachinko the old lady was playing the ball bounced and bounced from nail to nail territory to territory something there for him its a moot point komoto was saying there is no way to know whether it was murder not after all this time did you see the pictures of the incident in the papers or on tv he had found the edge of bamahk the pulse in this state fo saan had taught him to concentrate on nothing he did the opposite of focusing his attention he allowed it to diffuse to the point where he took in sensory data as impressions patterns of dark and light colors and sounds commingled the old ladys ball bounced from nail to nail it reminded him of something an impression what sure i took a great delight in shizukis death that had been a personal score i would have settled myself in time enlarge the field follow bamahk darkness and light a pattern forming another image in his mind an image of funny thing though komoto said that decapitation they never did find his head the top of a head thick stiff hair like a brush the edge of a forehead the tip of an ear stuck in a box on a table in kisans office in ohenro house buddha jake whispered his eyes were glazed with the aftermath of bamahk jakesan what is it shizuki was murdered i know it i saw his head inside a hatbox kisan higira and nichiren were grouped around it when i burst in i got only a flash of it then all hell broke loose and there was no time to think what brought it to mind now bamahk jake said and the pattern of nails in the pachinko playing field the black stippling the same as that of the hair on poor dead shizukis head i have had a chance to go over in detail the papers you gave me wu aiping said zhang hua nodded and what have you concluded actually im elated for the first time the qun has a real chance at destroying shi zilin above them loomed the twostory watchtower with its thickly enclosed guardroom below and its lofty observation eyrie above it was wu aiping thought a most excellent example of ming dynasty military architecture he rustled the flimsies copies of the documents zhang hua had delivered to him in the hong miao tea shop at their previous rendezvous on top of the great wall he had no qualms about security i have given up my mistress zhang hua said and winced at the senior ministers sardonic laugh and now you are saved eh comrade minister is that it wu aiping shook his head comrade lousinthe mousethat is what i shall call you from now on oh you are really quite entertaining come come you have already made your transgression the eyes of buddha or whoever it is you pray to have recorded your sin recanting now will not save you not from me he bared his teeth in a kind of horrific grin that made zhang hua recoil slightly lousin lousin wu aiping chanted like a bully in a schoolyard humidity gave the atmosphere a cloying heaviness so that there was a tendency to want to move as little as possible the sky was vast but without any discernible color heat haze had blanched all blue away leaving cloud and heavens nearly the same shade of oyster white wu aiping who towered over the heavyset junior minister strolled on it was zhang hua who was sweating not he he was rapidly coming to detest this man which made his control of him all the more satisfying mouse he thought i have trapped you now i shall slowly crush the life out of you it amused him to have arranged this rendezvous here the irony of this spot appealed to him it was commonly assumed by uninformed foreign devils that the great wall had been built for defensive purposes only that was not the case an important function was to provide communication and since the broad avenue along its top could easily accommodate horsedrawn wagons the transshipment of food and essential materials to and from outlying regions where the otherwise mountainous terrain would prove inimical to such rapid transit the answer to shi zilins defeat wu aiping said lies within these documents you seehis laugh now was all heartiness and good cheer i was correct in recruiting you the patriots role suits you though you fight against it much of shi zilins plan his ren has been revealed to me this mitre sir john bluestone is his primary funnel into hong kong the problem seems to trace itself back to kam sang this concerns me but ill come back to that in a moment it seems clear from the intelligence traffic that the pullout of mattias king and company has caused a change in the ren now fifty percent of the western share of the kam sang project is up for grabs the pak hanmin company has half mattias king have divested themselves of the other half reneged on their commitment at the worst possible moment just when weve come to the final phase it is clear that shi zilin has decided to push five star pacific his agents trading firm into the breach a doubleedged move it provides the additional capital needed to begin the project while keeping more control of it than would otherwise be possible they continued along their route they had come as far as badaling they passed beneath an arched gateway that had obviously been restored but was nonetheless magnificent they were heading toward zhangjiakou more commonly known as kalgan the name was taken from the mongolian kalgha which meant pass wu aiping went to their left and they ascended a steep flight of stone steps now they were on the very ramparts of the wall at a level with the guard towers eyrie to the north they could just make out parts of the newly built guan ting reservoir of course that would be how shi zilin would see it it is essential wu aiping said that one learns to think like ones enemy crawl inside his head study his tendencies find the pattern the pattern lousin everyone has a pattern and im beginning to discern shi zilins he grunted leaned against the dusty battlements out of the enervating sunlight his eyes roamed the horizon tracking the lines of umber and cerulean that were the demarcation between land and sky in between was the uniform drab gray of the modern chinese institutional structures i see the danger here that he does not this bluestone may be shi zilins agent but he is faangwailoh a foreign devil he is therefore beyond being unreliable he is suspect it occurs to me that he has played along with shi zilin just on the chance that has now come his way to get in on kam sang but he cannot know kam sangs secret zhang hua said i see that you are a patriot after all wu aiping said judiciously well in any case i share your concern the kam sang project is vital to our future survival its been extremely difficult to keep its secret from the faangwailoh investors we require their money not their inquisitiveness of course kam sang will give them what they want what hong kong needs but it will also provide us with our mighty sword to cut down the soviet menace that surrounds us like a malignant growth wu aiping waited until a straggle of three or four foreign tourists passed them by their cameras clicking away like a field of crickets in the hazy distance he could just make out the rising topography that led to the twin mountains of the tiger and the dragon between which was the great red archway leading to shi san ling wherein the remains of the ranking members of the ming dynasty were entombed for all eternity bluestones and i suspect shi zilins immediate problem is debt according to the intelligence documents it seems that five star pacific was caught out hard by the colonys financial nosedive in mitre reminds shi zilin in three separate communications of his companys shortterm debt load now this opportunity comes and bluestone is concerned with divesting five star pacific of almost all its liquid capital to buy up shares of pak hanmin and thus wrest control of that company while buying cheaply into kam sang it could he pointed out make five star pacific itself vulnerable shi zilin ignoring his warnings has ordered him to go ahead all well and good zhang hua said do nothing and you will be assured that bluestone cannot stick his nose into kam sang that part at least i agree with wu aiping shot the other minister the kind of withering look he would give to an underbright bureaucrat now i know why you never rose above your current level i dont want to destroy five star pacific i want to destroy shi zilin five star pacific is obviously the key to his ren it is his way into the kam sang project my project i know he opposes our clandestine use of kam sang through this trading company he expects to get close enough to kam sang to sabotage my part of it so i want five star pacific left alone i want him tied into the faangwailoh trading company so deeply that it will be impossible for him to extricate himself in a moment he laughed oh yes i do believe i have found our solution we will trap shi zilin inside his own company i dont understand of course you dont wu aiping said so bitingly that zhang hua winced again but if you think that i am stupid enough to explain it to you think again i want to make absolutely certain shi zilin is caught unprepared i will take no chances now he was figuring furiously what he had not told zhang hua was that he had already called upon the other members of the qun to research the names of the banks and lending companies that were holding five star pacifics shortterm notes there were an astounding number of them though on the surface of it the trading company appeared to be in good shape it was overloaded with five and tenyear notes now the qun would in secret through a dummy company they had dubbed yau sinkyuhn services hk buy up those notes one by one it would take millions he knew none of the members individually could come up with the money they all needed to borrow from their ministry funds and in wu aipings own case the science institutes government research allocation the risks were great but the reward would undoubtedly be greater then wu aiping thought when he makes his move against kam sang i will expose shi zilin as the traitor he is and control five star pacific all in one breath coming down off the great wall with zhang hua the lousin by his side he laughed enjoy these days shi zilin he said to the heavens they will surely be your last mikio komoto caught up with jake at the yatai the nighttime food vendor near the kannon temple in asakusa tokyos old quarter kannon the goddess of mercy attracted tourists as well as adherents day and night the park out front was always filled with young and old it was just dusk shoppers were hurrying home to their dinners children were being swept up by their parents after having played in the open air all afternoon the old folk were still engrossed in the idle gossip that fueled their days while they observed the several go games which had slowly developed through the afternoon the haze an incongruous confluence of water particles and exhaust fumes had turned sapphire with the lowering of the light the dark sweeping lines of the temple itself lent the scene a heavy brooding quality at the yatais mobile cart travelers weary from the day sat at the small wooden pullout table into its copper recesses were doled chinese or japanese noodles pungent barbecued chicken orwhat jake was eating oden this last was a savory stew consisting of a delicious broth filled with an assortment of vegetables boiled eggs seaweed fried beancurd cakes a variety of thick fish pastes and a dab of fresh bitingly hot mustard mikio pulled up a stool and ordered the oden there was a great deal of talk all around them as was often the case in japan the normally reticent citizen was eagerly rabbiting on to the stranger sitting next to him revealing secrets about himself that he dared not even tell his wife what have you found nothing jake said morosely he added a bit more mustard took a pair of cheap plastic chopsticks from the vendor and began to dig in hungrily he had left komoto outside the pachinko parlor heading into the roppongi district after making a call to the weaselfaced japanese he had met in the public baths but three hours spent in grilling him had turned up nothing he stirred the remains of his oden that leaves us back at square one not quite jakesan komoto was eating like lightning his bowl tipped just beneath his lips i have been as busy as you like a firefly i have been darting from flower to flower picking up tidbits just before i arrived here i gathered in a most interesting one its possible that shizukisan had a rival for the affections of chief tanabas daughter several stools down a patron who had been drinking sake with his bowlful of noodles since before jake had arrived began to sing a melancholy melody he had a pleasing tenor voice and he obviously knew how to sing perhaps once he had been a professional his drunkenness did not stop him from staying on key as the song unwound sinuously it reminded jake of the night of the raid on ohenro house the green world the heavily dripping foliage the smears of neon caught in the wet pavement of the street he felt an enormous wave of sorrow welling up in him at all he had lost since that terrible night he looked away from the singer as if that would also put his song aside how did you come by that komoto shrugged i have some small realestate interests about town a landlord who works for me remembers the girl because shes got an usagigoya in one of his newest buildings one i put up by the way hes sure she doesnt spend all her time alone in the apartment but the interesting thing is hes never seen shizukisan i showed him a snapshot he was certain the man he described was of another physical type entirely jake thought about shizukisan being pushed off the crowded platform the terror as the onrushing train lit up the tunnel with blinding light he thought of that bristly hair the gentle curve of the ear lying in the hatbox on the lacquer table the three of them around it as he burst in the irezumi men on his tail kisan higira and did you show that landlord another snapshot jake asked komoto grinned holding up the blackandwhite photo head and shoulders in jakes memory for all time smoldering there nichiren daniella discovered she was being followed the moment she went out of the office into the street across from her was the square mothers taking their children by the hand or allowing them to run after the pigeons beneath the low watery sun an almost pastoral scene in the heart of moscow as daniella moved a car moved it was almost dinnertime and the streets were clogged with traffic much of it official in this area everything was regulated by the lights so it was easy for her to spot the anomaly she wondered at that someone wanting her to know she was being watched instead of walking away she approached the car a latemodel volga sedan she got a good look at the driver a sandyhaired thug shed seen the type before living among them now and almost all her life she stopped before his rolleddown window and put her hard face on that was not difficult she did not like being followed she was obliged to lean down slightly moving to avoid the sunglare spinning off the hood who are you the sandyhaired man glanced her way as if only now focusing on her get in daniella bridled at the tone which department do you work for none he said he reached behind him opened the rear door on her side please get in comrade general i have been sent to fetch you by whom but she got in anyway intrigued it is not such a long drive he said in an odd friendly voice he spoke to her familiarly as if passing the time of day in the same manner as they had done for months on end he switched into the chaika lane and they picked up speed daniella was careful to watch where they were going they went through the heart of the city the sandyhaired man driving well they hit the highway the moskva river glittering in the twilight and the reflected lights of the new residential towers along its far bank the sandyhaired man turned the volga off the kremevskaya embankment crossing the river over one of the gray stained bridges behind them was gorky park they hit the highway doing better than one hundred kph outrunning the lightening traffic by a good margin it seemed they were headed into the countryside as they progressed this way for more than fifteen minutes from time to time daniella caught the driver glancing into the rearview mirror still she was unprepared for his sudden turnoff he slid them over three lanes within the space of sixty meters cutting off a blue zaz in the process hearing the squeal of brakes and almost simultaneously the blaring of a horn dopplering quickly away as they took the scurve of the offramp at almost the same speed dark trees rushing by then abruptly braking a sharp turn to the left and they were back on the highway heading into the city lights of moscow creating the horizon bright and lemonrich the deep dusky sky behind them reaching down to purple as the haze tinged it the sandyhaired driver turned them away from the moskva soon after they recrossed the river this time using another bridge heading north through the city staying away from the larger arteries no chaika lanes here few official eyes who was on our tail daniella asked the sandyhaired man glanced at her in the rearview mirror shrugged perhaps no one he said in his laconic manner precautions are mandatory she recognized these streets they led to red square soon he turned off paralleling them until they were just north of the square at kutuzov prospekt he turned east slowing now cruising down a street lined on either side by orange brick and gray stone private houses well maintained though they all dated back to the middle of the nineteenth century or earlier stopped in front of one and got out he opened the door for her bowing just as if he were a uniformed chauffeur up the steps comrade general he said in his friendly voice if you would be so kind daniella looked at him a moment then turned and went up the stone steps warm light muted behind translucent curtains bathed the stoop she felt very naked on the landing the door opened before she could ring the bell and she saw his tall lean frame his long handsome face she watched his light eyes so curious in his otherwise dark saturnine countenance she wondered what was beneath his surface coolness comrade lantin she said you have an odd way of issuing invitations come in he said stepping back a pace and closing the door behind her he turned down the hallway forcing her to follow after him in order to hear are you hungry i hope so ive been preparing blini he took her into a surprisingly large bright spotless kitchen obviously custombuilt with its imported vulcan stove marbletopped workspace stainlesssteel commercial refrigeratorfreezer copper pots hung from wire racks chained to the ceiling he resumed his work turning his back on her again he wore lightweight wool slacks that had been tailored in europe a newly pressed cotton shirt and black polished loafers without socks you look quite decadent comrade daniella said somewhat archly she was annoyed at having been pulled so mysteriously from pillar to post lantin was laughing and she was surprised at how open his face looked at that moment almost like a little boys save for the pencil mustache yuri he said yuri and daniella there are no comrades here inside these walls when she made no reply he decreased the heat on the stove burner and turned around what is the matter daniella looked around the room she peered into corners behind cabinet doors are you looking for this lantin took a portable tape recorder from a hidden drawer in the center island he handed it to her as you can see its not on daniella examined it carefully she took out the cassette and placed it on the countertop handing him back the instrument where is the camera she asked blankfaced lantin pointed daniella followed his direction discovered the video lens behind a mirror that had been altered to allow the picturetaking she followed the cord down underneath the sink to the videotape recorder she bent down removed the cassette from that as well she placed it beside the audio cassette that wasnt necessary lantin said the things not working im not surprised daniella said all that moistures very bad for the works youd best move it they stared at one another for a time when lantin smelled the butter beginning to brown he turned back to the stove i had no intention of recording this conversation he said you are too suspicious theres no such thing she said peering over his shoulder his hands moved deftly kneading the blini dough where did you learn to do that my mother he said adding a few drops of cold water i have a cuisinart somewhere but for mini theres really no comparison one must use ones hands they ate at the small wroughtiron table in the kitchen as informally as husband and wife the meal however was anything but ordinary buckwheat blini filled with beluga caviar drizzled with clarified butter iced vodka spiked with buffalo grass to daniella it had the aspect of a celebratory feast on the other hand it brought to mind an article she had read about american women who it was purported began their seduction of a man by serving him his favorite food her own body and the effect it had on most men was never far from her mind how could it be otherwise she was a supreme pragmatist early in life she had recognized her assets and had determined to use everything in her arsenal to climb the difficult soviet bureaucratic ladder daniella was no whore rather she had determined to use sex as the bright men around her used power they she found connived with their wits since they were unwilling to believe she could compete with them in that manner she used what she had to get to a point where she could whisper in their ears it had worked with karpov it had worked with colonel valentinin and lieutenant tolkchin before him it might work with yuri lantin as well but she was acutely aware of the different arena in which she now found herself this was after all what she had been striving toward but the dangerthat too confronted her you must congratulate me lantin said when they were through he had brewed them thick black turkish coffee the kind daniella loved best coincidence or had he ferreted that out our robot war against china is going splendidly you mean the vietnamese clash along the yunnan province frontier lantin nodded just this morning the new china news agency issued a further warning against what it terms these armed provocations and indicated that the army command was deploying thirty more divisions along the border this is your doing i take it karpov will say it is his but yes it is my idea just as it was my idea to send a department s team into japan to terminate nichiren daniella felt as if she were about to gag the rich food threatened to rise back up into her throat through the heavy beating of her heart she said you ordered me to send in a kvr team to observe and record nichirens movements she was desperately trying to regain her equilibrium does karpov know what youve done karpov ishow do they say it in the westpart of my hip pocket hes in there with the lining the lint and a couple of kopeks he smiled at her drink your coffee daniella it really is quite good he poured himself another cup the clock on the mantel in the living room ticked stertorously like an old man ill with asthma so you walked in and took over one of my teams she said after a time he shook his head i merely had them reprogrammed usurped my authority diddled with the chain of command rearranged their objective she saw that he enjoyed this kind of dialogue theyre all dead she said in a tone that assured him where she was placing the guilt yes well he thought a moment i hadnt counted on the intervention of the american agent jake maroc thats the one he looked out the window into the night i wonder what he was doing there daniella did not rise to that one instead she said the affairs of my department are my own he might have been waiting for her to say thateven perhaps baiting her he took an object from beneath the table and placed it squarely between them this too is the affair of your department i take it daniella willed herself not to stare holy mother of god she thought hes found the medea code book peter ng waited in the vast almost baronial foyer of andrew sawyers house in the mountains above sheko beach the place was done up in flamboyant american style furniture in old oak great knottypine sideboards paintings on two of the walls one depicted andrew sawyers grandfather daniel martin sawyer in hunting gear behind him were the verdant rolling hills of his beloved virginia across the twostory foyer hung a painting of andrew sawyers father barton he was also in hunting gear behind him were victoria harbor and the kowloon settlement of seventy years before ng knew well that hanging in the inner study was a painting of andrew though he was not in hunting gear he had chosen to have victoria peak in the background keeping at least onehalf of the tradition alive though ng had much to discuss with sawyer he was stuck here in the cool dimness of the anteroom waiting in time he heard the sound of a car pulling up the gravel drive he left his chair when he opened the door inward he was prepared already bowing excellent evening he said in his best obsequious tone an excellent evening to you younger nephew a tiny chinese in baggy pants and a suit jacket seemingly three sizes too big for him walked with him over the oriental runner with bright inquisitive eyes he squinted up at the stuffed bisons head on the wall above the doorway to andrew sawyers study is this another unfathomable gwai loh tradition you mean the bison elder uncle this was a term used outside the family as well as inside when an older and a younger man who knew each well spoke here however it was literal as well as figurative the two were nephew and uncle it is an animal native to the golden mountain the honorable sawyers father shot it when he was but a boy he brought this trophy here with him when he sailed here nearly one hundred years ago a trophy on venerable chens lips the word had an obscene tinge a rite of manhood it is said ng went on such rites are common to all peoples of the world heya venerable chen lowered his button eyes to peter ng foreign devils are foreign devils hey a younger nephew they still hoard their money in a bank they have minds like animals but we need them we need them again his gaze rose to the shaggy head on the wall but never forget that that is how they view us just like trophies to hang in their boardrooms tell me younger nephew if they exploit us should we merely bow our heads and murmur joss should we give up life with a callow sigh his eyes burned you are chinese never forget that i am shanghainese ng said just as you are but what about the cantonese the chiuchow the but there was no point in going on venerable chen had already delivered his answer by spitting into the corner that is why we have been exploited elder uncle because we are not united if chinese stood with chinese never and venerable chen thought this summit is a proposal that is doomed shanghainese chiuchow cantonese can never work together there is not a shred of trust between us now more quietly but no less forcefully he repeated never peter ng bowed his head honorable sawyer is waiting for you i will tell you this younger nephew if the gwai loh sawyer had not come to macao for our last meeting i would not be here now we work together the green pang and sawyer and sons to our mutual benefit it is important to show that mutuality in tangible fashion for a moment venerable chen stiffened he wondered whether peter ng was giving him a lecture in manners then he dismissed the thought the young man was simply devoted to andrew sawyer personally venerable chen did not understand it but he had been able to accept it besides ng was correct this alliance was benefiting both parties it might not pay to be so antagonistic long ago he had learned to smile with his mouth leaving his heart untouched by such false emotion that is why i have done as you suggested do not expect me however to relax my standards all dealings between my triad and sawyer and sons must continue to be effected through you andrew sawyer was waiting for them in his spacious study as the two chinese came in he bowed deeply and ushered venerable chen to the best seat in the room sawyers own spacious leather chair it was part of a grouping on the other side of the room from the office accoutrements and included a comfortable settee and a low cocktail table of green jade squares inlaid in a brass frame im so happy you could come honorable chen sawyer said deliberately using the shanghainese dialect he carefully watched venerable chens brittle smile and knew he was on thin ice with this man he poured them all johnnie walker scotch none of them used ice pleased with the choice of drinks venerable chen refused to be impressed by the others good manners it was a welldocumented fact that foreign devils possessed nothing but bad manners though it was certainly true that he had had little personal contact with andrew sawyer venerable chen could not think of any reason why this man tai pan though he might be should be any different he drank and tried to relax it wasnt easy foreign devils still made him nervous he had never met one he could trust not like younger nephew over there he thought he is shanghainese he is family there trust is implicit and absolute i have taken the liberty of having prepared a bite to eat sawyer said i dislike discussing business on an empty stomach i find that hunger impairs the reasoning process just so venerable chen said grudgingly how many times had he said the same thing to his sons educating the impatient young in the traditional ways of business he thought was an arduous and largely unrewarding task as he spoke sawyer was busy at the gleaming stainlesssteelandteak sideboard and service area that took up half of one of the rooms walls in a moment he returned to where the two chinese sat holding a tray filled with small bamboo steamers dim sum venerable chen said with no apparent emotion most unusual at this late hour just so sawyer said at restaurants i frequent which serve dim sum at this time it is invariably soggy however my chef is always on hand he was well tuned to the chinese way of acting he knew the others response was as positive as he could expect when he had proposed this meal to his comprador ng had indicated that he would be happy to heat and serve the plethora of small dumplings sawyer would not hear of it its important that i serve chen myself he had said face peter after all we have asked him to come here on our territory that could not have been easy for him now as the three of them ate sawyer knew that he had been right watching the tiny man in his oversized clothes he had had to suppress a smile of delight sitting in the huge chair gave him an even more diminutive quality it struck sawyer that venerable chen appeared to be a doll that by some alchemical process had been brought to life for a time sawyer was reminded of a story his father used to tell him at christmastime all year sawyer recalled he would wait to hear this story retold until it became more important even than the presents laid out for him beneath the brightly decorated tree venerable chen was a character out of that tale the nutcracker it was all too long since sawyer had last heard the story he could not remember any names beyond the sugar plum fairy the thought saddened him if his daughter had lived he would have had some reason to read the tale again so that each christmas he could relive the magic all over again through her when they had finished the dim sum with sticky rice wrapped in fragrant lotus leaves sawyer poured chrysanthemum tea venerable chen licked his lips and belched thereby showing his pleasure he looked at andrew sawyer and thought perhaps i have misjudged this one his manners are very good indeed he smiled and this time it was from the heart i dont like it sawyer said after venerable chen had left which part tai pan any of it ng had related the details of his meeting with three oaths tsun sawyer moved slowly around his library touching things the corner of a filigreed silver frame the gilt edge of a leatherbound volume of bruce cattons civil war history an agate paperweight so on he was a tactile man as many americans and few britons are he thought better when he could run his fingertips over a succession of surface textures peter ng stirred i thought you wanted into pak hanmin and kam sang perhaps sawyer said in an almost dreamy voice perhaps well here it is i gave you all the details that three oaths tsun outlined to me it seems a fair deal yes it does sawyers eyes caught a hint of the soft lamplight as he passed briefly through its pool of warm illumination beneath his feet the umbers and pale gold of an antique tabriz assuming one wishes to invest almost two billion dollars in the future of hong kong if that is not what we wish to do peter ng said matteroffactly we should join mattias king and company in moving out of here sawyer ceased his circling of the room long enough to say i take it then that you are for the deal he could almost feel the others shrug though he could not see it in the darkness of the room its what weve wanted seize opportunity by the throat thats a wellknown chinese saying i am familiar with it sawyer said commencing to circle again im also familiar with an old american saying give a man enough rope and hell hang himself what does that mean it means sawyer said seriously theres a fool born every minute you think tsuns hiding something about pak hanmin or kam sang either one it doesnt matter much what makes you say that if i could answer that one succinctly peter i could tell you how to go out and make your own fortune sawyer grunted maybe its only that tsuns so anxious to unload it his reasons make sound business sense absolutely otherwise the whole thing would blow up youve got to make it look legitimate as well as enticing but its all happening too fast theres no time to think rationally he wants us to jump to make an emotional decision based on i dont know whatgreed envy pick one something smells too bad we cant get a closer look at the both of them then ng said it would make life a lot simpler frankly sawyer said im not concerned with whats going on with pak hanmin and kam sang its after midnight call tsun tell him were passing if he starts in on you fend him off politely and hang up then what just forget about it not so fast sawyer sank down in his favorite wingback leather chair soft with age and groundin oils lets see if he calls us back by my reckoning hes only got until the hang seng opens in the morning if no ones picked up mattias kings share of kam sang by then hes going to be twisting in the wind pak hanmin stock will be out on the line that being the case we might be able to pick it up for a song and get in for far less money than this deal hes proposing would cost us would we want that if as you said something smells i meant the deal not the assets themselves after all were fairly familiar with pak hanmins dealings and administration ourselves and when it comes to kam sang we have the assurances of beijing the government of chinas not likely to screw up a project they need so desperately hes not going to give it away he cant afford that he cant afford what will happen to him on the stock exchange floor tomorrow morning either thats conjecture peter ng said better the devil youre not sure of eh i dont understand andrew sawyer laughed dont worry i doubt that three oaths tsun would either the sphere of influence of the kvr does not extend that far i want to know lantin said what you are doing with the chinese out of the corner of her eye daniella saw the code book swimming up through her vision what would have happened she asked herself if my father had ever found out about my mothers secret life how severe would have been her punishment lantin gathered up the book and rose he walked to the window leaned against the mullioned sash when my men discovered this the first thing i did was to take it to a psychiatrist of my acquaintance at the serbsky institute lantin was speaking of the psychological corrective arm of the sluzhba i told him of the circumstances under which this was discovered where it was discovered i filled him in on the overall picture then i asked him why lantins thumb was stroking the cover of the book he held it very close to him do you know what he replied he told me it seemed clear to him that in some unconscious fashion you wanted to be found out he turned from the blackness beyond the pane his light eyes catching her unawares i can take that further you knew that the only way you would be found out was if someone smarter than you entered the picture well you obviously had no fear of karpov which i suppose shows good judgment on your part he never would have found it why would he even look why did you because i thought i had caught a glimpse of you that day in your office some sliver that had evaded karpov all these months since the two of you have been bedding down no daniella said thats a strictly male fantasy you saw nothing at all except a new place to thrust yourself lantin grinned i learned a lot at your dacha that you and karpov were intimate for one he held up the code book this for another how did you find it she did not want to ask but could not help herself his smile broadened your mother daniella steeled herself what about my mother it would be where she would hide such an object dont you agree daniella an important secret an ikon you know about her oh yes its all in her dossier but she was left alone why because of you daniella you were always the one who was important to us actually we have karpov to thank for that he wanted you to remain happy he did not wish to disturb the relationship you had with her it was obvious that you would turn against us if we took her in as a subversive she was no subversive daniella said compulsively she loved russia she loved a russia lantin corrected her the smile now off his face not this russia why are you telling me this now you asked how i found the book but she suspected that was a lie rather he wanted her to know the extent of his power over her when one harbors secrets he was saying now one flirts with a kind of irrevocable danger secrets give their owner power only so long as they remain solely in his or her domain discovered their power often boomerangs she had been preparing herself to bring at least part of medea to lantin she wanted to be rid of karpov he had become a millstone around her neck she knew that he was impeding her career he wanted her just where she was where she could benefit him the most but she had outgrown her position she wanted more than karpov could provide now it saddened her to know that lantin had coerced her into giving him what she had been willing to offer up to him he had spoiled everything she tasted ashes in her mouth saw in a flash how she had been used by everyone around her even while she had gulled herself into believing she held the upper hand it was always the men who won out she was fighting a losing battle but even so she thought it was still important to end up on the winning side with nothing further to lose she set out to beat him at his own game she told him only as much as she felt she needed to regarding medeas information she spoke at length about the internecine warfare among the ministers in beijing because she intuited that this aspect of the intelligence would appeal most to his sensibilities she was rewarded with a positive response he wanted her to pursue that part and though they skirted the hong kong issue he did not ask her to amplify he was too busy figuring the angles in beijing does medea know which faction will win out he said after she was through he cannot say for certain yet this is important lantin said i would say crucial if we can get advance intelligence as to which faction will grasp controlling interest in beijing we could step up our robot war with china without fear if we know who they are we can control them by giving them just what they want theyll be like donkeys to whom we feed carrots daniella was watching the light coming on behind his eyes as much as she was listening to his words she needed to understand what made him tick or she would stand no chance against him he was more powerful than she and he was a man she needed to know what he wanted most and she knew words would not get the job done what she had to do was somehow alter the balance of their relationship she was aware that lantin thought of her now much as he did of karpov as part of his hip pocket that would have to change if she was to have any chance at all she got up and went into the living room it was done in dark masculine colors heavy leather furniture there was no relief no airiness at all when she had completed the inspection of the entire apartment daniella was certain that no feminine mind had been at work here that in itself was intriguing she wondered how lantin felt about sex she knew from her dealings with him just how he liked to manipulate people finding their weak spots and then treading on their faces while they were paralyzed he reminded her of a dentist her mother had taken her to see when she was a teenager he had pretended there was no novocaine left in his office and had then proceeded to drink in her cries of pain as he drilled out the cavity he had found in her lower molar she saw him get hard but it was not until years later that the haunting memory had made any sense to her now daniella had an intuition that yuri lantin was the same way as that dentist to prove it she decided to use the code book she told him she wanted it back when he refused as she knew he must she insisted again he refused it was not in her nature to beg and she did not want to arouse his suspicions so she slapped him lantin hit her with the book then as she reeled back against the bookcase he reached out with his free hand and gripped the bodice of her blouse he jerked her hard toward him and the cloth ripped in his fingers he twisted shredding it denuding her she wore no bra she never had now she watched through halfclosed eyes as lantin stared at her nakedness she had beautiful breasts and she knew it she was bent backward by his strength she whimpered softly he struck her across her breasts and she cried out he dropped the book and dug both his hands into her flesh kneading her he pulled heavily on her nipples so that she gasped and tried to twist away from him he liked that even more he insinuated one hand inside the waistband of her skirt felt the top of her panties he brought her to him and lowered his mouth to her breasts he was rough with that as well but daniella could not say she did not enjoy it she would not let him know that however since that would spoil his illusion he wanted to take her it was not rape precisely that was on his mind but close enough daniella allowed it it was easy to do and she thought somewhat enjoyable to playact the helpless female she could fit herself into the role without much trouble she was hot as well she wanted to be taken charged by the onset of emotions the excitement of deceit and the danger and when she saw his long lean body come undone from his tailored clothes when his rampant animal body was revealed to her she felt the wetness between her thighs so close to his power she wanted to become one with it each groan pulled from his throat each twitch and tremble of his body each inarticulate cry was a victory for her on this odd battlefield and when she felt his spasms begin the hot pumping of his seed deep inside her her inner muscles rippled of their own accord milking him and herself at once and half insensate she knew she had found what she had been searching for all her life power and the key with which to unlock it jake wanted to go alone to the usagigoya mikio found this a particularly foolhardy notion and made no bones about voicing his opinion at least wait for her on the street the oyabun said i will have one of my cars parked when she emerges we will pick her up cleanly without any fuss you can talk to her in complete privacy and safety jake shook his head thats not the way ill never get anything out of her if we kidnap her off the streets like a common criminal he could be waiting there for you mikio said i know i would if i were in his place theres risk in everything that pertains to nichiren jake said in this case i dont think i have a choice mikio was annoyed his anxiety for jakes safety made him so for a gaijin you certainly have an anachronistic sense of honor you should have been a samurai in the service of the tokugawa silently he held out a hand lying in his palm like a gleaming black blotch was a snubnosed automatic jake smiled and shook his head domo mikiosan he said it is not necessary dusk getting on toward dinnertime the streets of tokyo were choked with clouds of people rushing homeward jake stopped in a store and bought a fresh fish which he had the clerk wrap with a sheet of special rice paper he had bought moments before he handed the clerk seven paper cords in white and crimson with which the man tied the package he was an old man and understood the nature of what he had been asked to do a younger man might have had to be told in the upper right just above the cords jake affixed the noshi as in olden times he used a piece of awabiearshellstretching it tightly it was a symbol of long lifewhich was why it was stretchedand protection from harm awabi does not decompose nowadays one most often found the noshi printed on the wrapping paper as a design jake was taking great pains to wrap the traditional visitors gift in the traditional manner with the package under his arm he walked the rest of the way to the usagigoya there was no point in looking for a taxi at this time of the evening even if he found one hed be mired in the traffic for his efforts on the other hand he had no desire to be forcibly squeezed into a sardine box below tokyos streets in the subway rush hour was no time to ride the trains at the front steps he looked up he knew what apartment she was in he walked around to the side of the building mikio had shown him a layout of the complex before he had set off on this journey lights were burning inside perhaps he was expected joss shrugging jake went back to the front and entered the tiny elevator took him up he could hear his shoe soles echoing hollowly along the narrow hallway he stopped at her door from beyond the walls he could hear the rush of the traffic a barge hooted nearer at hand he heard the muffled chatter of familial conversation the last of the daylight was coming down soon the colored neon would take hold spangling the night banishing the darkness to the somnolent countryside he found that he was unaccountably hot above the muted sounds of the city he could hear the hard beating of his heart or was it just that he felt its throbbing in the center of his chest he took several deep breaths centering himself as he had been taught over and over he felt a peculiar itching just below his hairline and when he lifted a fingertip to investigate it came away with a warm bead of sweat he put it on the end of his tongue as if tasting its biting saltiness would prove to him its true nature he stared straight ahead at the blank door it was painted a shiny black and in its uneven surface he could just discern a ghost of a reflection with a start that sent a tiny shiver through him he realized that he was frightened he watched fascinated and detached as his right arm came up and seemingly of its own volition rang the bell for a moment he could hear nothing but the thunder of his heart gone was the soughing traffic the melancholy calling of the boats along the river the tiny homey sounds that wafted through the hall from behind closed apartment doors nothing existed now but himself and his coalblack reflection when that disappeared he would perhaps stand face to face with nichiren everything would change in the blink of an eye he would have his answer with a jerk the door opened inward yes his reflection was no more kamisaka tanaba hai he bowed showing her the top of his head i am jake maroc nichiren and i are acquainted with one another he could see the fear like a dark flame flickering in her eyes did that mean he was here with her who are you she wore a celadongreen silk kimono with a wave pattern woven through it at collar and sleeve cuffs he could see peeking through a tomatocolored underkimono on her feet she wore snowwhite tabi of lightweight organdy would she be so dressed he wondered if she was alone i have brought you a present he said extending the package toward her his awareness extended behind her into the usagigoya questing for any sign of nichirens presence only friends bring presents she watched his face as if she believed that at any moment it would explode he has no friends this man you speak of not now i have heard that i did not say i was his friend jake said smiling and then when she made no sound or move please it is vital that we talk she hesitated a moment more then bowed formally taking the present from him jake bent slipping off his shoes his muscles tense his mind alert he took the fighting position his knees slightly bent moving swiftly on the outsides of his feet body weight centered in his harahis lower belly where the wellspring of all physical strength dweltleading with the right side of his body the miniature kitchen the sleeping alcove with its cloudlike futon all taken in a flash then into the bathroom nothing there either he returned to where she stood watching him he bowed again i had to be certain sumimasen tanabasan kamisaka stared at him a moment as if dumbfounded in japan gaijin that is foreigners said thank you in only one way domo arigato on the other hand natives often used sumimasen a word almost impossible to translate accurately while it also meant thank you it held within it overtones of other feelings such as an apology for prevailing upon a stranger to do one a favor a sense of honoring ones obligations knowing that one could not as yet reciprocate the kindness extended you might have asked she said jake was intrigued kamisaka might be dressed as if she were a geisha from the celebrated days before the war but she spoke like any modernday japanese girl but for her words he would have believed her to be a samurais concubine from edoperiod japan she did not for instance open her gift in his presence that was the traditional way to forestall jealousy and to keep hidden the emotions that went into the choosing of the gift would you like tea she asked her eyes told him that she was still wary perfectly understandable thank you tea would be wonderful they sat on opposite sides of a low ebony table it was handcarved its elegance odd and overpowering in the tiny apartment kamisaka knew how to serve she set out rice cakes and sweet tofut confections with the tea you will forgive me if my questions are blunt whether or not you are forgiven marocsan will be totally up to you that gave him pause always fo saan had told him gauge your opponent well before you engage him remember that if you underestimate him once you will never be allowed the opportunity to do so again jake had no inclination to underestimate kamisaka a girl she might be but she had already demonstrated to him her keen mind he had a healthy respect for herand most reluctantly for nichiren this was after all his lady when was the last time you saw nichiren he asked her she smiled i think you must give me a reason for answering such a blunt question nichiren has something that belongs to me a piece of lavender jade carved in the shape of the hindquarters of a tiger he acquired it from my wife who is now dead oh im so sorry was it recent last week jake said thinking how many days ago how could i have lost track so quickly what is happening to me she was with nichiren he saw in her eyes that he had hurt her and realized that that had been his intent he was immediately ashamed why should this bright girl take the brunt of his rage and frustration he turned the anger in on himself i understand now why you look so exhausted she said surprising him your cheeks are so gaunt your eyes so darkly hooded when you first came to the door i mistook you for a marathon runner if it was not the truth then it was an artful lie made for his benefit he felt his cheeks burning with his shame i am tired he heard himself saying as if from the far side of a tunnel i happen to be in a business where that is an occupational hazard bad business she said refilling their tiny cups i had an uncle like that once i loved him so he used to buy me presents he could get me out of the bluest moods he died suddenly overwork my father said when i asked him why uncle teiso no longer visited us her eyes filled his vision i wouldnt want the same thing to happen to you why would you care he was inexplicably filled with selfpity kamisaka sat very still in that stillness jake observed the exactitude of her manners i think she said that your life has inured you to emotion it seems sad to me that this is so she looked at him do you have so little faith in humankind that you assume you are being lied to constantly she said this with no rancor or harshness rather her voice was soft and melodious gently questioning it caused jake to reflect on her words it was true he saw he lived his life within a web of lies and that life had hardened his heart he saw with a momentary shiver of terror that he could no longer differentiate truth from fiction saw too that his rage stemmed from the beauty and warmth of this woman nichirens woman mariana his woman was as cold as a winter frostlost to him forever i dont he paused not quite knowing how to put it youre not at all what i had expected did you expect me to come at you with a hidden knife he said nothing admitting to her the truth of what she said there is violence in your heart and in nichirens the bargaining had begun i do not pretend to understand him completely or to be perfectly content with our relationship but he is samurai an anachronism who would be more at home in another more ancient age i forgive him much because of that can you forgive his killing i am a buddhist i can tolerate no killing kamisaka said yet i am flexible enough to see an answer to it but you live with him now her calm rational almost meek manner disturbed him profoundly he found himself reacting to it with an irrational blind anger you sleep in the same bed you feed him for gods sake you have surrendered your heart to him how can you knowing what he does when he is not with you how can i continue to live in this imperfect world kamisaka said thats no answer like the man who demands perfection in his garden you ask the impossible from yourself therefore it is natural that you expect it in others and also natural that you find yourself disappointed when they fail to live up to your expectations you find yourself betrayed but not by those around you marocsan you have been betrayed by your own values you must learn to accept the world as it is not as you wish it could be there is so much anger in you as there is in him the same kind of deepseated anger from whence does it come that it is so difficult to exorcise how different the two of you would be without its terrible burden she smiled you see whether you choose to believe it or not i wish the same for both of you were cut from completely different cloth jake said hotly he is a killer she said and you are what i am not here to talk about myself of course how foolish of me was there something about her expression that was slightly mocking will you answer my question but i have already done so it is you who have not listened ive heard every word you said i am speaking now about your heart marocsan he snorted now youre giving me homilies as old as time awareness dawned across her face ah i understand she cried it is worthless without the struggle if nichiren were here and you fought a pitched battle with him killing him in the process then you would feel that the knowledge you gained in the process was worthwhile if i turned out to be a roughandtumble samurai lady with wakizashi in my hand beneath the table ready to puncture your heart you would know for certain the worth of what you had wrested from me jake saw the pity in her eyes and it rocked him to his very core she was right in everything she had said about him secretly he had yearned for a struggle in his world anything easily given up was next to worthless his world there it was again he saw now that he and kamisaka came from different worldsjust as he and mariana had been separated by the gulf of emotionlessness with which he had deliberately surrounded himself it was a condition brought about by the sumchun river it had destroyed much of his effectiveness as an operative it had made him into a nonentity as a human being he thought of that floating ghost the reflection of himself in the lacquer of kamisakas door that was all he was his sum and substance abruptly he was overwhelmed by sorrow his heart felt hollow and wooden as if though it would continue to beat it would never again even feel pain what good was this revelation now that mariana was dead with blurred vision he saw kamisaka reach into the wide sleeve of her kimono she put a tiny package on the table between the uneaten rice cakes and tofu i believe this is yours she said simply she had the priceless gift of never judging she always spoke her mind but that was all someone else might have added caustically you may not wish to open it even though i guarantee it will not explode in your face but she said nothing else instead she remained motionless her hands on the table jake saw the folds of her kimono sleeve its pattern green on green like a painting of the sea drawn from life taking that essence then like all true art adding another quality creating something new where before only the old and ordinary had existed he was acutely aware of her long fingers of the gentleness inherent in them they were like the kimono she wore possessing an inner structure at once surprising and moving for a long time jake sat as still as a statue he smelled her scent pine and musk commingled as fresh as a summers evening he stared at the tiny package at the cheery gift wrap he saw the glint of silver and gold in the rice paper it reminded him of the strings with which he had wrapped marianas wedding gift she had wanted them to exchange gifts then as if their giving of themselves was not enough jake thought he knew now why she had needed that tangible assurance from him he at last reached out and unwrapped the package at first he thought that nichiren had unaccountably given him back his piece of the fu it was a shard of lavender jade all right he recognized the style of carving by the same skilled hand then he turned it over and his hands began to tremble what he saw were the powerful head and shoulders of the beast it was unarguably part of the same tiger holding it up to the light jake could further discern from the depth of color and the degree of translucency that this piece was part of the same whole another part my god he thought what is happening jake suppressed a desire to scream at her but he could not keep the slight tremor out of his voice when he said kamisakasan have you seen this before he held the piece of the fu at the ends of his fingers she turned her head just enough she nodded she could be quite maddening whose is it her dark gleaming hair thick and blueblack in the lamplight framed her open intelligent face jake watched her eyes for any hint of guile but there was none nichirens she said he told me that it had been his mothers but jake had ceased to hear a word she said monday brought typhoon warnings to hong kong the shelters in causeway bay and aberdeen were teeming with preparations as were all the settlements on the periphery of the island but inland the hong kong businessmen were preparing themselves for a different kind of disaster as the bell for the opening of the hang seng sounded immediately there was a panic rush on the floor the official announcement of mattias king companys impending move out of the colony had been broadcast the ragged edge of terror was in the air and as the bidding reached a crescendo an hour after opening it was clear that everyones fears were being realized unless a reverse of the trends could be found more than a score of prominent businesses within the crown colony would be bankrupt or near bankruptcy by days end feverish eyes watched as stock prices of key issues began to drop and then to plummet one pair of eyes belonged to three oaths tsun because of the vulnerability of his position with the kam sang project now that sawyer had declined his offer his pak hanmin stock was declining at an appalling rate dizzy with anxiety three oaths tsun clung to the back of his chair overlooking the exchange and closed his eyes he swallowed hard cursing his joss he was under discipline his hands were tied he had been ordered not to call andrew sawyer back even though his instinct told him that if he did not sawyer would pass on the kam sang deal dawn had come and he had been proven correct now he knew that his meeting with peter ng had been business suicide deals such as the one he had offered andrew sawyer were almost impossible to keep secret for very long in a climate such as hong kongs the chinese loved only one thing more than gossiping and that was betting it was clear from how violently the pak hanmin stock was reacting that someone at sawyer sons had passed on the kam sang information to the other tai pan news other than mattias kings announcement was driving the stock down pak hanmin was falling down around his ears and he was certain it was because he had proposed that deal to sawyer he would never have done so on his own far better to keep a closed mouth the secret of his vulnerability deeply buried for those final hours before the hang seng opened those had not been his orders he insisted that the others inside the yuhnhyun have faith he could do no less especially considering the source yet he was here and the source was not he was privy to customs information the source was not oh a mi tuofo he sought to calm himself but when he glanced back at the board he blanched to see that his stock had fallen another two points it was impossible two points in ten minutes by the celestial blue dragon he thought if this keeps up pak hanmin will be finished faith or no faith his hands turned into fists he bent gave the order to buy up his own stock if he did not do that the decline would feed upon itself but he had only a finite amount of resources and as he glanced down at his notebook he saw with a fluttering in the pit of his stomach that he had just bought the last block of stock he could his eyes were drawn again to the hang seng board his stock was where it had been five minutes before it had lost seven and a half points since the opening since the news of mattias kings pullout had become official but it was holding now he was sweating certainly a bad sign but even so he refused to use the linen handkerchief clutched in his white fist by the eight drunken immortals three oaths tsun mouthed silently i will not show my enemies my fear pak hanmin was holding tight if this is all i lose today he thought i will be happy i will light joss sticks and pray to the memory of my ancestors still there was pandemonium on the floor of the exchange three oaths tsun stared down wideeyed as if he were witness to the caves of hell he remembered well the same kind of activity in and but then the hang seng was in the process of doubling each year now the reverse seemed to be happening there had been a minirun three years ago when britain had announced that there was no way they could retain control of the crown colony after but it was nothing compared to this three oaths tsuns uncomfortable gwai loh suit was sopping under the arms he detested being so enshrouded hated too that a rolling deck was not beneath his feet he looked at the board again had to squint pak hanmin was still steady well not so bad as it could have been he let out a long breath perhaps the worst was over now the time of waiting had begun because of its depressed price his stock was vulnerable to a takeover it was in just this fashion that he had acquired a controlling interest in the xiu hk ltd companies he had bought hugely while the stock was depressed becoming the majority stockholder because the xiu family lacked the ready capital to buy back the required shares at the inflated price that three oaths tsuns block purchases had raised the stock to now he was fully aware that the same thing could happen to him three years ago the xiu line of godowns seemed a good buy and indeed they had proved a moneymaker as part of pak hanmin then he had been ordered to turn them over in order to get pak hanmin into the utilities market in the new territories bad business decision he had thought at the time illogical because the godowns were extremely profitable and entering the already tightly contested utilities market with the threat of looming was risky by anyones standards faith and belief in the yuhnhyun one and the same really when you thought about it though he owned the largest individually owned commercial tanker fleet in the world t y chung was heavily into banking refinancing real estate and gold sawyer sons was now that mattias king was leaving the largest manufacturer in the colony five star pacific was the leader in utilities any one of these three would have reason to buy into pak hanmin it would be like them to run in on him scoop up the remaining shares at bargainbasement rates then turn around after they had driven the price skyhigh and offer to sell them back for three or four times their cost or stay in and force pak hanmin to pay its share of the kam sang project out of cash flow three oaths tsun gritted his teeth his eyes were blurry from staring down onto that pandemonium he blinked rapidly to clear his vision he did not know what he wished to see least now the price of the stock dropping or rising either way it would be bad news only a modest fluctuation would be good for him by noon the stock had made no serious move one way or another it had hit a support level and like a patient whose fever had run its course seemed to be recovering three oaths tsun took some time out to have tea and cold sesame noodles brought up to his seat he had been on the phone all morning with his office conducting business he would normally have directed from his shipboard stateroom at onefifteen the stock was up a halfpoint three oaths tsun mentally blessed his good joss his orders had been right after all his early heavy buying had scared everyone else off they were staying away now because they feared that if they started buying he would match them share for share if he possessed enough shares he would not need to buy theirs back and further they could not wind up with a majority position in the company they would be committing economic suicide that is if they believed his bluff he felt himself relaxing the worst was over he was convinced just past onethirty the phone connected to the floor of the exchange rang shrilly three oaths tsun snatched it up someones just bought fifty thousand shares of pak hanmin his broker said who three oaths tsun said he felt a warning quiver deep inside him i dont know im making inquiries now call me back when you have a name three oaths tsun said brusquely he slammed down the phone by the spirit of the white tiger he breathed silently let it be a onetime thing he watched the board like a hawk unable to sit anymore the quote had not changed he felt time break up into discrete fragments with each heavy pump of his heart the ring of the floor phone was like a noise in his brain he started lunged for the receiver the plastic slipped he was astounded to find his palm slippery with sweat yes another fifty thousand have been bought just this moment buddha same source yes oh gods we were wrong theyre coming after me the sharks smell blood i havent bought in hours now theyve made two smallish forays to see if they can bring me out do i have the capital to cover they wonder who his voice was a dry croak were still checking sir the broker said in his ear theyve been blind buys get me the name three oaths tsun said down the line on the hang seng board the quote was changing three oaths tsun felt his heart skip a beat and he put a clawed hand up to his chest to anyone watching it would seem as if he were smoothing his vest pak hanmin was up two full points its begun he thought dully someone wants in and i have not the power to stop them the telephone began to jangle david oh had secured himself in front of the glowing emerald computer terminal that linked him to the gpr mainframe monster deep within the bowels of the quarrys washington base this network included a secureline telephone modem that could handle all printed and graphic material with this setup he could tap into every nook and cranny of the quarrys vast files using his series of access codes which like a castles iron gates leading to the keep would pass him through to deeper and deeper levels of classified information no one was in the small stifling room with him the door was closed and locked and had been so since he had sat down at the terminal forty minutes ago to feed the two fingerprints he had lifted off the plates in jakes apartment into the graphic modem since then he had been passing through classified sections of the quarry files to get a fix on them almost immediately he had gotten a go forth response from the system which was an indication that somewhere within the mainframe half a world away the identities of the men infiltrating jakes apartment were known and had been stored away however a halfhour of reaching for files of known unfriendlies had proved fruitless as david oh eliminated possibilities the go forth response stayed maddeningly lit at the top of the screen he had gone through the most obvious kgb operatives all the organized terrorists that is members of the red brigade black september baadermeinhof the red star japanese extremists now he set to work on bringing the singletons the unaffiliated terroristsforhire to the fore file after file was reviewed and rejected nothing damn it he said aloud the terminals silent response was go forth what was left tried kgb operatives from left field nothing go forth tried retirees figuring an old grudge nothing go forth punched up the menu to review again his dwindling list of options there was only one he had not yet plumbed using yet another access code he extracted the dictionary of names certain that this could only be another dead end his mind was already devising computerlanguage methods of getting beyond the preset menu when the name list disappeared leaving two names pulsing on the screen found and matched read the terminals top line dew neh loh moh david oh said his hands automatically working the keyboard to doublecheck the findings within thirty seconds he knew there was no mistake he ran a hand through his hair he was dripping wet what the terminal showed was that the two men who had been in jakes apartment just after mariana left were a quarry extraction team these men were not sent to question or as messengers their particular skills made them far too valuable for that they were assassins that meant only one thing that the order to terminate mariana maroc had been given before the suspicion of her betrayal of jake and the quarry had arisen how could that be so david ohs head came up and even though he knew that he was alone in a locked room he could not help but look over his shoulder for the first time in his long career security had fled him within his own organization he felt totally naked a child again the typhoon warnings came down as the violent storm veered to the southeast whipping water into eighteenfoot waves gray and trembling beneath its fury to the northwest the outer wing of turbulence sent a summer squall racing through hong kong the light changed to sapphire then a kind of graygreen peculiar to the colony at this time of year the atmosphere already thick with humidity turned aqueous so that it seemed one moved underwater activity across the sluicing decks of three oaths tsuns high junk continued unabated despite the downpour that rattled windows and shuddered ratlines below decks in three oaths tsuns master stateroom there was activity as well but it was of a very different nature when neon chow was on board all movement was dictated by her she crouched now over her masters thighs her bare back glistened into the strange reflected light her black hair cascaded down her buttocks stray strands caressed three oaths tsuns knees as she worked over him sweat lay on him like sea water he seemed oiled with it it was always thus when neon chow gave her tender ministrations to his sacred member he groaned out loud feeling it swell beyond its natural girth how it loved her how it quivered for the release she would bring it slowly delicately even magically neon chow used nails fingertips lips tongue hot breath stiffened nipples the wet cleavage between her breasts to take him upward into the realm near the clouds and the rain he savored each moment feeling his heart pounding against his ribs his breath short and hot at the back of his throat barked out intermittently when neon chow added a delectable fillip here or there his eyes were closed he felt immersed in the heat of his own desire he sank in with a groan he felt the weight like gravity pooling in his thighs and lower belly he felt too heavy to move to think even to breathe he felt the clouds and the rain coming for him and he reached down and gently drew neon chow away from his engorged sacred member now he opened his eyes and drank her slick nakedness in as if he were seeing her thus for the first time her long legs her marvelously carved thighs so strong and soft at the same time her narrow waist the flare of her rib cage and those quivering upthrust breasts riding atop her long neck and welldefined jawline her eyes smoldered heavylidded with lust her eyes inflamed him and he brought her like a doll upward toward him until he could bury his mouth against her core she cried out at the contact her long fingers frantically entwining in his hair as she pressed her hips forward and back establishing a rhythm it was slow at first as she savored the hot lick of his tongue the nibbling of his lips she was dripping with need her upper body shaking in anticipation as he invaded her all the deeper he pulled the groans of ecstasy from her as he extracted her nectar now she held her pelvis immobile feeling the pleasure dancing through her rippling her musculature in uncontrollable waves she felt the tide pulling her onward and at last she gave herself over to it completely bucking her hips against him with frenzied need her hair flying out behind her as if she were in the midst of the storm raging above their heads the clouds and the rain touched her and she gasped heavily it was the signal for which three oaths tsun was waiting he pushed her away from his mouth down his torso and onto his sacred member neon chow gave a wail of delight as with one long ecstatic stroke he plumbed her to the depths the heated contact was all he needed in his aroused state to push him up the last several notches engulfed fully by her intimate flesh he felt the onset of the clouds and the rain convulsing inside her he drew her to him feeling the scrape of her nipples against his feeling it all the way down into the sac of his celestial jewels they never kissed before making love only after to three oaths tsun kissing was among the most intimate of gestures for lovers it heightened and prolonged his pleasure in the aftermath of the frenzy of the clouds and the rain neon chow sighed contentedly her fingers stroked his cheek while their tongues dueled wetly come here he said thickly he turned them on the bed we mustnt face west or else we will wake the earth dragon by lying on his head his anger will bring bad joss down on both of us at length they did nothing but listen to the rain drumming against the hull and cabin bulkheads it diminished with the same slowness their pulses took to return to normal she sat up before he did she plumped pillows set them at her back she lit a cigarette got it going and transferred it to his lips then she lit one for herself will you keep control of pak hanmin such directness would once have angered him no longer perhaps this was bliss doing like bliss neon chow was different she was part of the new breed of changing chinese on the one hand three oaths tsun did not know what to make of such boldness on the other it excited him he sighed inwardly one had to face facts it was a foolish man indeed who sought to stem the oceans tides perhaps his acceptance of the way women could relate to men stemmed from the fact that he himself had trained bliss to function as competently as any man in the modern world he had carried out his orders concerning her future in unthinking fashion but in doing so he had been exposed to the soul of a womans mind it had amazed him how much knowledge she could absorb how well she reasoned how in certain instances she outthought him he thought about the last phone call he had received before leaving the hang seng he had heard the voice in his ear identifying the dummy corporations that had scooped up the vulnerable pak hanmin stock powerful as i am he said to neon chow i do not have unlimited capital but then neither did five star pacific that had been the real surprise he had been certain that five star pacifics shortterm loan situation would preclude them from expending so much cash in buying the blocks of pak hanmin but there it was five star pacific owned all the dummy companies engaged in buying his stock today where had all the money come from what could the source have had in mind when he proposed this madness neon chow looked down at him her gaze traversing his body like a caress you must have some plan in mind she said you always do i want to keep pak hanmin very fornicating badly three oaths tsun did not bother to keep the concern out of his voice sun the monkey knows i could do wonders with that company but the gwai loh who run five star pacific have bought too much already dew neh loh moh on all gwai neon chow crushed out her cigarette she bent her head before his words and placed her palm against his heart then it is as you say rodger donovan called for a change in venue for the afternoon meeting it was just as well because a heat wave was blanketing the entire eastern seaboard of the united states washington was a steambath the streets choked with tourists were weeping moisture industrial fumes settled into the heat inversion sending ripples of sooty metallic particles through the atmosphere the entire city took on the appearance of a pointillist painting which was partially why donovan reconvened the meeting at greystoke the clean grounds the large cool house had never seemed so inviting it was also true that donovan loved the old house save for the time he was stationed in paris where he lived in the sixteenth arrondissement in an apartment in a turnofthecentury building he had been used to the space of los angeles living it was natural for him to prefer life at greystoke too there was a spot on the third floor where a seurat hung it was not the seurat the one in paris with which donovan had fallen in love but it was a seurat nonetheless and like all his paintings it fascinated donovan evoking in him a great longing along with the envy he loved the way the artist fooled you he placed two dots of different colors side by side and your eye saw a third it was there and not there at the same time to donovans way of thinking seurat was a prestidigitator of the highest order henry wundermans surprise when he drove up the crushed blue gravel drive was that he saw only one other car in evidence donovans pride and joy his corvette with the original design body which he had had shipped east from california when the quarry took him on he was constantly working on it either cleaning its outside or tuning its inside as wunderman parked his battered cougar donovan came down the wide wooden steps of the old house the younger man had an attitude that wunderman secretly envied wherever he was he appeared as if he belonged he was like a chameleon in that respect well what do you expect wunderman thought as he climbed out wealthy family good breeding the finest schools christ you should at least come out with something from that background wunderman had never fit in anywhere but the quarry he had been a fat kid always teased at home and at school now he was an overweight adult he owned one good suit which he used for all formal occasions with crass indiscrimination but then wundermans idea of formal was going to any governmental function that began after the hour of five in the afternoon he wore a pair of mudbrown polyester trousers picked up at sears and despite the heat a longsleeved dress shirt he detested short sleeves a prejudice hed picked up in his unhappy teenage years when his heavy unmuscular upper arms were a source of unbearable embarrassment to him donovan dressed in grayedout white ducks a forestgreen ralph lauren polo shirt and scuffed topsiders appeared slim tan and fit all that good life in la wunderman thought well he couldnt very well blame donovan for that the man had tried his best to get him interested in tennis offering to teach him from the fundamentals on up that was another thing wunderman detested tennis wheres the rest of the crew wunderman asked donovan indicated the rose garden lets take a walk they strolled in silence down the narrow aisles of beaten earth between flowering bushes and fat furry bumblebees the scent was so strong it tickled the back of wundermans nose the colors were exquisite on the far side of the regimented garden was the topiary donovan took them into the deep green hedgerows that climbed to a height often feet and in some places quite a bit more antonys over at state lunch with the secretary at lion dor wunderman made a sound in this weather donovan smiled nodding yes its a bit heavy for my taste as well the french foods not great for antonys cholesterol level either but im afraid he had no choice its the secretarys favorite restaurant he likes to be seen i imagine since state is still touchy over jake marocs unsanctioned raid antony wisely opted to concede the point they came up on a hedge carved in the shape of an animal wunderman had been through here before he could never tell which animal was which there was a stone bench between two hedges he sat wiping his face with a handkerchief whew im glad were out of the city it was my idea this meeting wunderman picked up on the others tone you mean just the two of us donovan sat nodded i spoke to antony about it just before he went off to his luncheon meeting he approved of the idea the iceberg the iceberg donovan ran his fingers through his thick blond hair making wunderman think of the models on old cigarette ads on television donovan could be making a mint inveigling the american public into buying diet soda through his wide smile and wider shoulders advertising executives could always use the allamerican boy on tv we all have our separate reasons for joining the service wunderman thought he wondered what donovans was with stallings death the icebergs breached to the quarrys core i am concerned properly so so is antony but you know how he is his regard for his personal safety is overshadowed by his concern for the quarry itself what are you saying that the object of this iceberg is to terminate antony beridien donovans eyes were iceblue can you think of a more effective way to cripple the service wunderman was already shaking his head no its impossible the risks just too high for an objective that would have at best shortrange effect donovan rose can we continue our stroll henry lately staying in one place too long makes me nervous wunderman watched him carefully as they went on through the odd sculptures the heats got nothing to do with why you moved this meetings venue has it not enough im afraid they made a turn to the left came out on the rolling virginia hills horse country the thought made wunderman sad stallings had finally gotten him to agree to his reciprocation of wundermans teaching him how to use the quarrys computer next week stallings was to have given him his first lesson how to mount without terror filling his heart now stallings stallion would never again be ridden in that hard aggressive manner he had become used to the computer has provided some suspicion that security has been breached by whom we dont know as yet but its certain that several programs have been activated and infiltrated how deeply has it gone thats another thing were working on wunderman took a long look at the grassy knolls that used to fill stallings with such a sense of joy and freedom he wondered what it would be like to feel that kind of ecstasy he resolved to visit the movie house this week and have one of the grooms teach him how to mount a horse what you said before about security he said now wed better get on it right away get the engineers in the first thing in the morning good donovan nodded ive made certain that antony wont return to the office again today i think wed better have him stay here until the changes are complete all right i was nervous about him being in washington anyway what about out of the office oh thats covered all right he glanced around i think another dozen men here will do the trick wunderman began to turn back toward the topiary donovans voice halted him theres one other thing that antony asked me to take care of with you whats that the westering sun was in wundermans eyes obliging him to shield his face with his hand jake maroc donovan seeing the others discomfort moved to block the sunlight wunderman dropped his hand the sound of the cicadas was very strong he slips off to japan an entire kvr extermination team winds up dead antony has no idea what hes up to neither does david oh what about you i havent heard from him either antony thinks wed better reclassify him wundermans stomach turned over to what henry antony and i spoke of this at length i wasnt sure but the old man was adamant its possible that maroc has invaded the computers memory frankly antony believes that to be the case he thinks maroc has been on the edge since the sumchun river incident his wifes death he reasons has pushed him over the edge to tell you the truth im in no position to argue otherwise you know jake maroc better than either of us what do you think wunderman wished that he could refute everything donovan and beridien had come up with the fact was he could not it was useless to deny to himself or to anyone else for that matter that jake had not changed after he had returned from the sumchun river wunderman could recall reading the intelligence flimsy recording mariana marocs death he should have felt something but the sad fact was that his first thought had been jake will go nuts now the memory bank invasion he said softly what programs were touched kvr priority nichiren restricted lists of quarrys former agents kvr priority wunderman said it with a sinking feeling jake had taken out that kvr team all right with help from the computer jake terminated the entire kvr team himself thats the kind of reckless abandon thats dangerous furthermore its obvious to ail of us that he mustve seen stallings kill his wife stallings is dead but we at the quarrys inner core we who made the decision we who sent stallings into japan are not were still alive the old man thinks that marocs intention is to terminate us first him then us wunderman was rolling something over in his mind if it was jake he said at last how did he access the information isnt that a good question donovan said you and i know the closest terminal access thats open to him hong kong station donovan nodded that means david oh the old man brought his name up maroc and oh are very close isnt that right david oh would put his arm in the fire for jake maroc oh christ wunderman thought its all falling apart first jake and now his whole network is following him down how could this happen he wondered out loud our architect is general daniella vorkuta as antony suspected shes been using nichiren it seems to get at maroc now we know shes succeeded nichiren working for the kgb the confirmation came in today donovan said the sun was orange its thick rays seemed to drip onto the surrounding countryside destroying the purity of the afternoons colors wunderman let out a long breath jakes new status the old man wont do it without your approval i must say i feel the same way how will you classify him now wunderman demanded knowing what the answer must be rogue still he was obliged to close his eyes rogue meant jake was now an outcast from the quarry further he was judged dangerous to security the orders to quarry personnel would be to bring him in for interrogation at the movie house if he resisted or there was any indication that he might lose them they were to shoot to kill wunderman turned his head away from donovan that was all the indication he would make donovan nodded henry for what its worth im sorry daniella at work the model soviet bureaucrat in and out of meetings concerning budgets departmental responsibilities appropriations finishing her weekly paperwork on manpower reassignments debriefing updates mission progress expense reports assets human and otherwise lost in the field pulling computer hard copies of field data success rate probabilities status evaluations three six and twelvemonth projections based on specific departmental goals making five copies now instead of four two for her files two delivered to karpov as usual one smuggled to lantin daniella her cornflower hair shining with extra strokes from the british brush that lantin had bought her wearing satin tap pants lacy garter belt stockings of real sheer silk beneath her stern sluzhba uniform of stiff skirt and highnecked cotton blouse daniella feeling wicked almost wanton in those dreary smokefilled meetings bending over the printer terminal to pull her hard copies imagining yuris palms on her buttocks fingers spreading slowly into the crack between he had promised her a pair of frenchmade midnightblue pumps with fourinch heels and during the appropriations debate she found herself wondering what those extra four inches would do for her figurethe arch of her rib cage and abdomen the thrust of her breasts startled she felt a warmth between her thighs and shifted in her uncomfortable chair recrossing her legs while the interminable meeting wore on at lunch with three other female sluzhba officers she found herself wondering what yuri was doing with the reports besides reading them was he passing them on to someone else in the politburo had he been doing someone elses bidding or had he asked for them on his own why was it to keep an eye on her or on karpov the success of the intermediary phase of moonstone had set karpov off in the office today it was all he spoke of the girls said he never mentioned lantin or the support he got from above it was only karpov this and karpov that i was right and now they know it was becoming a familiar refrain lantin had said the idea of the puppet war with china using vietnam had been his contribution to moonstone he told daniella that he had seen just this potential in karpovs plan and had decided to seize the initiative karpov on the other hand claimed the glory was all his he was becoming something of a bore what did lantin have in mind if she had heard of karpovs boasting it was logical to think that yuri knew too he had not brought it up with her but she would have been surprised if he had yuri she had discovered was composed of a series of faзades when one harbors secrets he had said one flirts with a kind of irrevocable danger that had been meant to tell her two things first that ferreting out other peoples secrets was his stock in trade second that he had none himself daniella however knew that to be a lie yuri lantins secret lay in his faзades she was beginning to suspect that there were many lantins she was certain for instance that the one she knew was definitely not the one karpov was familiar with also the yuri she knew now was far different from the yuri she had been introduced to in her office because she was unnaturally quiet at lunch the officers began to tease her about her rather startling new habits she had begun to smoke egyptian cigarettes and wear her hair down rather than tied tight at the back of her head both were done at yuris suggestion somewhere along the line daniella caught on and listening to their gibes smiled goodnaturedly secretly she felt only disdain for these creatures that also was new for her formerly these womenhad she once really considered them comradesinarmshad been her friends as much as anyone could be a friend inside the sluzhba daniella took a hard look at them they might as well have been three jabbering monkeys for all the sense they made their minds were filled with useless effluvia they seemed as contented as cows grazing along a hillside happy and satisfied with their own productivity they made her want to be sick this too seemed a product of lantin but she could not quite grasp how it had come about it was as if her affair with him had elevated her to a point where she felt estranged from the people habits haunts she had known and felt comfortable with for the past three or four years she excused herself and went to the ladies room at the cold porcelain sink chipped and smelling strongly of disinfectant she bent throwing cold water on her face she heard the door opening closing again went on with her washing she stood up taking paper off a shallow shelf wiping her dripping face and the back of her neck the others couldnt understand why you werent yourself out there tanya nazimova said she was a squat plainlooking colonel whom daniella had pegged as a lesbian she had her head cocked at an angle its because of the vigil isnt it daniella her pulse rate up had the presence of mind not to stare or blurt out what vigil as calmly as she was able she threw the matted paper away she turned to the mirror and under the guise of fixing her hair watched tanya nazimova she had green eyes as bright as a birds and a mole at the corner of her mouth like zsa zsa gabor they used to tease her why should the vigil worry me vigils were conducted by select surveillance teams to build up a record of habits of a suspected person daniella had no idea why a vigil should be ordered on her but she was going to let tanya nazimova tell her the other woman shrugged well no i just thought that since this one originated outside the sluzhba you might be nervous she smiled a colonel in department p handling liaison between the kgb and the rest of the kremlin bureaucracies tanya nazimova was always on the alert for situations that could curry favor with her superiors and thus get her promoted out of what she termed the armpit of the sluzhba but considering its source i dont think theres anything to be concerned over yuri lantin and general karpov are as tight as this she held up two crossed fingers since its lantins vigil you can assume karpov knows all about it its just routine daniella thats all no you idiot daniella wanted to scream at her its not routine at all why has lantin ordered a vigil on me and more important why hasnt karpov warned me she was still wondering the same thing late in the day in between calls to two of her field directors who were experiencing problems it took her mind off concern over the arrival of the next bit of intelligence from medea which she was expecting at any moment near quitting time karpov appeared in her office and before he left she had her answer it was not the one she had been expecting he slid into her office as silently as he often did he did not startle her though she was on the ciphered eavesdropproof overseas line she often used she continued to speak in a normal tone of voice while her eyes tracked his progress he sat out of the light but still his dyed hair gleamed with pomade one that contained a thickener he preferred his cheeks were red and shiny his skin glowing indicating that he had just come from his daily facial daniella could not see how it was possible but until this moment she had not realized what a vain man he was she continued to watch him as she would any outsider in her office while she finished her conversation well comrade general he said in his rumbling basso youve had a busy day i imagine this is my third trip down to your floor she smiled indicated the phone you could have tried a call comrade he hiccupped or laughed she could not tell which he took out a cigar visits i think have a certain piquancy that is lacking in phone conversations he spent some time examining his gold lighter he turned it around and around in his palm an archaeologist with his find she thought then that he would tell her about lantins vigil he had not come here to smoke a cigar he could do that anywhere comrade general he said in a tone of voice he used in situations where there were observers from outside the sluzhba present your name came up today during a department s executive meeting he continued to stare at the lighter and now daniella knew that he had come to deliver bad news there had been some thought of elevating you into department twelve department was directly responsible for infiltration of britain and associated territories quite a large step up from her current position im afraid that was vetoed today and you were delegated to tell me he looked up better from me than to hear it thirdhand comrade general which was bullshit daniella knew he had been ordered to do it may i ask the general why she was peculiarly calm karpov rose he did not want to get too deeply into this he shrugged he had not bothered to light his cigar he had pocketed the lighter that japanese disaster might have played a role in the matter five men murdered in the field four a simple operation botched karpovs eyes glittered daniella was familiar with that look he was enjoying this was it lack of preparation or a failure to command she opened her mouth to say that it was yuri lantin who had superseded her orders turning what was basically a surveillance team into a termination squad but closed it immediately she saw that even if karpov believed her which was doubtful because he had already cut his deal with lantinhe would inevitably ask her for the source of her information what was she to say to that oh it came up while yuri lantin and i were fucking in any case she had missed her opportunity to defend herself karpov was already out the door this is the last straw daniella thought ive had my fill of him her contempt for him exceeded her anger which was fortunate anger never did anyone any good but contempt she had found was at least in her case an excellent spur to serious thinking what an idiot karpov was she saw he was head of the first chief directorate the largest and most powerful single entity within the sluzhba if she had been in his shoes she would already be making a run on the politburo but karpov was either too thick to see his job as a springboard or he was clumsy enough to have run into a roadblock like yuri lantin either way daniella decided she had no more use for him for a time she sat quite still contemplating the darkening streets of the city through the tiny panes of her window she hated these oldfashioned panes they were like prison bars she decided that she hated this entire office it was altogether too small she would have to get out perhaps she thought now it was time to use chimera to activate valhalla chimera was a secret she had recruited overseas strictly on her own sluzhba policy had dictated that she report this asset to her superior within twentyfour hours either in person or via an eyesonly broadcast cipher this daniella had not done from her mother she had learned that one must have an escape valve one last card to play chimera was hers the valhalla plan her ultimate weapon in the game she had been trained for by the state once activated she knew there was no turning back she would have made her choice but what glory its success would provide her she felt her heart fluttering she wiped a thin line of sweat off her upper lip she was suddenly so hot that she was obliged to get out of there in dzerzhinsky square she walked on stiff legs between the children running after pigeons their faces were so innocent filled still with the afternoons light their cheeks as round as apples their lips red and sticky with sweets unconsciously daniella touched her fingertips to her belly she wondered whether she would ever know what it felt like to have a child growing inside her somehow the thought of carrying a tiny life of feeling its every move from the inside out frightened her it meant thinking more about someone else than she did about herself she did not think she was capable of that she knew she was a selfish person she just did not understand the depths of that selfishness the children decided her she saw in their faces the passing of time saw too the crack in a door she had believed would always be closed to her the politburo yuri lantin had inadvertently provided that crack now she would use chimera to force it all the way open with a small nod she strode across the square a rubber ball painted red and white bounced her way she caught it while it was in the air threw it back to the waiting child who had missed the catch she caught the toss and laughed in delight it was infectious and daniella laughed with her four blocks distant she found a shop that would give her sufficient change then she found a public phone she would not dare make this call anywhere else even over the cipher line in her office too many eyes too many ears though the soviet telephone service was abominable she did not want to entrust this to any other means of communication in a kind of euphoric daze she made the call plugging into the sluzhba circuits that would automatically reroute her overseas it took fourteen minutes to make the connection in the meantime she calculated the time in washington dc the ring of the telephone at the other end of the line startled her america the ringing stopped and a voice answered hello chimera she said speaking up as if talking to someone hard of hearing this is your greataunt martha she often wished that her conversations with chimera could last more than ninety seconds at a time she enjoyed speaking english with an american but the ninetysecond deadline was absolute in order to maintain onehundredpercent security beyond that any electronic scanner buzzing along the lines as they often did throughout moscow could record and store the call martha washington i remember this is the wakeup call for valhalla would you repeat that please auntie valhalla i see yes she said into the receiver i know you do shi zilin was tired when he was young he could have fought the celestial dragon across the clouds of heaven now he felt the weight of the world on him with each breath he took he lay naked and sweating in beijings summer heat in the center of a small room in his villa waiting for the acupuncturist not so long ago he remembered this had been a weekly occurrence now it was daily the pain the pain lying on his stomach his loins draped modestly with a square of white cotton his head cradled in his bent arms zilin thought of the long war he had waged on chinas behalf a celestial guardian should not feel this age or this pain a real celestial guardian was immortal he would still be able to chase the great goldscaled dragon across the skies this he did not quite grasp age was never a concern to him his ren only his harvest the ren crowded his mind like a flock of plovers wheeling in flight so many personalities with which to contend so many changing situations to which he must adapt so many destinies in the palm of his hand late yesterday he had heard of the appointment of deng zhaoguo one of his enemies from the qun being led by wu aiping deng would be the new head of the communist partys propaganda wing immediately he had announced a farreaching campaign against spiritual pollution among chinas youth as zilin had known he would zilin had petitioned the premier to him this potentially dangerous course harked back to the dark days of the cultural revolution that had crippled china from to he had argued that dengs reactionary policies would be derided abroad by the very nations whom china sought as modernday allies to no avail no matter what i might feel personally the premier had said there is far too much power behind deng zhaoguo for me to consider blocking the appointment zilin wondered anew at china was this the country he had spent fifty years trying to direct for what purpose so that dangerous fools like deng zhaoguo could gain power perhaps he thought now it is i who am the fool zilin stirred as he heard a soft rustling in the room in his position with his head away from the door he could not see who it was doctor he said he was abruptly afraid it is i comrade minister zilin relaxed recognizing zhang huas voice what news my friend five star pacific is making its run at pak hanmin it has already bought up close to one hundred thousand shares ah zilin said and this is only day one it seems our ploy worked someone leaked the news of three oaths tsuns meeting with peter ng undoubtedly is five star pacific the only one it appears not sawyer and sons is in for thirty thousand t y chung for fifty lots of pressure zhang hua nodded it will get worse so it must zilin stirred on the table as a jolt of pain went through him the pressure must get to strangulation level otherwise there will be more than one route to pursue that we cannot allow i understand comrade minister perhaps then you should begin now yes comrade minister he turned to go zhang hua yes comrade minister any news of jake maroc he is at this moment en route to hong kong bliss will meet him in kai tak she has been alerted comrade minister good he allowed himself along sigh sir zhang hua took a step toward him are you all right mariana zilin said that was tragic joss comrade minister joss yes zilin turned his head with some difficulty her death serves to remind us zhang hua that nothing ever goes precisely as planned the discovery of the fu by the mysterious chimera was the start of it then came jake marocs raid on ohenro house marianas death and wu aipings elevation to the leader of the qun he sighed again i am afraid my friend that i am beginning to lose touch with the mutability of the world when i was younger i could juggle all these permutations and still have room in my mind for more should they arise lately i find myself preoccupied with matters of the family under the circumstances comrade minister that is perfectly understandable but not excusable im afraid if i make one slip now so close to the edge we will all go down you me china the ussr america it will be a chain reaction that is quite unstoppable the soviets have pushed us too far we have allowed them to reach a level of readiness that is frightfully dangerous there is always kam sang yes there will always be a kam sang zhang hua it seems that the human race needs such terrible spectres glaring over its shoulder in order to keep its finger off the trigger to annihilation the soviets will not see it that way the soviets will have no choice in the matter zhang hua that i can guarantee you wu aiping it was a whisper yes first we must defeat our enemies at home zilin closed his eyes take care of that matter for me zhang hua yes comrade minister zhang hua at the doorway he paused his hand on the knob sir you understand the critical importance of every message at this stage yes sir i do there can be no mistakes zhang hua went out of the room when he was alone zilin said i feel wu aipings evil presence everywhere he is close very close he was filled with anxiety not for himself he had no fear of death but he knew that his work had not yet been completed fifty years was a long time to toil tirelessly in the service of ones country a long time in the context of a mortals life a blink of an eye in terms of the history of china he stirred on the table impatient for his treatment to start pain laced him he was used to that by now but still one could yearn for surcease at length zilin heard the soft padding of the acupuncturists bare soles on the carpet he felt the strong capable hands on his back searching for the meridians where does it pain you most today minister here the hands moved in concert here and again here zilin gave a little cry ah the voice said ah yes in a moment zilin felt the cold brush of the alcohol across three separate spots on his body the small of his back over his left hipbone behind his left knee now expertly the long gleaming needles pierced his flesh in a moment the pain subsided to a throbbing ache then it was gone altogether zilin slept jake flew into hong kongs kai tak airport just after pm he would have been in hours sooner but for the squall to his surprise bliss was waiting for him at the airport he saw her standing there slim and beautiful just after he and his bags cleared customs she came across the crowded floor toward him and he found himself watching the liquid sway of her hips in the movement he saw a motion that was both innocent and sensual she might have been a college student welcoming her older brother home they stopped a foot from one another she was silent he saw the look on her face and recalled kamisakas words to him i mistook you for a marathon runner do i really look that bad he wondered he had slept fitfully on the planea shallow unrestful slumber in which the image of nichiren dressed and made up like kamisaka beckoned him onward to hong kong for what reason he is in hong kong kamisaka had said to him that is all i can tell you why he had persisted why has he gone there he goes often three or four times already this year i dont know why despite everything she had said everything he felt from her he was still suspicious of her answers he told her so her eyes seemed to drink in his soul they were standing very close at the door his shoes just across the lintel in the hall the last moment before he would depart there was nothing sexual between them yet he felt a connection it disturbed him as much as it confounded him you have a piece of the fu she said simply nichiren also has one ive seen them both they comprise onehalf of the whole so the two of you are linked you cannot be enemies which just went to show how wrong a person could be a name jake said you may not know why he travels to hong kong but you may have heard a name he never speaks to me of his business an inadvertent reference pillow talk there is none of that not at least of the sort you mean actually i was thinking of something you might have overheard a telephone conversation for instance has he ever called hong kong from here kamisakas brow wrinkled in thought then she nodded yes i think so remember anything a name a place anything at all well it wasnt too long ago let me see her eyes lost in thought were luminescent in the dim light of the usagigoya when she refocused jake felt that odd connection like a heat in his chest does the name formidable sung mean anything to you kamisaka said was your trip profitable bliss asked him now the babble of kai tak was all around them a very chinese question jake thought he replied in kind yes and no i made a friend who is powerful that is always profitable on the other hand i watched my wife die oh how terrible she came a step closer i am so sorry she kissed him on the cheek pressed him to her as if he were in need of solace now it was his turn to be silent let me take your bag its all right he said quickly defensive im not a cripple i didnt she tossed her head angry with herself her nightblack hair swung in a heavy arc away from her cheek im sorry we seem to have gotten off to a bad start she smiled as if nothing had happened my cars outside she took him to her apartment jake was too tired to utter a word of protest it was near the top of victoria peak on the island below one could see the midlevel towers the mostly dark skyscrapers of central the harbor was beyond always filled with ships of every description both the living room and the bedroom overlooked this spectacular view from the bedroom one could see a bit of wanchai lit up like the inside of a circus tent she fixed him dinnerflashfried saltandpepper prawns chicken and mango chao fan fried riceand he ate silently with short rapid movements of his chopsticks you eat like a chinese she said watching him gorge himself afterward they went into the living room jake collapsed onto the sofa it was a soft jungle print peaceful calming he put his head back and bliss brought them brandy jake did not drink he stared out the window at the glitter of nighttime hong kong the squall had washed the air clean so that all the lights sparkled like gemstones rubies emeralds sapphires diamonds back in hong kong yet japan clung to him like a foul mist memories would not let him go he was engulfed by grayness he felt something saw bliss palm over his heart hai ma hai nisiu dong a she said is this where it hurts he could do nothing but look at her excuse me she said in a moment she had returned she knelt down beside him and he heard the striking of a match a moment later the plangent spice of a joss stick wafted his way please forgive my forwardness bliss said but i thought out of respect i would say a prayer for the spirit of your wife she was gwai loh he said defensive again i cannot see how that would matter she set the glowing joss sticks between them a spirit is a spirit is that not so with that she began to pray using a buddhist sutra of ancient heritage jake put his head back against the sofa listening to the words slowly they penetrated until he began to feel caught up in them at length he opened his mouth found himself speaking the prayers with her eventually he felt the wetness on his cheeks he thought they were silent tears until he heard himself sob then he felt soft arms enfolding him a gentle perfume surrounding him he felt her warmth pressing against him and the comfort it transmitted was at that instant ineffable still sobbing he put his arms around her pressed close to her golden skin the exxon terminal screen of the gpr mainframe was gravid with information none of it was good command access code gargantua unit access code blind boy response go forth goddammit chimera said as his fingers paused over the keypad gargantua was the current quarry access code for all known kgb operatives in the massive mother file blind boy was this fortnights code for the operative requesting access to the files there were nine letters and spaces in the code name indicating that the quarry operative was part of the hong kong station personnel but it was worse still chimera thought as he hit the return key command access code watersnake unit access code blind boy response go forth tuesday level he thought organized terrorists known to the quarry the second letter of the hong kong alphabet belonged to david oh hit the return key command access code hermes unit access code blind boy response go forth wednesday level unaffiliated terrorists for hire shit chimera said to himself what the hell is that bastard up to what worried him most were the last three letters of the nine there were innumerable suffix ciphers within the quarry computer language the confluence of boy was the ultimate access code into the bowels of the data banks places where there was more shadow than light in fact it was the generation of the boy suffix code that had brought chimeras terminal to life he had spent many hours outside the office perfecting this relatively simple override to the ironclad directive for total autonomous secrecy within the organization stabbed at the return key command access code furies unit access code blind boy response go forth next he saw david oh had begun viewing the list of lonewolf kgb operatives where was this all leading he wondered there had been no terrorist activity in the immediate vicinity of hong kong and no kgb activity that daniella had not already apprised him of then what he began to sweat had she become impatient had she put some of her chimera network people into the field had david oh picked up their scent punched the button saw the access code for quarry retirees emblazoned across the screen now what he wondered what could david oh possibly want with a list of the quarrys recently retired operatives hit return and his mouth dropped open command access code sphere unit access code blind boy response found and matched jesus christ he was staring at the names of the two operatives he had assigned to mariana maroc in the first place the ones who had somehow botched the job found and matched his fingers flew over the keyboard until the computer provided him with what david oh had been searching for all along fingerprints he murmured they left their fingerprints all over marocs apartment damn david oh he swiveled in his chair snatching up the phone he dialed the regular quarryinstalled scrambled outside line then jabbed at the phone again switching to one of his own lines which were fully secured against any kind of infiltration once assured of that he dialed the overseas number yes the taiwanese said he had snatched up the phone after the first ring your services are required for a specific purpose chimera said i know the purpose the taiwanese said to whom shall i bring the deliveries david oh half a world away the phone was set quietly down that was all the answer chimera required bliss was breathless with longing for him she heard the sound of the shower in her mind the image of the needle spray cascading over his naked body she desperately wanted to be that needle spray watching the twinkling lights climbing up to the peak she played a game with herself trying to imagine his body the contours of his flesh ridged muscle and the shadowed places between she had seen dozens of photographs of him after they had lost touch she still remembered his childs body close to hers his warmth that night in cheung chau how she had missed it when he was gone but even then so young she had had a job to do the yuhnhyun had dictated that she ensure that jake got to the fishing island for the ta chiu festival shed had no idea why at the time but as she grew up three oaths tsun had explained it in two words fo saan he had been another part of the seemingly endless yuhnhyun perhaps she had thought that was how it had derived its name the ring fo saan had trained her as well out of sight of jake not in the same ways she had her own skills to perfect bliss had been in love with jake from that night they had spent together on cheung chau as she grew older she put it down to a childhood infatuation perhaps that was because it was not part of the yuhnhyun contact with jake at that point was forbidden he had never been out of her mind or her heart and later when three oaths tsun had shown her the first photo of him she melted inside she was lost to him utterly and irrevocably but by then jake was already married now as she sat on the edge of the jungleprint couch she shook with longing for him stuck in the corner of her vision the guttering joss sticks even in death mariana stood between them she wanted him so badly desire was a taste in her mouth life was but a dream without him but there was mariana to think of at least his memories of her bliss prayers to the dead had not been a mere gesture mariana was a part of jake that meant she was important to bliss her body might be buried somewhere in japan but her spirit lived forever that was something bliss would not forget water like rain in her apartment jake in the shower his long muscles flexing his coppery skin gleaming halfhidden in the steam the lights of the harbor were smeary in front of her eyes bliss wept openly wept as she had not in years she experienced her desire now as a tightness in her chest she fought to breathe but her weeping made that difficult she fought for control and could not find it her conscious mind closed down frightened she sought out jake ran to the rushing water just the beat of a heart away through the translucence of the pebbled glass door jake saw the shadow of rapid movement his first thought was for the fu shard still soapy he pushed open the door stood on the slick tiles dripping steaming water he had had the hot water on as high as he could stand it and the small bathroom was alive with tendrils of mist the doorway was filled backlight turned the figure to silhouette made the outline as fuzzy and glamorous as a photograph in a slick fashion magazine by shoulders and hips he knew that it was bliss jake was conscious of his nakedness but to make a move to cover himself would have made him feel even more foolish he was aware of blood suffusing his face he was certain it wasnt from the hot water do you have a reason for skulking around like a spook but i am a spook she said skulking is one of the things i do best her first sight of him coming out of the shower had taken her breath away smoke curled from him as if he were some mythical creature rare as a dragon he seemed full of power she moved into the bathroom light and he saw that her lips partly open were tremoring slightly he came all the way out of the shower she wore what she had had on when she picked him up at kai tak a blackandwhite silk dress with a crisscross bodice and no back to speak of she was barefoot you didnt answer my question i thought i had it was so hard for her to speak raw emotion was a fist in her throat what are you doing here i wanted to see what you looked like and you came in just like that his voice was getting tighter and tighter yes goddammit i am naked he exploded its not it just isnt dont she said her eyes were full and glittery please dont yell at me her voice was thick bliss really he was at a total loss for words this isnt fair she took a halting step toward him she was so close now he could see the faint tracks her tears had made down her cheeks bliss jake her voice was a reedy whisper dont take my heart away jake no one had ever spoken to him in this way no one had ever spoken his name the way she did a caress forgive me mariana he heard her faint words and the rustle of fine silk against flesh in the same suspended moment one sound blended with the other so that later he was unsure if he had actually heard either in an instant bliss dress was a soft halo around her ankles jake had the good sense to stare he could hardly have done otherwise the sight of her robbed him of all volition she was as tawny as a great cat her skin lustrous and firm gently muscled so well formed that it was as if the years had barely touched her she was lush and small at the same time her waist and ankles were slender she had the shoulders of an athlete but the hips of a woman flaring and sensual he saw the muscle rippling along her thigh he could see its power she put her extended arms over her head drawing up her breasts even higher they were full and firm her large nipples were already hard she put her hands underneath them do you like me that reedy whisper again this time he shivered in anxious response bliss he breathed even if its just a little bit tell me yes you have no right to do this my love gives me the right ive dreamed of this moment for so long there was a wild spark in her eyes a heavy orange flickering of the sort one sees in animals through dense jungle foliage her voice was thick with emotion ive loved you from the moment we climbed side by side at the ta chiu i have slept with no man without dreaming of you their arms around me became your arms and when they penetrated me it was you i felt bliss as he whispered her name again jake was aware that he had been wrong about her in the airport she was not the sister coming to meet her older brother but a woman hesitantly about to open her heart to her future lover she came toward him seeming to float across the tile floor he was fascinated watching the play of her long muscles beneath that lustrous smooth skin he saw that she had the stride of a panther a sinuous grace that was as powerful as it was erotic she led with her thighs she moved from the hips down with a low center of gravity with each step she took it was obvious that she drew strength upward from the ground upon which she walked it was this elementalism that gave her innocence an erotic resonance at the moment their bodies touched jake gasped out loud it was as if he had been brushed by an electric current he felt the nerves beneath his skin bristle as if they had been lying dormant for years something inside himself had been brought alive by her he felt her arms come around him her face tilt upward on its long neck he was aware of her whole body lifting up propelled by the arching of her feet and because of this her flesh slid against his at the instant his mouth came down over hers he felt the heat of her groin pressing inward felt with a kind of lunatic tingling the brush of her pubic hair against his lower belly he groaned into her open mouth as he tasted her she was like a sweet liquor of which he could not get enough his head swam and he felt the tension in his legs burst into muscle spasm with this he recognized that he had been thinking of her since the night of that first dream in the hospital he had wanted her then and ever since but his guilt and then his mourning for mariana had not let him feel it fully he clasped her to him feeling her warmth stealing through him thawing his icy insides at that moment he thought he felt his heart cry out and he slipped down to his knees his palms caressed her muscular flanks his face was very close to her essence her innocence stirred him profoundly as he too thought of that childrens night in cheung chau he could feel her heat on his cheek his nostrils flared with the scent of her arousal he opened his mouth and felt his tongue being drawn into the core of her he licked softly and gently in long loving swipes and was amazed to find how quickly she opened to him layer upon delicate layer above him bliss thrust her fingers in his thick hair holding on as she rocked her pelvis in toward him her heart beat like a triphammer as she felt her own secret flesh flowering open her insides had turned to water and she felt a fine filament of sensation arcing downward from her navel to the spot where jake was making love to her as his tongue moved so too did the filament filling out and intensifying into a ribbon of pleasure beyond anything she had ever felt her lower belly fluttered with its movement out of her conscious control without quite knowing what she was doing bliss reached down and took jakes hands drawing them upward until she could press his palms against her breasts she moaned when she felt him grasping her there the feel of his callused flesh brushing back and forth over her distended nipples was almost more than she could bear now the ribbon extended itself upward fluttering through her breasts now she felt connected to him in all ways as if truly he had entered her bliss felt an energy building within her her intensive lifelong training with intrinsic energy caused her to be open to it to embrace it rather than fear it for she was immediately aware of its power ahhh she cried panting ahhh bliss was crouching down spreading her thighs as much as she was able in this position her openness increased her pleasure her neck arched and she threw her head back she stared sightlessly at the ceiling lost in the web of ecstasy jake was weaving within her her eyes fluttered closed her breasts heaved within the confinement of his palms she could not stop her hips from flipping forward against him she wanted him inside her but even more she wanted this ecstasy to continue she cried out sharply as she felt her engorged flesh being drawn into a liquid place heat suffused her and then the licking commenced again but this time with the added sensation she looked downward saw that he had taken part of her into his mouth ohhh she gasped i cant stand it i cant oh the heat struck her across her chest suffusing her shoulders rib cage and heart in a bath of liquid fire it rushed up her neck and into her face her breath shuddered through halfopen lips her nostrils flared the tension in her muscles reached epic proportions then it all gave a final outward thrust as her orgasm overwhelmed her she shuddered and shook within his embrace crying out in burmese in her release she collapsed into jakes waiting arms her head bowed her eyelids flickering jake lowered her slowly onto himself he drew on what control he had left he was mad to soak himself inside her he was so hard he hurt quivering with the burning images of her in the throes of her intense climax all the breath went out of him as he felt her streaming wetness engulf the tip of him oh god the words were expelled from him like steam from an engine bliss hands were on his shoulders and he felt them grip him as she came down on him her head bent forward into the crook of his shoulder her open lips bit into his flesh take me her voice was a ragged whisper take me oh please tentatively he pushed himself upward felt himself sink another halfinch inside her her warmth was almost too much for him to bear his lungs were working like a bellows sweat streaked him it pearled her long nightblack hair strands of which clung to him like tiny arms oh jake it seemed that she had no breath left he felt her hand moving downward beneath their connection her strong fingers cupped him gently squeezing rhythmically it was too much for him with a deep moan he slid all the way into her hilling himself then he felt her lifting herself away from him he slid all the way out and she hovered brushing against his tip for as long as they could bear it he hilted himself again jake grabbed her certain he could not hold out for much longer he did not want this feeling to end yet the ecstatic friction was ascending to such a height within him that he knew it could not be long sustained with every stroke he felt the core of her fluttering nakedly around him felt her high mount pressed against his belly her fingers squeezing gently but urgently at him he felt the weight growing inside him the gentle pulling at his loins becoming ever more urgent with a lurch his anal sphincter tightened he grew inside her trembling bliss sensed his ending and she rode him more rapidly now pressing the top of herself against him as he pistoned in and out their flesh slapped together faster and faster and as that happened jake felt a kind of ecstatic merging he felt floodgates opening inside him felt his vulnerability to bliss and did not shy away from it he embraced it and with great force and heady emotion he jetted into her with an abandon he thought beyond him merged with him bliss felt the building of her own forces his trembling ardor fueled her own so that she was on the brink when he came the force of his explosion transferred itself to her and she exploded again a quick sharp burst quite different from before but no less pleasurable perhaps it was not only the hot water still running in the shower that steamed the room but the force of their mingled emotions outside the moon had risen huge and oblate dimming the gemstone lights from the peak all the way down to the harbor the water glittered like a pathway to the stars in the new light david oh was on the run night in his city he would be all right he kept telling himself he knew he had to get to jake tell him what he now knew no place inside the quarry was safe at his shoulder the singapore hotel rose up like a glass beehive its room lights bright and inviting not for him he hurried on down lockhart road in brightlight wanchai full of latenight bars dance halls and cinemas he felt safe then why was he shivering remembering himself hunched over the gpr computer terminal in the process of finding out that stallings missions somehow coincided with kvr missions of unknown objective that shortly after his aborted missions opposition leaders had been terminated not killed as published reports indicated except for mahmed alqassar a secret cia double whom the kvr had cheerfully allowed stallings to mistakenly terminate perhaps all of this had made no sense to stallings perhaps if he had lived a bit longer he would have reasoned it out david oh had a leg up on that the knowledge that someone inside the quarry had ordered mariana marocs termination before the official seek and terminate directive had been given more time at the computer and a greater knowledge of the software programming allowed him to extract another vital piece of the puzzle all the opposition terminations had been traced back to one source nichiren nichiren was being run by the kvr that meant general daniella vorkuta the contrary directives from inside the quarry all benefited the soviets vorkuta again that was enough for david oh as soon as he had come up against the stone wall of the eyes only quarry director graphic he had made a hard copy of all the intelligence he had unearthed including that vorkuta had penetrated to the very core of the quarry she was attacking from inside and out david oh had no idea how far she had already gotten but one thing was certain he could trust no one no one but jake he slipped into the gray shark a sleazy dive where the lights were low the drinks two parts water and the girls totally without a memory the place was filled with noise and smoke the noise was coming from sixteen loudspeakers girdling the enormous room billy idol was spitting out the words to white wedding red green and gold spots roved the rafters swinging down every so often to brush the swaying dancers shoulders sailors david oh saw lots of sailors an american aircraft carrier was in piles of money would be made in wanchai tonight threequarters of it illicitly he went to the neontrimmed bar and ordered a whiskey and soda it tasted like water which was okay with him now was not the time to get a buzz on except for the raised octagonal dance floor the place was filled with tiny tables to one side near the bathrooms a steep flight of metal gridwork stairs led up to a second story david ohs eyes scanned the room but he saw no one he knew out of the corner of his eye he watched the door outs he ignored it was the ins he was concerned with within six minutes of his arrival he saw three possibles all men they caught his eye because of their faces they had been trained by a large disciplined organization their eyes swept the room piercing to a different quadrant every eight seconds there was no deviation in a moment they were gravitating toward him david oh grabbed a girl and pulling her close against him moved away from the bright aurora of the bar it had been a risk using the computer in the manner he had over the past several days because of the peculiar nature of the software he had picked up stallings trail he suspected that general vorkutas contact inside the quarry hierarchy had done so as well that was why he had been sent back into japan not to terminate nichiren but to be terminated himself david oh knew in the back of his mind that the same fate could very well be in store for him still he had continued with his unearthing once begun he could hardly back off hed never be able to live with himself now he knew that he had been discovered he took the girl up the stairs with him in his ear he heard her breathing the grocery list of prices did he want it straight or would he like to make it a threesome did he want oral or anal sex did he want to spend a halfhour an hour longer very romantic he didnt even bother to tell her to shut up they went into one of the two dozen or so rooms upstairs above the disco floor inside he threw her from him ignoring her hey s and m will cost you plenty more and jerked the small window up music permeated the floorboards the heavy thumpthumpthump of the bass setting his teeth rattling he peered out drainpipes galore there was no time to think about how long they had been there or how sturdy they were he wriggled like a cat through the aperture grasped the pipes filthy with encrusted dirt and rust shinnied down into the gloom of the back alleyway he took off into the night thinking my only chance now is to find jake three blocks later filling his lungs with muchneeded oxygen he remembered bliss he had suspected from the first that jake had slipped out of hong kong with her connivance now she might be the only link he had he dug in his pocket for a coin and began to run again looking for a phone sir john bluestone knew that he had his edge over his competitors as soon as the other man came into the room and began to report it was interesting bluestone thought now stretched out on his leather sofa like a prince a prince of commerce that was how he thought of himself partially he had his secret life as well which warmed him every hour of the day and night working for a cause that connected with him he had been born in englands upper class in india then in the smaller countries of southeast asia he had seen how the arrogance of the white man had turned a series of exquisite paradises into the dust of destruction the wanton disregard for life that his people exhibited had filled him with disgust and more importantly disquiet he had begun to make his feelings known and had been contacted vetted recruited then he had been sent to hong kong and eventually had risen to his current level as one of the five tai pan of five star pacific it was interesting bluestone thought again watching the chinese give his report his study in which he now reclined was a reflection of himself it was composed of a series of patternsall variations on the theme of black and chinese red the ceiling was black lacquer the walls papered in a blackonblack glossandmatte pattern with a scattering of tiny chrysanthemums in red the leather couch on which he reclined was red the chairs black the floor was covered with plush walltowall carpeting in black with red pindots ebony bookshelves climbed the wall behind the ebony desk and the black lacquer and red metal chair there was a chinese altartop sideboard in red on which stood the only splash of another color a priceless qing vase that was so translucent it could be said to contain either no color or all colors at once in all it was an overpowering place which was precisely bluestones intention no one who crossed this threshold had ever failed to be intimidated by the place this included the governor as well as a handful of lordly ministers from the english parliament peter ng was almost finished with his report it was interesting bluestone thought how all the birds eventually came home to roost here was a man who had been part of bluestones network for five years or more ever since bluestone had discovered through his agents that ng had been clandestinely keeping a separate set of sawyer sons books which showed that over shares of the companys stock had somehow come into his possession over the years he had never been of much use to bluestone just a tidbit here and there until now the bottom line ng was saying is that andrew sawyers into pak hanmin to the tune of thirty thousand shares tomorrow he plans to go for another hundred he thinks the issues tremendously undervalued now i have something bluestone thought though i have t y chung buying for me i need that last bloc of a hundred thousand shares to ensure my control over the company i havent enough money to cover that though and that hundred thousand might come very dear if sawyer and i fight over it which seems likely its the last major bloc up for sale now is the time he thought to contact my new partners the local banks with which he did business had kept him abreast of the buyup of his shortterm debt over the past several days through any one of them he knew he could get a message to his benefactors if they had money for that surely theyd have more to ensure five star pacifics control over pak hanmin and the fruits of the nearly complete kam sang project he dismissed ng then picked up the phone he opened his address book quickly looked up the number of the president of the hongkong and asia bancorp never mind the late hour he needed to get a message off in order to fight off sawyer sons he needed promise of capital before the hang seng opened in the morning bluestone listened to the quiet burr of the phone line and when the male voice he recognized answered he began to speak all the way from wanchai on foot using plateglass windows as mirrors to check his flanks and behind him whenever possible david oh watched for brackets box tags all the subtle variations that ticks take he doubled back switched sides of the street against the light shied away from the wide avenues then he hopped a bus it was going in the opposite direction from his final destination that was all right with him he was determined to give this run plenty of time if ticks were going to show themselves he wanted to allow them the opportunity he also wanted to know how the three of them were being employed that would give him a clue as to their overall expertise he was clean when he made the call his heart had leapt when bliss put jake on the phone so much to say so little time in which to say it it was the wrong place for sentiment and he had kept himself in check hed set up the rdv at the top of victoria peak near enough to jake but away from bliss safe house out in the openknown territory itd be okay he got off the bus at the third stop waiting until the doors were about to close no one came after him swung aboard a bus heading the other way thirteen stops an inauspicious number but it was time to get off he walked two blocks west to queensway it was after dinner and the colonys main arteries were crammed with people the neon nightlife beckoned just a ferry ride away in the throbbing heart of tsim sha tsui david oh waited patiently for the bus that would turn up cotton tree drive it was becoming more and more difficult to tell whether he was clean so many people packed into so small a space but at least he had made visual contact with his ticks hed have no trouble spotting them again a bus came but it was so overladen with passengers that he decided to wait it gave him a chance to get an indepth feeling about his immediate environment directly behind him was a shop emblazoned with the threedimensional logos of four or five top swiss watch manufacturers as was usual this kind of establishment drew a multitude of tourists both those with enough wealth to buy the solidgoldanddiamondencrusted timepieces and those content merely to gawp down the street a band of young chinese strode purposely away from him mingling in the crowd he turned away across the busy thoroughfare a brace of sailors grabbed a taxi heading down toward the pier and the star ferry the happy raucous babble of dialects only served to make him feel apart from the hurrying crowds his situation had made him disassociated enough as it was the red doubledecker swung into view on its side was a tigerstriped poster for a new film a woman reclined with her head upturned the torso of a man loomed over her halfshadowed in bloodred script the ninjathe movie the crowd that had formed for the bus began to surge forward even before it came to a full stop david oh felt himself borne along on a tide of rushing human flesh chinese screamed in his ear cursing an australian for his slowfootedness the dark funnel of the bus door seemed to suck the crowd up into its depths david oh followed along he was acutely aware that he had had no chance to inspect everyone who crushed in behind him he slipped off the bus at the stop where cotton tree drive and garden road came together he waited for the light then crossed to the peak tram kiosk he bought a ticket for hk and slid into the shadows just beyond the cones of light surrounding the small structure mist was building already it was difficult to see farther than halfway up the peak road he glanced at his watch it was very near midnight the time when the tram stopped running no one else was about it was not the most popular time to take the steep journey up the mountain he put his head back against the damp wall he wondered what he would say to jake when he saw him he knew over and above the information he now possessed that it was important to right things between them he realized with a plangent pang of sadness that neither he nor jake had been much of a friend to the other during the past months even at this moment his anger at jake was a palpable presence something had happened to him at the sumchun river it was natural perhaps for jake to clam up about it during debriefing maybe it was none of the quarrys business that part of it but david oh had to admit that he had been disappointed then hurt that jake had not confided in him did their friendship mean so little didnt jake trust him resentment had smoldered within him like a lit fuse it did not change what he would do for jakejust his perception of jake he had thought friendship was more important to jake as important as it was to him sacrosanct there was much to be accomplished this night and the peak was perhaps symbolic of that the highest point in the colony up above the clouds the rails began to sing the tram was coming wires were vibrating david oh felt the movement as he swung aboard the dimly lit car he felt his longing to return to friendship as a physical sensation startled he realized just how much he had missed jake he sat near the front of the car far off he heard the muffled hooting of a barge and closer to hand the soft hiss of traffic passing across wet tarmac the doors began to close david oh looked around a young chinese in a black lightweight raincoat and hat sat at the opposite end of the car he carried a tightly rolled umbrella perhaps unconsciously imitating a british gentleman he did not look at david oh david ohs gaze swung away the doors sighed shut and with a soft lurch the tram began its tedious trek up the side of victoria peak six stops no one got on or off they were halfway up now completely enclosed in cloud the night took on a softly luminescent glow it was neither dark nor light and it seemed now as if they traveled through an unchanging clime suspended partway between heaven and earth david oh shifted to get his sticky shirt away from his back he was thinking about jake at the seventh stop the tram ground to a halt a chinese stepped into the car and the doors slid shut they were on their way again the man looked around he glanced at the chinese with the umbrella then toward the front of the car then they both came after david oh outside the moon had been obscured by the mist after the call had come in bliss asked no questions as a westerner surely would have nevertheless she seemed to have picked up jakes melancholy mood her hands were dug deep into her coat pockets it might be best to walk to the peak tram station she said starting down the sidewalk jake nodded try to cover every possibility trouble is one rarely does it had begun to drizzle the perfectly clear night had disappeared as if it had never existed jake held them back in the shadows of the dripping wisteria just in front of them the sidewalk stretched away i want to listen he said and look the night was doleful the misty cloud cover held the street and apartment lights turning shadows gray every hiding place glowed with accumulated luminescence jake heard nothing and saw no one crickets beat a hidden racket the sound caught between the highrises lower down on the slopes reverberated setting the night shimmering jake was absolutely certain of his tradecraft he had been trained by the best henry wunderman it was wunderman who had approached jake in hong kong more than twenty years ago they had met for lunch at the peninsula hotels grandly curving dining room wunderman his face shiny with sweat had scraped his chair legs against the carpet in getting his bulk to the table he had ordered bourbon and had made a face on taking the first sip i understand youre out of work thats right wunderman made a great show of studying the menu but had ended up ordering the blandest items im not used to this part of the world he said he waited for jake to order then put his elbows on the table what are your interests jake wondered who this large american was it would not have been good manners to ask martial arts chinese wei qi wei qi whats that its a game ill teach you how to play sometime thatll take seven minutes i can also teach you how to win thatll take seven years wunderman had laughed at that youre perfectly right he said some skills take a long time to develop they had liked each other immediately wunderman found jake smart enough so that he felt certain he could learn from him for his part jake was intrigued by wundermans mystery it was his opinion that this man represented a kind of sub rosa world apart from hong kong or any one city on the globe jake feeling apart from the world felt an immediate attraction to this as yet unnamed society it did not appear to be against the law as the triad society was but rather beyond the law as if reading his thoughts wunderman said i understand you have triad connections jake nodded why arent you working for them the food came and they both waited until the whitejacketed waiter was gone i am gwai loh jake said a foreign devil only half wundermans soft brown eyes looked into jakes sure i know youre half chinese kid he looked away for a moment stirring his drink with his forefinger tell me why are you still on this rock its my home think theres something for you here then jakes eyes held his what dyou suppose that something is i dont know it wouldnt have anything to do with some crazy notion you might have about trying to find out what happened to your father would it jake knew then that this man was someone special tell me henry wunderman said after a pause if you were not a foreign devil but were fully chinese would you work for them then no jake said id find away to make them work for me wunderman went back to his eating he seemed wholly concentrated on that after a time he said suppose i can show you a way to do that would you be interested jake looked at him it was easy enough to give an answer but he understood the gravity of the moment a question such as this should not be answered in an instant how long do you plan to stay in hong kong wunderman shrugged how long will it take you to say yes it had taken three days what had happened to them both since that time all right jake said now leading the way down the path and out onto the street without the insects clatter the world would have been utterly silent around them even the airport across the bay was beginning its nightly shutdown procedures his mind was alight with david ohs words the quarrys been penetrated so many questions no time for even one as he should have david had set up the rdv and then rung off theres a possibility jake had said as he began to get dressed that david will have visitors with him so she was drawing on her dress what is this monkey see monkey do if theres going to be trouble im going with you youre staying here jake theres no time to argue right he buttoned his shirt youre staying you cant stop me from following you she zipped up searched for her shoes do you think you can run in high heels i was looking for these she held up a pair of dancers thinsoled shoes they make no noise he looked at her then turned and went into the living room what is it she asked coming after him do you think i cant take care of myself maybe he slipped into his loafers i studied with fo saan he looked up fo saan she nodded he came over to her so close he could feel her heat he stared into her eyes ill make a deal with you what kind of deal you can come with me hear whatever david oh has to tell me get your head bashed in too if it comes to that but afterward you tell me everything there is to know about you she hesitated and he said its the only way bliss that i promise you she scooped her thick hair out of her eyes i want you to trust me i wouldnt have suggested this if i didnt then why do you he put his hand on the door take it or leave it ive let you keep your secrets too long as it is i cant he opened the door if you follow me ill know and ill lose you you know i can she was unsure enough about that to acquiesce all right its a deal everything a mi tuo fo yes everything almost there bliss said now up ahead they could see the lights glowing in the mist of the peak tram station it looks deserted she said lets make sure within seven minutes they met at the station after having circumnavigated the perimeter they could see the result in one anothers eyes nothing together they stood in the close night waiting it was impossible to believe that an hour earlier the moon had shone clear and stark the drizzle pattered all around them the leaves on the trees at their shoulders bowed beneath the weight now he would never see rain without thinking of mariana jake it was a breath beside him he stirred what we did earlier we did out of love bliss please i must say this her fingertips touched his no matter what i felt inside i never would have approached you that way had it not been she paused momentarily flustered took a deep breath as if she were about to plunge off a cliff if mariana and ting had not been dead his head jerked away from his vigil down the steep incline of the tram tracks you know about my first wife bliss nodded her eyes were filled with sadnesshis sadness i know that she took her own life jake said nothing bliss thought his face was hard enough to have been chiseled from stone she forced herself to go on i didnt bring this up to hurt you it was to reassure you i love you too much ever to upset your life he looked down at her then he could feel the familiar film growing over his heart protecting his core she had pierced him back at her apartment he had been open and vulnerable for the first time in three years that was something at least he knew that she was making an attempt to make permanent what was now only temporary he wanted to respond in kind he knew that in the most absolute sense but it was too soon or he was no longer capable he did not know which and that knowledge was like a crippling blow to his heart he wondered now just how deeply the sumchun river had damaged him wondered too if he would ever recover he was about to say something when he heard the tension coming into the rails overhead the tram wire began to sing he glanced at his watch time he said lets get going david oh was slowed by his disbelief he knew the three taiwanese these two were shanghainese by all the gods great and small he thought how many have they sent after me reflexively he managed to kick a heavily muscled leg outward connecting with one of the chinese he felt the impact as the toe of his shoe caught the man on the inside of his thighbone along the line of the nerve meridian the leg collapsed underneath the man and he grabbed it his sunglassed face grimacing in pain the second chinese held the tightly rolled umbrella before him like a lance david oh heard a sharp click through the heavy rumbling of the moving tram car it drew his eyes to the eightinch steel blade protruding from the end of the umbrella he twisted his upper torso at the last possible instant feeling the hot wind of the miniswordblade as it shot past his left ear he struck immediately upward with the edge of his hand in an attempt to crack the weapon he felt it bend not break then the chinese was yanking it backward for another stab david oh heaved himself off the seat sitting he had been at a serious disadvantage as the chinese rushed at him he slammed his foot down on the mans tensed instep using all his weight centering his body over that one spot he ground the steeltipped heel of his shoe in a tight arc until he heard the crack of the metatarsal splintering under the pressure at once he clasped his hands together swung them upward from his right hip they slammed into the chinese just below his armpit it was a little high to break a rib but it got him off balance david oh followed him down keeping his foot on the others foot until he heard the snap of the ankle used his elbows just under the chineses chin digging for the windpipe and the cricoid cartilage the chinese twisted desperately aware that should his opponent find his mark he would be dead within seconds his fingers abandoned the now useless umbrellasword scrabbling between the rolling bodies to find a neural plexus david oh felt the telltale burning and he knew the chinese had hold of a major nerve center but now he had forced his elbow beneath the mans jaw in a moment he would crush the cricoid artery it was dangerous to ignore the others attack but david oh made the decision instantly there was simply no question of his giving up his advantage he doubted that the chinese would allow him back within his guard there was a buzzing filling up his head bees like lead weights swam through his brain his coordination was slowing he knew what he had to do but getting the commands down the line to his extremities seemed more and more of a herculean task spots danced before his eyes as the chinese knowing the end was nearing exerted all his strength in this one desperate bid for life a viscous blackness hovered at the edges of david ohs vision he could no longer feel his legs and he knew the creeping paralysis would soon rise into his arms when they were too heavy to support his elbow would come away david oh felt close to collapse his sense of dissociation was now so acute that he seemed able to differentiate his inner self from the husk of his body he no longer knew what he was doing sweat stung his eyes bringing him back to a semblance of reality he felt his heart struggling to maintain his adrenaline level he felt the hot breath sawing in and out of his painfully heaving lungs he knew then that he was in trouble concentrate he ordered himself saw the sharp point of his elbow jammed into the interstice between the chineses chest and chin and with an awesome rush it all flooded back at him leaned the full weight of his upper body in behind the elbow attack felt it plunge downward suddenly into soft flesh and cartilage he felt the easing of his nerve center at once but he lacked the perspective to understand what it was he was panting in the heavy air still filled with fear and excess adrenaline there was a trembling inside him at the knowledge that he had almost died and that he had killed a man buddha he moaned beginning to massage the burning welts around his solar plexus with a great animal grunt david ohs head jerked backward as the steel wire whipped around his neck he had forgotten about the other chinese he began to cough as the oxygen flow was severely restricted the panic that tore through him caused him to bring both hands up to try to pull the wire away from the soft flesh of his throat he was doing just what he had been trained not to do in this kind of situation it was a waste of time to try to pull the garotte away he had been trained to forget the garotte entirely and concentrate on the assailant disable him and the garotte would come away the panicked animal knew only that something was choking it and that it must pull it away at all costs perhaps it was the muted laughter in his ear that snapped david oh back into the mindset of a veteran intelligence officer he smelled the garlic and licorice breath in great foul pants and it made his stomach heave the real problem was that the nerve damage he had suffered had not yet fully dissipated he could barely drag his legs along they felt like dead weights with a grunt he tore his hands from their useless task at his burning throat he willed himself to ignore the fact that there was now no oxygen at all coming in his windpipe was on fire his lungs strained for a new breath he was strangling on his own carbon dioxide he heard a singing in his ears the siren song of his own desperately pumping blood sound became distorted his eyes began to bulge the only thing that saved him was the braking of the tram it came unexpectedly and his assailant loosened his hold for an instant half of that time was past before david oh recovered enough to take advantage he reached painfully behind him grabbing the tail of the others jacket with all his remaining strength he jerked downward as a result the garotte tightened against him so hard that he gurgled in agony but then the chinese lost his balance completely dimly david oh heard the thump he had to remind himself twice that it was the sound of a body falling slowly painfully he collapsed to his hands and knees he was gasping like a fish out of water all color had drained from his face his oxygenstarved brain felt as if it were about to explode on the floor of the tram he scrabbled at the wire constricting his throat desperate to remove the cincture then he felt himself pulled down a dog on a leash the chinese had regained hold of the ends of the garotte and now face to face with david oh he began again to exert pressure on the larynx and windpipe david oh had scarcely enough strength left to resist he met the garlic and licorice head on and he almost drowned on his own gorge as he gagged heavily he was so dizzy he no longer had any sense of up or down he felt weightless suspended as he had earlier between earth and heaven only now he felt much closer to heaven he knew he was close to passing outknew too that death lay on the other side of that slumber he was determined that should not happen with great hamlike fists he pounded against the chineses face harder and harder until the blood began to flow as he tore through skin bruising the flesh beneath the chinese was blind with his own sticky blood but still he refused to let go of the garotte all his energies were concentrated down that narrow line his only thought was to pull the wire as tight as he could death was in his heart not survival still david oh fought on he was no longer aware of time or place there was only life and the void that succeeded it he turned his thumbs outward like spoons dug them viciously into the chineses eye sockets the man only grunted where any other would have howled in pain and begged for mercy the chinese had inured himself to all consequences he knew his job and he was doing it with a last desperate effort david oh leaned forward and hunching his shoulders so that all his muscles bunched up with effort plunged his spatulate thumbs downward through the soft sockets the eyeballs burst apart as david oh howling in terror and rage dug his nails through tissue and cartilage as far as they would go death came and the chinese whipped under him in galvanic response there was nothing left inside him but residual nerve flow and the reflexive convulsions of muscles carrying out the fiercely concentrating brains last command the fists white with effort and strain remained pulling at the ends of the garotte even in death the chinese would not give up he was killing david oh just as if he were some undead fiend risen up out of a grave in some lurid horror film jake knew something was wrong inside the car of the ascending tram even as it was slowing to head into the peak station he saw the humped forms through the windows recognized the black spatters flung across those same windows for what they were blood jesus christ he whispered sprinting toward the car the tram rose at him out of the mist of the mountainside it was shining beaded with rain lights were flickering inside tendrils of fog clung to its sides slowing as it entered the station proper jake was running alongside slamming his fist against the door bliss right behind him open this thing he shouted in cantonese dew neh loh moh open the doors at last the tram reached its berth the doors slid open jake and bliss rushed inside the short hairs on the back of his neck tingled the interior stank of blood and the sweet foulness of death without thinking he ran the length of the car leaping over the prone body of a young chinese slammed the heel of his shoe into the second chineses face and he bent dragging the mans clamped fingers one by one from their death grip on the ends of the garotte david he gasped oh my god david bliss got the wire from the dead mans hands and began to unwind it david oh groaned as it came away blood leaked from the center of the purpleblack welts the neck was already swollen to double its normal size jake tried to hold david still as the younger man gasped for air it appeared as if the severe swelling was preventing air from getting through the windpipe he used the end of the garotte to make an incision in the flesh opened it with a small splinter of wood to allow the air unimpeded flow take it easy he said david oh was shaking all over his hair was plastered against his skull by sweat and blood he was gagging and crying all at once jake lifted his head while bliss went for assistance in a moment she returned to tell him the ambulance was on its way david jake tried to lift him but david oh screamed so piteously that jake eased up david he whispered david ohs eyes were filmy their rich black turned watery their heads were touching jake cradled the younger man in his arms david oh was struggling to marshal his energies listen his voice trailed off and his lids fluttered closed with a great effort he looked into jakes eyes beridien donovan wunderman one of them knows did this to me to stallings his lids fluttered and when they opened his pupils were dilated with pain it was so difficult to speak the taste of blood and bile was metallic in his mouth his throat was filling up missed you jake no one around to talk to taking off like that without telling me anything i thought you trusted me more it wasnt trust david it was personal for me to do alone like what happened happened to you at sumchun river he was quiet for a moment his breathing harsh and irregular blood leaked from the corner of his mouth i feel like im filling up he was crying im sorry jake whatever happened to you there wish it had never happened youre my friend my friend a rigidity coming into his musculature all at once the onset jake had seen it before a mi tuo fo broken fists like claws digging into jakes arms oh buddha his eyes snapped open and jake saw the finiteness of the pain the edge of death coming david the huo yan remember the huo yan jake in death there was no more pain that was the only sense jake could make of david ohs passing as he held the lifeless body his thoughts were far away from the added revelations david oh had given him for seven years jake had been david ohs mentor he had taken care of the final phases of davids training had protected him from the treacherous eddies of political maneuvering inside the quarry jake had been aware of all this but in all those years they had never gotten around to talking about it now they never would it was terrible to know that this man had died while they were estranged from each other there was an incompleteness to the equation that could never be filled it was not so oddly just as it had been with mariana oh david jake thought now ive missed you too ill always miss you you were like my brother because you were so close to me i hurt you the most like mariana sumchun river did that you were right i began to die there marianas death the dantais now yours piece by piece until i seem more dead than alive at that moment he felt bliss moving against him even in this situation her flesh was like fire where it touched him his pulse raced bliss jake could and would spend the rest of the night mourning the loss of david oh but he wondered whether it would be a futile gesture on his part mourning was meantinsofar as the living were concernedto bring about resolution to a relationship a definite ending all that he should have said to david he had not he had wronged his friend as he had wronged mariana and ting as well if he was to be brutally honest with himself now it was too late their relationship would forever remain incomplete he was engulfed in grief i think wed better get out of here bliss said the ticket takers coming her urgent words pulled him into the present in a moment his mind was filling up with david ohs last words remember the huo yan the movable eye in wei qi what did it mean and where was the material david oh had unearthed from the quarry it was not on him and a quick search of the other chinese confirmed that they had not taken it from him that was not surprising david had been too good an agent to have come to an rdv with written material of that sensitivity come on come on bliss took his hand pulling him upward as they raced out of the car another thought struck him a savage blow now that the quarry had found and sanctioned david oh it was a certainty that he would be their next target shanghai hong kongcentral chinashanghai japanese highlands summer spring for ninetyodd years the foreign tai pan had ruled shanghai now the rats and the mongrel dogs had the run of the rubble and corpsestrewn streets the tai pan who in years gone by had made their fortunes in tea opium silk shipping rubber real estate and silver depending on the decade retreated to the rooftops of their white buildings along the bund there binoculars in hand they watched as their city was destroyed as they had been in the japanese were on the march generalissimo chiang who had at that time been so successful in defending shanghais twisting streets and narrow back alleys its array of bridges and canals confusing to all but seasoned residents had decided to make his stand in the city rather than face the invaders in the kaoliang fields to the north besides he knew that in shanghai he would return to the international spotlight quite naturally the tai pan did everything in their power to keep the chinese from fighting the japanese knowing that this war would certainly destroy shanghaiand their futuresfor good but in these dark militaristic days the tai pan had lost almost all their power once again they had forgotten that they stood on foreign soil the illusion given them by the existence of the international settlement had increased their arrogance this time the chinese ignored them completely japanese and british gunboats rode at anchor in the great harbor ten thousand chinese troops handpicked for the job by chiang himself had dug in throughout the city erecting barricades unrolling barbed wire twentyone japanese warships began to sail up the huang pu their bluejacketed army was on the march on august the first shots were fired across the yokohama bridge at the northern tip of the settlement the chinese had bombersamericanbuilt northrops as it happened their pilots were young inexperienced and shorttempered for hours the day following they tried repeatedly to destroy japanese factories and stores failing in that they turned their attention to the huge battleship izumo lying at anchor in the huang pu bombs exploded in the river along the wharves destroying a line of godowns the flagship of the japanese naval forces remained unscathed gritting their teeth in frustration the pilots turned their planes and heading lower overflew the bund the impeccably dressed tai pan field glasses to their eyes gasped to see the bombs begin to fall over the settlements busiest crossroads the intersection of the bund and the nanking road the first plunged through the roof of the palace hotel swarming with foreign and chinese guests the second detonated in the street just outside the entrance to the cathay hotel the devastation was staggering the road was jammed with people most of those in the immediate area never knew what hit them others hit by spinning debris or caught in the flames spreading from the epicenters of the targets stumbled screaming in pain and terror children eating ices were torn apart young women crashed through plateglass windows or were crushed by collapsing mortar and brick in all people were killed another were seriously wounded all within the space of ninety seconds athena and jake safely away from the site of the terrible carnage felt the shudder of the bombs athena if she thought about the moment at all assumed an earthquake had hit her innerdirected mind did not translate the roar her ears had picked up ever since the night of the incident with zilins mistress she had been a changed woman horrified at what she had done to another human being she had taken jake and retreated to zilins study at the rear of the house while she had waited for him to return she had had much time to contemplate her actions and her conflicting emotions it was the first time she had seen firsthand that intense fear could turn to hate the expression of her own aggression terrified her athenas hawaiian mother was no more capable of hating than she was able to be unkind it simply was not in her nature athena had always believed that she was like her mother in this until now her mother could not have done what she had done to zilins mistress no matter what the provocation how do i know that athena had asked herself over and over my mother never had her family threatened she had never felt so alone and frightened as she did during that long night the arms of destruction were sweeping south toward shanghai always this teeming city had been the nexus of chinese trading it had been one of the worlds richest cities for years it had held the largest concentration of silver on earth and one of the largest of gold certainly more opium passed through this port than any other china was poor china had always been poor but shanghai had always been rich until now this wealth had provided a blanket of protection across the city as if it were exempt from all ill as well as all law the war of had been viewed at least as far as the western community was concerned as a minor aberration never to reoccur yet now the fall of shanghai was assured the japanese were at the gate and china always inimically divided seemed powerless to stop them in contrast to the intensely militaristic and highly disciplined invaders the chinese were callow illtrained and with chiangs german tacticians illadvised shanghai had essentially been a hugely profitable boomtown since the day ninetyfive years before when the british warship nemesis steamed up the huang pu to blow apart the wusong forts crumbling chinas last line of defense against the foreign devil but it had been an unusually stable one due to its international significance and the amountone billion taels in silverof foreign money invested in it now war was bringing that all to an end shanghais days of glory were being swept away like ashes into a trash heap the stench of cordite and blood hung in the air like a pall masonry dust borne by hot summer winds turned the air dry and choking corpses lined the streets and alleyways while the rats and dogs feasted disease ran rampant athena had waited hours for zilin to return home how many times had she planned the speech of contrition for his benefit and her expiation he never came the servants terrified by the onset of the fighting and the rumors of the citys imminent defeat failed to return the heart of the large house beat on but athena was already deaf to its pulse in the pale light of the gray morning even sheng li was gone dumbly athena saw the smears of blood caking the floor marring forever her husbands expensive rugs with their indelible brown tattoos the iron poker lay where she had dropped it discolored at its tip at sight of it she murmured god in heaven wheeled and with her hand pressed hard against her mouth ran to the bathroom where she vomited into the white porcelain sink she spent the next ten minutes bathing her face with trembling hands in icecold water she returned to zilins study to find jake playing on top of his fathers desk in his small hands was a stiff oversized envelope jake looked up at her approach stuck a corner of the envelope into his mouth chewing it with teething gums when she took it from him though she did it gently he began to cry athena picked him up and kissing the top of his head held him against her hipbone she turned the envelope over saw my dearest athena written in zilins careful english script now she began to weep knowing that she held the confirmation of what she had in her nighttime terror suspected that her husband was not returning to her her hands shook so badly that she cut her finger trying to get the envelope open inside she found a note three lines long directing her to zilins hidden safe the last line was the combination setting jake down to crawl underneath the desk a favored spot she crouched opening a lacquer cabinet behind false doors she found the safe and using zilins combination opened it inside she discovered fifty taels of gold one hundred ounces of silver and a tiny silkwrapped packet this last was marked as jakes inheritance she unraveled the silk until a shard of lavender jade lay revealed in her palm it seemed to be part of a carved beast though it was surely no creature she had ever come across this fu read a card attached to the shard is the birthright of my son and must stay with him no matter what may befall him in the distant future when he comes of age he may have occasion to make use of it if he ever does my athena it will mean that i have succeeded in what i have set out to do i love you but alas i love china more perhaps you can understand this not now i suspect but later broken hearts may mend in time it was signed in vermilion ink with zilins chop but in this last at least he was wrong nothing could mend athenas broken heart zilin had been her life but for him she would have soon left china far behind drawn to its allure but nonetheless wishing to contemplate it from a safer distance now she was trapped by the war the japanese were laying siege to the city she had been here in when their atrocities proliferated so highly regimented and controlled in their daily life the savage animal that lurked within every man was loosed in awesome intensity within the japanese soldier by the pressures of war that horrific mindless carnage could and would happen again she knew she no longer thought about herself but only of her baby for two months she hoarded the wealth that was her only reminder of zilins departure she kept to herself as much as she could venturing forth from the house on rue moliйre only infrequently to shop for food and clothes all around her the evacuation of the city had begun the families of the western tai pan were removed to safety while the men stayed on secure in the knowledge that the british destroyer duncan with its contingent of marines was waiting for them docked at the shanghai club in their dimly lit woodpaneled sanctuary at number the bund distant in atmosphere if not in physical proximity from the sandbagged barricades where chinese and japanese shot stabbed and clubbed each other to death the tai pan discussed the end of the world their world it did not matter to them who won this stupid war the japanese would attempt to kill them if they won and if the chinese were by some miracle to emerge victorious they knew that chiang would push them into the sea their time in this foreign clime was over in any event that however did not deter them from lifting their sparkling stemware and with great quaffs of scotch and brandy toasting the end of an era misery dogged athenas life during the day she marshaled her strength to keep jake busy and happy at night she lay awake in a semidarkness lit by constant fires the smell of smoke was never out of her nostrils and the crackle of smallarms fire was a dulling litany one day athena took jake shopping it was the better of two choices she would never have left him alone in the house she chose the noon hour since the ravaged city was most alive then the nanking dense with shoppers she had just emerged from sinceres and was heading across the road to the wing on department store when her ears caught a peculiar buzzing sound it was the same noise that haunted her restless sleep through nights filled with the sweat of the heat and of fear she knew instinctively what it was before anyone else around her did mutely she grabbed jake off the street and holding him tightly against her breast ran through the jumble of rickshaw and truck traffic at every step it seemed she was thwarted and later in the visions of these moments that were to engulf her she would feel again as if she were trapped within a dream time became elastic she tried to elbow people aside she ran into the dusty side of a car people shouted at her hurling chinese epithets her way her feet felt stuck in mud her leg muscles sapped of energy and all the while the terrible metallic buzzing tore at her increasing in volume until it filled up her brain death was coming athena screamed in inchoate terror my baby she thought oh god save my baby at least the great shadow of the plane shut out the yellow sky at the same moment the bomb fell athena could recall through her visions that one instant of deathly silence when everything on earth seemed to cease breathing then the world collapsed sinceres disintegrated into a flaming spitting inferno athena heard the howling of the shoppers like a chorus of the damned the earth erupted at her feet and she was hurled sideways by the tremendous concussion of the explosion the entire wall against which she was thrown was scarlet blood and bits of pink matter drooled down the brickwork just as if all human flesh in the immediate vicinity had been instantaneously liquefied athena curled herself into a protective ball around jake smashed one shoulder and knee against the wet brick the stench of hot blood and fecal matter made her gag it was a physical presence in this place an abhorrent spectre striding through the city jake cried out choking on the fumes and athena instinctively put her hand over the top of his head she whispered into his ear then the wall of wing ons against which she had been thrown started to crumble athena heard the rumbling far above her head but she could make no sense of it her instinct was to get up and run but she pushed down the fright and stayed where she was had she moved she and jake would have been buried beneath the collapsing brick wall athena felt the rushing of masonry it seemed to her as if the sky were falling a terrible grinding split apart the tie beams and without support the wall caved outward like the arc of a tidal wave those still in the street crushed together and spinning drunkenly away from the utter devastation of sinceres were crushed beneath the tonnage an avalanche of brick masonry splintered wood and shattered glass descended on them with lethal rapidity there did not even seem enough time to understand what was happening to them athenas curled position at the base of the wall was the best she could have taken she was spared the fate of hundreds all about her who died of broken necks crushed windpipes shattered sternums and multiple fractures that severed their arteries nerves and organs a stray brick struck her a glancing blow on the temple its corner leaving a long deep gash all the way from her scalp above the hairline to the ridge of her brow just above her right eye blood coursed down her face terrifying jake at first she was so dazed that she did not understand it was her own blood that was flowing now and not more of the muck that had coated the wall in the last moments before its collapse what she said what thought seemed difficult she did not know where she was for many minutes she seemed to be breathing in water rescue crews working through the mire of the rubble finally found her two of them drew her gently out of the little pocket within which she lay even then she would not relinquish jake to them so that they could check the child for wounds they took her to a hospital where her laceration was cleaned sutured and dressed the overworked doctors asked her to stay within the precincts of the hospital overnight because they wanted to check for signs of concussion not of course in a room or a ward which were all filled to overflowing with more seriously injured people but out in the corridor where bandaged patients milled about dizzy and teetering athena escaped this bewildering asylum with jake on her hip certain that her baby should not be subjected to such an environment a moment more than was necessary the brick had left more of a mark on her than just the bandaged gash all around the wound her flesh turned black and blue puffy and oversized until the right side of her face was unrecognizable jake was terrified at the sight of her and nothing athena could do seemed to calm him he would not let her hold him or even sing to him the thing he had always loved most it was as if he felt that someone pretending to be his mother had slipped into the house with him athena was not aware that the swelling was affecting her vocal chords even her voice had changed into a deepthroated rasp at night she held her swollen head ticking off the seconds by the throbbing it seemed to her as if the only sound she could hear at those times was the coursing of her own blood through her veins and arteries sunk deep within the working plant of her own body she was unaware of how distant the world was becoming there were times during the days when she could remember nothing she would awake on her feet staring at jake or out the dusty window she was a tabula rasa no thought flickered inside her brain no emotion then just as if a master switch were being thrown all her life would flood in upon her memories intellectual thoughts emotions the input was far too intense to absorb all at once she would weep uncontrollably for hours jake sitting on his fathers desk as if it were a great winged steed of imagination would watch her silently he was no longer frightened of her he saw as the swellings subsided that this indeed must be his mother but somehow the emotional connection that had bound them until the moment the wall of wing on had collapsed around them was gone he watched her with the same intense but dissociated curiosity with which he observed all people when he was outside he wondered who she was one night athena awoke she sat bolt upright in bed she felt as if she had been awake and was now asleep an odd timeless quality filled the bedroom it was the night of the full moon and unlike the weather of the last week or so the sky was perfectly clear she found that she was staring at the window opposite her bed not through it but at it a shaft of silver moonlight pierced the darkness shimmering onto the floor illuminating the rug at her feet its monochromatic light created new colors from old the moonlight seemed to waver before her eyes as if its substance were not visual at all but rather aural it seemed to sing to her a song so familiar it brought tears to her eyes what was it as if in a trance athena climbed out of bed and barefoot padded across the room she stood by the window slowly she put a hand on the sill bathing it in silver with the same deliberation she lifted her eyes her gaze following the band of light upward she saw the glowing disc of the moon the heavens around it were absolutely pellucid she cried out as the first of her visions struck her with the power of a physical blow she staggered falling backward she sprawled in the moonlight while her mind recreated in painstaking detail the devastation in the nanking from the moment she had first heard the plane until the wall collapsed around her when she came out of it she stared unseeing up into the beam of moonlight its song was so loud in her inner ears that she was deaf to all else a hymn she thought its singing a hymn it was the same hymn her brother michael used to sing at home when he came back from the seminary she used to be so derisive of him deliberately disappearing from the house on sundays so that her mother could not ask her to go to church with him she had hated religion then she had not understood the calling some inkling of its power had dawned on her in of all places china she saw how michaels faith had made him happy impervious to the heartbreaks of the vast unknowable continent at last athena understood why she had been reluctant to leave shanghai even when the evacuation had begun her vision had shown her the answer her destiny lay here in helping the sick the poor the injured the doctors were there to bind their physical wounds but someone had to take gods light and bind their inner hurt in her euphoria athena thought she could grasp gods larger design michaels death had to have a meaning she was convinced this was it his example was now made manifest inside herself michaels spirit would live on in his beloved china through her the warmth of the moonlight which she had only begun to feel flooded through her the soulwrenching ache with which she had lived since the long night when she had branded sheng li was gone she had sinned had paid her penance and was redeemed in the calling of her dead brother the world was now hers she was no longer alone directionless afraid her epiphany of faith had healed all those agonies even as it had absolved her of her guilt she no longer felt weighed down by terror or remorse she was cleansed of hate for the next three months athena took to the streets as before she had huddled terrified within the confines of the house her husband had built for her she preached her healing gospel to anyone who would listen and to many who did not there was no loss of work for her shanghai had become a hollow shell echoing dully to the daily cannon and smallarms fire at night shells brushed the undersides of lowlying clouds before bursting in thunderous detonation within the settlement by day the japanese sent in more and more reinforcements little by little chiangs valiant but outmanned force was pushed back through the litter and rubble of what had once been the continents greatest city disease pestilence athena remembered the four horsemen of the apocalypse brought into existence by war the skies were ashen the once snowwhite office buildings along the bund now streaked with soot and blood shanghai was a corpse as raw and bleeding as were its many wounded inhabitants athena often crossed suqiao creek to the south to attend to the chinese many were dying it was merely a matter of increment were they dying slowly or quickly athena tried to comfort them all they seemed surprised that she could speak cantonese others ignored her words finding it impossible to believe that a foreign devil could speak their tongue with such fluency none however failed to be moved by her ministrations she kicked at the persistent dogs and rats that patrolled this part of shanghai as if it had become their own jake learned to take a piece of wood with him to beat them into bloody pulps the autumn was dying as surely as was the city winter was coming and with it the end of the generalissimos defense in november chiang ordered his troops to abandon their longheld positions they fell back rapidly and the japanese began their triumphant march into shanghai ninety thousand strong they forged up the yangzi in pursuit of the fleeing chinese they entered a city seemingly bereft even of breath smoke curling from smoldering fires hung in the still air an awful silence enveloped the city now that the batteries which had been at each other for months had ceased their bombardments extensive areas of the city had been devastated streets down their entire length had ceased to exist thousands of houses and factories had been leveled the corpses were piled rotting where they had been flung by the massed explosions from brenan road to the garden bridge six thousand japanese troops paraded in their dress uniforms all of them wore sanitary masks to keep out the rampant pestilence by order of the new garrison commander soldiers with megaphones exhorted the observers within the defeated city to accord the victors their proper measure of respect by giving a gentle bow and wishing us good morning athena with jake beside her watched this moment and felt a terrible pang to see her chinese bow murmuring before this horde she heard the ghosts of a billion chinese ancestors cry out in horror and dismay their pain lanced through her so that she herself cried out in a moment she had collapsed at jakes feet jake had never seen his mother so pale she smelled funny he did not want to approach her he watched silently as the man and woman hanging back at the furthest edges of the crowd of spectators worked their way toward his prostrate mother he observed them as they crouched over her the man who seemed very old to him held her wrist in a funny way his lips moved in time to some internal rhythm perhaps he was singing but jake did not think this moment was cause for even a hymn come on the man said to the woman lets get her back home he lifted athena up in his brawny arms the woman held out her hand to jake he slipped his hand into hers it was warm he walked close beside her she smelled good he liked that in their house jake became aware of the loud noises his mother was making she lay on a bed her face was shiny and tight her chest heaved the woman attended to her putting a wet rolledup cloth on her forehead once she tried to feed athena something from a bowl the liquid ran down athenas chin and neck wetting her clothes even more the man who wore a strange sixpointed star around his neck put his huge hands on jakes shoulders turning him away are you hungry he had an odd accent that made jake giggle jake nodded in the night they woke him gently with whispered words your mother wants to see you the woman said she smelled sweet jake took her hand and went with her athena smelled worse than ever he wrinkled up his nose and tried not to breathe this made him gasp within the space of thirty seconds so that the woman squeezed his hand he saw the sweat streaming down his mothers face why was she so hot didnt these people have a towel to dry her suddenly his mothers eyes flew open in the light of the single oil lamp that the man was holding up jake could see the color of her eyes as pure and clear as ever at that moment their connection returned and he threw himself upon her heaving bosom sure now that something terrible was about to occur he felt the womans hands pulling him back holding him now stroking the back of his head as he remembered athena used to do jake it was a sandpaper rasp he heard his name but could not recognize her voice mama athena was weeping her thin hands searched beneath her soiled dress she was thwarted her eyes looked from jake to the woman please she whispered and her hand pulled away part of her dress the woman saw again the small bag hung by a leather thong from around her neck give it to him athena said with some difficulty please the woman let go of jake and bending over athena removed the bag she loosened its drawstring and drew out some papers she inverted the bag over jakes hands out rolled a piece of lavender jade see that he keeps it with him always athena said she sighed deeply liquidly jake stared down at his mothers blank face in a moment the light swept away plunging her countenance into darkness he heard the mans voice rumbling its time we left here we will go to our friends in hong kong in the darkness jake felt the womans acquiescence he reached up taking her hand in his the way to mao led through hu hanmin zilin had known this from the moment he left shanghai for the peasant fields of destitute hunan where his sources told him mao had returned after thirteen years to conclude the process of winning over the populous central provinces to his cause zilin knew that he could not simply approach mao with his ideas in fact at this point he had no desire to make himself known to the rising communist leader he wanted first to sink into maos organization and then once entrenched spread his philosophies slowly it was crucial that zilin sell himself to hu as a zealous communist if he could not accomplish that zilin knew he had no hope of continuing in his longrange plan he did not relish using someone who had been a friend in other days but he reminded himself harshly that he had already done far worse to those he loved even more than hu he could have come with moneya commodity of which mao was in desperate need but that he knew instinctively would have been a grave mistake for one thing it would have called immediate attention to him for another it would have made him suspect zilin had no desire to have his background checked he had lived too much of his life as a capitalist what hu and mao had in commonwhat had drawn them together in the first placewas their love of philosophy zilin knew therefore that he could approach them in the same manner but using different cant for mao it would be sun tzus art of war which he called on constantly in fighting his continuing guerrilla war against chiang for hu it was laotse a philosopher whose writings zilin had studied extensively but with whom he had become disenchanted for one thing laotses thinking was far too formularized early on zilin had learned that formularization was second only to rote in ossifying creative thinking it was one of the roots of his disagreement with communism dogma he thought was all well and good for displacing anarchy but as an ongoing structure it was no solution at all he found hu without difficulty he was out in the fields working side by side with the peasants he looked older his wide face somehow grayer lines had appeared in his flesh as if each day with mao had marked him with the blade of a workers crude knife ah shi zilin hu exclaimed when he recognized his longtime friend beneath the dust and the simple clothes so you have come after all zilin smiled to be orphaned lonely and unworthy is what men hate most he said quoting laotse hu wiped the sweat from his brow he stank of hard labor his eyes narrowed the war in shanghai has devastated you is that why you are here zilin shook his head i had divested myself of all my holdings some time ago i urged my brothers to come with me but their philosophical leanings lay in another direction they had not been married to mai they had not sat with sun zhongshan and absorbed his faith he shrugged sometimes things are benefited by being taken away from he concluded quoting again hu smiled cautiously in that case he said hefting a farm implement he held it out to zilin when the calluses begin to form i may begin to understand five months after zilin entered into maos camp the forces came under the first serious attack by generalissimo chiangs troops until this time zilin supposed chiang had been too busy licking his wounds from the shanghai debaclenews of which had reached them somewhat belatedly recruiting fresh soldiers from the provinces not already under japanese domination he had had his one bad moment then seeing in his minds eye the destruction of his adopted city but he knew both athena and sheng li were in their separate ways strong women in his absence he had left them what he felt each needed to survive he knew they would do all in their power to protect his children the onset of the rainy season had already begun turning the ground marshy flooding the manytiered rice paddies maos forces were currently occupying ground that in sun tzus opinion would be considered encircled that meant access to it was strictly limited where the way out was tortuous and constricted it meant in a nutshell that should chiangs troops catch them there they could easily defeat mao chiang using intelligence from his spies knew that and was coming as swiftly as was possible accordingly mao had ordered a full retreat if he could get his people across the wideopen fields and through the narrow defile before chiang got there they would be safe the problem was the swiftness of movement maos forces were tired they had spent twelvehour days in the fields with the peasants putting aside their weapons for the time being and in his words picking up plowshares zilin making a detailed estimation of maos men felt certain that fatigue would slow them sufficiently so that chiangs fresh forces would catch them either in the defile or just emerging from it either way they would be on death ground that is one in which in sun tzus opinion the army would survive only if it fought with the courage of desperation even assuming that the casualties would be horrendous there must be a better way zilin said to hu as they crouched on their haunches eating boiled rice the men follow mao hu said stuffing rice into his mouth there was little time before maos orders would come for the men to move out they have done so from the beginning they believe in him implicitly he has never been wrong so far zilin thought he squinted up at the lowering clouds it had been raining all morning but the precipitation had ceased about an hour ago still the weather was not good the sky was so dark it might have been an hour past sunset instead of near noon zilin who had been taught to read the portents of wind humidity and barometric pressure by three oaths tsun knew that more rain was imminent heavy rain by the feel of how low the pressure was dropping he looked morosely out at the enormous expanse of fields they must cross in order to get to the head of the defile he watched one or two peasants still at work bent over their filthy cotton skirts pulled up to their thighs they were calfdeep in the mud and as one moved off zilin saw that she sank down to the level of her knees well never make it through that in time he thought its like quicksand he sucked in his breath so sharply that hu stopped his eating and stared at him what is it hu said concerned are you ill on the contrary zilin said his heart was beating so fast he was obliged to concentrate on his breathing for a moment to slow it down to an acceptable level still he felt the adrenaline pumping through him he stood up i may have discovered a way to save our men now hu stood up as well his bowl of rice was forgotten what do you mean listen to me zilin said you believe that maos strategy is correct heya hu nodded i do tell me then what will happen if we engage chiangs forces while we are still partially in the defile or even if we have just emerged hus face looked even more tired than usual there will be many casualties many good men will die but the cause they neednt die zilin said hu was quiet for some time zilin pointed watch the women there in the paddies do you see how slow their movements are they are women hu pointed out not men and soldiers at that those women zilin observed could carry twice the field load of any of our men without complaining still they are having difficulty in the field its become a quagmire yes i see hu nodded bad for us it will slow us down terribly and there is more rain on the way i can feel it zilin turned to face hu but if the field will be bad for us think of how it will be in six hours time when chiangs troopsat the end of their long days trekmust slog through it hu looked at him blankly and they will have to slog through it my friend if we do not move from here if we hold our position until they have waded out into the paddies then we fall on them with all our strength hu was silent absorbed besides zilin said administering the coup de grace we will be fighting in front of the peasants they will see for themselves how we defend the land that we have been helping them till all these long months how do you think they will react to that it will galvanize them to our cause mao will become legend in these provinces hu nodded slowly thinking through all that zilin had given him its true enough he pulled at his lower lip meditatively its an excellent plan come i will take you to mao zilin shook his head it is only an idea i have passed on you and mao are close there is little time he might not listen to me but he surely would to you all right hu said but ill tell him whose idea it was tell him about the plan zilin said watching hu hurry off that will be sufficient in the months after maos decisive victory over the force that chiang had sent against him in hunan his prestige and power increased tenfold again and again the tale of his military prowess was told over smoking fires in peasant villages all through the central provinces and as was the nature of such things the actual details of that days battle became more and more grandiose chiangs force swelled from six to nine hundred and thence to fifteen hundred the count of maos army of course always stayed the same so that the victory increased in importance in the retelling mao was well aware of this and was delighted to let the story grow out of all proportion all men seemed happiest when grappling with outsized numbers he would let them have their fun and in the process do his recruiting for him but he was also well aware that the plan had not been his no one else within his army knew this save hu and the man with whom the plan had originated for despite zilins admonition hu had felt honorbound to mention his name to mao for some time after the victory mao was in a quandary as to what to do to acknowledge the man right away would be to lose incalculable face but to ignore him was boorish and worse stupid the man obviously had a keen and calculating mind such a one mao finally decided could be of enormous value to him in due course zilin was summoned before mao hu took him to the communist leader but was dismissed immediately by mao shi zilin mao said i have begun hearing about you of late i am perhaps unworthy of so much talk mao nodded absently he keenly wished to impart to this man that his interest in him was minimal at best it was illadvised to allow others to see that which you needed hu hanmin thinks highly of you after their introduction mao had not once looked directly at zilin instead he paced the room he had made into his study he had zilin had observed the true revolutionarys restless spirit since he was never content to be in one place for any length of time it must have taken extraordinary control for him to remain in the fields at hunan for so long now they were in yunnan cavedwellers like bats i rely on hu hanmin mao waved a hand perhaps he can find a place for you on my permanent staff as you wish comrade zilin said thinking two can play at this as well as one mao glanced at him we will speak again perhaps if you have an interest in military matters we could play a game of wei qi i would like that zilin said giving no outward sign that he had understood maos oblique reference to the plan he had created which mao had used as his own as maos stature grew so too did zilins more and more those who sought an audience with mao and could not get to see him were directed to zilin after a time they asked to see him instead of mao zilin found the solving of these problems fascinating athena had read enough of the bible to him for him to be able to draw a parallel with solomon it was not ego that led him to this comparison but merely his particular bent on a windswept day when the cave had become a howling hive driving many of the men down the mountainside a woman entered zilins chamber it was near twilight the lamps were lit but their flames whipped by the eddies of wind flickered disconcertingly so that reading became impossible zilins aide a young intelligent man who shared many of his ideals introduced her this is qing ming comrade the young man said he stood by her side until her intense stare obliged him to withdraw when he had gone the woman came across the room to where zilin stood zilin looked hard at her but the unsteady light made definition difficult she seemed no more than twenty he thought she was exceptionally beautiful she has been well named he thought qing ming meant pure brightness she wore the dusty clothes of the country folk to the south and it occurred to him that perhaps she had come a long distance to see him would you like to sit down he asked her thank you but i prefer to stand tea she seemed grateful for the offer nodding mutely as he poured zilin called for his aide and when the man came he asked him to bring in some food he smiled at qing ming it has been a long tiring day for me i have not had a chance to eat since early this morning i hope you will not think it mannerless of me to take food while we speak my aide will bring enough for us both are you hungry not really she said but she ate ravenously zilin picked at his food not being hungry at all he had divined this womans intense pride he suspected that she would never have asked him for food even had she been starving to death watching her eat now he wondered from how far away she had come after a time she wiped her mouth she had sat down when the food arrived now as zilin poured her more tea she sat on the edge of the chair as if its full comfort was not for her she seemed extraordinarily tense this is difficult for me she said without preamble for a time after i heard of you i thought that i would not come at all it shames me to sit here before you zilin said nothing it was the best he could do for her at the moment her head came up and he saw the lamplight flickering in her ebon eyes i am the granddaughter of the jian jian the word hit zilin like a splash of cold water the jian he murmured he remembered the garden the solitude the utter peace of the old mans environment in suzhou he thought of all he had learned from him he thought of trying to find him but he had only been a child then the jian had disappeared into the adult world he looked anew at this beautiful woman he knew that he did not have to tell her his relationship with the jian in her eyes he already saw that knowledge my grandmother loved the jian she was his mistress she looked at him i have no one and nowhere to go my husband was killed three months ago in the fighting near canton his family has no use for me because i am not from their village his mother spits on me in these evil times i have become a burden to them i care little for myself if it were just for me i would not have come here to beg like a street urchin before you butshe put the palms of her hands against her bellyi have someone else to think of now my unborn baby is all that matters to me her eyes dropped to her lap the one story that came down to me from my grandmother was of you grandfather spoke of you all the time to her to him you were the son he never had but i do not in coming here that is it is presumptuous of me to present myself here on the strength of what he felt zilin studied her for some time marshaling his thoughts my time with your grandfather he said was the most important in my life without him i cannot think where i would be today he looked around certainly not here and he thought my grand design for china assuredly would not have been created without the lessons he taught me he got up and stood over the young woman your grandfathers love for me was certainly reciprocated i am glad you screwed up your courage and came to me he pulled her to her feet his open hand touched her lower belly your child is important to me a descendant of the jian is a member of my family he took her to the opening of the chamber and called for his aide tonight he said you will sleep here in all the comfort we can muster you will eat well i do not want you or your child wanting for nourishment tomorrow i will begin making arrangements for your journey it will be long and arduous without doubt your child will be born before you reach your final destination qing ming looked up at him all of her tension had dissipated where am i going through burma to hong kong zilin said softly to a man named three oaths tsun i will give you a letter of introduction he smiled down at her and of course a present for the baby every january yumikosheng li had begun from the moment she joined the japanese civilian evacuation of shanghai calling herself by the name her father had given hertook her son to the tiny bochi on the outskirts of the small hillside town of kamioka the cemetery was within walking distance of their house no matter the weathermore often than not at this elevation there were more than a few inches of snow at that time of yearyumiko would bundle her son up in warm clothes throw on a quilted haori coat over her winter kimono and walk with him on an undeviating route their geta would crunch through the crust of the newly fallen snow silence draped the trees even the glossy black birds seemed to shiver on their perches within the bare crowns of the trees at the bochi yumiko would let go of her sons hand and producing incense from inside her kimono place the sticks in the frozen ground he watched her silent as she knelt the sound they made stayed with him for hours she lit the incense and began her prayers she never knelt in front of any one marker and he had no idea whom she was praying for until many years later in fact when he was old enough to reason clearly he assumed that she was remembering the kami of his father long dead she had told him in answer to his question in china that he was mistaken in this was due more to yumikos reticence than to his erring in divining the signs it was true that she was mourning what else could he think by the spring of the world war was over japan was tired humiliated and occupied by american troops for weeks while the wild plum among the earliest of blossoms sprang up along the hillsides in bright patches of color yumiko had been at work sewing a cloth pennant in the shape of a fish on the fifth day of the fifth month it was hoisted atop a slender bamboo pole that yumiko planted to one side of the entranceway to their house just beyond the engawa mothers and fathers in this small town were doing the sameas they were throughout the islands it was the koinobori akithis was the name yumiko had given him a rough japanese translation of his original chinese name which meant beginning of autumn asked his mother about the festival during the war years the koinobori had not been celebrated it was the boys day festival she told him a pennant flew for each son in the household smaller pennants for the younger children larger ones for the older sons aki was pleased to see that the pennant yumiko had made was in his estimation at least quite large he watched as the stiff spring breeze snapped the fish smartly he saw each scale she had so painstakingly painted upon its side he stared into its face kind yet fierce which she had lovingly created it is a carp yumiko told him it was chosen as symbol of koinobori because of its unquenchable courage the carp is known to swim up waterfalls and to face the carving knife unflinchingly it is said that schools of carp were enlisted by empress jingu when she led an armada of warships on an invasion of korea yumiko took akis hand and sat with him at the edge of the engawa it was still cool winters aftermath not yet having been entirely laid to rest by the warming sun the air was very clear so that the very peaks of the hidasanmyaku range to the east stood out in sharp relief like the edge of a great avenging sword yumiko had always thought perhaps that was why she had chosen to settle here she looked at aki his black hair fluttered in the wind his golden face was upturned as he continued to stare at the floating carp the poignancy of the moment was not lost on her even in its moment of darkest defeat japan managed to celebrate the lives of its young it was a symbol she had prepared just for him he was almost ten now it was time she thought to begin his real education akichan she said softly did you know that these carp pennants were not always used in koinobori he said nothing but she knew he was listening he always listened to her and he retained everything she had been concerned about him at first what with all his infant sicknesses his seeming inability to speak had terrified her doctors had assured her that nothing physical was amiss but these were men whose minds were on the war on more important matters and yumiko remained afraid there were few things in life that could frighten her now since she had crawled in agony from zilins house in shanghai so long ago returning home to find the packet of gold and the shard of lavender jade for her son she had vowed that fear would have no more place in her world for had she given in to her fear then she would have died on the spot and her son with her yet the prospect that he would somehow not grow into a normal healthy child haunted her whether it was because she could not erase from her mind how he had come into the world so prematurely or whether superstitiously she felt he was cursed by her own bad joss in having fallen in love with zilin she could not say at fourteen months aki should have spoken his first words in fact he said nothing at all until his third birthday then when he did open his mouth what came out was an entire sentence mama can i go pick plums yumiko was so filled with astonishment and relief that she laughed and cried hugging him to her for the longest time when she had recovered he asked his question again of course you can she had said she accompanied him watching him amazed from infancy one of his favorite foods had always been umeboshi these plums were harvested in the spring and put up for pickling so that they would be ready as a refreshing midday snack during summers first heat wave in early june it was perfectly clear why he wanted to go picking plums but yumiko had not expected such sophistication from her threeyearold tell me about the carp aki said now looking from the pennants to her face yumiko roused herself out of her reverie in the seventeenth century she said the samurai were the only ones allowed a display at boys day then they would take out their katana and their armor polished and shining in the sunlight to honor their sons some of the common folk as a joke i expect made paper carp to display on this festival day since they were forbidden to own swords they chose these valiant fish to show the samurai that even commoners had their worth in the world does that mean we are not samurai aki asked with characteristic insight yumiko looked at him for a moment i do not know the answer to that akichan it is possible that we are samurai i suppose i think id prefer to believe that we are samurai aki said thoughtfully then he stood up is it all right if i go pick plums of course yumiko said a single tear slipped down her cheek as she watched him run longlegged down the path to the street over dinner that night with the koinobori carp still fluttering outside yumiko told him why she took him to the cemetery each winter to pray youre growing up quickly she said it is time you knew the story of my life in shanghai will you tell me about my father there is nothing to tell she said curtly hes dead long dead it is much better that way but he was a brave man aki persisted a samurai in the war fought at shanghai yumiko went on the bravest and the purest of spirit were the first to perish her eyes turned thoughtful perhaps it is always thus purity in any of its forms has no place it seems in this imperfect world perhaps those who find itand live by its absolute preceptsare punished for their audacity if i was pure aki said i would not be punished he picked up one chopstick brandishing it as if it were a weapon i am a samurai i would destroy those who would seek to punish me yumiko who was about to admonish him for such talk stayed her tongue at the last minute she thought on what he had said it was as if her own avenging spirit had somehow crossed the boundary between them it was as if her kami had entered into his we go to the bochi each january she continued because on that date in five japanese priests were attacked in shanghai one of them was killed murdered by the chinese he was the first to diethe first of many we must honor his kami always who was he a samurai no akichan i told you he was a priest but why was he in china how perceptive children could be yumiko thought and above all others her son because he was a member of a rather militant sect of buddhists there are many buddhists in town aki said was he one of them yumiko smiled and touched her son i dont think so they have lost much popularity since that time i doubt that any of his sect live around here what is their name nichiren yumiko said aki learned from his mother that the real nichiren had lived during the thirteenth century he had believed in the lotus sutra which unlike the other major forms of buddhism esoteric zen and amidism considered the three forms of the buddhauniversal body eternal body and transformation bodyto be one and inseparable he had spent much of his life railing against these more prominent sects and criticizing japans rulers for patronizing what he considered false forms of religion nichiren was not of course his real name he had adopted it because it fit his purposes nichi meant sun symbolizing both buddhas light of truth which nichiren was dedicated to promulgating and the land of the rising sun which he was dedicated to keeping pure ren meant lotus the symbol of the one and only righteous buddhism because of his endless militancy nichiren was at last sentenced to death by the ranking members of the hojo regency in kamakura but as the executioners sword descended upon his neck a bolt of pure blue lightning struck the blade shattering it this divine intervention caused the hojo regency to reconsider his punishment eventually he was banished for life to a tiny island in the sea of japan where he was the only inhabitant there he wrote birds cry but shed no tears nichiren does not cry but his tears are never dry no one knows how long he stayed there but one thing seems clear he did not die there rather a giant carp swam up to him while he was bathing in the sea and carried him away on its scaly back aki thought about the story of nichiren for a long time after he went to bed that night its message would not let him sleep it seemed to him that nichiren was pure and for his purity of purpose he was punished yet unlike his follower in more recent times he had not been allowed to die hadnt buddha intervened in his behalf sending down that bolt of pure blue lightning if so why hadnt he done the same for the priest in shanghai perhaps it had not been buddha after all in that case the lightning was an act of nature that made more sense to aki since it was a giant carp another of natures pure creationsthat had spirited nichiren away from his lonely exile satisfied with his reasoning aki fell asleep when he awoke in the morning he helped his mother take down the bamboo pole from in front of their house when she moved to untie the pennant he asked her if he could do it free of the cord that had bound it to the bamboo the carp lay fluttering as if alive in akis outstretched hands he took it inside and carefully wrapped it up in their best rice paper then he knelt by the side of his futon and gently slipped the package underneath his pillow from her vantage point just beyond the doorway to his room yumiko looked on with glittering eyes that year aki received two presents on his birthday the first from his mother was the boxwood bow and quiver of slender finely fletched arrows he had been asking for all winter he threw his arms around her excitedly jumping up to string the bow outside akichan yumiko said havent you forgotten something you have another present to open i do he came back to where she knelt beside the low table but how could that be who is it from there is a note for you i think she said handing him the gift it was exquisitely wrapped in seven layers of handmade rice paper each had a different weave a different hue a different texture the outermost layer was rough and ruffled the innermost was as smooth as satin aki was careful in unwrapping the present sensing perhaps the importance of what lay inside by the complexity and care give over to its binding inside he found a kimono it was very shiny and unlike any he had seen before on the center of its back was a charcoal gray kamon an unfamiliar family crest aki saw the heavy sheet of rice paper on top of the kimono it was folded in precise thirds sealed with a blob of vermilion wax he took it up and broke the seal it was handwritten in large brushstrokes by a forceful hand it read akichan it has been almost ten years since you and your honorable mother settled here i have watched you grow in that time on your birthdays i gave your honorable mother money because you were not yet old enough in the grammar of my world for me to give you a token directly this year is different it was signed mitsunobe ieyasu the sensei aki breathed these words mitsunobe had been their only close neighbor though he had seen the old man speaking to his mother many times aki had never actually met him there had always been a peculiar aura of unapproachability about mitsunobe that had kept him away on the other hand he felt a fascination whenever he saw the old man with his shock of thick white hair striding down the road or leaning on his carved gnarled walking stick while talking to yumiko then he would crouch on the engawa his arms tight around the wooden post as if fearful that he would somehow be drawn down the last steps to his house and out toward the sensei sensei meant master and that was certainly what mitsunobe was he was the most celebrated go master of his time and of course this alone would have been enough to earn him the title of sensei but the old man was purportedly sensei in a number of other disciplines as well aki unfolded the kimono he tried it on it was so gossamerthin that he felt as if he had donned the wings of a dragonfly it was unlined which was odd in such a dress garment made out of habutae silk aki curious as always commented on this yumiko shrugged delicately then youll just have to ask sensei yourself perhaps one dons this kimono only on special occasions what occasion then he turned to her laughing i know you must ask sensei yourself then his face darkened is something the matter akichan he shrugged abruptly mute dont you like senseis gift oh yes he said sincerely of course i do its just that goon well he looked up at her it makes my heart pound to look at him yumiko smiled put her hands on his shoulders she felt his strong bones and muscles through the veiled layer of the ineffably smooth silk it felt to her as if he was already taking on new form that is only natural my son sensei wields enormous power i take it as a good sign that you can feel his power from such a distance but you should not allow that power to frighten you or keep you away it is a power to protect you not to harm you she began to walk with aki to the front door now i will tell you a secret that will help you with sensei on your first meeting i know that he is waiting to hear from your own lips how much you like his gift but it happens that today is also senseis birthday i think that is one reason why he was drawn to you when we first moved here he has no true son only young and glib disciples his wife died many many years ago today akichan is senseis beiju his eightyeighth birthday today begins his age of rice why is it called that yumiko took him back to the table handed him a sheet of paper and a brush you know your kanji she said write out the number eightyeight aki did as she bade she took the brush from him now she said using the brush if you break down the character you get three characters she drew them what does this say now age of rice aki said he clapped his hands with delight is there more mother yumiko tousled his hair in japan we begin celebrating old age at the sixtyfirst birthday because an old proverb has it that life lasts only sixty years but further our calendar gives remarkable emphasis to the sixtieth year it is the time when ones birth signs are repeated wholly in the new calendar thus we see that year as marking a kind of rebirth special presents are given have we given sensei a special present for his heiju for a time yumiko said nothing she gazed down at her sons upturned face with loving eyes she felt closer to him at this moment than she had to anyone on earth how her heart was filled up with love for him i thought i would leave that up to you she said softly me but mother how could i possibly know what to get sensei look to your heart she said that is all that matters akis face screwed up in concentration for a moment then he said do you think sensei likes umeboshi as much as i do thank you for this gift his voice rumbled off the finegrained cedarwood ceiling it was as if the whole mountainside were speaking aki his hands and forehead pressed hard to the tatami of the senseis entranceway murmured it is my favorite thing in the whole world he heard the sound of paper unwrapping their rice paper was not nearly so fine as that in which mitsunobe had swathed the black kimono but it was the best quality he and his mother possessed ah the deep voice rumbled again umeboshi how i love pickled plums even in the beginning of autumn aki ended his deep respectful bow his muddy geta had been neatly placed on the concrete slab just below the first cedar steps up into mitsunobes entranceway on his feet were clean white tabi come in my boy sensei said welcome his face was powerful it was square with his great shock of white hair like a lions mane adding to the effect his jaw was wide and firm deep lines were scored down from the sides of his nose to the corners of his broad mouth his white eyebrows floated startlingly just above eyes like chips of flint he was dressed in a widesleeved white linen blouse and a pale blue hakama skirt that aki recognized as being similar to those he had seen the zen archers wear when they practiced their mysterious art senseis house gave an impression of great expanse the ceilings were exceedingly high massive cedar beams crisscrossing eyrielike he had directed the house to be built so that it faced the mountains one could kneel and sip tea while gazing out at the almost limitless view that ranged up two miles or more through turreted crags snowdriven slopes and rising fields alternately sundrenched and clouded over mitsunobe made tea for aki just as if he were an adult visitor in fact aki was struck by the fact that sensei did not seem to treat him as other adults didsave his mother he did not talk down to aki or feel that he had to be in some way amused just because the boy was ten years old i am sorry that my gift is not as special as yours was to me aki said after sipping first at the frothy tea on the contrary mitsunobe said i delight in pickled plums and it is a rare day indeed when i am able to get the homemade kind as rare as the age of rice aki asked in his straightforward way mitsunobe laughed the sound seeming to shake the bare rafters of the room oh my goodness he shook with mirth yes yes as rare as beiju he unscrewed the cap of the jar what do you say to sharing a portion of umeboshi night descended but aki did not notice until mitsunobe rose to light the lamps there was no electricity in the house the illumination came from kerosene lanterns sensei fixed them a substantial though simple dinner of broiled fish and sticky rice afterward they retired to the main room where no lights were lit it was a clear night and as aki arranged himself on the tatami he felt himself bathed in a kind of ethereal illumination he looked up saw the skylights set in a wheel pattern that seemed similar to the crest on the back of the black kimono in the silence of the upland night starlight spilled into the house lighting up the space with an extraordinary pinpoint glow this is my time of contemplation mitsunobe said bathed in the light of buddha his face was only partially illuminated only patches of his features showed so that aki was obliged to use his memory and his imagination to fill in the dense shadows in this atmosphere senseis countenance took on chimerical characteristics there was once a mystic badger mitsunobe began he was an exiled wise man who had transformed himself into the forest animal to escape the threats made against his life by an evil magician in the pay of a fierce and unjust warlord in the transformation he had left his human body behind the warlord before whom the lifeless corpse was brought was satisfied that his enemy was indeed dead but the magician whose mind was far more devious remained unconvinced he ventured forth from the castle keep in order to prove his suspicions the wise man sensing that the magician was near quickly ran but he knew he could not run forever hiding in a cave or in the nearby stream was useless for the magician had ways of discovering him accordingly the badger sought out a floating forest of lotus he had heard of and plucking two wrapped himself in the larger one placing the smaller one atop his head like a cap thus he stood his golden eyes like beacons searching for the magicians approach at length he felt the chill one always feels with the onset of evil he tried not to shiver inside his musky cloak for any movement might dislodge his armor against evil the magician passed over the badger on batlike wings the hissing of his breath silenced the usually noisy nocturnal predators of the forest in a moment he was gone the lotus had protected the badger after a time the badger returned to where he had shed his human form now that the crisis was past he wanted to return to his natural body but of course it was gone having been brought before the evil warlord and burned in his presence now an ineffable sorrow gripped the badgers heart he spent the next year hovering about the fringes of human society in a vain search for his body during that time however he made many friends foxes stoats rabbits even the muchmaligned weasels had their good side he discovered but not so with mankind during that year the badger was able to observe human society as he had been unable to all his life in total objectivity he saw the cruelty that man inflicted on man he saw wars death and blood running freely at the edges of the forest he saw the victors exult the vanquished collapse in despair he saw in short that it was pride which separated man from the animals pride was a sin which animals were incapable of committing so at the beginning of the summer solstice when in the innermost reaches of the forest its creatures gathered to celebrate the new year the badger abandoned a search for which he no longer cared and returned to the circle of his newfound comrades but it was the time of the hunter and unknown to the badger he had been seen by human hunters and followed deep into the forest with their bows and arrows they fired into the shadowed glade where all the creatures had gathered the last to die was the badger having had to see the death of all his newfound friends before at last an arrow pierced his chest for a long time after senseis story was done aki said nothing he listened hard he heard the trill of a nightbird and at inconstant intervals the scratching of a bough against the side of the house i would like to be a badger he said at last indeed mitsunobe was moving around in the dark the danger is great starlight glinted off his shoulders making it seem as if he were appearing and disappearing through a dense forest if i become clever enough i can outwit the danger at last aki heard the soft susurrus of a fusuma sliding open he felt almost immediately the slight chill of autumns night wind on his cheek and throat let us see whether you are brave or merely foolish bring your bow and arrows mitsunobes voice reverberated out into the night and follow me into the starlight aki rose and grabbing up the present he had brought to show sensei scrambled across the tatami at the lip of the doorway he stepped down onto a broad flat stone its cold penetrated his thin tabi my geta no clogs mitsunobe said his voice was like thunder only the kimono but it is thin aki said and it is cold out this time of night sense put his powerful arm across akis shoulders remember he said his voice like thunder traversing the clear starladen sky the mushrooms aki wrapped the habutae silk of the black kimono tighter around himself from somewhere far away a mist was rising when he returned from his first round of lessons with sensei yumiko found him changed he was no longer akichan and she went to get her books she summoned her son into the room in which she had had constructed the altar to the fox goddess whom she had taken as her personal protectress here she lit a multitude of candles and twentyseven joss sticks in a semicircle around the plumeria wood altar her ancient books were spread open before her she settled her son in the center of the light his face glowed with a special illumination she saw the flickering flames reflected in his eyes his strength filled up her sere heart her withered soul they sat crosslegged on the reed tatami and she felt his breath on her cheek a fan of immortality she might die soon she knew but he would live on and through his power her revenge on athena and zilin nichiren was her logical choice the historical nichiren had killed in the name of a holy cause was her cause any less holy yumiko thought not beneath her kimono her body burned along the meridians of the scars she bore a physical manifestation of her shame nerves had been irrevocably severed the japanese doctors had told her she should feel no pain in those spots no sensation at all yet she burned how she burned only the knowledge of what she was about to do would assuage that agony akichan was zilins issue as much as she wished it were not so but it would be she who would mold him she and the sensei would assure that together they would make of akichan something that zilin would never recognize or tolerate his philosophy was one of ultimate reason and order in the world therefore yumiko had devised the ultimate revenge for him to turn his son into the supreme anarchist one drop of chaos into zilins precisely ordered world his own son it was only fitting the irony pleased yumiko now she began her chants raising ancient kami the wildfire of desire resurrecting the ephemeral substance of spirit outside the night had clouded over the piercing starlight by which the sensei had guided akichan through the first of many years of lessons was gone in its place low racing clouds gravid with rain and electrical energy dominated the atmosphere aki looked briefly out the window at the refulgent night and was reminded of the badger he wondered if his mother had lotus leaves in which he could wrap himself he felt something coming and thought of batwings against the blackness of the sky the semireligious chanting of yumiko gyred in the room seeming to create patterns of light perhaps it was only the wind seeping in through cracks in the walls and windows that caused the candles flames to flutter then flare in incandescent brightness the incantations yumiko had been quite correct akichan was no more the child had been suffused with the spirit of the man a certain man ironwilled and hungry for life in yumikos mind she had brought nichiren back to life he lived again inside her son and who was there powerful enough to convince her that she was wrong certainly not akichan book four ka moscow hong kong beijing washington macao summer present there is something i wish to know yuri lantin lay on the rumpled bed surrounded by the thickstriped yves saint laurent sheets perfectly nude he was smoking a thin cigarette of foreign manufacture his long legs were flung carelessly out crossed at the ankles he seemed quite relaxed there have been rumors he said staring up at the groined creamcolored ceiling of an increasingly disturbing nature regarding what daniella asked she sat beside him with her back against a pair of goosedown pillows she was wearing part of a threepiece albert nipon outfit that lantin had bought her at the beryozka store just three blocks from dzerzhinsky square though the place was within walking distance of her office daniella had never once gone in there though she possessed a coveted red plastic card that allowed her entrance to the restricted stores selling imported luxury items from the west she had never used it since she had begun her affair with yuri lantin he had taken her there three times tonight she wore the gorgeous gored nipon skirt made of luminous deep blue synthetics that hugged her hips in a sexually inviting way she wore black silk stockings she was bare to the waist lantin often dressed her thus for their long bouts of lovemaking he loved inventivenessloved too to see her nakedness through layers of halfopen clothes and degrees of shadow she studied his nakedness now much as a fine painter studies her nude model with her eyes she traced the clean lines of his chest free of the hair she despised on so many russian men his belly was flat and lean she could see the outline of every muscle there his groin was halfshadowed just the head of him visible curled on his thigh waiting he had very muscular legs wiry like a runners daniella found that she loved this body with an amazing passion the galvanizing mind atop it was another matter at last lantin finished his cigarette he leaned over stubbing it out and in the same motion picked up a water glass containing three fingers of starka he liked to smoke occasionally especially after sex but he detested the taste it left in his mouth he swallowed some of the starka and said the rumors concern kam sang the nuclear power plant the chinese are building in guangdong what of it rumors he said again his gaze swept over her and he thought what extraordinarily fine legs she has if i could choose the method of my death that would be it to be strangled by those magnificent legs my face buried in her snatch rumors that kam sang harbors a secret that it is more than it purports to be but the rumors are true daniella said amused at how completely she had captured his attention do you think the kvr is ignorant of what is going on in hong kong or southern china i already know kam sangs secret it was passed on to one of my agents its nothing to concern you i want to hear it anyway kam sang is going to be a radically different design in nuclear power generators the engines will also be desalinizing sea water hong kongs always had a water shortage problem this will alleviate it lantin closed his eyes as if drifting off to sleep daniella contented herself with watching the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest and stomach he even breathed like an athlete she too wanted something and she was deciding how best to get it once she had seen a western film depicting the mafia in it the hero had to go to the boss the godfather to get permission to take action daniella wondered whether the western term godfather fit yuri lantin are you certain of your intelligence he said concerning kam sang her mind was far away yes tell me yuri have you had much experience in interpreting intelligence from the field i was in the army he said shortly that was my field he said it as if no other field meant a damn its not like reading auguries she said poring through goats entrails to divine the future a network is an entity one sets up over years allowing it time to settle in to become like an insect or a blade of grass part of its environment as that happens over time one evaluates the incoming intelligence testing each bit like a chemist she pulled her golden hair back from the sides of her face but that is where the analogy ends there is nothing empirical about espionage she said nothing more for a moment she put her head back on the pillows luxuriating for just an instant in the softness of the down one tries never to leave anything to chance from the first ive had a vigil on each section of the network those observers report back to me they are absolutely independent of the network there are also specific backups for certain links in the chain each of these reports back to me independently to help verify the main body of intelligence this is all in aid of telling me that you are certain of the reliability of your intelligence no she said it is to show you why it is reliable i think he said that is why i was first attracted to you he turned to look into her gray eyes for the first time he saw the tiny constellations of brown flecks there you are not afraid it is stupid not to be afraid sometimes he reached out to touch her as he rarely did merely to make contact that contained no carnal component that is not what i meant fearless daniella she said wanting to draw him out having simultaneous affairs with a sluzhba general and a politburo godfather a what the man with the ultimate power not me he began premier she had put the flat of her hand across his lips he pulled her fingers away dont ever do that again he snapped she was not sorry that she had angered him he was always in a more receptive state when he was angry she slapped him try to be civil will you her outrage seemed genuine enough to him he grabbed her wrist twisting so far that she was obliged to curl away from her position one halfclad thigh came down over his legs she could feel his knee between her calves she cried out her thick hair obscuring her face the gold catching the light glinting softly metallic as if it held hidden secrets perhaps it is also because you are so physical that i am attracted to you he said in her ear youre hurting me she liked him to believe this to hold him at a level that was tolerable to her she suspected that given free rein his violence could easily slip across the boundary to become dangerous yes he said thickly loving the sound of those words he leaned in bit the side of her neck it was a spot that made daniella hot she pulled away so that he would come after her as he desired more and more she felt caught up in his game in deceiving him but slowly getting him to understand that she enjoyed what he was doing to her she did not know why and from time to time she found herself thinking about it generally it was while she was at work after a time she realized that it concerned her learning to like his kind of sex was somehow akin to taking drugs it was different and addictive it altered ones perception of reality she did not know what to make of that only knew she wanted more she beat him back with the heel of her hand against his pectorals she loved the feel of him the resilience and the hardness at once when she aroused him he became hard all over this she had discovered made her wild her hair flew between them like a golden curtain he took a handful and pulled her prone atop him his knee began to part her thighs flesh against silk his hard thigh jammed against the fulcrum of her legs the contact pushed all breath from her lungs she gasped and whimpered her eyes watered and he licked away her tears her nether lips were flowering open her heart was hammering hard all she could hear was the rushing of her blood in her inner ears she was making him wet so hot he said assaulting her anew he flipped her over with a powerful twist of his upper torso he circled her wrists with his hands pulling her arms up over her head her heavy breasts thrust out toward him and he shoved himself between them the contact was dry and unpleasant so he freed one of his hands to stimulate her roughly at the apex of her thighs daniellas eyes fluttered closed she moaned to the sensation then his hand came away and her eyes flew open she watched him stroking himself coating his long shaft with her fluids then he was between her breasts again poling up and down his knees pushed her prominent breasts tightly together forming the sheath he was getting redder and redder daniella lifted her head and at an upstroke enclosed the tip of him in her mouth swiped with her tongue she felt him tremble and quickly let go he gasped continuing to pole up and back i need your lips he whispered his face was contorted with his effort i want you in me she sighed please his stroking was feverish she whimpered and he could not refuse her he pushed the skirt aside buried himself on the first thrust they groaned simultaneously daniellas inner muscles massaged him until she felt the fluttering of his lower belly oh he sounded as if he were being stabbed to death more she gave him more in tiny increments increasing the friction from moment to moment she thought he was going to have a heart attack lantin convulsed atop her the force inside him gathering and releasing gathering and releasing daniella had never been with a man who came so long and so deeply this time she did not reach orgasm herself though she came close her mind was filled with karpov later at the edge of sleep when it was so still within the apartment that she could discern the tiny increments of time being ticked off by the clock in the living room he said into the space beside her ear tell me about your day this was not an idle question and she knew it he had already digested the report copies she had smuggled to him she resisted an urge to ask him about the conversation she had had with tanya nazimova it had been odd to be on the phone with chimera her holiest of holy secrets and to be the subject of a vigil at the same time life ticking away like a time bomb suddenly very dangerous indeed but to the man following her she was only on the phone a call to a friend or relative so what defensive thinking that was bad if she could not manage to gain the offensive now she would be finished in both a professional and a personal sense she would be lantins body and soul might as well slit her wrists right here in bed mess all the new clothes he had bought for her hollow gifts anyway she knew they were for his pleasure not hers shed played that game many times before shed give him no cause to worry about her now she recounted the march of meetings she had had today allowing him into her innermost thoughts regarding the fantasies she had of him the comments of the other women officers at lunch about her smoking and new hairstyle gulling him with the truth so that when she lied he would not spot it did they like the new you his voice was soft and dreamy lover to lover but daniella was not fooled he did not care about that he liked the new daniella that was all that mattered to him they were fascinated she said as if she were happy about it they wanted to know what had come over me and what did you tell them that it was time for a change that was something they could appreciate how do they feel about change having worked to get him to set the framework daniella could feel the edges of the topic that she wanted to discuss coming into view she had deliberately kept away from it it was important that lantin come upon it without suspecting he had been helped it depends on who initiates it generally then generally you know they are not trained to take changes in stride change upsets their ordered world he thought about that for a moment what else did they talk of what gossip they were close now very close oh nothing exceptional whos sleeping with whom what lieutenant came out of the closet this week the usual stuff ive begun to hear some reports leaking back to me about what i was wondering whether you had heard the same thing i dont understand i think you do he was being very clever youre still loyal to karpov there it was out hes been the one behind your career pulling all the strings what about karpov i think you know he turned stroking her arm you know i think youre going to have to give up that particular loyalty i have my career to think about just what hed expect from her karpov is stealing my thunder his eyes were closed his breathing calm sweat was a saltyslick film across him karpov has an ego the size of the ukraine she said yes i know egotists are like blackmailers once they start they never have sense enough to stop is that your opinion of karpov she said nothing quite deliberately he was the original architect of moonstone lantin still had not opened his eyes karpov i think had one good idea in his life what was that making me head of the kvr he laughed at that and his lids popped open surprising her he stared at her thoughtfully after a time he said what am i to do about karpov why ask me youve known him a long time you know him intimately and you think im privy to all his secrets it was important that he work hard for this why dont you ask his wife then he chose to ignore her facetiousness his wife perhaps loves him also she does not possess your mind people in the position karpov is in are not so easy to bring down as head of the first chief directorate he has many friends more in the military one neednt muddy the waters to catch fish she laughed i almost think youre serious i am now that he thought of this as his idea she could get on with it this is not a small task i would think not then i have something to ask of you what is that your permission she said he looked at her breasts so firm and rich they stirred him again he felt himself growing the breath quickening in his throat youre looking at the wrong place yuri daniella thought she moved minutely so that her breasts quivered just enough for him to pick up you are sluzhba he said i am not what would you need my permission for she leaned over grasping his erection at its base she squeezed slightly at the same time her pointed breasts dragged against the muscles of his lower belly you are the power without you there will be nothing he sighed and she echoed him oh she whispered so big he closed his eyes his breathing already ragged he thought of how strong his hold on daniella was she would never speak a word against him she might be devious but she was a woman she knew her place in the sluzhba his intelligence on her assured that just as it assured that she would obey his every command zhang hua hurried across tian an men square again he was late for his meeting with wu aiping and he was not looking forward to the withering comments the senior minister would subject him to he went quickly to the wide steps of the historical museum opposite the national peoples congress building in the cool dim interior such a contrast to the devastating heat outside he hurried past the enormous relief map of china hanging on the wall with its quotations from mao and its chronological history of the dynasties he turned left then right until he found the space filled with the thirtythreefootlong dugout canoe discovered in jiangsu in it was presumed to be old but like the majority of the artifacts housed within the museum it could just as well be a restoration or a wholesale copy china had been too well plundered over the centuries for much to remain even in the largest museum in the country a thousand pardons comrade minister he said as he came up to wu aiping the senior minister had been studying a replica of the calendar used during the shang dynasty between the sixteenth and the eleventh centuries bc to zhang huas relief he did not return an acid comment instead he continued to stare at the chart on the wall in a moment he had moved on to the first of a series of large glass cases as zhang hua followed him he saw that the case was filled with weapons used long ago do you realize zhang hua wu aiping said that all the hafts of these knives spears and axes have been cleverly reproduced by modern artisans using the designs garnered from ancient pictograms of the period it makes one feel proud of modern china it makes me sick to my stomach zhang hua thought privately to know just how much of our past has been stolen or ruined by the faangwailoh now there is nothing left of our long and glorious past but these sad restorations that merely look like what they are not but he said only i understand comrade minister they moved on to the second case here were displayed a list of ancient grains gleaned from characters found in archaeological inscriptions as well as agricultural tools such as a bronze spade purported to be real stone hoes and shell sickles to zhang hua they looked no different from the weapons in the previous case now that it has been done i dont mind telling you wu aiping said in fact i prefer to you who are loyal to shi zilin you whom i own to pay for that loyalty i would have you twist in the wind while you watch your mentors destruction wu aipings tone of voice was the same as if he were strolling with a friend idly enjoying the museum the last of the cables has been sent to hong kong he continued the qun dipping into our various ministries funds has bought up all of five star pacifics shortterm notes that makes a total investment of just over twelve million dollars now we control five star pacific shi zilins main link in his ren has been neutralized now that the qun is sir john bluestones partner shi zilin is a thing of the past he has no more leverage with which to sabotage kam sang kam sang could kill us all zhang hua said hotly i feel as shi zilin does its secret is far too dangerous for silence wu aipings hissed warning served as well as a shout i have no stomach to hear this weakhearted drivel surrounded on all sides china is besieged if we do nothing to destroy the soviets they will certainly crush us this war in yunnan is but the first step of a concerted campaign designed to destroy us kam sangs power will ensure that never happens zhang hua recognized the lurid light of the zealot behind wu aipings eyes he was terrified by the power the senior minister wielded his shoulders slumped against the glass case and he thought if kam sang is activated none of us will survive speaking of sir john bluestone wu aiping said calmer now that zhang hua had ceased to verbally oppose him i received a cable from him via the hongkong and asia bancorp he wanted more capital to buy up all the remaining outstanding shares of pan hanmin wu aiping was savoring the knowledge that bluestone was now his agent unwitting or no last night i called the qun together and though the risk to us is now high i persuaded them to borrow further from our funds since we are assured of a quick return on the money we wired out the money early this morning that was the last nail in shi zilins coffin but comrade minister zhang hua protested shi zilin was about to advance them the money wu aiping smiled of course he was i just beat him to it the pattern i have broken it now that i control the faangwailoh bluestone i can control the flow of events you good hitsin minister mouse will inform me the moment shi zilin sends his next coded message to mitre at that moment i will set my hearing with the premier at last we are in position to destroy shi zilin as soon as he sets the final phase of his hong kong plan in motion hes a dead man once he is gone we will weed out the generals who are loyal to him replace them with our own men inheriting the axis of power that has been his for decades we will actively use it as he has cravenly chosen not to the time of swift action is upon us a rising bubble of power that will sweep all my enemies from before me zhang hua walking beside wu aiping heard this change in emphasis he said nothing jake watched bliss asleep half hidden by the floral bedcovers at the window sunlight struck him a heavy blow across the shoulders his back was to hong kong he watched her with intimate absorption he felt the same standing here as he had moments before asleepawake next to her he had dozed with unrestful deliberation acutely aware of her presence beside him the silken slide of her skin her perfumed breath on his neck strands of her hair light as air fanned across his chest he had felt the rhythmic rise and fall of her deep even breathing believing himself several times to be immersed in the south china sea off cheung chau island fo saans voice coming from nowhere and everywhere at once bamahk find the pulse rapt in her aura deep slumber eventually took him a clear utterly restful time such as he had not felt in years he had awakened just before dawn aware of what had befallen him and so guilty that he had been obliged to get out of bed immediately never mind that he wanted to remain where he was by bliss side that guilt so western in nature must have been a genetic product of his mother certainly it had not come from his father jake rarely thought of his father when he did it was most often of david maroc his fu shard was his only link with the couple who had created him his memories were full of david and ruth maroc the people who had raised him as their own carefully in the light of the new day jake unwrapped the fu shard that kamisaka had given him nichirens piece yes his eyes and mind confirmed it was part of the same fu the same chinese emperors seal how was this possible jakes gaze returned to bliss sleeping form who was she really besides his childhood friend she had long outgrown that role or had she he knew that he must get her to fulfill her promise to tell him everything jake was surrounded by mystery he disliked unanswered questions that trait too must be from his natural mother athena nolan shi even in her lunatic ravings just before she died athena had refused to give up that name jake shi he had become jake maroc but now with the fu shard lying heavy in his palm he suspected that there were others in the world who knew his real name who were they how did they know to his knowledge only the marocs had been aware of his origin not even mariana not even ting the fu ever since his raid on henro house events seemed to have revolved around the fu shard marianas disappearance nichirens actions even bliss she knew of the fu shard had told him to go after it why what did she know about this artifact that he did not he crossed the room as he did so his shadow fell across her face bliss awoke staring into his eyes jake she did not move she slept naked her shoulders and the tops of her breasts were visible above the rumpled top sheet you slept well last night causing another stab of guilt to go through him sleeping better with her than he ever had with mariana i tossed and turned he said i dreamed constantly i woke twice she said softly to make sure you were all right you slept like a child unmoving all the worry lines were gone from your face he sat on the bed he felt a flood of emotion just by talking she could melt his heart how was such a thing possible she watched his face as a mother will watch the face of a troubled child she sat drew her legs up to her chest im holding you to your promise bliss her thick hair was like dark wings shadowing her face she rested the point of her chin on her knees when i was a child she said my father used to tell me the story of the fox who was forced to forage for himself and his mate pregnant and ill with an unknown disease it was winter in the northern provinces a hard mean season when frost rarely left the land because of this the fox was obliged to stray farther and farther afield to find sustenance one night he came to the edge of a farmers land and slipping through a gap in the reed fence found the henhouse thereafter every night the fox slipped into the coop and dragged out a hen the farmer set traps each night a different kind each one more cunning than the last the fox desperate and determined that his mate and still unborn cub should not die evaded them all this went on for ten days until finally the farmer determined that he would have to go after the fox himself taking a broadbladed axe he sat in wait for the fox inside the henhouse eventually the fox arrived but he scented the farmers presence he tried for a hen but the farmer deflected him with the axe he wounded the animal but it managed to escape the coop the night was clear and the farmer following the tiny droplets of blood black in the moonlight tracked the fox back to his lair using his axe he set about to destroy the lair but the bottom of the tree bole was hundreds of years old and as big around as the farmers shoulders it resisted his attack and this exertion combined with numbing cold to defeat him still he wished to ensure that the fox would never again kill one of his chickens so he made himself as comfortable as he could in front of the lairs entrance when the fox emerged as he knew the animal must in order to eat his weapon would make certain of that all through the night the farmer kept his vigil and into the following day morning turned into afternoon afternoon into dusk dusk into night numb and hungryhe had eaten only several scoops of snowthe farmer swung his axe back and forth in front of the lair at last he heard a stirring and turning as still as a rock he waited for the fox to appear his axe honed and lethal was at the ready the farmer saw the beginning of the black muzzle the whiskers he could see the eyes he prepared himself for the kill and at the last instant he stopped his swing in midair for what had emerged from the lair was not the fox who had been raiding his henhouse but a tiny cub his fur matted down with his mothers saliva his legs weak and unsteady the farmer knew that this cub must be an orphan for his parents would never have allowed him out of the lair his father must have bled to death his mother must have died as well the farmer hefted his axe setting it on his shoulder he bent and took the trembling fox cub into his hand pressing it against his side to provide it warmth he returned to his farm the farmer trained never to allow anything to go to waste raised the cub and when it grew up he trained it to guard his henhouse from nocturnal intruders which the fox did to the best of his abilities which was very good indeed bliss put a hand up stroked jakes cheek patience my love the righteous have learned that patience is one of their most potent weapons i am hardly righteous bliss he took her hand away from him i want some answers now now now now how western you often are jake went very still what do you mean oh jake i knew about the fu do you think i dont know that you are half chinese the marocs the marocs took you out of shanghai when your mother died he stared at her how do you know that my father was in shanghai at the same time he knew your father your real father jake got off the bed he drew bliss with him they stood naked bathed in the morning light all of hong kong stretched away below them above the peak was wreathed in mist bliss youre a spook you said as much that makes us the same her head tilted up so that she could look at him was golden in the sunlight her blueblack hair was like a curtain separating them from the rest of the world the fu what is it the fu is the key to the yuhnhyun in hong kong the circle what circle the ring she said set up by your father long ago i dont understand none of us inside the yuhnhyun understand all of it pieces fit together to form the whole like the fu this is not my piece of the fu it is nichirens mine came from my parents my real parents do you know where his came from if i knew that she said i would know everything nichiren and i he broke off turned away toward the expanse of the city and the harbor it disturbs me that he has this that we share something as unique as the fu he turned back to her he is here in hong kong im told he comes here often do you know who he sees formidable sung your friend you know that too whom do you work for ive never asked you that i suspect that you already know whether i do or not she said simply ive never asked you to abrogate your trust why do you ask me to because of your promise you said youd tell me everything and so i shall she touched him again in time she lifted up on her toes pressed her warm lips against his patience jake i am working to keep us alive will you allow me to do my job her dark eyes met his with such force that he was shocked into silence it took three oaths tsun more than twenty minutes to establish radio contact with beijing atmospheric disturbances to the northeast were causing his signal to waver like a flame in the wind so that when at length contact was made the voice was stuttery and often indistinct three oaths tsun sitting in the stern of an eighteenfoot lorcha had anchored his craft along the shore of an estuary approximately sixteen nautical miles upriver from hong kong he varied the exact point from night to night during his thriceweekly rendezvous but he was invariable as to the general area he knew this topography intimately and not wanting to keep his longrange transceiver on board his junk for obvious security reasons he felt this to be the optimum recourse five star pacific has bought up all the outstanding shares of pak hanmin he said morosely into the microphone good the familiar voice said out of habit they spoke mandarin by the spirit of the white tiger there was a fight over the last one hundred thousand shares bluestone and andrew sawyer went at it tooth and nail before bluestone prevailed even better better fornicate better three oaths tsun cried into the mike ive lost control of my company there was a garbled response and he had to fight to remember that they switched frequencies every sixty seconds he dialed furiously and asked for a repeat have no fear in that regard all is going well in hong kong my plan is on schedule despite all the recent setbacks unfortunately the same cannot be said for events on this end i am being sorely pressed by a clique of ministers here three oaths tsun hunched in front of the transceiver how serious is the threat its possible it will be lethal i cannot say as yet have you scheduled zuihoukaiting the final meeting the day after tomorrow is there anything any of us can do here anything i can do have you heard from bliss she is with jake he took a breath david oh his friend has been terminated by whom the quarry ah chimera has arisen we are in the end phase now you must get word to bliss jake will be chimeras next logical victim its all coming down to one fine point three oaths tsun said isnt it that was the original design but there are so many variables variables have already entered into play they have changed nothing nothing is mariana marocs death nothing is david ohs death nothing how many other deaths have there been of people whose names i do not know we are speaking now of the future of china perhaps even of the world how can you equate this with the death of a handful of people three oaths tsun shook his head there must be some humanity left inside you do you see everyone as a piece in your game to be manipulated at your whim i see the future of china that is all and your family three oaths tsun had promised himself that he would not bring this subject up it was improper and worse disrespectful but he found that he could no longer hold his tongue there was bliss to think about and bliss emotions what is left of your family a mi tuo fo look what your obsession has done to them silence the crackling of the ether evidence of storms far away and violent hello henry antony beridien said looking up from his crowded desk he always said that he felt most at home surrounded by dossiers files were the lifeblood with which he directed his agency is it time already wunderman nodded just past really i knew how busy you were i wanted to give you as much time as possible behind beridien the white house shone like alabaster in the waning hours of a long drab afternoon the rosebushes in full bloom were visible but the crowds filing along the pavement past the presidents office were hidden by the building itself beridien stretched you know ive gotten almost no work done since you and rodger instituted this redlevel security scheme of yours why youve even got the doctors office rigged with videotape monitors just a precaution sir wunderman said easily precautions shit i cant even take a piss without cameras and agents taking a peek at my pecker christ almighty man even ike didnt have this much security during the war wunderman smiled as they went down the claycolored corridor maybe thats because general eisenhower didnt have daniella vorkuta to contend with fucking kvr beridien said id like to get vorkuta and karpov in one room together id give them something to contend with his palm pressed against the wall plate calling for the private elevator ive activated apollo wunderman said hes my asset i have full and complete integrity over him hes been inside the kremlin for years under deepest cover i think matters have come to a critical enough point that we must take the chance of his being discovered beridien looked at him as the brushedbronze elevator door opened and they went inside he pressed the lower button our queen for theirs is that it if it comes down to it yes sir thats precisely it youve nurtured apollo for a long time henry are you certain that you want to sacrifice him in this manner it may not be a sacrifice antony apollo is clever he may get away with terminating vorkuta without incriminating himself beridien was shaking his head inside the kvr hes not kgb henry the risk is great right now we need vorkuta dead more than we need apollos intelligence i wish to christ youd come to me first why so you could order me to keep apollo away we lose apollo henry and we lose our highestlevel mole inside russia and if we allow general vorkuta to live shell destroy us they passed by the double squad of guards and entered the medical facilities wing in the examining cubicle beridien began to undress either way im afraid well lose something valuable dressed in the hospital gown open down the back beridien got up on the table he hissed as the cold hit him youd think theyd be able to heat these damned things in this day and age he said crossly presently the doctor came through another door her brown hair was tied back in a tight bun she wore only a hint of lipstick her high slavic cheekbones needed no artificial aid wunderman watched her long legs as she walked across the room to where beridien lay the checkup she gave him was complete but routine eyes nose throat heart lungs blood pressure kidneys wunderman continued to watch the play of the muscles in her legs as she moved and especially when she bent she must play tennis he thought like donovan youre basically fine the doctor said after a time wunderman could hear the scratching of her pen as she completed her findings on beridiens chart but youve got the beginnings of a bug a flu perhaps nothing serious but im going to give you a vitamin shot nonetheless i dont want your long hours depleting you i know better than to order you to take some time off beridien grunted you can sit up now she said wunderman became interested in her buttocks the doctor was at the gleaming stainlesssteel crash cart she inserted the end of a syringe into a vial turned it upside down drew the clear liquid into the body of the syringe with a tiny squeak she unplugged the vial just a moment wunderman said he crossed to where she stood and took the vial from her he studied the label his gaze flicking over the list of vitamins he looked hard into the doctors brown eyes and nodded all right she smelled of handmilled soap the doctor watched him as he went back to his spot against the wall when he was still again she took a cotton ball soaked in alcohol and swabbed a spot on the fleshy part of beridiens upper arm beridien was looking away when the needle went in otherwise he would have seen the doctor smile thinly as she depressed the plunger this wont take long the doctors words seemed to reverberate in the stillness of the room beridien turned his head back when the doctor said not more than three minutes not more than three minutes until what beridien asked why until youre dead director wunderman was already moving across the room what is this a joke i but the venom had already begun to attack beridiens central nervous system and he no longer had any control over his vocal chords his mouth worked comically as you can see the doctor said its no joke she put a hand on beridiens head flicked up one eyelid then the other uhm pupils already highly dilated her voice had the crisp detached tone of an automaton wunderman pushed her aside antony who are you talking to the doctor asked hes dead what wunderman looked into beridiens eyes they were clouded bereft of intelligence he bit his lip until he broke through the skin and could taste the salt of his own blood what the hell poisoned the doctor said i am his li via you see wunderman whipped a smallcaliber pistol from beneath his jacket and fired three shots pointblank into her face she reeled back into the crash cart the black holes marred her look of total surprise then he lunged for the red alarm button that was part of every room no matter how small or insignificant in the quarry building he snatched up the phone emergency he shouted down the line this is an emergency not a drill the director has been assaulted i repeat there is an emergency in the infirmary in a moment the doors had crashed open agents streamed in above their heads the video cameras silently recorded every movement in loving detail it was drunken shrimp time sir john bluestone had been introduced to the chinese delicacy some years ago in taipei by a young woman with a healthy appetite for sex and food drunken shrimp had been her favorite meal just as some people crave a cigarette after making love this woman was happiest digging into this particular dish these days in a kind of private remembrance of those faraway days of rash youth bluestone ordered drunken shrimp whenever there was an event to celebrate taking the controlling interest in pak hanmin was certainly one of those and he had wasted no time in dragging t y chung off to a festive lunch the two tai pan were seated at the best table in jumbo the largest of three floating restaurants permanently anchored in aberdeen harbor on the south side of the island this was not on the third deck where all the gwai loh tourists were led but down on the first deck from this position they had an excellent view through a large window of the busy harbor the town and beyond the peak jumbos great fish tank was just a stones throw away on their other side bluestone lofted his glass of johnnie walker black and clicked it against t y chungs he would have much preferred champagne for this occasion but he wanted to seem as chinese in spirit as possible to the man without whom id never have gotten pak hanmin that was of course not strictly correct it was true enough that t y chungs bidding and buying had been tremendously helpful but really bluestone had to admit that it was his newfound benefactors to whom he owed his thanks at first when his banks had contacted him to say that someone was buying up all of five star pacifics shortterm notes he had become suspicious especially when he could find out nothing about the company yau sinkyuhn services hk but then the banks had assured him that it was not owned by either three oaths tsun or andrew sawyer in fact they informed him that a document was being prepared by yau sinkyuhns lawyers that would allow him to repay the loans at fourteenpercent interest fully four points lower than what he had been paying in exchange the firm was asking for ten percent of five star pacific bluestone who had for some months been in a financial bind could have thought of several more odious alternatives after all ten percent was hardly enough to influence policy and if yau sinkyuhns intervention brought an end to his financial crunch it would be a blessing in disguise for months he had been putting off communicating his problems to his source then he had come up with a way that yau sinkyuhn could be of further use to him he had hit them with the final bill for pak hanmin why not they wanted part of the profits of five star pacific why not get them to work for it and it had worked less than twentyfour hours after he had sent the telegram to ysk he had received the money along with a simple loan contract calling for repayment through pak hanmins profits he couldnt say no to that even though he still had his suspicions about who was really behind yau sinkyuhn he knew that he had done all he could to discover the identities of the owners he would have to accept the situation as it was now but he was determined to keep searching for clues to yau sinkyuhn one day he would unearth its secret until then he would use it in any way he could but there was no point in telling t y chung that the less the chinese knew about bluestones affairs the better after all it was bluestone himself who was in partnership with t y chung not five star pacific the pak hanmin deal was something he had put together on his own without your help and the hak sams intervention in the new territories my fortunes would be quite different t y chung smiled thinly joss mr bluestone the hak sam the chiuchow triad with which you are affiliated was no doubt pleased to resolve your contract problems in the new territories utilities are their bread and butter in that region work is still difficult and though this agreement with the communists gives us some breathing room people are still jittery especially there as for myself new business opportunities are always welcome when they involve trading houses the size of five star pacific the waiter came with the food first abalone in blackbean sauce then garoupa steamed with bamboo shoots and tiger lily buds the men ate silently with quick jerky movements of their chopsticks tea was for later now bluestone continued to pour the scotch at length the waiter arrived at their table with what appeared to be a small aquarium on a rolling cart inside the pair could see two dozen outsized prawns swimming lazily in the sea water with deft economical movements the waiter reached under the aquarium producing a large metal bowl he set this on the center of the table into it he poured two full bottles of white wine then one by one he fished up the prawns with a bamboo utensil and placed them in the bowl of wine when he had transferred all twentyfour of them he took his cart and departed bluestone saw t y chung staring out the restaurants window not at the buildings of aberdeen but toward the floating city of the hakka bluestone thought he was looking for three oaths tsuns junk weve really stuck it to him this time t y chung turned his head i beg your pardon three oaths tsun bluestone said he was slightly put out that his culinary piиce de rйsistance had not taken center stage weve dealt him a severe blow pak hanmin was one of his pet projects now weve taken it away from him you and i t y chung smiled again but in such a way that bluestone had absolutely no idea what was in his mind yes he said a severe blow to be sure bluestone returned his gaze to the metal bowl he pointed the swimming of the prawns was beginning to falter look bluestone said theyre getting drunk t y chung lifted his glass just like us bluestone smiled but he felt vaguely disquieted by the notion he stirred the wine as if he were a chef now that our partnership has been firmly cemented by pak hanmin t y chung said as he watched the prawns dance i think its time we set up a threeway meeting with sharktooth tung bluestone looked pensive he is a busy man dont i know it t y chung thought but youre not going to keep him all to yourself building a friendship with the dragon of the hak sam triad is one of the main reasons i am sitting here today were all busy men mr bluestone but in business i find there is no substitute for personal relationships if our partnership is to flourish we must enter into it with a joined spirit if we do not we are wasting one anothers time ill see what i can do then but by his tone t y chung knew that bluestone would do nothing of the kind id better whet his appetite he thought i have something specific in mind he said something that perhaps sharktooth tung can help me with what does it concern bluestone asked now i have him t y chung thought not what mr bluestone who three oaths tsun ive another acquisition in mind in the new territories local management i am told is riddled with hak sam bluestone thought the sooner we can bring three oaths tsun down the better there will be an entire rainbow of choice companies ripe for the picking together t y chung and i will scoop them up in the same manner we did the pak hanmin after all thats one of the main reasons i agreed to go into this partnership right now i need this man five star pacific is cashpoor t y chungs capital is a blessing but all marriages must end and when this one does i want to be on the winning end perhaps after all he said i can prevail upon sharktooth tung to have lunch with us sometime next week splendid t y chung said sir john bluestone glanced down into the metal bowl he rubbed his hands together i do believe our meal is now at the proper degree of drunkenness so saying he reached in and plucking up a dazzled prawn bit off its head with great relish he began to munch in earnest on the tender white flesh formidable sung the of hong kongs ik was a busy man that was only to be expected since he was the leader of the crown colonys largest and most powerful triad for years the ik had fought a pitched and bloody battle with the shanghainese green pang triad through hong kongs twisting streets for control of the colony an uneasy stalemate of sorts had been broken by jake who went in search of formidable sung a month or so after he had been assigned to head the quarrys hong kong station what jake had proposed was a mutual protection and assistance pact between the k and the members of the quarry and their families the idea was for the members of formidable sungs triad to keep the quarry agents and their families safe within the precincts of their homes in return he promised to pass on any intelligence directly affecting the triad that came the quarrys way six months after the k under the direction of sung had begun their quarry liaison the balance of power began to swing inexorably in their direction as a result a strong friendship had sprung up between jake and the triad leader sung pohan was the youngest anyone could remember within the triad hence he had been renamed formidable he had done more for the reorganization of the triad in his first seven years of tenure so it was said than had been accomplished in the previous seven decades that meant a schedule that would have crippled most other men within a year but as busy as he was he always made time for jake maroc from their very first meeting formidable sung had been impressed with jake though he had taken pains not to show his feelings to jakes face that would have put him in a disadvantageous bargaining position jake had looked for him first at his office in the toy factory he had been referred here formidable sung involved in many businesses had a number of offices around the colony now as jake was ushered into the office off a tiny side street in wanchai formidable sung stood up he wore an armband it was white the chinese color of mourning they bowed to each other across a space of not more than five feet my condolences mr maroc in the colony among chinese as well as among the gwai loh there was unyielding formality between business associates i am happy that you are looking so much better than when we last were together but i am sad as well i heard about the unfortunate and untimely demise of your wife dew neh loh moh on all russians and especially on all of their fornicating agents thank you honorable sung jakes head was still bowed i appreciate your concern it is without exaggeration the concern of all k in this locality formidable sung said fiercely let one dungeating kgb agent reveal himself to us and he will be squashed like the insect piddle he is it is good to know that one has such loyal friends jake said lifting his head up a mi tuo fo these are evil days first your honorable tai tai then david oh the honorable oh was well known to us formidable sung shook his head sagely friends are important during the best of times but in bad weather they are to be treasured unlike taels of gold however friends sometimes have a way of reversing themselves yes jake knew he had the others attention david oh it seems was not murdered by kgb agents chinese werent they terrible terrible jake nodded especially so since these chinese were agents of the quarry in the outer office someone was typing up a storm the tapping was abruptly distinct in the heavy silence my dear mr maroc formidable sung said if this is the case i fear we are being presented with something of an enigma only temporarily jake said david oh solved it and so will i given a little time someone deep inside the quarry has turned against it oh dear jake almost laughed formidable sung sounded like an old woman but there was nothing amusing about the situation and they both knew it dew neh loh moh on all traitors formidable sung spat into one corner to show the seriousness of his curse spies are like rabid dogs in the street infecting all who come close to them who is to be trusted nowadays he clucked his tongue foul weather indeed yes jake agreed we must both be on our guard i am on the run from my own organization what certainly i am their next target then by all means we will take you off the streets i know a place jake held up the palm of his hand a thousand thanks honorable sung but such an imposition is not necessary nonsense friends are friends true friends know the nature of their obligations they do not turn their coats inside out with the changes in the wind undoubtedly so jake said but i cannot afford to go to ground now there is however another way in which you might help me formidable sung spread his hands anything my friend explain to me why nichiren comes to hong kong in the breathless moment after jake had uttered those words formidable sung saw how neatly he had been trapped why would i know anything about that because jake said completing the trap nichiren comes here to see you formidable sung felt no anger rather he was filled with admiration what a chinese heart this man has he thought if i had any sense i would hire him as my chief negotiator at the summit nichiren perhaps sees many people in hong kong i am just one jake had no time for this fencing but he knew he had no choice in the matter formidable sung had never in his life told anyone anything he knew was important to him without exacting a price negotiation the chinese never felt anything was worthwhile without it the trick here jake knew was to divine what the wished in return and offer him something of less value then it would become a question of who needed what the most it seems to me jake said now that your triad has lately run afoul of the police in stanley is the hyeung yau the fragrant grease insufficient to protect you great pool of piddle mckenna is the new chief there australians are always difficult to get at right away well wear him down jake shrugged perhaps eventually but its a gamble and in the meantime how many taels are you losing day to day not enough to bother about there was just the right note of nonchalance in his voice jake tried another possibility how is the godown war going fornicating green pang theyre nothing more than a nuisance well take care of them he said this with even greater ease so jake thought this is the one thats really a thorn in his side jake waited a minute then said this information on nichiren is important to me honorable sung the was shaking his head confidences honorable maroc you would ask me to betray confidences jake was reminded of his conversation with bliss this morning between friends he said anything is possible formidable sung nodded even doors with locks can be opened with the right key true even recalcitrant australians can be persuaded by old friends you and great pool of piddle friends i can hardly believe that ive known him since he was a corporal formidable sung scratched behind his ear well i dont think we can do business there really to be honest were on to something with him i dont want to deprive myself of the pleasure of presenting it to him which little boy is it this time ah i see you do know him formidable sung spread his hands again well some intelligence is too dear for anyone to afford jake smiled but not because mckennas distasteful predilection was about to put him under the ks thumb i suppose youd like the godown war to end id also like to win every race at happy valley for a week but one often has to settle for the possible suppose i make it possible formidable sung tapped his forefinger against his lips truly honorable maroc i do not see how this can be done but jake had fired something within the if i can bring an end to the godown war formidable sung was thinking i will be the hero at our summit the day after tomorrow i will have gained immeasurable face his confidence soared he made a decision i accept your proposal under one condition the war must end within thirtysix hours agreed agreed formidable sung grinned when he did so he became a different person perhaps a hint of the old pohan peeped out then the freespirited even somewhat wild teenager who had sought out the triad society as a substitute family his father had been a stern and unforgiving businessman who found it impossible to say a kind word to any of his sons he had believed that contention strife and most importantly angerhe would say the control of itwere the most important molders of a young mans character sung pohan had disagreed with him violently enough for him never to want to return within the precincts of the k he had found that he was quickly rewarded for his agile mind and his strong arm he had risen quickly within the triad hierarchy now it was his only family tea is brewing he said then lunch one cannot satisfactorily speak of important matters on an empty stomach as you well know jake nodded weve had many memorable meals together a sign of trust in this uncertain world heya jake tried to make himself relax just so in his minds eye he conjured up a wei qi board lian jie liaisons were being madethat is stones of the same color in a line opposing stones were chi eaten as these liaisons surrounded them depriving them of their breaths further dan guan routes that encircled a territory by means of liaisons were forming his eyes snapped open the only problem was he did not know the identities of the contending forces he was on one side that was the only certainty at first it had appeared that nichiren was his opponent now it was the mole buried deep inside the quarry were the two linked at first glance it seemed likely since nichiren had managed to spirit mariana away and take jakes fu shard but then the kgb had arrived in tsurugi in an attempt to terminate him then at kamisakas nichiren had failed to show and further had left his piece of the fu for jake why was it a peace offering it came back to nichiren honorable sung jake said about our bargain ah yes formidable sung put down his teacup as soon as i have proof of your pledge i will provide you with what you desire thats a day and a half away jake said keeping his anger carefully in check patience bliss had counseled only if you take that long to stop the godown war formidable sung smiled it is up to you honorable maroc jake was about to respond when the door burst open bliss came in followed by three or four triad members you were followed here she said a little breathlessly it took me this long to find a way in here without alerting them jake rose how many three mr maroc i think honorable sung our lunch will have to be postponed until we complete our bargain he looked around the room how many ways out of here three two above ground one beneath jake chose the tunnel antony beridien was dying frame by frame as the videotape was advanced in super slomo life drifted out of him in infinitesimal increments movements were slowed to such an extent that a single eyeblink took several seconds to complete christ on a crutch maroc wunderman said maroc is taking his revenge on us donovan stirred he sat as a kid would his legs crossed ankle on knee his fingertips tapped the toe of his topsider he was wearing a blueandgreen striped ralph lauren polo shirt and khaki polished cotton hiking shorts the two of them were sitting in the leadinsulated room one hundred fifty feet below the basement of the quarry building in washington they were within a heartbeat of the white house the president had viewed the tape he had made his decision it was like wartime but only wunderman was old enough to remember what that was like they had viewed this unfolding scene a dozen times here was wunderman pushing the doctor away bending over beridien in slomo there was no intelligible sound they had to return to speed for that wundermans hand had disappeared inside his jacket with excruciating slowness he drew out the gun shot the doctor in the face blam blam blam blood and gore all over the place the wall behind her coated with bits of skull and her exploding brains donovan swiveled in his chair youre the boss now henry you dont have to answer this but ill ask it anyway why did you shoot to kill if it had been me id have wanted to interrogate her get some answers now we have none wunderman passed a hand across his eyes dug in for a moment i dont know how to answer that question it was instinctive i guess i realized what she had done to antony after all our added precautions i hadnt slept in three days worrying about security this was the last place ah whats the use i have no good explanation rage frustration the blind need for revenge i understand all that henry donovan said softly but your training should have restrained you youre a thirtysevenyear veteran this never should have happened the whole goddamned thing never should have happened wunderman cried damn jake maroc donovan stood up and stretched he turned off the vcr and the room glowed with indirect rose light maybe not maroc at all what do you mean our iceberg vorkuta vorkuta yes i think shes a distinct possibility the doctor might have been a soviet sleeper one who got through our vetting process its happened before at central trashies not here never here are our procedures so different from the cias wunderman grunted thats not your area so you wouldnt know but yes theyre much different frankly i think jake would have had a better chance of getting to the doctor than vorkuta would have donovan fished in a pocket pushed a communications flimsy across to donovan it was pale yellow indicating that its origin was inside the soviet union from my most recent monitoring of that new polar cipher network donovan said as wunderman began to read the decoded report i think wed better find out more about this kam sang project the communist chinese are working on why i already know about it its a joint project with western firms based in hong kong what could be going on there plenty donovan said at least plenty that we dont know about as the flimsy points out the kgbs just gotten word from a worker at kam sang by accident he stumbled on a restricted area naturally he thought it was part of the atomic pile for power generation then a squad of chinese army soldiers converged on him and he spent the next eighteen hours in solitary being interrogated wunderman shrugged nothing too sinister about that any kind of a leak in that area could endanger millions of civilians true enough donovan said but this guy was interrogated by a pair of intelligence colonels what does that tell you that it wasnt a routine security matter nothing about kam sang is routine henry nothing is what it seems on that project you think theres a military component to kam sang if there is wed damn well better find out about it before the russians do with this more aggressive attitude theyve been taking of late in asia the slightest sign of escalated retaliation on chinas part would set the spark for a major confrontation wunderman scrubbed his face with his palm ive got a bastard of a headache yeah donovan said i know what you mean and ive got a feeling its going to get worse before it gets better zhang hua almost passed out while leaving the office he saw a sweep of cyclists rushing by below him at the foot of the steps and lost all equilibrium it had been an incredibly hot humid day and shi zilins offices had been stifling zhang hua took three tottering steps to the metal banister and sat down heavily the concrete burned his flesh inside his trousers he was hyperventilating and he knew it im just not cut out for this life he thought holding his head below him the cyclists whirled by in dusty clouds on their way home the daily beijing marathon they blurred into gray wisps of smoke as he watched he felt his heart beating too fast and his gorge rose at the thought of having to meet with wu aiping again zhang hua was so terrified that he had given up sleep as a state of being far beyond his present lowly abilities exalted slumber was for the gods and buddha knew he was only one frightened man ive forgotten my briefcase he thought woodenly in a moment he forced himself to stand and on wobbly legs return up the steps back to shi zilins office he felt as if he were split into two parts his brain was on fire he could no longer remember which lies he had to tell to which person he wanted to crawl into a cave and disappear for a decade or so he was as white as a ghost as he drifted back into the office he sat muddleheaded while shi zilin fetched him cool tea he drank thirstily and almost immediately felt better he became aware of shi zilin peering at him from close range the old man had pulled up a chair and they now sat practically knee to knee he felt himself shaking as if with the ague and wondered idly if he was actually ill is there anything i can do old friend zhang hua put his head back what was he to say to that i want to end all this deceit he wanted to cry out but he could not he thought of wu aiping and he could not he closed his eyes and sighed a little it is nothing comrade minister the heat nothing at all i see zilin continued to study him what we have to do every day is difficult we all have our duty zhang hua duty is what we survive on for you perhaps something snapped inside zhang hua you who were born to the gods his eyes flew open and they were as wild as a firepanicked horses but not for me i am only a poor mortal i have nerves that fray teeth that clench a stomach twisted into knots i have a mind that refuses to shut down and let me sleep because this is so i feel this terrible burden is crushing me into the ground i am not the celestial guardian of china i am not jian zilin looked at his friend he thought of three oaths tsuns words a mi tuo fo look what your obsession has done to them my family jian i might be zilin thought but i am mortal the cold pain in my bones tells me that if nothing else the burden of separation from my family is something for which i could not have planned if i had known then of the pain it would bring me could i have done what i did youth made my mind strong my righteousness brought me through the trial of fire leaving my women and my sons far behind me but i was raw then despite my supposed sophistication i had been witness to but a fraction of the atrocities man will perpetrate on his fellow man forgive me comrade minister zhang hua said his head lying limply against the chairback i cannot think in this heat after all our years together you are allowed to speak your mind old friend zilin leaned to his right wiped a forefinger along the windowsill it came away with a lightcolored coating not dust sand from the gobi desert on the far side of the great wall he rubbed the sand across his palm feeling its abrading quality at this moment seeing zhang hua so close to a breakdown hearing three oaths tsuns words in his mind knowing how he had lost two daughtersinlaw fearing that now that his two sons were together in the same city the one fine edge of which three oaths tsun had spoken would bring about the destruction of either or both was even the prospect of the ren worth that risk if i can so callously risk their deaths he wondered now can i be any better than the bloodthirsty kinsmen whom i abhor men who have a vision and sacrifice all their humanity to obtain their power and their pitiful concept of immortality the state i have seen the state change firsthand because i have been the creator of that change but after i am gone will it all devolve into this same dust as it did for those who came before me sand from the gobi it was here before i was born it will be here still long after i am gone is this what i spent fifty years of my life searching for sand dust of the ages colorless featureless is this the sole substance of my life the end product of my ren my harvest no no it cannot be who would be foolish enough to harvest sand not the jian of china zilin thought certainly not him tell me three chinese she said ones in gray slacks dark blue striped shirt hes got a scar on his cheek the seconds just walking away from him now slight wiry wearing a white muscle shirt and black jeans the thirds across from them older ears like a bat brown slacks pale green sport shirt got em he said they were headhigh to the sidewalk hidden in the dankness of the subterranean alley into which formidable sungs passageway had debouched jake could smell the vestiges of dried fish and urine garbage was piled everywhere it would help to know whos behind all this bliss said as it is if we slip these therell only be more david oh knew but he didnt tell you he told me as much as he was able jake said huo yan the movable eye but thats a strategy in wei qi whats that got to do with the person who wants to kill you i dont know jake admitted he was watching the three men redeploy themselves they were seasoned professionals all right but david knew what he was doing if he had discovered something inside the quarry he would have made a hard copy of it since he didnt have it with him when he was killed its logical to assume he hid it somewhere but where thats the puzzle huo yan trouble is that doesnt ring a bell it should mean something to me but it doesnt meanwhile weve got to get to venerable chen without any ticks tagging along why do we need to see the of the green pang jake told her quickly about the deal he had cut with formidable sung now i know youre insane she said after what you did to help the k triad youre lucky venerable chen hasnt cut off your legs now youre going to ask him for a favor yeah it does seem an impossible task on the surface she snorted impossible any way you cut it lets just say i like challenges bliss looked at him just as long as you dont have a death wish if i did id be walking straight out into the street he had not taken his eyes off the three chinese they had taken up stations along wing cheung street using the striped shadows within which to curl like nocturnal predators they all possessed that quality of extraordinary stillness so rare in a human but so necessary for their trade the thing is to get them to move he said after a time in motion lies confusion right now theyve got the whole morrison hill area down like a gridwork map well never lose them unless we get them into violent motion as long as its not too violent he gave her a silent laugh looked down to the opposite end of the alley i already checked it bliss said dead end were in a box it depends on how you look at it jake said eyeing the piles of garbage you carrying matches sure why planning a nice quiet smoke while those three close in on us jake ignored her sarcasm go light up those bags of garbage will you bliss took a hard look at them i dont think theyre dry enough to give off much in the way of flames jake nodded thats just what im hoping for bliss waited a moment working it through then crouching she crossed the alley struck a light within the cupped palm of her hand she went through halfadozen matches until she got it going then abruptly there was a great deal of smoke it stank so much it made them cough but it was thick enough and noticeable the two younger men muscles and scarface slipped through the shadows passing through darkness and light crossing wing cheung street you know the swim building off oi kwan road he whispered and when bliss nodded he said if we get separated thats where we meet east side the zincfaced door muscles and scarface came cautiously down into the alley they did it well one behind the other point and backup jake went into scarface low bringing him down in a tumble he felt bliss highjumping over the tangle slamming muscles high he went down but twisting grabbed her arm so that she fell heavily onto her left hip she stifled a cry and jake swinging the point of his shoe into scarfaces throat leaned forward chopping with the callused edge of his hand the kite caught muscles in the nerve plexus just above and to the left of his right kidney it took all the breath out of him and bliss was up and running with jake just behind her full out down wing cheung street past batear taking a hard right onto oi kwan road it described a roughly hexagonal path around morrison hill and the buildings of the swimming pool seeing the structures lit up jake veered away into the shadows walls rose up all around him as he made his careful way to the east side of morrison hill and the zincfaced door nestled against the concrete wall jake allowed his breath to return to normal he still felt slightly dizzy whenever he ran or was subject to violent motion he kept his gaze on that door his ears open for the slightest sound of pursuit humidity condensed on the rough painted concrete wept against his skin beneath his thin shirt the buzzing of the cicadas was a metallic wash jake searched in the bottom of his trousers pocket opened up the paper clip he took a deep breath and silently rushed the open space between the wall and the door put the end of the clip in the lock and went to work he was sweating more than usual and he was aware that the fear factor was high he was totally unprotected here heard the snap of the lock and pushed the door inward just then he heard a tiny rustling from over his head he tensed bending his knees to gain momentum and broke concentration just in time as bliss slipped down from the eaves angry with himself because he should have felt her presence he pushed her inside closed the door after them echoes the whisper of a vast emptiness stretching away the thick chemical stench of chlorine darkness jake took her by the hand edging her through the locker room they sat on an unpainted wooden bench this isnt smart she said theyll find us here we would have had more of a chance on the rooftops the moonlights too bright jake said softly there are a lot of ways out of here on a roof the streets a long way down shhh i hear something jake strained his ears nerves she pulled at him lets go they went quickly out the other end of the locker room the soft lapping of the water was distinct breaking up the silence into discrete segments jake felt a presence behind him and whirled just in time to feel something slam into him he went off the edge the pool was cold and dark the water so devoid of tight seemed inordinately heavy pressing in on his chest like a fist fought the bare arms and knew it was muscles he kicked out violently and they went down into the deep end tumbling end over end until pressure filled his ears with insects incessant clamor muscles must have been used to this slowmotion combat waterdrag on all limbs got a stranglehold around jakes throat and refused to let go darkness descended into a dreadful night airless and as chili as a morgue tried two atemi percussion blows with his elbow muscles only tightened his hold bubbles flew from the corners of his grinning mouth fire in jakes lungs and he began to fight in earnest the instinct to inhale his head was aching the edge of the concussion insinuating itself on him again and he knew he had little time using a mantis jake extended his arms forward moving into the hold rather than away from it this made it necessary for muscles to move with him coming forward jake used the motion combining his momentum with muscles twisting to the right and as he did so straightening his right arm using it as a battering ram against his assailants left side used the heel of his hand massing the power from his shoulders and pectorals allowing a straight line through his arm and into his hand felt the ribs give heard nothing but the rushing of blood in his ears clenched his teeth now in order not to open his mouth and gulp water raised his right arm and slammed it down hard onto the point of muscles shoulder the socket collapsing his strength enormous even through the drag of the water the body slipping away from him and jake kicking powerfully upward with his legs rushing to the surface in a welter of bubbles sucking in air in deep bursts he swam to the side of the pool and dripping levered himself from the water jake turned into the muzzle of batears automatic i should blow your brains out right now just the slightest instant when he became more interested in jake than he was in bliss a fatal mistake jake watched as bliss translated motionlessness into motion the blur she became cracked down on batears catching him between targets he wanted to squeeze the trigger on jake but he sensed the acuteness of the danger batears was in the process of swinging around to meet it when bliss tramped hard on his instep pinning him his motionlessness left him helpless as she slammed the sole of her shoe into the partly turned crease of his knee kneecap and shinbone splintered batears let forth a piercing scream echoing in the vastness of the pool room as she hit the kidney meridian his splash was heavy wavelets came up over the side inundating their feet jake was still panting for a long moment they stared into each others eyes this was the first time either had seen what the other could do in a violent situation the moment was certain to stay with them for the rest of their lives seven minutes later they were on hennessy road though disheveled they did their best to look just like all the other windowshoppers crowding the wanchai streets jake used the shop windows as mirrors to give him a sense of what was going on behind them and parallel to them across the street they joined a long queue the third bus that came was a number and they swung aboard it was one of the crimson doubledeckers with an open rear egress that many chinese used to sneak aboard at the last minute when the conductor was otherwise occupied its a long trip bliss said we might as well go upstairs but jake shook his head were getting off before cotton tree drive if we havent shaken them i want to know it before we take the peak tram im not about to lead them to your apartment they stood in the crowded lower level and as the bus proceeded making its stops they inched their way unobtrusively toward the rear he did not have to tell her that he wanted to be near the rear exit when their stop came they went onto queensway heading toward central district the bus changed to an inner lane began to brake two stops farther on was cotton tree drive jake took a quick look around not only to orient himself one last time but also to fix in his memory those within lunging distance of him bliss was just in front of him standing at the edge of the steep steps down to the exit jakes quick but encompassing glance had taken in a fat middleaged chinese woman two chinese teenagers with slickedback hair and dark glasses a slim businessman carrying an expensive leather attache case he was european or possibly australian a young chinese woman carrying a baby wrapped in a pink blanket in one arm holding on to her fouryearold son with the other hand a pair of thickset chinese in slacks and shortsleeved silk shirts a young american girl with pretty eyes and a noticeable case of acne the bus slowed to a stop several people climbed aboard through the front entrance no one wanted to get out jake took a look at the line of people filing onto the bus when no one was left on the sidewalk he nudged bliss immediately she went down the rear stairs jake followed after her jake saw her step off and at that moment a chinese teenager ran out from the crowd swinging onto the bus hoping for a free ride he ran right into jake who by that time was halfway down the steps dew neh loh moh jake shouted out of my way the kid froze stunned at the same moment jake felt a fierce tug from behind him he whirled and was astonished to find the chinese mother she had abandoned her little boy who was he saw in a flash probably not hers at all for the baby she carried so tightly wrapped in the pink blanket was in fact a lyson ty the minimachine pistol manufactured expressly for the quarry her hand was beneath the blanket closed around the pressuresensitive trigger lever at close range he could see the anger in her eyes jake estimated she could be no more than twentyone or twentytwo the bus lurched as it started up everyone shifted to compensate for the force of acceleration in that moment jake grabbed hold of the chinese teenager and swung him into the woman she kicked out instinctively and the kid went down on his hands and knees jake lifted his free elbow slamming the barrel of the lyson to one side behind him the kid bounced down the stairs tumbling onto the road bliss who had begun to run after the bus smashed into him scraping the heel of her palm and one knee on the macadam she got up running again quickly jake turned his full attention on the quarry agent the lyson swung downward the muzzle scoring a line from his temple to just beyond the extreme edge of his eye socket blood welled up temporarily blinding him he was immediately dizzy the blow bringing back whatever vestiges still remained of his concussion he staggered felt the lyson come away from him he did not need his eyesight to know what that meant desperately he reached out for her grabbing on to the haft of the machine pistol both of them were oblivious to the screams from the nearby passengers the girl divining his intent pushed violently forward with the lyson so that it slammed into him underneath his chin he gagged and choking went down on all fours in doing so he fell as the chinese teenager had before him down the steps the girl followed him bending her knees and bringing the lyson down to the aim position she got the aluminum stock against her side she was at such close range there was no need to sight jake was all too familiar with the lysons muzzle velocity and its roundpersecond capacity he knew that if he allowed her to pull the trigger there wouldnt be much of him left intact to bounce along the road the only hope for him now was jowaza he was in the wrong position and the weapon facing him was a machine pistol rather than a staff or a katana but he had no other choice he slammed into her oncoming shin with the arch of his foot lifting his upper torso painfully as he did so the essential thing was to get his right hand between hers as she held the lyson she would be looking out for that so he had distracted her first with the kickfeint as she reacted his left arm shot out his fist closing over the barrel of the lyson on his knees he twisted sharply to the right in the severely limited space of the exit well continuing to use her forward momentum against her he drew her toward him by twisting himself back to the left at the same time he rotated his fist turning the lyson from the horizontal to the vertical now he had pulled her two steps down into the well she was at his level completing the jowaza jake simultaneously rose up and bent forward taking her down with him but she surprised him she let go the lyson mounting an immediate double kite to his exposed left side he grunted in pain threw the lyson out the exit that gave her enough time to deliver a hard blow to the side of his head he careened into the steel wall of the exit his head was ringing through the haze he knew that he had misjudged her believing the jowaza sufficient to subdue her she crowded in on him and he collapsed down another step then another until he was crumpled on the bottom step he was two feet from the blurred macadam of the road the steel toe of her shoe shot into his thigh and now he was half off the bottom step the girl crouched over him pummeling him with lightning blows that sent shock waves of agony through him he could not breathe he could not see he could barely think blindly he attacked her face she blocked him easily and through her gritted teeth he thought he heard a gurgling laugh got a handful of her blouse while she was doing that and bent her far forward over him his other arm was still high where he had allowed her to take it with her block his fist crashed down onto the bridge of her flat nose where it bisected her eyes the force of gravity and momentum along with his strength combining to crush the cartilage immediately she could not catch her breath a torrent of blood poured from the wound jake jammed a thumbinto her eye pressing his fingers against the side of her face he slammed it against the wells steel wall he felt himself tipping over the edge of the bus diesel exhaust billowed up from beneath the bus he made one last attempt to arrest his fall and failed tightening his grip on the quarry agent he tumbled out the back of the bus pushing her under him to break his fall he heard a snap then another as they made contact with the macadam their momentum spun them end over end he heard the heavy squeal of brakes the sounds of cursing a long string of cantonese then he got his breath back he was lying by the side of the road halfstunned someone was kneeling over him but he was aware of a large knot of people hovering in the middle of the road like a gigantic bundle of flies let me through he thought he was imagining her voice let me through please im a doctor someone moved slightly away and he saw bliss crouched over him buddha you look a mess she whispered then in a loud voice just keep back please give him room to breathe i want to get up he told her she put her hands beneath him and they did it together jake felt a brief wave of nausea racing through him he closed his eyes for a moment licked his dry cracked lips are you okay he nodded that was a mistake it set off an intense wave of dizziness in him despite that he got to his feet he could taste blood it was all over him he wondered whether it was his or hers his head hurt and he put his hand up to his temple the kid all right nothing serious bliss said in his ear he could feel her supporting him what about the girl he asked is that what she was he turned his head in the direction bliss was looking the knot of black flies was looser now and he could see through their legs to the misshapen lump lying twisted and broken on the macadam behind her was a long smear silver and scintillating like tinsel in the harsh highway lights lots of blood bliss said they both heard the sirens at the same time lets get out of here jake said and then wed damn well better make sure were clear before we go home he seemed out of breath again and he waited panting as he limped with her arm around his waist into the concealing darkness past the corner to brightly lit admiralty centre your house is getting to be the only safe place in the colony early morning was given over to a formal tour of the serbsky institutes newly completed psychosensory wing the institute was a potent arm of the sluzhba housing many of the most important political prisoners and in its softer roomsdefectors from the west the purpose of the institute was to probe the minds of these dissidents and turncoats to discover the truth what they believed whom they knew of what networks they were cognizant whether or not they were who they claimed to be and so on the doctors at the institute spent a lifetime devising new ways to penetrate to the shadowy depths of the human mind the new section had been named the andropov wing by karpov who had led the twoandahalfyear fight for appropriations from the kremlin it contained the most sophisticated and highly advanced digital hallucolography equipment at the soviets disposal a good deal of it highly experimental this tour of the site of karpovs newest triumph would have been hollow had not he invited daniella to accompany him they were met by a committee of three behavioral psychotherapists everything at the institute was done by committee they were fanatical about security here the embarrassing theft of the visiting commissars fur hats from the kgb offices last winter could never have occurred here these doctors all held the military rank of lieutenant colonel or above they appeared a very formal dour lot it seemed the seriousness of their work had left its mark upon them silently they escorted the two generals through deliberately antiseptic anterooms down long corridors gleaming with stainless steel and copper through highceilinged laboratories filled with banks of computerized hardware bristling with dials toggle switches faders lit up by colorcoded pinlights past the laboratories were the doctors lounges it was explained that though three shifts of physicians and lab technicians were assigned doctors often stayed through many shifts if they were working on a difficult patient in that event they would use the lounge for an hours catnap when they could another corridor this one was constructed of rough concrete painted a dull institutional gray harsh fluorescent light hurt the eyes as it created lurid purple shadows of the tour groups passage a doublelocked chromium steel and wirereinforced glass door opened on pneumatic seals by a pair of mudeyed guards with pistols prominently displayed on their hips here were the holding cells the committee explained they stopped before one of a series of leadlined steel doors it looked like the entrance to a bank vault the cells were escapeproof we took the designer into one and locked him up said one member of the committee a week later we opened the cell door he was dead then we were assured of the cells absolute security the members of the committee laughed it seemed to be an ofttold joke the generals continued their tour they were told that the andropov wing contained a number of different kinds of cells depending on the nature of the prisoner and his or her disposition there were the socalled soft rooms reserved for defecting members of foreign espionage and diplomatic services pastelpainted walls lushly upholstered furniture and opulent wall hangings all made the place seem part of a western luxury hotel they are brought here a member of the committee said as they went inside because we can make one of two assumptions about them either they are genuine in their change of political heart and will help us to the best of their ability or they have been planted on us in which case it is to our benefit to catch them off guard they moved on to another section of the holding area here we have a hard room another member of the committee took over the generals looked inside here was a stone cell with a thick wooden board inserted partway into the wall as a bleak and uncomfortable pallet there was a hole in the stone flooring the most primitive of toilets look upward the generals directed their gaze as instructed the high ceiling painted an almost blinding white was studded with floodlights the committee member snapped his fingers and they were bathed in an awesome and painful onrush of incandescent light it helps to do this the committee member said snapping his fingers again so that the lights went off at sixminute intervals our extensive research has shown us that that time interval is perfect for interrupting the human sleep pattern and for causing the maximum amount of psychic anxiety in the subject they stepped out of the room resumed their walk down the drab hallway the odd fluorescent lighting was disconcerting after the demonstration and karpov took his wirerimmed spectacles out of his breast pocket hooked them on he disliked wearing them but he felt uncomfortable with the black spots in front of his eyes now we come to the crowning achievement of the andropov wing still another member of the committee had taken over another gleaming steel door was opened and the five of them stepped into a room that on first inspection was identical to the soft room settees fabriccovered chairs rugs bookcases pleasant pastoral paintings the walls were a pleasing shade of pale peach this is a cell for our most recalcitrant prisoner the ideological traitor the committee member intoned for many years this particular kind of dissident was simply put to death in the basement of lubyanka after a short and fruitless interrogation session nowadays we have more modern methods of handling such people karpov frowned i dont understand certainly comrade general the committee member said a demonstration has been planned please sit down he indicated a reproduction of a gilt louis xiv chair karpov sat and the doctor snapped his fingers steel bands snapped into place over the generals wrists and ankles what is this a roaring filled karpovs ears the wall directly across from him began to crumble and a surge of water rumbled impossibly toward him at the same time the bookcase dissolved into a tentacled creature that humped swiftly across the floor to encircle his ankles the rugs were shredding before his eyes until a raft of coiling serpents their wedgeshaped heads lifted and pointing in his direction came slithering toward him the striped settee was a tiger roaring as it caught sight of him he tried to free himself but he could not i cant stand restraints you must not but he never finished the sentence for the room canted over on an angle spilling him in his chair into its lowest corner sprawled with his back against the wall he groped in vain for his spectacles which had been dislodged by his fall now he felt the pressure of the ocean against his chest and as he did so the light in the room turned aqueous water continued spilling into the room through the rent in the wall he felt cold and wet though when he reached out his trembling hand he could not be certain whether he encountered water or air within the water now swam the various creatures of the sea sharks and giant squid stingrays and barracuda it was the stuff of nightmares karpov opened his mouth to scream but cold water bitingly salty filled it up his eyes were rolling wildly his brain refused to function he vomited alt over himself in the adjacent room fitted with oneway glass daniella watched this gruesome spectacle so this is hallucolography yuri lantin said he moved out of the shadows to stand beside her from here it doesnt look like much you cant really appreciate its true worth unless youre in there with it daniella said the subject becomes the center of the imagegeneration field lantin grunted our friend general karpov seems to be getting the message with such a simultaneous allout assault on the five senses the committee member explained it is not surprising the holograms generated by our new laserimager are far beyond anything we have been able to come up with before this believe me inside that room they are real daniella and lantin their gazes fixed on general karpovs cringing frame could only agree but our true breakthroughs have come with the olfactory and tactile stimulators the human brain has learned that the eyes can be tricked but it cannot cope with the same thing being done to the other senses all at once on the other side on the threeinch pane of glass karpov was trying to curl up into a fetal ball his powerful muscles strained against the steel bands until he bled it was clear even though the microphones in the room had been turned off for the moment that he was weeping uncontrollably even while he was gagging lantin paid him no attention whatsoever he was looking at daniella thinking hed never before encountered so desirable a woman what he told her was you were right you know i could never have asked karpovs wife to dredge up his secrets sometimes the most extreme measures are the only effective ones still it takes guts to follow through with them what i believe the americans call true grit daniella saw his eyes burning with lust for her and for the first time in her life she felt embarrassment at such sexual outpouring in this setting with karpov going slowly insane just a pane of glass away with these three behavioral psychotherapists grouped a foot away as cold as their arcane machines lantins intimate emotion struck her as obscene it made her think again of the sexual drug he had offered her and of which she had willingly partaken i must destroy him she thought if only to save myself thus the two of them their secret selves locked within the ringing silence of their skulls stared through the window that the doctors of the serbsky institute had obligingly provided into a hell neither of them could have imagined on the other side of the small room the committee members continued to monitor the increasingly erratic life functions of general anatoly decidovitch karpov cocommander of the hungarian revolt occupation forces hero of the ukraine uprising of patriot of the revolution andrew sawyer was at the ghost wedding the sam ku had set with the hu family when he found his world crashing down all around him it was odd how it happened truly odd because it was the last thing on his mind his thoughts had been wholly with miki and her ghosthusbandtobe the hu family was large seven sons and six daughters the eighth son duncan had died in an accident when he was six a careening car driven by a motorist with one too many ounces of liquor inside him the sam ku that peter ng had found had put sawyer and the hus together the spirits of their dead children cried out for a happiness denied them in the corporeal world sawyer liked the hus immediately they radiated a warmth and goodwill he found invigorating the pain in his heart that had stayed with him ever since miki had come to him in the dream had at last begun to fade as he and the hus had discussed the exchange of wedding gifts these would consist of clothes electronic household items a kingsized bedall miniatures made out of paper they also agreed upon the amount of the dowry payable in hell banknotes that sawyer bought at a shop specializing in such arcane paraphernalia the sam ku chose the taoist temple on ladder street in the islands western district the day and the hour were important also she had informed him here before an altar specially prepared by the sam ku she began her incantations aimed at the brightly clothed paper dolls representing the bride and groom grouped around them were models of all the gods and goddesses of hell who in their witnessing of the ceremony gave their blessing to the couple incense filled the air with clouds of orange smoke the ritual complex and totally impenetrable to sawyer ground on hour after hour until those in attendance felt giddy with the incessant drone of the unfamiliar words magic was afoot even a gwai loh such as andrew sawyer could feel it stealing along the wooden floorboards with the billowing of the incense and the sam kus litany after a time it felt to sawyer as if the old womans words had taken on a life of their own as if she were not actually speaking but only now opened her mouth for the words like threedimensional objects to issue forth of their own volition it was as if the spirit of his miki and the hus duncan dwelled now within the sam kus convoluted incantation toward the end of the ceremony sawyer was certain that he glimpsed miki within the billowing shadows of the temples towering interior grown up and smiling at him as she linked her arm with that of a strong handsome young man idiotically he pointed the kodak disc camera he had brought with him and squeezed off a shot it was when he was standing immobile on the steps in front of the temple at ceremonys end taking a picture of the hus that he caught a glimpse of a hurrying peter ng sawyer was stunned he had sent ng across the harbor to tsim sha tsui in kowloon on important business that would take all day to conclude what then was peter doing rushing up ladder street on his way to hollywood road it had taken jake and bliss all morning and most of the afternoon to locate venerable chens whereabouts jake was on his own in this for obvious reasons the quarrys facilities were off limits to him and because the rivalries between triads were so intense the ks conduits came up with nothing but dead ends naturally then it was bliss who got the break she had been making calls every half hour from public phone booths jake never asked her whom she was calling at a quarter after four she emerged from one such and said to him hes in macao macao why there thats not green pang territory apparently it is now she said twice a week he goes to the hotel partita hes got a piece of it fortyfive minutes on the jetfoil there were three ways to get to macao it just depended on how much of a rush you were in when jake and bliss were children there was only the ferry that took three hours the more recent hydrofoil took about an hour and a quarter the jetfoil the most recent addition to the hong kongmacao route was by far the quickest strapped into their airlinetype seats jake and bliss rode across the pearl river estuary toward the distant spot of land that was portuguese sovereign territory macao was unutterably seedy jake had often thought that if anthony burgess had set a clockwork orange in miami beach rather than england his vision of the worlds bleak future would look like macao the worlds most tenacious touts rimmed the landing quay the taxis were broken down the oncesmart hotels were shabby and flyblown as if they had not been cleaned since the s even the palm trees were dusty and listless despite what the guidebooks claimed there was nothing much for the tourist to see what drew the crowd of chinese were of course the casinos the only legal form of gambling in the crown colony was the horseracing at happy valley in macao almost all forms were legal the casinos were jammed day and night filled with the browngray fog of cigarette smoke the body odor of thousands of chinese hungry to lay down their money at fan tan sik po pai kau as well as the western games of roulette blackjack and craps the partita was a round pinkfaзaded affair just down the road from the sintra in places its stucco had faded to the color of an old undershirt it had been built in the s but jake doubted that it had had any charm even then now it resembled nothing more than a boil on a fat mans bottom they found venerable chen busy playing dice treasure sik po was played with three dice enclosed in a glass dome with an opaque cover his face was flushed with the fever of gambling and his round button eyes stared fixedly at the dome jake hung back on the edge of the throng even though he had a deadline to meet he was loath to interrupt venerable chen this was going to be a difficult enough confrontation as it was there was no sense in adding to it he took bliss upstairs where they had an indifferent portuguese meal outside the window the lowering sun beat upon the open sea with a sledgehammer fist they were the only customers in the restaurant everyone was in the casino even the beach was empty forty minutes later they returned to the casino venerable chen was just where he had been before he was wiping his sweating face with a handkerchief jake wondered where the challenge lay in winning from yourself as he watched the shanghainese he began to think there was nothing he could do to break the hard sheen of devotion to the dice put up like a mask over venerable chens face there are many ways into the enemy camp fo saan had counseled him time and again but only one that will enable you to emerge unscathed as usual fo saan was correct this was not a matter of getting venerable chens attention but rather of keeping it jake reached into his pocket put a roll of bills into bliss hand he looked into her eyes how are you at sik po he waited for them in the lounge it was a dark and gloomy place located on the mezzanine level he sat at a booth near enough the front to give him an excellent vantage point on comings and goings through the open archway jake could see the sightseeing counters so deserted that the clerks had begun playing mahjongg the rapid clickclickclick of the tiles traveled all the way into the lounge where jake leaning against the wall drank a club soda with lime he was unprepared for alcohol the place smelled of mildew and lost dreams in the twenty minutes he sat there alone three women two cantonese and one eurasian passed close enough to murmur their price all were overly made up as appealing as wax dummies on her second pass the waitress propositioned him her price at least was more reasonable he took another club soda instead jake saw them coming up the wide corkscrew stairs from the main floor he slid out of the booth and bowed formally as bliss brought venerable chen across the room i have heard of bizarre methods of introduction mr maroc but the one you have chosen is certainly the most intriguing if nothing else i have met this charming young woman wont you sit down the other nodded jake looked at bliss who nodded and went out it would not do to have her at this meeting jake might understand but venerable chen most assuredly would not in asia women had their place it was not in affairs of business venerable chens bright little eyes searched every fissure of jakes face it was as if he could divine the nature of this meeting there like a feng shut man reading the portents in the drift of the wind or the shape of the land mr maroc he said now after having declined jakes offer of a drink you have cost me a great deal of money manpower and face not to drink with a companion even if one was not thirsty was a deliberate affront it meant more clearly than any words could that this was not to be a friendly meeting now you have come across the pearl river estuary to seek me out i must say quite frankly that i cannot imagine what you might have to say to me but audacity even in a devious barbarian is to be acknowledged even if it is impossible to admire he seemed to have said his piece he folded his small hands one over the other as if compactness were a religion with him he seemed like a midget in his illfitting suit business is business jake said there was nothing personal in what i did i saw an advantage to be gained and i took it but honorable chen needs no explanation of the obvious but i do need an explanation of why you are here the shanghainese glanced pointedly at his watch jake was about to tell him when the wall of the lounge nearest them ballooned inward with a roar that shattered the glasses and bottles on the other side of the room bliss had seen the two taiwanese climbing up from the lower level of the casino she had remembered their faces from when she was playing sik po by venerable chens side what had interested her then was that they did no gambling upstairs in the main lobby one had stood at the foot of the curling staircase up to the mezzanine while the other began a slow and thorough circumnavigation of the area the first man had one hand on the wroughtiron handrail and bliss took a good look at it hard yellow callus covered the lower edge she ducked back just before he glanced upward though it was casual its sweep took in the entire angle open to him bliss moved along the mezzanine to another location with a better view she saw the second man return and speak quietly to the first together they came up the stairs bliss was on the verge of moving when she felt the fuzziness she associated with a nerve blockage she had just enough presence of mind to turn and saw a blurry face thought dew neh loh moh a third taiwanese and passed out the shattering of concrete glass and steel brought her around she groaned hanging her head to clear it of cobwebs then she got to her feet stumbling down the mezzanine smoke ash and concrete dust filled her lungs and she thought oh buddha jake there was a breathless moment after the first shock wave before the wall caved in just enough time for jake to grab venerable chen by the shirtfront and haul him underneath the overturned table the shield of the tabletop was what saved them as the wall broke apart hurling itself like a mighty fist into the lounge that and jakes reflexes the combination was not lost on the shanghainese mr maroc he said from his position curled inside jakes protective shell a barbarian you might be but you must also be part tiger your quickness is what saved us jake unwound himself from around him and they stood up plaster was still pattering down around them save for the wall and the immediate area around their table there was remarkably little damage to the lounges interior someone was screaming hysterically the waitress who had propositioned jake was on her knees rocking back and forth sobbing plaster dust had turned her hair as white as a greatgrandmothers venerable chen looked at the rubble a mi tuo fo one of us has dangerous enemies they could hear sirens wailing growing louder the shanghainese turned back to jake i wonder which one then he laughed what does it matter as long as our sacred members remain intact heya he shrugged insurance and hyeung yau mr maroc in the end theyre the same he gestured this way please he seemed quite unconcerned now about the damage in the mezzanine they met bliss jake ran to take her into his arms im all right she said then put her head against his shoulder and cried im sorry she whispered i had two of them covered i never expected a third one he came up behind me i turned but by then it was too late its all right jake said stroking her hair jake she said i was so frightened for you he held her more tightly what was there to say he became aware of venerable chen at his side is the young lady all right the shanghainese inquired the young lady is fine bliss said wiping away the last of the tears with her knuckle good he gave a quick nod now if you will follow me there is no point in my having to listen to stupid questions for which i have no answers the fornicating police will be here at any moment he led them to the far end of the mezzanine through a door marked private now he said slowing his pace as they entered a quiet spacious office i do believe mr maroc that i owe you a drink mystified sawyer said a hurried goodbye to the hus he hastened down the temples stone steps he could just see ng nearing the top of the street sawyer was himself more than halfway up when he saw ng turn right disappearing around a corner he quickened his pace and puffing slightly with the unaccustomed exertion reached the summit in time to see peter ng enter a warehouse the sign out front told sawyer that the place specialized in ginseng root sawyer immediately slowed his pace he mopped his brow with a white linen handkerchief thinking its damnably hot to be chasing all around the western district after my comprador the front of the warehouse was open a large isuzu truck was backed up to the opening and two young men in headbands and sleeveless shirts were busy throwing cartons from a stack inside into the back of the truck as he came abreast of them sawyer could see a third man quite a bit older with a clipboard and an abacus he tallied the cost as the young men loaded sawyer took the opportunity to step out of the brassy sun in the shade and relative coolness just inside the corrugatedsteel awning of another warehouse just across the narrow street he could smell a pleasant mixture of spices the men went on with their work good joss had delivered to him an excellent vantage point because of the isuzu they could not see him from here he could see ng speaking in low tones to the man with the saltandpepper hair sawyer squinted through the sunlight in an attempt to focus on the others face it was broad and flat a cantonese peasant face there was something about it sawyer did not know what it was but the more he looked at that face the more certain he became that he knew it but from where ng and the cantonese were huddled together the two young men ignored them moving back and forth like powerful automatons delivering their cartons in that moment the cantonese gave them a quick glance and with a jerk of his head moved off to the left with ng deeper into shadow but closer to sawyer their angle changed and sawyer felt his stomach give a sick queasy roll a mi tuo fo he thought dizzily i dont believe it as the cantonese shifted the left side of his face came partially into view the outer corner of his eye was dragged down by a livid scar whiteeye kao sawyer thought several years ago there had been a problem at one of sawyer sons limitedaccess electronic facilities plans for two prototype systems disappeared working on his own sawyer had had plans drawn up for a dummy prototype setting infrared photography equipment in place he had taken pictures of the spy rather than having him arrested sawyer had hired a firm of excellent and absolutely discreet surveillance operatives to follow the man the firm reported to no one but sawyer himself and the tai pan had kept all written material on the case locked in a vault to which only he had the combination sure enough the firm had traced the dummy plans back to a source sawyer could still remember the moment of holding the blackandwhite photo grainy from the highspeed film the image unrealistically flat from the long lens hed remember that odd scar anywhere sawyer was trembling now but he did not know whether it was from rage or fear the thing about whiteeye kao was that he was a highlevel soviet agent the tai pan shifted his gaze he could see a whitepainted metal staircase running up the right side of the concrete wall from the loading platform to offices high up bamboo shades were partially drawn across dusty windows but he could make out a figure moving behind them lit from behind by fluorescent light sawyer mopped at the back of his sweating neck buddha protect me he thought what is the comprador of sawyer sons doing talking with a soviet spy the tai pan had taken no action against whiteeye kao figuring that the enemy he knew was far less dangerous than the one unknown six months after the last theft he had had to lay off thirty or forty people he had made certain that the spy inside the facility was one of them now however he wished he had delivered up his evidence on whiteeye kao to the special branch there was movement and suppressing his shock sawyer concentrated his attention the door above the two men was opening a shadow was emerging coming down the staircase sawyer could not make out who it was the gloom was so dense in the warehouses interior he heard a voice raised and ng and kao broke off their conversation now sawyer noticed an odd thing the demeanor of the two changed radically at the third persons approach it was clear from their stance and their expressions that they were in the presence of a tai pan of sorts my god sawyer thought i know how high up whiteeye kao is in the soviet hierarchy this must be the tai pan of russian spies for all of hong kong of course sawyer did not expect to recognize the person and when he did as they came into partial sunlight his palsied hands rose in pure reflex using his kodak disc camera to take shot after shot after shot his mind was so frozen that he kept depressing the shutter long after the disc had been used up peter ng snap whiteeye kao snap sir john bluestone snap snap snap what you ask is patently impossible venerable chen stood up there was a small porcelain panda on his desk he picked it up warming its cold smooth skin in the palm of his hand besides the godown war is between formidable sung and myself it affects all members of the green pang jake pointed out if just one man dies because of the wars there is his family to consider they are adequately recompensed venerable chen said shortly we know how to take care of our people but even one life lost is too many bliss said from the corner of the sofa wouldnt you agree honorable chen the shanghainese turned and regarded her she was curled up like a cat knees to chest a double oldfashioned glass filled with scotch clasped between her hands he was about to remind her of her place when he remembered that he had been curled in just such a position after the explosion in the lounge it made him think twice about reprimanding her death is in the nature of who we are he said evenly no one can change that of course not honorable chen jake said but strictly from a business point of view one finds that streamlining often results in a leap in net profit any good businessman knows that mr maroc streamlining can also encompass compromise venerable chen went behind his desk and sat down he set his panda back in its place atop a pile of envelopes jake took the silence as an invitation to him to continue one compromises every day of ones life the hyeung yau that one pays policemen to stay away from ones operations the intimidation one employs among shopowners the infiltration of the special branch that allows one to make ones smuggling runs of guns gold and the poppys tearsall these things which are sometimes taken for granted in business are forms of compromise one must give up either money or manpower in order to get what one wants why should it be any different with the godowns because mr maroc i want all of the godowns for the green pang it is our hereditary right i have my duty to perform when it comes to hereditary rights then surely the hakka hong kongs true residents should control the godowns when it comes to duty i agree absolutely but tell me something honorable chen how much money have you taken in from the godowns since the start of the war none venerable chen said it without emotion of any kind jake got up and stared out the window at the south china sea were i the comprador of the whose triad was in the midst of this war this is what i would counsel him to do contact the chief hakka and make this proposal to him let all the sons of the hakka who can no longer tolerate spending all their lives on shipboard take to the land as is their wish let them manage all the godowns currently under contention assign them an administration fee of say fifty percent the other fifty would be divided equally between the green pang and the k my would get his money every month without tying up manpower in running the godowns and in fighting a war that can realistically never end further it would put the hakka forever in his debt since the problem with their current generation is reaching epidemic proportions it would be ideal for the young men and their fathers it would give them a new business on dry land and would keep them close enough to their ancestral home so as not to break up the family unit ah the face he would gain by instituting such a sweeping reorganization venerable chen stirred after the longest of silences mr maroc i was wrong about you you are a devil but not in the way i had at first thought a mi tuo fo you are as deviously cunning as a chinese he laughed now an infectious boyish sound i think in you i have found my secret weapon nichiren lay within pearls slender arms he listened to her gentle snoring smelled the faint trace of liquor on her breath mingling with the soft scents of her perfume and her sexual oils the windows were wide open and he could hear the sleepy drone of the nocturnal insects he felt the light down on her velvet arms as she stirred in the midst perhaps of some kaleidoscopic dream all these sights sounds smells and touches were as familiar to him as the certain array of colors on an artists palette each time before when he had come to hong kong the confluence of these sensations had served as a powerful palliative to send him off to a deep and dreamless sleep from which he would invariably wake ten hours later refreshed and relaxed tonight sleep seemed as far away from him as the shores of japan for it was not of pearl he thought it was of kamisaka something deep inside him was growing out of season kamisaka found him in the bars of spectral moonlight which at last breaking though the heavy cloud cover that had turned much of the night heavy and clammy penetrated the open window throwing themselves in reckless abandon across their entwined legs though pearls prowess in the pillow ways remained undiminished nichiren had felt incapable of entering her licentious world try as he might something inside him had remained adamantine unshakable it was as if a barrier not of his own manufacture had somehow been built inside him during a moment of unconsciousness he had awakened to find himself irrevocably changed and lying here in the semidarkness with these hedonistic comforts strewn in satiated abandon all about him he knew that it was kamisaka who had erected that wall inside him his dislocation here was a physical manifestation of her for he felt called back to japan not only by his innate love of his adopted land but now too by a human spirit he saw for the first time that the power this kami could wield was greater than any other on earth this revelation shook him to his core the fact that his feelings for another human being could supersede all his arduous training the seeds planted within him long ago by his mother stunned him into immobility it was odd he felt as if he were lying in a perfect hammock beneath perfect towering pines whose crenellated branches allowed the perfect amount of sunlight through to warm him there he swung in short languid arcs content how could that be hadnt his mother told him that true contentment did not exist just as perfection in mans world did not exist now he began to suspect that she was wrong because now he knew how it felt to belong knew as surely as he was lying here in hong kong that yumiko had never belonged in that way that she had had no conception of what that might mean to her spirit he had lived his life until now as the outcastas she hadeither having it thrust upon him by circumstance or after a certain period of indoctrination by his mother opting for it actively there had been he had found a certain degree of spiteful satisfaction in engendering in others exactly the reaction he had learned they would choose to put on him anyway his control of the circumstances of his pain and anger seemed important at the time even necessary for his survival and yet oddly enough this journey to revelation which had begun with kamisaka had only come to its full fruition through the catalyst of mariana maroc mariana had been the first person to show him that he could be liked for himself a friendship had sprung up between them as unmistakable as it was strong in the short time they had known each other something inside her had touched him deeply perhaps because of how she had come to feel about him despite her predisposition to hate him her death had struck him across the heart he realized that it brought to light secret emotions inside him he had found at last that he could feel he thought about his source i am your savior the electronic voice had said in his ear time and again nichiren had never met his source he believed that he never would that was all right he had been given the most compelling reasons during his recruitment by obeying the source he would save himself and in working clandestinely for china he would be helping to destroy the soviets nichirens love for japan was well known to his source the soviets were inimical toward japan that had been enough now nichiren was not so certain he stood in the center it seemed of a vast darkened theater before him was the image of yumiko but he saw her now as if through an insects multifaceted eyes she was his mother whom he loved she was a scarred woman whom he pitied she was the presence who had begun him on his training she was the creator of a terrible vengeful demon she had bound into him through some arcane ceremony he saw before him now yumikos flesh she who had been so beautiful was now hideously disfigured for a moment then nichiren heard the chanted words his mother had spewed out during the calling forth of his namesake abruptly he felt strangled even his closeness to pearl grated on him as if her arms so soft and dreamily around his lap still had turned to writhing tentacles sucking him to her with a great gulp of breath he swung his legs out of bed he got up and silently crossed the dappled room in a moment he was dressed slipping out the front door like a wraith arisen from the mist of the land when he reached the street the moon was already down and in the depths of the night the blackness was complete in the end it was yuri lantin who decided his own fate he overruled daniella who had said that she would like to go back to her apartment for dinner death she said as a joke always tired her out at lantins she sat in his plush leather wingback chair his house was large enough to contain a study if he had a child daniella supposed this would have been its room it was lined with massive mahogany shelves filled with the literature of the world whatever else yuri lantin was not he was certainly wellread there was a mahogany dropleaf table on which was perched a thickframed portrait of lantin when he was much younger he was smiling into the camera his uniform and perhaps his expression as well made him seem dashing and somehow innocent beside it was another table less aesthetic but sturdier on which sat a highdomed typewriter the walls were painted a deep luminous blue the ceiling and moldings cream daniella was dressed in a sideslit dior gown of pure satin silk she had never even seen such a gown except in photos let alone worn one before lantin had bought this for her its sheen was tactile especially because she was naked beneath its clinging wrap naked save for garter belt and sheer silk stockings lantin had chosen her wardrobe but daniella did not complain she felt precisely as if she were taking a steaming bath and she was luxuriating in the experience before he went into the kitchen to prepare dinner lantin had selected a volume from one section of the bookcase that was glassedin and locked it was bound in calfskin and had gilt edges it was the story of o by pauline rйage it was in the original french daniella had never told him that she spoke and read eight languages fluently one of themher favorite besides russianwas french she had never read or heard of the story of o but after twenty or so pages she was beginning to get the idea mozart was playing on the stereo every fifteen or twenty minutes lantin would appear and either turn over the record or change it always mozart it was difficult to get foreign pressings of such astounding virtuosity and aural clarity the subtle combination of the silk gliding against her flesh rages heady prose and the gorgeous music was beginning to dizzy her it was almost possible to believe that she was in paris her old recruiting ground rather than in drab moscow lantin came in to flip the record mozart began again drenching the room in glorious melody lantin wearing calvin klein jeans and a cowboys denim workshirt walked barefoot across the oriental carpet and popped fois gras in her mouth it melted as she chewed and she made a sound deep in her throat that was when he offered her the opium it was as dark as night filling the tiny bowl of a longstemmed pipe of chinese ivory the color of a chrysanthemum the bowl was carved and felt odd beneath her fingers lantin lit the redolent opium and daniella inhaled she had never experienced drugs of any kind firsthand before of course her training in the sluzhba had included an extensive program on drugs of all kind including their effect on different parts of the brain nervous system coordination and so on she and lantin shared the opium and when the pipe was cool he returned to the kitchen through flared nostrils she could smell fresh coriander and preserved chili she resumed reading the opium gave her the ability to absorb what she read and think independently at the same time the leather initially so cool on her bare buttocks was now as deliciously warm as a lovers lips she squirmed in the chair aware of her bodys flush rйages story was turning her on despite herself the smell of leather so manly mingled with the cooking scents to create a kind of wholeness that daniella could not explain but only wonder at yin and yang her resolve to break irrevocably away from lantin flickered like a candle in the wind the truth was she enjoyed the things he bought her the luxury within which he immersed her he was decadent and oddly that thrilled her this gown was decadent with every breath she took she could feel the silk caressing her flesh mozarts sublime music caressed her ears rйages french caressed her mind she was filled up with emotion soaking in discrete moments of desire there was no yesterday no tomorrow only an endless now she read steadily until she heard lantins voice get up she obeyed she was wearing the highheeled pumps he had bought her through halfglazed eyes she saw his gaze of lust as it glided over the thrust of her breasts the stiff peaks of her nipples the shallow bowl of her belly the heels made her legs seem endless the stockings gave them a sheen as if they were coated with oil lantin changed the record are you hungry yes walk across the room she began but he redirected her until she stood beneath the glassedin bookcase hold out your hands she did so and before she knew what was happening he had slipped a pair of gleaming chromeplated handcuffs over her wrists she heard with an odd kind of echo the sniksnik of the ratchets closing over her flesh daniella was slightly dazed if he had said hold out your wrists she might have had some inkling as to his intent especially considering the book he had given her to read as it was she stood staring stupidly at him there was already a great bulge in his jeans she wondered whether the constriction was very painful turnaround she seemed incapable of any movement she felt his hands rough on her shoulders spinning her so that she faced the glassedin case he took her wrists by the manacles and slipped the chain linking them through an eyehook screwed into one of the higher bookshelves this drew daniella upward until the heels of her shoes barely touched the floor we will eat in a moment she felt her dior gown being pulled aside the scrape of the jeans zipper abraded against the gently flowing mozart a scar disfiguring an otherwise exquisite face daniella became aware of what he was going to do a moment before it happened she thought of rйages character and what she had been asked to do for love to prove her devotion this debasement was the first of many she cried out at the invasion of his hot oiled penis it seemed to have grown to four times its size her back arched instinctively but this only presented her buttocks to him more completely his carnal heat was on her like a blanket she felt as if she were being penetrated by a horse there was nothing pleasurable about it the shame and sickly fear served to evaporate the euphoria of the opium mozarts ephemeral stateliness now seemed hollow and mocking she thought of o of how her lover had taken her thus how his friends had availed themselves of her in the same manner how she had been whipped and then made love to how the ring her lover had selected and which bore his initials had been put through her labia as an eternal symbol she thought of how o had endured all this for the love of her man and she wondered whether this was what lantin ultimately had in mind for her certainly this was the beginning of what he saw as a learning process she saw that he had given her the book to read so that he would never have to say to her daniella this is what is to come yet he had missed the essence of the story o had been asked at every stage if she would accept what was to come and at each stage she had agreed until the strength of her commitment and the knowledge it lent her had freed her of womans traditional chains giving her an extraordinary power over others lantin had asked daniella nothing he had never sought her consent he had gleaned from rйages story only the most superficial emotions male dominating female he had not recognized os submission as strength but rather had seen it erroneously as weakness he saw weakness in all women thus he made up daniellas mind for her she let him have his grunting sweatsticky orgasm inside her she turned her defilement into a rite of passage a search for self as rйage meant os to have been in the end she would have to thank lantin for it was through his cruelty that she began to see herself as a free creature rather than as a woman who was dependent on the more powerful men around her to scale the heights she desired for herself still rampant from his rape lantin reached up and slipped the chain off the eyehook he unlocked the handcuffs so that they fell away from her red wrists landing at her feet they felt hot against her toes as if they burned with her shame he was deep inside her daniella felt as if she had dysentery she was beset by cramps she wanted to cry with the pain but she would not allow herself that release not in front of him he did not want to come out of her but her calf muscles were trembling so hard now that he had no choice he withdrew and to daniella it felt as if a swordblade were slicing through her bowels she put her forehead against the glass case until it fogged with her panting breath sweat drenched her and she could smell the musk of sex swirling in the room along with the mozart the music followed her as she staggered into the hallway into the bathroom where she fell against the door and vomited all over the tile twenty minutes later after she had cleaned up taken a chilly shower because as usual the hot water wasnt working properly she stood before the medicine chest she looked at herself in the mirror on the door and quickly opened the chest to rid herself of the sight it took her several minutes before her vision concentrated enough for her mind to understand what she was looking at a bottle with a fairly new prescription sleeping pills she took them out and while lantin was busy in the kitchen completing his preparations for dinner she went into the bedroom and threw all the pills into the bottle of starka he always kept by his bedside twenty gingerly she sat on the bed watching fascinated as the thin coating slowly dissolved in the alcohol soon there was no trace of them the bottle was less than a quarter full she thought of the concentration of chemicals inside that bottle like swallowing poison she thought almost it was so painful to sit on the hard dining room chair that she had to bite her lip through most of the meal lantin did not notice or perhaps if he did he felt it best to make no comment he spoke as if nothing untoward had happened daniella was astounded it was as if he was unaware that she might have some feeling one way or another about being taken or as if he did not care she did not know which was the worse reality as was his habit when he got into bed he drank three fingers of the starka out of a water glass in the airless dark daniella waited feeling the sweat congealing on her flesh being so close to him now gave her goosebumps as if he were a bear or a great cat who though ostensibly trained might strike her down at any moment at last she could stand it no longer yuri she said then in a somewhat stronger voice yuri no answer she turned over she could just make out his profile he looked like the devil she reached out and breathless poked him in the ribs she made a fist beat down on his chest above his heart she slapped him hard across the face then she clambered across his still body and reaching back dragged him out of bed this was no time she thought to take a chance grunting with the effort she took him up under the arms and pulled him across the room the rug proved a bit of a problem his heavy heels dragged it over the polished wooden floor adding to his weight until she dropped him and untangled it from beneath him down the silent hallway they went daniella could hear the stentorian ticking of the clock on the mantel her breath was hot in her throat and the stooped position she was in caused a return of her cramps in the kitchen she opened the oven door and blew out the pilot light then she turned lantin over on his belly and slid him up onto the bakelite lip shoved head and shoulders into the aperture then already gagging on the fumes she turned on the oven full blast it took her fifteen painful minutes to dress break into his cache of secret files and remove all traces of her presence including prints from the apartment by then the place was so thick with gas it was possible to hallucinate how many wars had he fought the war against chiang the war against the capitalists the war against the faangwailoh but the greatest toll of all had been taken in his war against himself like a mountain climber who after a long exhausting ascent stands wreathed in cloud zilin was now increasingly absorbed by his thoughts his secret life dedicated to the fruition of the yuhnhyun had been kept from everyone every day had been a battle with security on the surface he had to seem to be working toward the goals set by each succeeding regime of course he had had his say he had pulled the strings at which time had made him adept but it had not been enough despite his work presentday china was a shambles of political quicksand indecisive priorities and allocations and above all inability to devise a longrange plan for china and stick to it perhaps zilin thought it was not inability but unwillingness ever since maos disastrous fiveyear plans there had been a reluctance within the governmental hierarchy to return to that kind of thinking no matter the urgency of the need we are an unwieldy nation he thought dispiritedly we are too many people too little educated in a quality fashion our communist cant shackles us to an unsupportable economy our continued fear of western contamination dooms us to an endless infancy in the modern business world time and again zilin thought about the examples of chinese initiative and business acumen in almost every country of the globe in most cases they paid the price for it philippineborn chinese were still denied citizenship in that country even after their families had lived there for many generations in the s thousands of chinese were slaughtered in malaysian and indonesian race riots principally because of their business dominance in those areas a decade later the socialist regime in hanoi had forced vietnamese chinese into the south china sea rather than harbor such potentially destructive capitalists in their midst today the two most successful business tycoons in jakarta were born on mainland china but rather than risk the racial they had renamed themselves soedono salim and surya wonowidjojo indonesianizing themselves today while the chinese in indonesia are not subjected to mutilation and death as they once were they are still persecuted in a way the government has decreed that the bumiputras the sons of the soil islamic native malays have first rights on all new business enterprises further foreign businessmen are encouraged to take on bumiputras as business partners in america however the chinese flourish among many en wang an emigrant from the mainland has shown his genius in designing computer networks zilin regretted now that he would never see america for himself but in these days of pain and fear he regretted most his decision to leave his wife and his mistress for the first time in his life doubts about himself had begun to assail him he was after all just a man nowadays his youthful dreams in which he had believed himself to be the reincarnation of a celestial guardian of china seemed farfetched indeed his increasing pain made him aware with every breath he took that he was merely a man as mortal as those around him and now he felt the closing presence of wu aiping all around him fluttering wings of death beat in the shadows of his office and villa at night the darkness closed around him like a cloak clutched in the senior ministers hands bearing down on him the sweat rolled off his emaciated body there were times when he wished he could weep he wondered then how he had ever been able to leave athena and sheng li in the past he would have called it strength now he suspected that it was sheer callousness how could he have been so unfeeling how could he have left his two sons one a child the other merely an infant he had been driven by his dream by the haunting vision of the yuhnhyun which had been born so many many years ago in the jians garden in suzhou artifice in the appearance of nature that was what had sustained him for so long it was what had kept him alive but he suspected now in sorrow that it had also warped him beyond his own understanding he was jian the creator but for the first time he questioned the nature of his creation he wondered whether the future of china was truly more important than his own happiness and the happiness of those he held dear he had been witness to such cruelty such stupidity such inhumanity in his climb to power he had done what he could but it was of course never enough he could never have stopped the evil flow the eternal fluttering of the rings banner had not let him he had had to blend in to seem to go along with those who had grasped the power he could not have survived otherwise mao would have killed him later he would have been destroyed along with mao the gang of four all the others increasingly he had begun to suspect that he was unable to feel any emotion after all my sons my sons he thought i must have my sons back not even china means as much to me as they do now a chime sounded softly in the villa and zilin rose sighing he went to his transceiver and flicked on the power with half his mind still immersed in deep thought he went through the rituals to ensure security contact they performed the recognition codes without a hitch report he said i the voice faltered and zilin came out of his reverie what is it what is the matter i do not know nichiren said from a faroff place something seems to have changed in hong kong inside myself explain yourself his control said with a calmness he did not feel how i was never taught to understand my own emotions i thought i had accomplished that by breaking you away from your mothers control i wonder whether that is enough i do not understand i want for a time there was only the crackle of the ether i want an end to this an end to what to obeying orders to being under discipline to being a part of the yuhnhyun what are you saying this is impossible do you have any idea how long it took me to set you up in just such a way so that you would become irresistible to daniella vorkuta as long as she was running you you reported to me everything she said or did i already had a line on her recruitment of chimera the soviet mole inside the quarry that was my reason for ordering you to get mariana maroc and the fu shard out of hong kong chimera had somehow found out about the fu and had sent out a seek and terminate directive on mariana daniella vorkuta has been a primary element in the yuhnhyun though she is totally oblivious of the fact she has taken care of general karpov for me if i know her at all she will have found a way to do the same with yuri lantin once that happens we can move without fear lantin is our most feared enemy inside russia it was he who ordered the termination squad up to tsurugi it is he who seeks to strangle china by provoking her into a war he feels certain she cannot win listen to me i have saved you from the utter anarchy and nihilism of your youth and in so doing i have furthered the yuhnhyun the positive ring without it buddha only knows what would have happened to you you must think about that you have your duty i believe i have a duty to myself also that has been weighing heavily on my mind of late something i learned not long ago a lesson given by jake marocs wife you will listen to me i want my own life the cry was that of a lost child and it froze zilin i want my own life and i will have it then the connection was gone just like that such a slender thread from father to unknowing son zilins hand trembled as he replaced the microphone and shut down the power the yuhnhyun he thought fifty years of planning the sacrifices he had made to become jian i want my own life a cry in the night raw emotion that zilin himself had felt growing inside him for weeks now his longing to see his sons face to face to let them know that he was alive that he loved them that he had always loved them even as he was abandoning them was so intense that it overpowered the pain lighting up his body like lightning he shook where he sat trembling with emotions he had pent up it seemed for almost an entire lifetime what matter that he was jian his sons had been lost to him for all these years he saw now that one could not equate the one with the other abruptly he tasted the dust of his life understood its barrenness he felt the alienness of his own self being jian so far from any human frailty he had not laughed nor cried in decades nothing had been able to move him in a vacuum he had planned the intricacies of the yuhnhyun like a great general his manipulation of people had of necessity inured him to their pain and sorrow instead he was focused in only on their fears for in knowing them he could motivate them to make the moves he required of them i want my own life and i will have it he had never been there when his sons needed him now it was clear that nichiren at least lost and alone could no longer survive in his current state a woman could comfort him but who could set things right but a father oh buddha help me he thought what should i do at last zilin began to weep tears of such bitterness that they stung his flesh as they spilled out of his eyes it was strange how a telephone bell sounded as loud as a klaxon at night perhaps it was because the noise was so penetrating or again perhaps it was because like pavlovs dogs humans have been trained to expect only bad news at night in any event the telephone woke henry wunderman out of a sound sleep at once he sat up and grabbed for the receiver with his other hand he reached out and gentled the stirring shoulder of his wife with his hand over the mouthpiece he whispered its all right its nothing the kids are all asleep go back to sleep yourself he waited until he felt her relax with the kids in their teens she never quite got used to the broken silence of the night at length wunderman said yes into the phone the nightclubs open for dancing a familiar voice said in his ear right wunderman said twenty minutes tops his feet were already swinging over the side of the bed the nightclub was quarryspeak for asian theater communications dancing was the code word for top priority driving through washington at night always reminded wunderman of paris both formed the essence of power on their continents cities of light also washington in its overall structure was very european in nature with its main streets radiating out from the hub of the capitol it was a city wunderman had been told that was easy to defend paris had a special place in wundermans heart it was where he and marjorie had gone on their honeymoon a package tour all he could afford at the time since he had turned down the money from marjories family the busmans special no matter paris was a place to fall in love not just for the rich but for everyone he tried to think of what rodger donovan had been like striding along the parisian boulevards in his izod shirts white duck trousers and topsiders a quintessentially american figure amid all the gallic charm the parisian women must have gone mad for him the russians must have run for the hills he was a oneman july fourth celebration wunderman went through security in five separate stages even though everyone knew him by sight he was pleased to see there was no letup or exception made he was met on the eighteenth floor by the od a young earnest man named rhones whom wunderman had handpicked out of the washington talent pool what do we have rhones didnt bother to apologize for getting his boss out of bed at this late hour he knew his job and did it to perfection computer call that checked wunderman are you kidding nightclubs not computer thats right sir communication came in from hong kong station it was automatically computerrouted because of the code rhones all our communications overseas and otherwise are ciphered i know sir but this is in gasp garbled agraphic speech parts was a cipher that donovan had come up with some time ago he had told wunderman that it was essentially a joke hence the name which revolved around the word agraphic wunderman had had to look it up it meant a pathological inability to write what donovan had done in gasp was to take speech sounds rather than words and translate them into a representational wordphrase alphabet then he had garbled it all to hell hence it was a cipher only the quarry computer could translate donovan had brought up the existence of gasp in the most offhand way but wunderman and beridien had immediately seen its application and they had had donovan program it into the gpr memory bank consequently the quarry now had the only unbreakable code wunderman had ever heard of wunderman sat down at the computer terminal and rhones left him an unspoken quality of gasp was that it was eyes only director and clearance personnel he punched his first set of access figures into the computer when the go forth graphic lit up he gave the recognition code for the gaspcipher communication work ing the gpr told him it was hot in the windowless room and wunderman called for rhones to put up the air which was on minimal at this time of night go forth wunderman picked out the second set of access codes confirmed and verified jake maroc responsible for termination of three quarry agents in hong kong during last twelve hours request reclassification to lethal rogueorders the words rolled over wunderman like a chill tide he felt the breath go out of him just as surely as if he had been punched in the solar plexus he glanced down at his hand noticed that there was a slight tremor how could he give the order i brought jake into the quarry im his mentor i guided him through training let him loose in the field but my god three agents killed and jake responsible for all of them wunderman thought of his wife and kids asleep safe in their house in rural virginia ive got to bring him back he thought now at all costs i must stop him hes running amok jakes my responsibility wunderman was about to stab out at the keyboard when the running graphic lit up the top of the screen another toppriority message was coming in wunderman hastily cleared the screen typed in go forth followed by his access code this was what came up rumor confirmation on red rosered rose was quarryspeak for russianew head of first chief directorate kgb general daniella vorkuta announcement forthcoming within hours unconfirmed reports indicate within week general vorkuta will be first female to be appointed to politburo endit oh jesus christ wunderman breathed he thought ive got to contact apollo immediately there was a pay phone he used on the way home he did not like to do any security calling at all inside the washington environs he cleared the screen and tapped in his command via gasp director to hk sta confirm message receipt maroc hereby reclassified lethal rogue repeat lethal rogue reclassification confirmed wunderman turned away from the screen after shutting down the terminal now he thought wearily theyll shoot him on sight what else could andrew sawyer do but deliver the photographs to venerable chen he himself had been wronged peter ng was sawyer sons comprador but he was venerable chens nephew sawyer attuned all his life to chinese philosophy and customs knew that family took precedence over business it did not matter how many secrets peter ng had stolen from sawyer sons the only important point was that he was family to venerable chen you know the man with the scar venerable chen nodded whiteeye kao his face was filled with an unutterable sadness a dungeating lackey of the fornicating kgb theyre all in it together sawyer said ng kao bluestone venerable chen looked up you have taken no action sawyer shook his head as i told you honorable chen it is to you i came first peter ngs position in your family made that my duty i see the shanghainese stared at the tai pan for a long time without saying anything further they were in the study of venerable chens house in the sai ying pun district of the island when venerable chen spoke again it was seemingly on an irrelevant subject i am told that you recently attended a ghost wedding sawyer nodded for my daughter miki she died when she was eighteen months old oh ko such a sadness the burden is heavy for such a little one but now through the ghost wedding her spirit is happy at last the two men looked at each other appraisingly as if a new light shone on them both it would seem obvious mr sawyer that my nephew has done you and your firm great harm the conversation was suddenly as delicate as crystal i think sawyer said that it is as nothing compared to the disappointment he has brought you i appreciate your concern but my first thoughts are of the damage to sawyer and sons it will take time sawyer said carefully to accurately assess the full extent of the loss he paused i may need help venerable chen had been waiting it seemed for just those words then it will be given to you you have only to ask sawyer bowed i am honored by the thought honorable chen the shanghainese looked up and the punishment the crime was against hong kong the punishment should fit the crime at least that is my belief venerable chen peered hard at sawyer then you see no need to inform the special branch i leave that up to you taking a big chance his heart in his throat the other gave a quick nod of affirmation he went on his tiny feet to sit behind his desk he placed the photograph he had been holding at the end of a line of all the others he stared at them one last time then lifted his gaze to sawyer he saw a kind man with open features as chinese read such things it seemed at that moment to be filled with intelligence and more heartfelt emotion for the first time he recognized the face of anally my judgment is this mr sawyer let the chinese take care of the chinese let the tai pan take care of the tai pan sawyer took a step toward the tiny man he bowed with respect honorable chen i would like to make a suggestion you may let us punish together let the punishment we devise between us be the first bond of many in business and personal life venerable chen allowed a smile inside himself through his grief at what his nephew had inexplicably become and he thought dew neh loh moh i may come to like this barbarian after all formidable sungs main office was in a toy factory the place manufactured tiny articulated samurai warriors constructed of red green yellow and blue plastic bright colors favored by the chinese but wildly inappropriate for the subject aisles as straight as arrows were bounded by gigantic bins in which resided literally millions of arms legs torsos and heads swords and bases were kept in a separate section of the factory because they were added last lines of chinese girls somewhere between thirteen and sixteen dressed alike sitting on hard uncomfortable stools their shining black hair tied up in thick cotton swatches assembled the furiousfaced warriors piece by piece along a kind of conveyor that moved at a speed that gave them no margin for error while there was perhaps enough money to turn this factory and others like it over to the gleaming robots of the s it was not practical human labor in hong kong was still far cheaper than converting to automation a bristly haired triad member picked jake up a hundred yards from the factory he met him at the door and escorted him through the noisy chaos of the interior formidable sung was waiting for him there was tea brewing the twin gold and green dragons their arched and flaming backs forming a symmetrical shape over the altartop of a camphorwood cabinet stared crimsoneyed at him joss sticks were burning adding to the confluence of intangible smells within the cramped space woodenslatted windows allowed thin slices of sunlight into the interior plastic dust floated like plankton in the semidarkness lights were lit within this room jake knew from experience only at night even then the shadows in the corners were inky and impenetrable the dragons who inhabited the earth beneath this spot formidable sung had once been advised by his feng shut man preferred the darkness he happily acceded to their wishes dieh loong the earth dragons were the s personal protectors he believed in their existence with an almost febrile intensity those who were not aligned with dieh loong he refused to see or to do business with he was adamant on this point consulting the feng shui man before entering into any business deal large or small ah he said as jake was ushered in mr maroc it was not the chinese way to compliment or to touch in pleasure it would have been especially unseemly for an older man such as formidable sung to show such emotion to a younger man such as jake instead he had brewed tea himself jake was alone with the which was rare enough in itself in china one learned to glean emotion from the most minute source just as one learned in the desert to get water out of the most unlikely places in either case it was a survival technique they drank the tea in silence both of them taking pleasure in the moment so that the ritual became almost an intimate kind of interplay during this time jake knew the faзade of the was down now jake if he wished could take advantage of the other ask him anything but he also knew that although the other would answer it would be the end of their relationship politeness dictated that jake be content with the knowledge and accept the moment for what it was a quiet time between equals there was ironbound honor between these two and that was what was being displayed now neither of them wished to disturb the forces at play invisible lightning ringing a park in summertime at last there was nothing in the earthenware pot but moist leaves it was then that formidable sung said the godown war is at an end i am pleased that no more lives will be lost that simple exchange was all that marked an acknowledgment of jakes victory they sat facing each other the sounds of the factory engulfing them in a kind of dangerous noise the aura of both men was very strong their intrinsic energies meeting in the center of the room like the confluence of two powerful rivers nichiren formidable sung said opening the topic i want to know why he comes here to see you he and i are in the midst of discussions but he sees not only me when he comes to hong kong he also sees venerable chen sharktooth tung head of the hak sam the chiuchow triad he sees all the dragons in fact separately i imagine jake had said it lightly but formidable sung took his time replying that is not the way he has wanted it to be but after two abortive efforts to gather us together in a summit he has been forced to make the rounds does that answer your question the breath had gone out of jake a triad summit but why how the cocked his head and now there was a look of genuine puzzlement on his face has your friend not told you my friend do you have another way to describe the woman bliss the other nodded what does bliss know about this my dear mr maroc formidable sung said softly she is part of the yuhnhyun and so are you how do you know about the yuhnhyun how do you think i too am part of the ring so is nichiren nichiren jake was dizzy he felt as if the ground had given way beneath his feet nichiren works for the soviets not quite now the other was smiling the soviets believe he works for them his first allegiance is to the yuhnhyun i dont even know what this yuhnhyun is that is not for me to tell you after what i did for you mr maroc you know very well the parameters of our bargain the yuhnhyun was never mentioned all right jake conceded nichiren then what is the purpose of the triad summit i thought that would have been obvious to unite all triads behind one cause dont tell me the yuhnhyun formidable sung said nothing how did you get into this it was my understanding that all dragons were independent independence mr maroc depends almost wholly on history allow me to tell you a story that is historical in nature it goes back many years a somewhat rash youth ran lorchas with a man together they knew every inch of the waterways in and around hong kong where they plied their trade some things in china never change i think you know that well the tears of the poppy is one of those things smuggling opium was and is enormously profitable because that was so the competition washow shall i put itintense suffice it to say that the rash youth in a moment of heady euphoria bragged to people he thought were trustworthy the prospect of wealth it was later brought home to him bores holes in the concept of trust it was a painful lesson he never forgot so it was that the rash youth and his mentor were ambushed one day after picking up a rather large shipment four men were eventually killed the youth was wounded quite severely his mentor took care of him healed him and never once reprimanded him for the incident or the loss of the opium the youth by his own decision worked for his mentor a full year without compensation to atone for the payment the mentor was obliged to make to cover the loss the mentor was a most unusual man and when in time events dictated that he move out of that business he bequeathed it to the youthwho was now not nearly so rash formidable sung was removing his suit jacket he hung it carefully on a coat tree in the comer of his office then he undid the buttons of his longsleeved shirt pushing his tie out of the way he exposed his chest and right shoulder the skin there was puckered and white with a series of thick scars an abstract pattern across his hairless flesh as you must have guessed he said buttoning up the rash youth was me my mentor mr maroc was three oaths tsun he is the dragon of the yuhnhyun we are tied in business in this also he shrugged but i forget you already know of his involvement in the yuhnhyun jake was puzzled why should i because mr maroc your friend bliss is his daughter the soldiers of the premiers guard presented themselves at precisely nine oclock in the morning at zilins office cubicle there they went through zilins files gathering up all information pertinent to mitre hong kong and the ren zilin looked on impassively but zhang hua who had followed the soldiers into the room stood shaking white with terror as he watched the systematic rape of the office after the soldiers had finished their work one of them the commander read them a precisely worded document that coldly called for their immediate presence before a tribunal of the premiers calling there was absolutely no question of not complying zilin gathered papers into his briefcase and handed it to zhang hua a tense look passed between them courage my friend zilin said softly enough so that the premiers guard could not hear together they went slowly down to the street a dense zinccolored rain was falling it washed all color from the greenery ducking his head zilin climbed into the waiting car he sucked in his breath at the pain the motion engendered in him zhang hua sat by his side the slim briefcase across his knees he held on to the handle with whiteknuckled fists zilin could feel the tremor shivering his body he wanted to make a gesture to reassure his assistant but he knew they were being watched the commander sat beside them there were three moreone was the driverin front privately zilin thought that excessive to fetch two old and tired ministers zilin put his head back against the plastic seat and closed his eyes pain laced his consciousness like a web it became more and more of an effort each day to separate the pain from his quotidian duties it took time to compartmentalize his mind storing away the pain that whistled through him with the constancy of breath zilin opened his eyes through the mist of his pain and the steadily drumming summer rain he observed his beijing his love for it overflowed his heart for a moment at least easing his agony he remembered as a man of middle years being taken to zhoukoudian southwest of the modern city to inspect the site of the discovery of the remains of peking man he had felt such excitement and suchwhat would one call itpride perhaps as he squatted in the ancient dust the centuries had rolled back returning him to the dawn of man it had been here along the most strategic route on all of the asian continent that man had made his early mark here at the confluence of the vast yellow river plain and the darkling mountains to the northeast traders made their arduous way on this important northsouth route and here was where they had to cross the yongding river at just this spot downstream of the mountains to the west and the dense overgrown marshes to the east here the settlement of what was to become beijing began under the zhou during the warring states period somewhere between and bc it was known as ji the reeds after the fall of the tang dynasty it lost its status as a frontier province incorporated into the northern empire in ad it became known as tanjing by the khitan founders of the kiao dynasty by the beginning of the twelfth century when the jurched succeeded the khitan the name had been changed to zhongdu central capital one hundred years later the mongols razed it during their war with the jurched but the importance of its position was not lost on the victorious khublai who in decided to make it his home it was dadu the great capital to the mongols but to the visiting marco polo it was cambaluc a corruption of the mongol word khanbaliq the khans town by that time it was already vast when in the yuan were defeated by zhou yuanzhang this founder of the ming dynasty renamed the city beiping northern peace it was inherited by one of his sons later titled the king of yuan when he came to power in he decided to move the countrys capital back from nanking beiping became beijing northern capital under this ruler the city took on roughly the shape it has today to the north new walls were built inside the old fortifications excluding a large portion of the yuan town to the south a wall of earth was built in and later in rebuilt in brick enclosing much of the former mongolian sphere this gave beijing the appearance of being a double city the one roughly square the other rectangular zilin turned his head the rain battered against the windows as the limousine sped through the wide boulevards of the city there was almost no traffic and they were well away from the bus and trolley routes how he loved every year of this great citys rich history how he relished having been born chinese having lived his life here but in the west the future of china lay waiting like a poisonous creature that was nevertheless essential to the continued existence of civilized man the technology of the west had made zilin walk a deathdefying tightrope almost all his adult life now he knew it was time to either master it or to see that in reaching out for it he had been fatally bitten the foul weather had turned the vast hall of the premier as chill and dank as a grave at the bottom of the sea the mist of the centuries seemed to hang in the air to coat the hard wooden furniture as if with a new coat of lemon oil oddly the room had the same smell as zhoukoudian where zilin had crouched in the dust of the eons so long ago to observe the place in the earth where peking man had been found enwombed by the ages it was after all a certain scent that by its very existence smacked of petrification in zhoukoudian it was as if the world had not advanced even one day since the living peking man made his stooped way over the same terrain so many eons ago here in this enormous space it was not zilin thought very much different as he approached the far end of the room in the company of the trembling zhang hua and the four guards who had escorted him from his office he could see that wu aiping was already present he sat folded up in the same carved ebony chair in which he had sat during their first confrontation only weeks before the premier was at his accustomed station behind the high wooden desk his face was surmounted by the mask of power that network of lines and sunken hollows that turned young men old that turned old mens hearts into ash at that moment the procession passed a mirror set into a wall and zilin chanced to look into it what he saw there shocked him he saw the mask of the premier clamped tightly onto his own face all the great love that had surrounded him like a comforting blanket during his ride through the streets of beijing evaporated now he felt only the chill walls of the corridors of power down which he had trod for so many long years he thought of all the time he had spent watching and waiting for just the right moments to play his strategy out spinning his complex webs of intrigue patiently searching for the right set of circumstances that would he had been certain bring him the openings he needed for the final phases of his plan it all came down to this one moment in time yet his mind was filled only with the pain he had caused those who had loved him he shrank from their sad floating faces from their tears from the unutterable loss of the severing then he thought of his sons how he longed to see them both to look at them to see the sun in their eyes zilin and zhang hua sat we are here today the premier began to hear charges of the most serious nature which are being brought against one of our most respected senior ministers out of the corner of his eye zilin saw the slight smirk spreading across wu aipings face this is the moment he thought that my enemy has been waiting for since he insinuated himself into the gun wu aiping the premier said solemnly please stand and face me with pleasure comrade premier the man rose to his full imposing height clasped in his left hand was a sheaf of papers the incriminating evidence i shouldnt wonder zilin thought shi zilin the premier said turning his round head slightly due to your advanced years i will not require you to stand during this hearing that is quite all right sir zilin took zhang huas hand in his felt the other mans strength levering him to his feet i am quite capable i am not yet an invalid the premier nodded he fixed his attention on a middle ground between the two last night i received by special courier a set of documents he riffled some papers i have them here with me now having spent all night with my advisors crosschecking their validity wu aiping could not suppress the glint of triumph in his eyes you found everything in order i trust comrade premier indeed i did wu aiping nodded any additional questions you may have can be answered by shi zilins aide zhang hua he turned his head so that he could gaze upon zilin when he said this last zhang hua has been in my employ for the past months zhang hua the premier said heavily will you affirm this statement zilin had not moved at all at wu aipings pronouncement he had evinced no outward reaction this at least had angered wu aiping who in delicious anticipation had longed to see his hated enemy squirm beneath the blade of the knife he had prepared for him however when zhang hua struggled to his feet it was the supposedly infirm zilin who steadied him with a hand and forearm which when the lesser minister grasped them communicated great warmth and power zhang hua straightened himself and gaining courage from the old man next to him said in a clear firm voice i deny the allegation sir what wu aiping took a step toward him but was frozen in place by a gesture from the premier please explain this shi tong zhi the premier said i will do my best sir zilin took a deep breath i had suspected for some time that a group of ministers whose radical philosophy was antithetical both to mine and to that of the current regime was gaining in power when it became known to me that wu aiping had become the head of this group i determined to set about trapping him and exposing the entire qun once and for all to that end i used my assistant with his consent i set him up in a clandestine and quite illicit sexual liaison this was extremely difficult for minister zhang hua since such an indiscretion is not in his nature and further the secrecy of the operation obliged us to keep the truth even from the members of his family it was a dangerous ploy but it worked wu aiping searching for a way to infiltrate my office discovered the false liaison and using photographs commenced to blackmail zhang hua into delivering to him information of the most sensitive nature naturally comrade premier wu aiping was delivered only information i wished him to have wu aiping was white with rage i will no longer stand by and listen to this he cried these lies are a mockery of silence roared the premier he loved using a voice that for the most part at least was soft and pleasingly modulated as another occasional manifestation of his ultimate power he leaned forward so that his tunicclad chest pressed against the high wooden bane do not dare speak out of turn comrade minister not with these confirmations i have here in my fist of the embezzlement of funds for which you must hold yourself and your socalled qun accountable but comrade premier that is easily explained wu aiping said with a touch of desperation in his voice you see the money i borrowed from my ministry has been funneled into the hong kong firm of five star pacific oh i know wu aiping the premier said i know all about you and five star pacific the tone of his voice chilled wu aipings blood he knew at that moment that his life had become worthless but how how the documents i and my staff pored over so assiduously last night were not your poor excuse for evidence but an entire dossier compiled by shi tong zhi and zhang tong zhi they show conclusively your involvement with five star pacific a company which has for some time been infiltrated by sir john bluestone who through shi zilins diligence we have discovered to be the kgbs highestranking agent in that part of asia the soviets wu aiping said in a strangled voice but this is impossible the faangwailoh is shi zilins agent he is deeply involved in five star pacific on the contrary wu tong zhi the premier said with finality it is you and your compatriots who are involved in the company controlled by the soviets twelve million american dollars deep can you deny making these moneydraft transfers no but do you deny that your plot against shi tong zhi was to be the first step in the furtherance of your own power within this government with all respect i reject the notion you will answer this court truthfully wu tong zhi or suffer the consequences my loyalty is beyond reproach i must protest do not speak to this court of loyalty you are hereby stripped of all rights and privileges furthermore you are remanded to the political prosecution detention center pending further action this is all a terrible mistake comrade premier you have been traduced almost wu tong zhi almost but through shi tong zhi and zhang tong zhis diligence you have been trapped within your own game at that moment zhang hua who during this discursive and highly charged exchange had been trembling more and more gave a little cry with a convulsive shudder he broke away from zilins clandestine hold and pitched forward onto his face ah buddha zilin breathed with difficulty he got down on his knees though the pain was excruciating zhang hua he called zhang hua the premier signed to his guards who rushed to aid the stricken minister in a moment the premiers personal doctor hurried into the hall he knelt beside zhang huas immobile body turning him over with such care that zilin began to weep until the moment of his death zilin would remember this instant with crystal clarity the unknown doctors gentle hands turning zhang hua so that his ashen face was raised toward the ceiling high above his mind told him that this was joss bad joss for them both but his heart cried out in anguish what matter his moment of ultimate triumph over the qun after eleven years it was meaningless now that zhang hua was not here to share it with him zhang hua who had known his duty and had turned his life inside out for zilin is this a heros end zilin asked himself he felt the loss of his longtime friend with the same acuteness as that with which he would feel the amputation of a leg he was a true cripple now perhaps in a way he had been a cripple all his life he did not know where to begin in attempting to encompass this well of sadness rushing back at him were not merely the years spent in the company of this man but the moments when he gave up athena jake sheng li and the infant who had become nichiren the grief was too much for him to bear his head bowed beneath the weight and his heart felt like lead throbbing in his chest like a wound that would not heal joss he thought joss and then i must not let this happen to my sons im afraid there is nothing i can do the doctor said to the premier a moment later needlessly confirming what zilin had felt the moment zhang hua pitched away from him the doctor stood before the premier like a prisoner in the dock his heart simply ceased to beat i suspect a massive myocardial infarction but without an autopsy theres really no way to be certain the premier gestured to his guards come and take wu long zhi away he said the look on his face is unsettling my stomach dazedly wu aiping allowed himself to be led out of the room he said nothing his eyes were glazed now the premier climbed down from his bane he was a tiny man smaller by far than the wizened zilin he stood very close to his senior minister his old eyes watched as zilin held zhang huas head in his lap at last he bent down helped zilin to his feet come he said his voice was now as soft as velvet come with me behind their backs zhang hua was taken away in a litter the loss is great my friend i know he said softly but it is tempered by the knowledge of your success the other members of the qun are being rounded up now as to the party chief and the defense minister warrants are being drawn up now we have to be circumspect with them still the amount of power they have been amassing is extraordinary until i myself read through the evidence that you and your office clan destinely accumulated i would never have believed that these peoplethis quncould have such deeprooted strength they rose on mighty wings to power heretofore unimaginable the premier nodded at zilins use of his own words at their previous meeting modernday boxers yes they were bent on the destruction of this regime you were correct in that also we needed your plan to trap them to get down through all the layers of deceit the qun was composed of many more comrades than i thought possible once again i owe you my life how many times must you save this unworthy self before you are satisfied it is my job to be your stalking horse comrade premier zilin said those who would seek to destroy you have in me an implacable enemy they expend all their energy on bringing me down all roads in beijing lead through shi zilin the premier touched his longtime friend on his shoulder it has been so i suppose for longer than we both care to remember old friend heya we all have sacrifices to make i fear that this time the price has been far too high we will do what we can zhang hua will be remembered as a hero of the revolution in a public ceremony his eldest son will receive the medal that comrade premier with all due respect i beg of you no ceremonies allow the dead to remain at rest shi zilin the country should know we know comrade premier perhaps that is too much already they were at the far end of the hall of supreme harmony now windows rose above their heads long and narrow like crystal swords how is your pain zilin shrugged what was the point of answering the gray rain beat against the windows desperate to be heard only the elements remain in the end the premier said so buddha tells us what place has buddha in our modern state the premier smiled slowly it is buddha who has sustained you all these long years shi zilin has he not it was a rhetorical question and zilin had better sense than to say a word did you think i was ignorant of your climbs into the temple of the sleeping buddha or of your hours of meditation there it is antithetical zilin said you are antithetical shi zilin if the truth be told the premier put his hands behind his back clasping them loosely i must confess that i envy you thatwhat shall we call itthat perfect peace your meditations at wofosi bring you not perfect zilin shook his head without my sons now i cannot feel even a semblance of peace what can be done i must go to hong kong there was a great silence between them then that the rain attempted to fill up with its anarchic drumming did you plan this all the time zilin gave a wan ironic smile some things comrade premier even i cannot plan then you will go what then the premier asked you know it cannot end there it can if buddha wills it they were out of all sight enwrapped by the mist of the ages it clung to them tike tiny spectral hands in china the past had a way of remaining very much alive and if he does not you know the rest zilin said i shall not return to beijing somewhere it seemed the spirits of all the ancestors were crying out as one whatever am i going to do without you the premier said his voice was muffled by the mist or perhaps by the spirits calling the wind will still ride the mountains the yellow river will still ebb and flow what will china do without your guidance we are still children here despiteor more accurately because ofhow passionately we cleave to the notion that we are the only truly civilized nation on earth we have been bloodthirsty in the pursuit of our civilization we have only done what we thought most prudent that i believe zilin said is the most telling indictment of our political system perhaps the premier said distantly perhaps zilin felt tired and he had not yet begun his journey yuri lantin our great enemy is gone and general karpov the mastermind of moonstone as well the premier was shaking his head you were right about daniella vorkuta all along i must admit to having doubts about your plan shi zilin i myself find the personalities of faangwailoh impenetrable i cannot fathom how you understand them and besides she is a woman as laotse taught me premier i use each person in accordance with his or her talents there is no such thing as a useless individual i spent over a decade studying the lines of power within and without the soviet spy apparatus known as the kgb it was my desire from the first to allow them to do for us that of which we ourselves were incapable toward that end i studied my files i came upon daniella vorkuta her unique mind coupled with the circumstances of her advancementthat is that she was a womangave me the germ of the idea i am still at a loss to see how you could create the situation of the killing ground for anatoly karpov and yuri lantin he had some difficulty with the foreign names in this case i created nothing i merely saw a latent pattern among them and with a certain amount of doctored intelligence funneled in to daniella vorkuta set that pattern into motion the kernel was always there waiting to be let loose i thank buddha that general vorkuta possessed the strength of spirit and the consuming ambition that i saw nesting inside her she acted yes she acted i had nothing to do with that i merely set her upon the stage but only you shi zilin could see the way to the killing ground you have created victory out of the very ether around us i understand now why it is known as stealing the light i did only my duty comrade premier zilin said softly his mind was on the loss of zhang hua and this praise was he felt unseemly you have made the tao powerful once again the premier said i am most grateful with moonstone hanging like a sword over us it was impossible to move against the qun outright it had given them much added support i am relieved that that particular threat is ended perhaps one day we shall have to be as afraid of daniella vorkuta as we were of the two men zilin said though i have convinced her that the way to undermine us is through hong kong and though we control her through her hong kong network one can never tell what power will do to the soul of even the hardiest individual but soon we will have kam sang its dangerous secret is safe for the time being soon i think we shall have to allow our allies and our enemies a glimpse into what we have created in kam sang but we must always remember with the utmost clarity our bloodthirsty past the purpose of kam sang after all is to have it not to use it in that respect yuri lantin and wu aiping were cut from the same cloth they both wished to goad us into a conflagration the one to prove our inferiority the other to prove our superiority you and i know that chinas future lies down another path through hong kong it is the only way for us now i must be off comrade premier the other man came out of his thoughts of course how unthinking of me he took zilin by the arm i will hear from you at journeys end zilin looked into the premiers eyes either from me or from them do you really think thats wise in the end the premier looked away from that magnetic gaze he felt humbled by the old mans power his voice echoed in that vast ancient hall though it was only the two of them who could hear it i accept your judgment jian jake and bliss on a vigil outside the factory that manufactured samurai warriors he hadnt spoken in more than two hours and bliss was becoming concerned i dont even know what were doing here she said jake said nothing but continued to stare at the factory entrance after he had left formidable sung he had taken a close look at every point of the buildings exterior because of its position wedged between other such structures there was no possible egress other than the one jake had used even the back of the factory abutted the windowless wall of a warehouse in the next street above it was a solid block of dollsized apartments jake three of the young girls were leaving their hair free of the cotton bands shone in the streetlights jake whats the matter with you why didnt you tell me your father was three oaths tsun because first you never asked and second hes not my real father he adopted me when i was very young i never knew my real father or mother three oaths tsun told me that i was born in burma while my mother was on her journey south from the mainland her head turned and she watched his profile so strong and powerful why is it important i would think so he said distantly since three oaths tsun is the dragon of the yuhnhyun bliss seemed startled and for the first time he divided his attention between the entranceway and her face who told you that she asked formidable sung hes wrong really she felt the tension building uncomfortably and turned her head away lets not talk like this she said softly it disturbs me im sorry about that jake said with a hint of sarcasm but think how i feel you promised to tell me everything youve told me nothing i learned nothing from david oh she told him simply all he said was huo yan i dont know what that means and neither do you it may mean nothing at all i didnt guarantee that youd learn anything from him when i allowed you to go to the rdv jake was very angry now and it was all bliss could do not to show her fear of his rising intrinsic energy she felt as if she were out in the open facing the onset of a typhoon you werent ready to know she stopped abruptly aware of how wrong her words were she thought ah buddha ive done it now jakes face was dark with rage and now bliss felt her heart shrivel beneath this onslaught i wasnt ready who makes that decision your father the dragon of the yuhnhyun bliss knew that she had absolutely no choice now not if she wanted to keep the lid on this thing a moment longer yes the dragon of the yuhnhyun she said but he isnt my father youd better tell me who he is then bliss took a deep breath hes your father jake shi zilin her words rang in his head but in their iteration they lost all meaning in the stunned silence jake almost missed formidable sung the was emerging from the factorys entrance along with three of the triad my father why are we here jake my father is alive but how why hasnt he contacted me to let me know hes shi zilin jake shi zilin what do you think it would have done to your career had the quarry known that one of the most senior ministers in beijing was your father buddha hes alive jake felt elation fear and apprehension all struggling for supremacy in his mind his father alive for so long he had been utterly alone in life in a sense he saw now he had made himself that way turning away from the women who loved him why was it an insane form of atonement for having been left an orphan whom the marocs out of pure human kindness had taken in and loved until the moment of their deaths did he think that this statelessness this limbo in which he had no family ties was his joss that he could do nothing to overcome it at this moment he felt the fu shard like a living coal against his thigh nichirens piece but from the same source that link he felt certain was what had brought his father back from the dead my father my father my father he even loved the sound the words made in his mind they played a melody there of his own invention his father one of the senior ministers in beijing did that make him friend or foe just as important what did that make jake bliss was part of the yuhnhyun so she said was he what did that make him wasnt it obvious that the yuhnhyun was a communist chinese operation and that he had been an unwitting part of it for how long he wondered it was incredible really he and nichiren mortal enemies locked in a global chase were unwittingly or not working within the same operation on the same side and that side was the communist chinese what have i become jake asked himself merely a piece in a gigantic game of wei qi and mariana david oh what did they die for have i any real idea he realized that he did not formidable sung jake snapped out of his shock what is formidable sung why weve been on this vigil jake followed her glance saw the and his guard he nodded hes the reason he said he began to move bliss with him as constant as a shadow formidable sungs going to lead me right to nichiren because of the incident at lantins daniella had failed to make two successive telephone rdvs with chimera following the incident she had been too busy poring over lantins cache of documents to think of anything else only questions from the brace of bloodhounds assigned to the investigation of comrade lantins death interrupted her they had found the note she had typewritten on lantins machine outlining the precipitous decline of general anatoly karpovs state of mental health how operation moonstone had been created by someone who in effect was already a madman how lantin had been gulled by the madman and how much it had cost the soviet union only now the note ended do i understand that moonstone put us a mere heartbeat away from a nuclear war i cannot live with that knowledge daniella had adorned the bottom of the sheet with an excellent forgery of lantins signature that was that the bloodhounds were idiots which hardly surprised her but even if they had been as canny as lantin himself there would never have been any suspicion cast on her the neatness of the package she had presented to them had drawn them to the properif falseconclusions as a flame will a moth it appealed to their analretentive minds bureaucrats as for the dossiers she was astonished not by the plethora of minor and notsominor peccadillos of moscows elite ministers but that yuri lantin had managed to amass so much physical evidence on all of them the nature of his power base had become clear to her at once and she had lost little time in establishing herself in the breach left by both lantin and karpov considering her skills and the fortune in intelligence she had filched from lantins apartment it was not particularly difficult it merely meant that several days went by before she had a chance to reestablish communications with chimera when she did it made her sorry that she had been so wrapped up in her internal affairs for that long what he had for her was the most promising intelligence yet kam sangs secret it appeared was not the water desalinization plant encompassed within it it is military in nature chimeras electronic voice buzzed in her ear and certainly inimical to us its secret should be breached as soon as is practicable yes daniella thought breaking the connection well before the ninetysecond limit it will be breached but for that we have time now in bed hours later she closed her eyes and sighed deeply now she was doubly relieved at lantins death that insane moonstone operation was her first order of business tomorrow morning it would be closed down as would the puppet war the vietnamese were waging with the chinese i was right all along she told herself hong kong is the key it always has been now im right inside the colony just where i want to be she thought of the danger lurking like a darkeyed adder within the heart of kam sang and shuddered what lantin and karpov had almost unleashed on the world no one would know but she the unknown weapon within kam sang was still asleep daniella determined that whatever it turned out to be it would sleep for all time the oily water lapped drowsily against the wooden pilings fittings creaked aboard the floating city of the hakka just beyond the conglomeration of junks the crimson yellow and emerald lights of jumbo spangled the water the last of the motor launches was bringing the latenight revelers back from its bejeweled decks three oaths tsun was up near the bow of his junk he had just mounted the companionway from the cabin below decks where he had finished making love with neon chow she had wanted him to stay by her slick sticky side melded by the heat of sex he had complied up to a point feeling her thigh heavy across his knee until her breathing had slowed and deepened rhythmically while she slept he left her turning his eyes to the stern he could see three or four of his children talking in low tones while they strung lines and rewebbed the thick trolling nets they are good children he thought as he watched them i do not want to lose even one he turned his head quickly away so that only the water could see by the spirit of the white tiger that does not make me a selfish man just a loving one he heard a movement and simultaneously felt the minute change in the motion of the junk as someone came aboard he looked around saw the shadow approach he did not need illumination to recognize the walk dangerous to be here like this he said when the figure was close enough on the eve of the summit i knew you could not meet me in our assigned place he is coming three oaths tsun said after all these years he is leaving beijing our brother the other man said it is almost impossible to believe tomorrow there will be an ending of the yuhnhyun as we have come to know it over the years the figure moved slightly so that the colored lights from jumbo picked out several of his features that means all the fu pieces will come together at last t y chung said there will be no more need for this business war we created we have spent fifty years in the pursuit of this ruse three oaths tsun said passionately this war was necessary so that the other tai pan should not suspect us of collusion i could never have been able to begin pak hanmin otherwise and sir john bluestone would never have become your partner we never would have been able to purchase so many companies tang shan godowns donnelly and tungs tankers southchina electronics fan man metalworks while everyone was centered on our feud we acquired all the outside resources we needed for our part of the yuhnhyun now the only question to be answered is what will happen when the fu pieces are united even i do not know the answer to that it is obvious that the yuhnhyun is not yet complete who owns the fourth piece of the fu until tomorrow it is elder brothers secret but it is already clear that we need all four pieces or we have nothing t y chung looked out to sea his face was filled with sadness nothing he echoed his brother is what we may yet end up with and in the meantime look what the yuhnhyun has done to us two brothers never able to acknowledge our kinship let alone share our lives and our families instead you put your adopted daughter in the gravest danger and i have to spend my evenings with that viper dunghill bluestone three oaths tsun sighed if we did not know the meaning of duty my brother we would be nothing better than the barbarian gwai loh t y chung turned his head spat heavily over the side then i must tell you that there are times when i hate being civilized we should feel only elation now that our elder brother has defeated his enemies in beijing it means the yuhnhyun will work you and i and everyone in hong kong must pray that it does work because otherwise the colony is doomed despite this fiftyyear respite that elder brother rammed through the battle is not yet over i am certain that there are others in the north who wish to see our fragrant harbor subsumed by communism t y chung came and stood beside his brother their shoulders brushed as if by accident we must guard him well here from both the dragons and the fornicating authorities if his identity were to become known to either it would mean the destruction of everything for which we have worked for half a lifetime his protection is paramount our elder brother is an icon he is jade itself perhaps as you have said not a man at all i think that he has made himself over the years what he believed himself to be as a child a celestial guardian of china at the head of the companionway neon chow held her enormous excitement in check when she had crept scarcely daring to breathe up the companionway just after three oaths tsun she had wondered what t y chung three oaths tsuns bitter rival was doing here now she knew dew neh loh moh she thought who would have suspected that three oaths tsun and t y chung were brothers buddha what fantastic knowledge this is three hours before when peter ng had failed to make his rendezvous with sir john bluestone she had been called into service as daniella had told yuri lantin her networks had backup measures built into them neon chow remembered back several weeks to the first coded message she had sent off as she had been instructed she had used the blind postal box drop the morning after dialing the local number she had memorized months ago she had overheard three oaths tsun and bliss talking about the fu neon chow knew what a fu was she just could not fathom its significance in the modernday world less than a week later she had observed three oaths tsun slip off the junk and via a tiny tender climb aboard a lore ha she withheld her excitement and was patient she had discovered his routine twice a week on nights when the moon was down or obscured by clouds in making her decision to follow him neon chow knew that she dared not attempt such a dangerous action more than once she had seen the longrange transceiver and had heard every word three oaths tsun spoke in mandarin there were few dialects neon chow could not understand that was part of her worth as an agent the fu three oaths tsun and the unknown contact spoke of the fu they spoke of power power that could encircle hong kong like a ring and bring to him who held the whole fu incalculable wealth that night she had made her call and spoken the one word mitre into the mouthpiece the next morning her report was in the post box neon chow was in a faceless essentially contactless world she often wondered whether her report had been acted on once or twice when she was feeling particularly depressed she wondered whether it had even been read there was no way for her to know whether what she had discovered was important or trivial this was one of the oddities of her world it was hard to do nothing but watch he had been doing that for so long now eight hours ago it had been evening and he and bliss had been at the plastic samurai factory using a rental car they had followed formidable sung and his retinue to the s villa along the peak gap road the center of hong kong midway between central district and aberdeen perched high in the territory of the predatory kites large black flesheaters that swung through the evening skies in everdecreasing spirals no one had gone inside after formidable sung had settled in for the night no one had come out that was unusual the triad dragon liked the colonys nightlife when jake had told this to bliss she had said somethings up something like that triad summit bliss shook her head theyll kill each other unless nichiren gives them a compelling enough reason not to but why would they even listen to him hes japanese theres a natural enmity there jake recalled mikios files which showed that nichiren had emigrated to japan with his mother when he was less than a year old where had he come from why would chinese listen to him unless what if nichirens chinese bliss had stared at him what thats the only way it makes sense this triad summit i thought his mother was japanese she was jake said thoughtfully but who knows if she was his real mother besides even if she was his father could have been chinese hes not japanese not chinese either they would hate him even more then not necessarily hes part of the yuhnhyun so we must assume that hes being run by the communist chinese not the russians hes being doubled and quite cleverly so somehow i dont think my father would want the triad dragons to get wind of where the power of the yuhnhyun ultimately lies formidable sung himself believes that three oaths tsun is the rings dragon i think its safe to assume that the rest of the dragons have the same notion nichirens involvement continues the ruse but adding an international skew to it how do you think theyd react to knowing that perhaps the single most important soviet agent is secretly in league with them itd be a great incentive to go in bliss admitted despite their bickering exactly jake thought a moment who else is involved in the yuhnhyunt i dont know jake looked hard into her eyes is that the truth yes all right above their heads a cloud luminescent with moonlight pierced the utter darkness of the heavens but for a lack of discernible eyes it might have been a coiled dragon jake she said each day were together there must be a thousand things i feel weve forgotten to say to each other time goes by so swiftly when i look at you sometimes i see a man with his hands tied behind his back does that make any sense to you he said nothing staring out into the night but bliss felt a subtle stirring within him if only she could get him to spew out the poison that had been inside him for so long what was the dark secret he felt unable to share with anyone he will destroy himself one of these days the thought came upon bliss with breathtaking suddenness she knew that she must deflect him somehow she remembered a poem that fo saan had often spoken when she could not articulate what was troubling her she wondered whether he had done so with jake to see she spoke it now down the wellechoing a plovers cry that is all jake settled himself into their rock niche i remember that he said quietly its been a long time since i recalled its meaning bliss felt the softening inside him as keenly as if it were her own emotion she said not a word at last when jake felt the core of him reforming in the center of his beating heart he began you know that i have been married twice the first time i was very young in those days as in the following ones the quarry came first but ting was even younger than i she could understand everything but why i was never with her marriage makes no sense for the young i have learned when one is still searching for the key to oneself it is no time to take on the responsibility for another life or lives here jake paused passing his tongue across his dry lips his mouth felt full of cotton he continued to force himself into deep even breathing those were foolish days for me bliss i wanted it all a wife a family a life inside the quarry it was an impossibility ting was chiuchow but she was well versed in the ways of the gwai loh we had a daughter as lan grew so did the rifts between myself and my wife we were both in the grip of growing pains especially me naturally lan was affected by our quarrels the friction between us she did notcould notunderstand that my absences were not actually directed at her in any event she became rebellious unhappy at home she fled this was in hong kong of course she reached out and found the anarchic wildness i had possessed as a child she made it her own the triads would not have her they laughed at her she was only twelve she was female and she was half gwai loh thus she was forced farther afield three years ago i was sent on a highly classified mission my destination was a tiny village on the sumchun river something went wrong terribly wrong perhaps we were traduced there was a pitched battle it was like a war in microcosm the closer jake came to the heart of it the shorter and choppier his sentences became his breath felt hot and he had begun to sweat profusely in the midst of it i knew operations mounted against us all have a different feel depending on who has devised them like a fingerprint in code signaling its called a fist it dawned on me that a master had planned the defense a strategist it had about it the precision of a wet qi endgame you must understand that our attack was like lightning the counterattack was the same we were unprepared for that strategy it unnerved some of the men under me it hampered their effectiveness we were being defeated and defeat of course meant death there was blood all around seeping into the ground soaking the heavy foliage floating out into the muddy middle of the sumchun river nichiren was there directing the opposition as if he were placing his pieces onto the wei qi board yet he did not hold himself aloof he killed two of my men it appeared as if it was going to be a rout then i became aware of another element entering the battle chinese i recognized some of them as a highly radical splinter triad who worked the border bringing people out from communist china jake swallowed his eyes watched bliss with a kind of manic intensity i suppose i was looking at her for some time before i knew who she really was she had changed so much and yet she was still my little girl my lan for a long time then there was silence jake was lost within the chaotic litter of his own thoughts as he saw it reproduced across bliss beautiful face he did not begin again until bliss stirred refocusing him i watched as she slit the throat of one of nichirens men when it resumed jakes voice had taken on an odd detached quality she did it with great skill with the kind of animal fierceness a lioness shows when her cubs are threatened i could tell there was no real pleasure in it for her just duty it was something she believed in something neither her mother nor i could give to her and in the next moment blood flew from her she twisted like a reed in the wind bullets broke her tore through her flesh nichiren ran from what he had done and i ran after him not very far of course the jungle had swallowed him whole when i returned my dead daughter was gone taken by her triad cohorts bliss stared unblinking at jake for a time at length he closed his eyes with the moonlight filling his eyelids with phosphorescence it seemed as though he were still watching her the taiwanese was in a lousy mood his brother had been drowned in the indoor pool at morrison hill two days ago the bomb he had set in macao had failed to terminate his target and to top it all off he had been crouched here like a bear for more than eight hours awaiting his chance he put the infrared nightscope up to his right eye and peered through it again bliss head then jakes came into focus stupid of the man he thought to take a woman into a situation like this no wonder he was going to die the taiwanese had traced them through the rentalcar firm they had used as easy as falling off a log he should have been home by now in taipei he had a blind girl named mo who could make him come just by walking across his naked back with her bare feet she was otherworldly that one he thought now he missed her he had not had sex since he had taken on this assignment and his testicles were tender hard with their load the taiwanese thought that he would take the chinese woman after he had terminated his target she would not be as good as mo but she would have to do that was all right the taiwanese was aware that the smell of blood increased his ardor during sex hed make certain there was some of that when he took this woman that would make up for the fact that he was not home with mo at least she wasnt occidental occidental women set his teeth on edge the taiwanese shifted slightly and he felt his testicles weighing heavy between his legs he took another look at the girl through the scope it was attached to the lyson ty submachine pistol it was rather a new toy for him he had been using the swedish kulspruta because he knew it to be the most powerful submachine gun in the world that was before his new masters had introduced him to the lyson it shot eight hundred fifty rounds per minute of the kind of ammunition he liked best parabellum the taiwanese thought about his instructions shoot on sight but that was before his brother had been held underwater to drown his target was fully in the crosshairs now illuminated in ghostly fashion by the infrared all he needed to do was squeeze the trigger and inside of three seconds there would be nothing of the man and the woman but twin smears across the rocks so easy to do but the taiwanese would never consider such a thing not now he was a black belt in tae kwon do the man in his sights had killed his brother there was a matter of honor to be avenged now it was a matter between men face to face it had nothing at all to do with eight hundred fifty rounds of parabellum ammunition a minute the taiwanese set the lyson aside he slid off the rock on which he had been crouching this time jake felt the approach he had been deep in chahm hat sinking into his surroundings he had become part of the humid night filled with drifting cloud cicadas buzzing nocturnal animals prowling the night wind through the trees fo saan had taught him to do more than listen to the night he had instructed jake on how to become one with it consequently jake felt the taiwaneses approach to his heightened senses it was as if a dark inimical tunnel had appeareda blackness deeper than the night he turned but he was obliged to climb over the rock face he had carefully put at their backs at this time of the night it was slippery with dew he lost fractions of a second in that brief span of time he heard the slight whirring and rather than protect himself kicked back at the startled bliss as she rose knocking her off her feet and out of harms way jake knew a nunchaku when he heard it the weapon had a distinctive sound a trilling of a diurnal lark out of character with the night his concern for bliss cost him and perhaps the taiwanese had been right about him it would have been different had he been alone up here among the hawks nests and the eyries of the wealthy the working end of the chainandmetalbar nunchaku struck him across his hip and his entire right side went numb fell on his face in the wet grass saw bliss make a lunge for the shadow take hold and bring it down faint moonlight inconstant through the sliding silent clouds illuminated the taiwanese his flat shining face was intent on his work it gave him the appearance of a stone god a coldness had invaded jakes body and he struggled to overcome it he did not waste time in trying to move that would have been foolish he concentrated instead on flushing the numbness from his system the taiwanese was on top of bliss her legs were splayed open beneath him just as if they were coupling the intensity of their struggle held sexual implications as well out in the night with only the moon and the clouds as mute audience the sight was surrealistic jake saw bliss use an atemi to the taiwaneses liver he rolled half off her at the same time striking upward with his knee bliss still partially pinned beneath him could not avoid that blow to her pelvic bone jake heard her moan the taiwanese took the initiative immediately raining a series of percussion strikes across her chest and abdomen with his knuckles karate jake thought it was important now that his concern for bliss not deflect him from what he had to do this was not idle time for him he needed to get a sense of the taiwaneses style his strengths and weaknesses his spirit feeling in his extremities was coming back he concentrated on his breathing slowing and deepening it all the more it was important to help his system by oxygenating it the taiwanese seemed to want to end his struggle with bliss quickly she was more tenacious than he had anticipated she had seen jakes incapacitation knew that it was incumbent on her to delay him long enough for jake to recover as the taiwanese became more desperate to break away he stepped up his attack he was angry that this woman seemed to have the power to keep him here against his will and it was this anger perhaps that saved her anger had no place in handtohand combat emotion impaired judgments that had to be made at splitsecond intervals he put more effort into his strikes but they were more erratic somewhat easier to defend against he was of course unaware of this and his inability to make a winning blow only increased his anger beneath him bliss felt the pain and swelling trebling every few seconds the taiwanese was very strong and he knew his karate he was hurting her badly even through every defense she threw at him once bliss thought she had passed out she had lost all sense of time and that was bad she seemed to be adrift on a sea of agony as if she had been thrown into a pit of flame her nerves screamed at her to stop to break away but she thought only of jake and she kept going fighting against this powerful foe with all her waning strength jake rolled over he was barely a yard away it seemed as if it were a mile he regained his feet and sucked in the moist air he was panting like an outofshape runner he thought of what kamisaka had said to him launched himself at the taiwanese used a double atemi the heels of both clasped hands into the soft flesh above the mans kidneys the strike went deep it had all his strength combined with his momentum behind it bliss saw the taiwaneses face screw up in agony his teeth draw back from his livercolored lips in a terrible grimace he made no sound at all save an involuntary wheeze as all air escaped him his hands ceased their attack he rolled all the way off her and the release of tension brought spots before her eyes the taiwanese came after jake he was unmindful of the pain he did not bother to look for the nunchaku his eyes were filled with the image of his brothers bloated face the eyes dull and filmy with exposure to chlorine jake went into sumi otoshi grabbing the outside of the taiwaneses extended right arm as soon as he made contact he pulled toward him pivoting to his left as he did so this brought the taiwanese off balance and jake was able to bring his right arm up above the others shoulder and slamming it against the side of his face pulled sharply down on the right arm the resultant vectors of force were inescapable the taiwanese found himself thrown to the hard ground immediately he kicked out connecting with jakes ankle jake fell and the taiwanese struck him in the face blood gushed from jakes nose and the taiwanese brought the edge of his callused hand down on the point of jakes shoulder jake collapsed and the taiwanese grinning with the onset of the victory adrenaline scrambled after him right into an atemi that broke three ribs the grin froze on his face his eyes opened in astonishment as jake rose as if from the dead chopping down with a vicious atemi that broke the taiwaneses neck he died still thinking that he had won at dusk formidable sung emerged from his villa and the tail began jake and bliss had held each other until long after dawn jake was dizzy wracked with pain he was astounded to discover that he was more concerned with bliss pain he had been patient going over her body inch by inch assessing the damage there had been nothing broken by what miracle he could not imagine but much of bliss extraordinary golden skin was marred by bruises growing darker and more tender by the hour burst blood vessels traced themselves like grasping hands across her belly and breasts she had sat curled against him her head against his chest while he made his examination her thick glossy hair fluttered against his neck and chin she had made no sound even during his deepest probings around her rib cage where he knew that the pain must be extreme still he was aware of her deep breathing and knew what she was attempting to dispel she had spoken his name after he was finished as if to assure herself of his closeness he had kissed her forehead the tip of her nose her tender lips he had been overwhelmed by the relief he felt at her safety they stayed like that through most of the cloudy day except for the brief times when one or the other rose to urinate into the trees or to stretch their legs they remained locked together they had long since finished the food they had brought with them they were content to drink the lukewarm water from the canteen by their side it was odd that formidable sung had not gone to the office that he had gone nowhere at all during the daylight hours twilight had brought an end to their cramped waiting the sleek maroon mercedes sel wound with great alacrity across the mountainous roads along the center of the island jake had trouble keeping up in the fourcylinder nissan and was grateful that there were few straightaways for the mercedes with its powerful v to open up an insurmountable lead now and again he could see formidable sungs silhouette in the front of the mercedes on the passengers side the inside light was on as if the were reading as his driver negotiated the twisting hairpin turns jake drove the nissan without lights that was dangerous but not as dangerous as alerting formidable sung that he was under surveillance darkness crept over the outflung surface of the south china sea far below their rushing bulk and here and there a ships sapphire and ruby running lights burned like living jewels the mercedes raced with almost reckless abandon as if it were late for a vital rendezvous the driver was very good which was fortunate for these roads under construction during the day were a maze of sawhorses swinging lanterns and minor detours across dusty shoulders overgrown with wild foliage they were climbing the north side of violet hill just beyond the crest the mercedes suddenly went off the road jake slowed but even so he almost missed the turnoff it was at a ninetydegree angle from the main road it was paved for perhaps a hundred yards soon enough it turned into a dirt track but one that was obviously well used jake was crawling along the dense woods on either side made it seem like the middle of the night he stopped the nissan and sticking his head out the open window listened intently he could hear no other engine running he went ahead cautiously and when he found a gap in the trees he pulled the nissan in and shut off the ignition they approached on foot the trees gave way almost immediately they found themselves next to a villa roofed with azure tiles and set into the side of the cliff that dropped down to repulse bay jake took bliss hand and they worked their way around to a point where they had a clear view of the front door a few steps farther on they caught a glimpse of a wide woodbeamed veranda built out from the back of the house it wrapped around the right side of the house beyond which jake and bliss crouched halfhidden by chrysanthemum and peony bushes jake saw that there was easy access to the veranda from a rock promontory not more than three feet from them the maroon mercedes was parked in a graveled offshoot of the shallow semicircular driveway in a moment lights came on along the front of the villa and across the expanse of the veranda in back jake saw two men come out and stand in the semidarkness then he heard more cars coming and he took bliss farther back into the protection of the shadowed bushes its him the triangular feline head with its huge obsidian eyes bobbing like a lethal stalk at the end of his swans neck the small flat ears barely visible through the long black hair moving along the slate path to the house with the dangerous liquid grace of a cat loping through the jungle floor nichiren bliss so close beside jake felt the tension flooding through him her fingers closed down on the corded muscles of his upper arm dont she whispered fiercely from their place of concealment there are others coming youve waited too long to jump the gun now jake knew she was right but it was not easy to crouch here in the shadows when his nemesis was less than a hundred yards away a shadow he had been chasing over all the continents of the world for the past three years with a vengeance ever since the sumchun river now with the last of the crimson and deep yellow light fading from the west jake saw three oaths tsun and t y chung standing side by side on the veranda i dont get it jake said your father and chung are bitter enemies thats what i thought bliss said thinking how much has my father kept from me off to one side formidable sung and nichiren were speaking in low tones a pair of cars drew up out stepped venerable chen and sharktooth tung the dragon of the hak sam triad the two stared at one another for several moments they moved at the same time toward the front door stopped together it was a comedy act despite the circumstances at last three oaths tsun came outside and engaged venerable chen in conversation thus allowing sharktooth tung to go in first without loss of face to either man in a moment three oaths tsun took venerable chen inside theyre all there jake said it was odd though none of them was making a move to begin discussions there was about the scene an air of waiting bliss felt it too somethings going to happen they watched while the sky went dark and the spangle of tankers lights twinkled on the water like fallen stars along the beach lovers strolled hand in hand their faces to the rising moon jake felt the vibration and turned his head a black limo was emerging from the forest it seemed to be coasting so slowly was it going it drew abreast of the front door its engine idled while a thin chinese in a shiny blue suit opened the drivers door and got out his back was rigid and jake recognized the bearing army intuition fluttered the muscles in his lower belly he felt a heat rising in his neck and throat the thin chinese was bending slightly to open the rear door he reached in apparently supporting something then the old man emerged and for the first time in his adult life jake looked upon the face of his father there was absolutely no doubt in his mind as to who this was in the eyes the brow he saw himself reflected as with a tiny thrill a sculptor will when gazing on the face of his first creation it was true he thought everything bliss had told him was true not that he had really doubted her but the shock of the reality was breathtaking nonetheless buddha bliss whispered its shi zilin why has he come here his presence could destroy the entire yuhnhyun if the triad dragons get a hint of who he really is everything will fall apart what was so urgent that it required his physical presence hes in great danger here if the authorities knew she did not need to complete that thought the thin chinese had pulled a walking stick from the interior of the limo now upon handing it to zilin he retired to the car the old man was left to make his way across the slate no one inside the house made a move to help him such a gesture would have meant an enormous loss of face for the old man but all were aware of his presence no one spoke now no one drank no one looked out to sea or to the highrises below now as zilin negotiated the stone stairs three oaths tsun broke away from the others to stand just in the center of the veranda jake who was most attuned to nichiren saw the other stride away from formidable sung at three oaths tsuns side he began to talk at first the older man made no reply then as nichiren became more insistent he began to talk jake could not hear what was being said but he could see well enough the expression on nichirens face dew neh loh moh jake breathed my father is nichirens source as zilin appeared on the deck there was a moment of absolute blankness on nichirens face and that was when jake detached himself from the shadows and hurled himself across the lawn he hit the rocks with an elastic bound bliss screamed after him but he blocked out the sound he was concentrating solely on that peculiar expression he had seen it once before when they had faced each other in ohenro house jake had been struck by it because it had presaged nichirens leap into aggressive action what had he asked three oaths tsun what had the older man replied jake did not know he was only certain that he was already too late in a blur nichiren had gone from absolute motionlessness to violent motion he had slammed into shi zilin whirling the old man off his feet before jake was threequarters of the way to the veranda i want to know who that is nichiren had said at three oaths tsuns side in truth three oaths tsun had not even heard him the first time he said it he was engrossed in the sight of his brother whom he had not seen in fifty years it was the moment he had been dreaming of for decades a reunion of the family he was trembling with the advent his silence however had angered nichiren nichiren repeated the question and this time three oaths tsun heard him he knew an answer was needed now was certainly not the time to tell nichiren that this man was his father and knowing that nichiren was dangerous enough to spot a lie he told him another truth he is your source that was when the blank look had slid over nichirens face like a noh mask what three oaths tsun could not know was that nichirens mother had had an old frayed photograph of zilin and she had carried it with her to japan she had been reluctant to throw it out because over the intervening years looking at it had renewed her desire for revenge on her death nichiren had found it and along with her diary had made the connection now many decades later three oaths tsun had inadvertently provided the next step in the connection that nichirens father was also his source the knowledge had galvanized nichiren i know everything there is to know about you source had said to him over the ether all the suppressed rage and humiliation he had absorbed from his mother that unconsciously he had felt for the father who had abandoned him and his mother to their dark fate boiled up in him red rage shook him to his core to think that for years he had been blindly obeying the orders of the one man in the world whom he had hated all his life the indignity of it the bitter irony caught in his throat threatened to choke him nichiren found that he could not breathe could not even think clearly he wanted to be free to return home to kamisaka to be his own person abruptly he knew such a thing could never be so long as his father was living there was no chance of breaking discipline yet again the man was a magician to have sought him out to have used him in such a manner the scale of the deception that was involved staggered nichiren it frightened him as well he knew that he was powerless against such deviousness he wanted so much to be free free of all the psychic weight with which he had grown up he shook with his rage and his terror of this man fright was almost unknown to nichiren and it made him hate his father all the more that he could engender such an emotion in him kamisakas beautiful body mingled in his mind with the image of his mothers scarred flesh he felt a burning inside him as if it were he who had been marked and indeed he had been marked he saw that now it was the only thing he saw clearly his lungs were bursting with unnatural heat his heart hammered wildly in his chest rage engulfed him like a flash fire he was burning out of control with a guttural growl that felt like the onset of some terrifying elemental force nichiren bounded past three oaths tsun and before those present could overcome their shock had zilin by the throat now you will join my mother only this ultimate atonement can heal her mutilated spirit three oaths tsun heard the words and they made him shiver they seemed to have been uttered by an inhuman larynx involuntarily jakes mouth opened from deep inside him came the roaring of the kiai yell that fo saan had taught him it was an animals call brimming with power and aggressiveness it shivered the trees it rooted everyone on the veranda to the spot it made nichiren pause long enough for jake to make up the last of the distance between them he saw the old mans body being twisted saw the face that reminded him so much of his own passing through the violent air like a waning sun he felt the extraordinary force of nichirens intrinsic energy jake used an elbow atemi the percussive force falling full across nichirens shoulder the important thing was to get zilin away from him there was nothing more in jakes mind at the moment but as he peeled nichiren off the old man as he stumbled locked in nichirens embrace now across the slick polished boards of the veranda lan became unsealed inside him he knew he had been walking on thin ice ever since he had witnessed her death at the sumchun river perhaps his retelling of the incident had caused it or again perhaps it was the touch of nichirens body against his whatever the cause the world narrowed down to one sharp point gone was the thought of the exchange of the fu pieces gone was the thought of kamisakas kindness and love revenge rode like a great kite in his mind blotting out a horizon of possibilities only jake and nichiren existednot this villa not the people standing on the veranda not repulse bay glittering in moonlight far below not even bliss there was a terrifying animal inside him now and it had extended its paws its gaping jaws its unthinking mind leaping into the firelight it had been born in the well of his unsharable sorrow and guilt he was a father who had failed a father who in his own mind at least had been just as much responsible for lans death as had nichiren within the last glint of intelligence in her eyes he had seen reflected his neglect of her mariana an adult might learn ways to deal with his long absences in the field a child could not and in the ending of her life he had seen one terrible tragic result like hammer on anvil it had flattened his heart it had twisted his soul all out of shape since then he had been in the process of dying withdrawing from the world of his own manufacture he had loved lan so much and had never found the ways to tell her love twisted into hate jake and nichiren tumbling across the veranda fetching up against the guardrail nichirens left leg kicked out in a lethal atemi jake rolled away and the guardrail splintered beneath the force jake landed two rapid atemi of his own before nichiren uncoiled like a panther he sprang pinning jake against the rail with a grinding of split wood it gave way they both went over tumbling into the night nichiren stretched twisting he reached upward grasping the lip of the veranda jake just below him locked his legs around nichirens hips he was blind to their situation he only knew that he had found nichiren his mind was filled with lan her voice her bloodflecked face his own tearstreaked image reflected in her shining eyes bahba daddy her last whispered word he had not been able to tell that to bliss even now it was too much for him to bear to repeat it bahba he beat at nichiren as if he were the devil himself jake no longer cared whether he lived or died he only knew that he was haunted by the ineffably sad face of his daughter he might dream of mariana but lan would follow him every day of his life above the struggling men the chinese were turned immobile by the force of the combatants hatred zilin might have sought to intervene but he was lying near the center of the veranda three oaths tsun and t y chung knelt beside him tending to him it was bliss leaping onto the veranda following jakes route who seemed unaffected she ran through the staring men and grasped the back of nichirens shirt but his weight combined with jakes was too much for her she screamed at jake to stop then seeing that nichiren was busy using his legs to kick jake off she screamed at him as well neither would listen to her perhaps they were both determined to die jake had managed to crawl slowly up nichirens body now they hung together jake using his hands nichiren his legs and feet they stared into each others eyes close enough to feel their breaths merge what strange spark passed between them what clash of emotions each was locked within the past a tiny grimy room long unused but certainly not forgotten nichiren was remembering the humiliation of his mothers scarred flesh jake was consumed by the image of the first rays of the sun rising above the treetops illuminating in death a young face he had failed to understand in life then the endless moment was broken nichiren holding on to the edge of the veranda was at a distinct disadvantage because of this jake was able to climb over him he gained purchase on the boards and managed to lever himself up onto the veranda he turned and slammed the edge of his hand into nichiren the other man swung away and jake panting and sweating thought it was over in a moment he found out how wrong he was nichiren had used the momentum of jakes attack to swing himself inward he stretched his legs as far as he could to gain momentum rolling his body into a ball after he reached the apex of the outward swing he flipped up onto the veranda he landed and moved all at once he caught jake off guard and was atop him instantly two vicious liver kites brought jake to the edge of unconsciousness bliss terrified kicked out with all her strength the toe of her shoe caught nichiren on the point of his chin his teeth clacked together madly and his head jounced on his neck he coughed blood jake immediately used a twohanded atemi across nichirens windpipe nichirens body arched backward still he kicked out slamming into jakes thighbone jake rolled unthinking his body wanting to get away from the pain nichiren hoping for this brought the edge of his hand down across jakes back writhing in pain jake shot his left leg out it connected with nichirens hip sending him flying backward jake was already up blinking back tears of pain he was in the process of striking again his arm outflung but nichiren was not stopped by the rail already splintered a sharp end of wood brushed his side and nothing more jake lunged for the killing blow his fingers hit something and involuntarily closed around it he heard a sharp snap and then there was nothing in front of him but the glittering south china sea a dank wind blew in his face not even the shadow of a kite moved there jake leapt to the edge of the ruined rail eventually he heard bliss soft voice calling to him as if from a great distance hes gone jake nichirens dead bahba was it the night wind or lan he heard calling to him in a moment he became aware that he was trembling violently bliss pulled him away from the abyss light flooded across him as he came to the center of the veranda formidable sung had led the other triad dragons into the house shi zilin was surrounded by three oaths tsun and t y chung the old mans skin seemed as delicate as rice paper blue veins patterned his countenance as lines scored others nichiren his voice was as thin as his skin jake could not answer the muscles at the corners of his jaw were knotted hes gone gaaufuh bliss said how long she had wanted to speak to him face to face her godfather gone in that one word was conveyed a lifetime of loving lost shi zilin put his head against the shoulder of his brother ah buddha protect what is left of my family now jake took a step forward he wanted to say something but his mind was a whirl of emotions the hulking beast of his own manufacture was still running rampant inside him after three years of being bottled up it could hardly be otherwise zilins gaze rose alit on jakes face for a long time those bright black eyes drank in the sight wholly for fifty years he had dreamed of this moment for much of that time he had not believed that it would ever come about he was like a man who has not eaten in weeks and now finds before him the most delicious offcasts his heart was filled up with love zilin was utterly absorbed in his son so brimming with genuine emotion was it that the others around him were held rapt by that absorption he wanted to speak but the words caught in his throat jumbled by these feelings so strong yet so strange to him at last he said softly get me to my feet younger brother if you would be so kind gingerly with t y chung aiding him three oaths tsun lifted the old man up he was trembling heavily as if a current were galvanizing him jake zilin said jake still filled up with nichiren said why did you ask about nichiren it was not meant to end this way the old man said i did not foresee the depths of the hatred his mother had implanted within him i thought i had exorcised it the mists were clearing slowly jake felt a great fist clamping down on his heart squeezing i dont understand but he did he did nichiren was also my son zilin said he was your brother or more accurately your halfbrother squeezing jake felt as if he were dying a black wave of despair such as he had never felt washed over him first lan and now nichiren he could not breathe his heart seemed to have ceased to beat there was a roaring in his ears jake ive murdered my brother someone was saying it was only after he had fled from them all disappearing into the forest beside the dirt track that he realized who that someone was much later in the silence of her apartment bliss brought jake a wei qi board with two shallow dishes filled with black and white stones frankly she did not know what else to do he had been there when she returned home sitting on the sofa staring out at the coming of dawn lights were still on here and there haloed by the motherofpearl glow brushing the darkness of the night away though he had not slept in fortyeight hours he did not appear tired bliss had made him some food but he had not eaten he drank nothing but water now as she set the wei qi game down in front of him she opened the slip of paper zilin had handed her as she rushed off after his son it contained a handwritten local phone number jake she said your father has called several times he wants to see you jake said nothing bliss had been sympathetic to what he was going through but as the hours wore on she became increasingly angry this psychic retreat was selfdestructive he was so wrapped up in the past that he had lost touch with the present this frightened her and at last as it began to get dark again she determined to do something about it the lshaped sofa had a low wide back in the shadows and silence of the apartment she carefully undressed naked she climbed onto the sofa back like a giant cat she approached jakes unmoving figure she pounced like a predator on its prey tumbling both of them onto the carpet in front of the windows sprawled atop him she bit his ear dug her nails in his chest wrapped her ankles around his calfs bliss no the first words he had spoken in almost a day yes she whispered yes yes yes she bared her teeth at him her eyes flashing her long hair flung itself like a living being down his belly with her fingers she tore open his shirt and when he moved to stop her she slapped him across the face bliss goddammit thats right she thought using her elbows and hips give me a reaction any reaction their faces were so close he could feel her lashes when she blinked she smelled of lemon and musk jakes mind was clouded with memories chittering like hungry animals crying to be fed at once he resented this intrusion on his living nightmare he had been quite content to wallow in his guiltthe atonement of despair bliss hardened nipples scraped across his bare chest she dipped her head her hot lips enclosing one of his nipples her tiny pink tongue darted out she made a deep sound in her throat as she felt the thickening bulge between his thighs leave me alone he panted i dont want to yes you do she said in his ear her fingers were busy at his belt what you mean is you dont deserve this now thats very western of you jake i hate you when you get like this he stopped fighting her his extraordinary coppercolored eyes were almost orange in the twilight but it was bliss into which he stared that were feral do you really hate me his voice was thick yes her gleaming lips were halfparted jake reached up and taking her head between his hands brought it down his mouth enclosed hers and when their tongues twined a great shudder rippled through bliss entire frame her fingers unfastened his trousers pulling the material down his hips and thighs she was wild to climb on him her pelvis squirmed and he gasped at the feel of her liquid heat reaching down while their lips were still pressed together she plunged him into her molten core he reared and went all the way up bliss gasping felt the air rush from her lungs she panted against the side of his neck tears filled her eyes she possessed him as he possessed her the connection was so exquisite that she passed into another realm she had never believed that she could feel so close to another human being jake was more than her lover the feeling of him deep inside her massaging her intimate flesh engendered a completeness she had believed only buddha could possess she stroked her hips against him moaning her hair covered them in a fan filaments of feeling and when her orgasm opened up inside her it radiated all the way to the top of her head the heat of him spurting jake oh jake yes yes yes her head curled on his heaving chest she listened to his heartbeat as if it were the pulse of the sea she kissed his damp flesh her fingers stroking when he softened at last popped out of her she cupped him in her palm reluctant to let go he could still feel the place on his skin where she had slapped him a plovers cry echoing down the well he knew that she had not sought to hurt or to shock him but merely to remind him of all that he was bliss he said bliss and she wept knowing that she had him back still he was adamant i dont want to see him jake hes your father do you think i want any part of his yuhnhyun it destroyed mariana and david oh i killed my brother because of it he pocketed the slip of paper she had handed him without looking at the number arent you even curious as to what the yuhnhyun is its a communist chinese operation youre half right its a chinese operation he stared at her his hand came out of his pocket when he had shoved the slip in his fingers had encountered an object they both looked at it now where did you get that bliss asked when i grabbed for nichiren at the very end it came away from him jake held a small worn chamois pouch in his palm he undid the drawstring and out popped his piece of the fu they both stared at it wordlessly for a time jake took it to the table on which bliss had set up the wei qi board he reached into another pocket placed the two pieces together the fiercefaced tiger its one side of the fu he said i wonder who has the other two pieces i thought you werent interested in the yuhnhyun jake made a face at her and she went across the room he watched the play of her golden flesh from behind all the puffy bruises were hidden when she returned she put her closed fist down on the table slowly she opened her fingers there between them lay a shard of carved lavender jade the head of a great dragon the third piece of the fu buddha jake said how i am shi zilins goddaughter long ago when he was still a child your father had a mentor a jian you understand that man was my greatgrandfather it was under shi zilins protection that my mother journeyed out of china through burma where i was born to hong kong she was very ill by then but she managed to get me to the destination shi zilin had given her three oaths tsun it was my mother bliss said fitting the third piece with the other two who gave me this then they all came from one source my father bliss looked up at him yes who holds the last piece i do not know i think only shi zilin can tell you he turned away i am finished with him i am finished with shadows and lies i do not believe the yuhnhyun can work without you i dont care bliss and what of the quarrys infiltration she said angrily we have been hunted like dogs for the past four days do you think that will change you must care about that whether i do or not is immaterial he sat down on the sofa began absently to arrange the opening of a wei qi game i dont know what got david oh killed but the evidence exists bliss drew on a pair of jeans and an amber vnecked blouse huo yan the movable eye jake said nichiren used it as part of his game so do i dont you think ive been trying to figure out what david meant by that it must mean something bliss came over and sat down next to him you knew david a long time jake nodded perhaps it has some meaning from out of your past but i cant think of what did you and david play wei qi together are you kidding david hated board games of any kind he was the eternal bachelor loved to spend his free time prowling after the girls he used to tell them he was an intelligence agent they didnt know what he meant until he said spy of course they never believed him theyd giggle peering under his armpits for the pistol they knew wasnt there still you two spent plenty of time together over the years what did you do then jake was pushing the white and black pieces around the board creating liaisons oh we did a lot of things bliss laughed like what chase girls and play wei qi at the same time it was meant as a joke but it galvanized jake dew neh loh moh i have the memory of a sea slug he jumped up buckling his belt and thrusting his arms into his shirt come on he yelled where are we going huo yan of course huo yan in wanchai where less than a week before david oh was running for his life jake and bliss hurried down the same jammed streets there was this one place we used to go to that we both liked jake explained it had the girls david oh liked best clean and young enough to still be interested it was owned by a man named mok bald ring in his ear a mongol maybe i never knew his background but that was how he looked mok was the meanest goddamned bastard either david or i had ever come across we twice tried to recruit him but he wasnt interested even the triads let him alone he fooled around with the girls some which was why they were clean and young he also was a wei qi fanatic his favorite endgame was invariably based on huo yan david would be finished with his girls before the game was over even he didnt have the kind of stamina mok possessed so hed be around for all of the endgames huo yan was the only move in wei qi he knew so you think he gave the evidence to this mok well soon find out moks establishment was in a seedy groundlevel building on luard road it looked like the kind of place only a horny sailor on leave would tolerate inside colored spots in red blue and yellow drifted over an octagonal dance floor uniforms and slit skirts dominated along with blaring randb music from the early sixties the temptations and the supremes jake took bliss by the hand led her over to the bartender after speaking to him they were shown to the back of the room bliss picked out mok immediately he was just as jake had described him except that he appeared to weigh in excess of pounds muscles bulging very mean but when he saw jake he beamed like a lighthouse on a foggy night he rose from the wet qi board and pounded jake on the back he leered goodnaturedly at bliss when jake introduced her come back after all this time for a game mok had a voice that was all basso he seemed to be tattooed in the style of an american sailor not exactly jake said the two men looked at each other for a moment davids dead shit and perdition mok said and spat heavily in that case i know why youre here it took jake just under three hours to read and analyze the data david oh had extracted from the quarry computer by that time he knew that gerard stallings had been killed for the same reason that david oh had been he also understood that a quarry extraction team had been sent to terminate mariana on the night of his raid on ohenro house if they only wanted your piece of the fu bliss asked after he had outlined the pertinent data to her why kill mariana because someone in the quarry knew that the fu shard was hidden whoever ordered the extraction team in knew me and knew mariana well he was aware that mariana would never willingly divulge the fus location they were sent to torture the information out of her then of course she would have to die otherwise she would be able to identify an unsanctioned quarry operation the stupidity of marianas death appalled him and he said christ very quietly bliss put her arm around him in a moment she said donovan or wunderman which one is the traitor jake staring at the starlit hong kong night felt weariness sweep through him his race was almost run unfortunately he said theres only one way to find out there was a storm building over washington the weather turned the washington monument slate gray and the reflecting pool in front of the lincoln memorial gunmetal in great falls farther away by fifteen miles from the chesapeake the clouds had begun to roll in the humid day turned clammy as if all the heavy foliage were sweating at once in greystokes cool thirdfloor study henry wunderman was plugged into the quarrys teeming storehouse of knowledge the security precautions he and donovan had instituted since the assassination of antony beridien did not satisfy him slowly he was becoming obsessed with jake maroc and the growing threat jake posed to the worldwide organization he now controlled the overcast day did not stop rodger donovan from working on his corvette he had pulled it up beside the rose garden at the side of the large house in amid the somnolent drone of the bumblebees fat and lazy with midsummer pollen he felt comfortably alonedetached even from the changeable weather here his mind was free to drift working on ever more complex software programs for the quarrys gpr mainframe when he heard the voice say softly hello rodger he stopped what he was doing he was wearing gardeners gloves in his right hand he held a greasecoated wrench he held a sparkplug in his other hand just behind him was a bush with blossoms the color of peaches he stood up straight now he was clad in a purple ralph lauren cotton polo shirt a pair of old smeared white ducks and scarred topsiders without socks jake he said without turning around he seemed quite calm you seem to have as many lives as the hero of a novel i knew we couldnt kill you it didnt stop you from trying donovan winced at the tone of course not what do you take us for amateurs no more talk jake said take me to wunderman ah wunderman i imagine hell want to know how you evaded all our security measures then hell be disappointed come on lets go now donovan turned around do you believe ill simply guide you to him hes the director now and youve been classified lethal rogue i wont bother to ask how that came about it wouldnt do you much good im afraid thats classified information jakes face hardened wunderman donovan spread his arms wide kill me why dont you with one of your handtofist specialty items jake moved in so fast that donovan did not even have time to blink just a blur with a hardened cutting edge on the end of it donovan crashed into the rosebushes his nose drooling blood thorns tore through his polo shirt scratching like cats claws tears came to his eyes and dropping the wrench he lifted a hand wiping away the blood my god he said i believe i had better stop joking jake pulled him to his feet against the wall rodger the other complied and jake patted him down that was hardly necessary donovan said i never carry a weapon lets go jake said i need the two of you together donovans face was apologetic when it poked into wundermans study the nose and the upper lip were already beginning to swell and he had had to stuff a wad of kleenex in the left nostril to control the bleeding jesus henry wunderman said when he saw him what the hell happened to you fall into your engine im terribly sorry donovan said sniffing for what jake pushed him all the way into the room and came in after him i think he means me oh christ wundermans eyes bugged he sat in his shirtsleeves before the computer console only his head moved now as he followed jakes progress around the room the walls painted a robinsegg blue were covered with a plethora of preserved butterflies all in miniature mahogany frames spreadeagled side by side they looked like a series of inkblot cards above them fluorescent strip lighting leached all color from their delicate forms jake had not taken david ohs printouts with him he did not intend to bring them up here either what was the point the traitor would lie to save himself and the innocent man would lie to protect the quarry in this respect jake realized there was no difference between them in battle fo saan had told jake over and over words are meaningless men will say anything if they think it will give them an advantage only action has any meaning action is distilled intent youve broken every tenet of the quarrys bylaws wunderman sat with his hands on his thighs he had changed since he became the director not physically but emotionally dont expect us to make excuses for our actions or to apologize for anything henry believes youre going to kill us donovan stood where jake had pushed him he had not attempted to move hes convinced that your chinese half has taken precedence he thinks youve got nothing but vengeance on your mind by the manner in which he spoke jake could tell that he was asking the questions for himself as well wunderman might be convinced of these things as donovan said but donovan himself was on the verge of believing them as well jake said nothing it was not his intention to engage these men in debate jake wunderman said in the exaggeratedly reasonable tone a doctor will take with a madman youve got to understand that the tragedy of marianas death has combined with the trauma of the sumchun river and the death of the dantai at ohenro house so many deaths to have on ones conscience is too much for anyone even you if you give yourself up now before anyone else gets hurt i promise youll not be charged well debrief you bring you back to health jake could hardly recognize the man who had recruited him for the quarry the man who had led him through his training in these same rolling virginia hills the power to which wunderman had aspired the power that he had now achieved had warped him perhaps the responsibility had been too much for him better men than he had buckled beneath the enormous strain or then again perhaps it was his dual life that was aging him before his time donovan kept his mouth shut which was just as interesting to jake like wundermans his eyes never left jake but there was no fear in them he was as calm as if he were still rummaging through his cars engine jakes hard gaze on donovan for some time flicked back toward wunderman in that space as his peripheral vision took over he had a fraction of an instant to react he saw the pistol in wundermans hand and he had to make his decision action is distilled intent and his own thought whoever ordered the extraction team in knew me and knew mariana well wunderman the pistol discharged but jake was no longer in the spot where wunderman was aiming he was a blur in the air landing a blow with his leading foot across wundermans chest the two of them flew backward with a crash wundermans head struck the floor the gun flew out of his hand skittered across the carpet in the center of the room jake struck with a pair of liver kites powerful enough to make wundermans eyes flutter hold it jake paused donovan was pointing the pistol at him i should shoot you where you are theres a traitor inside the quarry jake said there was no emotion inside him he had imagined this moment mariana and david ohs faces swimming before him their spirits crying out for vengeance but there was nothing compelling about what he was doing now it all felt like nothing i imagine you might have come to the same conclusion david oh was terminated because he found information buried in the computer memory banks the same with stallings jake registered the shock in donovans eyes with it was confusion and a measure of disbelief henry thinks youre the traitor henry thinks id kill david oh we know youve terminated four quarry agents in as many days they murdered david while he was on his way to an rdv we set up then they came after me with a lethal rogue directive out on you its no wonder who ordered the directive donovan did not answer but for an instant his eyes flickered toward wunderman christ on a crutch he breathed he waved with the muzzle of the pistol get away from him jake obeyed donovan knelt down loosened wundermans collar so he could put two fingers against his jugular there was no pulse to feel after a long time of staring at the gray face he said henry you bastard the two of them went out to dinner to an inn serving french country food not far from greystoke moths buzzed in the lights and young girls swung in with their dates brightfaced and cleareyed donovans nose was lightly bandaged but even in this state he had managed to make himself look rather dashing it was at him that most of the young girls glanced not at jake donovan ordered the best wine in an excellent cellar and together they toasted the henry wunderman who had once been jake was thinking of the moment at the peninsula when wunderman had recruited him to absent friends he said just as if wunderman were missing in action which in a way he was to mariana donovan said for what its worth im awfully sorry they finished more than half of the bottle before the food arrived i suppose well never know exactly what happened donovan said over coffee and brandy some time later what made him turn he had ordered and demolished the pheasant jake had chosen the shrimp but the sauce larded with clarified butter and the glossy reduction of juices did not appeal to his palate and so they lay before him mostly unfinished he was grateful when the waitress took the plate away its clear however that wunderman was the bottom of antonys iceberg donovan poured his brandy into his coffee stirred it absently speaking of which have you heard that daniella vorkuta the mastermind behind the iceberg has just been elevated to head of the first chief directorate jake said he hadnt shes also due to become the first female politburo member why are you telling me this jake said isnt it classified information donovan made a noise into his napkin i was hoping i could persuade you to return to the nest thats an interesting way of putting it im merely asking you to think about it donovan said calling for the check but it was not of the quarry that jake thought when he returned to his hotel the room typical of hotel rooms throughout america had the heavy blackout curtains pulled shut so that the space had the aspect of a womb jake crossed the room and yanked open the drapes he saw a courtyard filled by a mature plane tree its lightspeckled branches were dipping slightly in the summer wind but because the windows were closed there was no sound at all he might have been peering at a silent movie screen through the branches jake could see a small cafe set with striped umbrellas and tiny marbletopped tables the scene looked curiously european as he watched a couple middleaged but totally enraptured with one another strolled hand in hand between the empty tables to jake the observer it was a melancholy sight over dinner he had thought rodger donovans offer an ironic joke but now peering out at the spangled darkness he saw what donovan must have seen in him that he was the same as he always had been he was no different from the other men who played this deadly game when he looked again the courtyard was deserted in a moment the lights in the trees went off jake glanced at his watch it was after midnight he went to the bed and sat down on it he stared at the phone for some time then he drew out a slip of paper unfolded it he picked up the receiver asked the hotel operator for an overseas line to hong kong when she informed him that this was a directdial area he gave her his room number and did as she bade him the line rang hollowly for the longest time in the instant before he was about to hang up a voice said wai hello so many emotions raced through jake at the sound of the voice that he almost failed to speak then taking one deep breath he said bahba father epilogue hong kong washington summer present a dog barked as it ran along the waterline leaping for a red ball it extended itself arcing in the air like a missile when it landed it came near enough to jake to leave a sandy mark on his trouser leg jake and zilin walking slowly along the shallow crescent of the beach at sheko it was midmorning the hazy sun made the ocean seem as if it were coated with cream zilin had just finished telling jake about his life in china he had taken the news of chimeras death with characteristic equanimity now you know more about me even than my brothers jake looked at the old man thinking hell always be full of surprises i was wrong to leave you and your mother zilin said just as i was wrong to take a mistress but i was blind you see i was consumed with what i felt i had to do i made decisions and never once conceived of the consequences i was like a monk jake who after many years in the service of his god is set loose in the lay world i operated by an entirely different set of precepts the yuhnhyun zilin nodded in a way yes they made a wide circuit around a brown child making sand castles at the edge of the water i could not see that my actions would have repercussions on those around me or perhaps i did and discounted the effect you have told me what befell my athena after i left you i know from what i gleaned from nichiren over the years how i hurt sheng li the yuhnhyun killed them or rather my obsession with it they walked for a time in silence the clouds were piling themselves along the horizon above the black smudges of tankers with a sweep of silver spray a pleasure boat raced by them a young blonde in a bikini raised a hand and waved at her admirers on shore she was very sure of herself i must rest zilin said after a time he sat by the edge of the water parallel to the childs sand castles jake standing beside him watched as he took off his shoes and socks rolled up his trousers he stuck his feet into the curling end of the rolling waves the sight brought tears to jakes eyes zilin watching the child at play did not notice jake crouched down beside his father they had not embraced when they had met here not an intimate word had passed between them that was not the chinese way perhaps they had spoken to each other with silence i will stay here now zilin said he turned his gaze out to sea i was never a communist i love my country but i do not relish what has become of it i embraced communism many years ago because of pragmatism and i was correct communism did unite china i think still that it was the only way to stop our history of internecine warfare history as you may know is rather difficult to break away from but i like many of my brethren never knew the right time to disentangle myself from communism it has served its purpose i think all of us knew that some time ago we continued to use itfor ourselves i suspect and nothing more now communism is what ties us to the past it is what prevents our emergence into the future that is how the yuhnhyun was really born jake waiting for his father to continue watched the people on the beach as he had been trained to do even in this atmosphere he could not forget who he was the yuhnhyun came about when i became convinced that hong kong was the savior of all china if i could control hong kong absolutelyand now i am not speaking about the chinese government but rather about myself or someone like mei could control the future of all of china i could channel great sums of money into heavy industry i could promote free enterprise as i strengthened the bonds between the tai pan houses here and sources of supply on the mainland i could within fifty years effect the unification of all china that was the yuhnhyun goal jake thought about this for a long time he remembered bliss words its a chinese operation she had not lied but to control all of the colony he said now i dont see how you could do such a thing zilin smiled but there was no humor in that fragile face the network of blue veins crisscrossed everywhere i am jian what i create lives such a thing is possible i assure you my son in fact it was within my grasp even now not that much time has passed yes the sun caught his eyes turning them from black to white jake could see a pulse beating in his temple but it wont happen now too many people have died because of my callousness i am tired even a jian must have his time of rest to their right the sea came up dissolving one wall of the childs sand castle the boy stared at the leveled place for a moment before his eyes began to ooze tears then his sister came out of the water and stood looking at him she dropped to her knees the sand coating her honeycolored skin here she said here and began to build the ruined wall back up again after a time her brother stopped crying and began to help jake who had been observing this scene smiled father he said would you talk to me about the yuhnhyun zilin nodded if you wish but first i must tell you something it was on my orders that nichiren brought mariana to japan waves crashed along the shore as they always had but to jake the sounds seemed as loud as rifle shots mariana whitefaced the storm beating her back against the muddy rock slipping down and away mariana no i wish to continue jake barely heard his fathers voice why would you spirit mariana away his voice was a hoarse croak chimera found out about the power of the fit he sent a termination team to your apartment on the night you so rashly raided ohenro house jake barely registered the rebuke in his fathers voice i know that but i still dont understand mariana would never have gone anywhere with nichiren of course not zilin said softly not with what she knew or surmised about the longstanding enmity between the two of you it was essential that she be convinced otherwise zilin stared out to sea but his eyes saw nothing nichiren phoned her he warned her of the teams approach it was necessary to cut it quite close still she did not believe him why should she the quarry was on your side so he told her the name of the group leader he was someone she knew well evans evans yes chimera apparently was not aware that mariana knew what evans did for a living she hid outside the building and when she saw evans lead his team in she had no choice but to believe nichiren there was silence between them for a time the high spirits along the beach seemed far away at length jake said but why nichiren i didnt see any other choice i had to protect mariana and do it at once i had very little advance warning i knew that the termination team would find her if she stayed in hong kong i had to get her out i thought the safest place for her would be with nichiren i believed that no one inside the quarry would think of looking for her with your enemy but they did jake said bitterly they found out zilin nodded sadly and a power struggle within the soviet hierarchy sent a kvr team to tsurugi as well i am sorry my son jake felt the tremor running through the old man beside him his heart broke were all a little bit to blame he thought but mainly its the life i chose to lead my violent world destroyed her a world i love in time he gathered himself together tell me about the yuhnhyun father zilin accepted this ending because it was what his son wanted all right you already know about three oaths tsun and t y chung youre the only one even bliss does not know that they are my brothers i want it kept that way the consequences of that particular bit of information are far too dangerous you know that under the guise of their feud they have been acquiring companies they have been doing so under my direction so that all these new firms are now part of the ring as part of this ruse t y chung has entered into a business partnership with five star pacific within six months thanks to the machinations of one of my enemies in beijing we will have a clear majority control of that house the triads are ours as well three oaths tsun as you know has a friend in formidable sung that gives us the k sir john bluestone is affiliated with the hak sam that leaves the green pang jake said you wont get far without the shanghainese triad quite true zilin assented that means andrew sawyerand venerable chen who controls virtually all gold trafficking in and out of macao he turned now and stared into jakes eyes for a moment the years sloughed off him and jake glimpsed the young man his father had once been you have three peices of the fu my son andrew sawyer has the fourth sawyer buddha there was a small buddhist shrine hidden away along the slopes above sheko late afternoon found the two men entering its cool musky interior the scent of cedar mingled with the curling smoke of the joss sticks zilin spent a long time at prayer jake by his side thought of other things more worldly but no less important he was still getting used to having a father to being next to a human with whom he shared the same bloodline often he found himself trembling he thought it might be with relief the yuhnhyun is useless now zilin said as they sat in the shade of the shrines painted bamboo overhang without someone to sit at its heart and run it there is nothing the westering sun spilled its golden light all across the south china sea even the gathering clouds at the horizon were for this moment obscured you are speaking now of the tai pan of all tai pan jake said carefully in effect he would control all of hong kong all of china eventually because without international trade and the vast revenues it brings china is nothing you have me father zilin was shaking his head your life has already been intruded upon enough my son i am qualified zilin hesitated debating with himself in all the world jake you are the most uniquely qualified to be the center of the yuhnhyun that had been my original intention you and eventually nichiren in japan extending the ring then its settled no nothings settled for many years we on the mainland used the tenets of marx and engels to achieve a form of order and freedom from the faangwailoh who not content to rape our country threatened to swallow us up whole communism was a means to an end it has been clear to me for some years that we have reached that end we have a sense of stability now but we are still mired in feudal thinking in beijing there is a plethora of backward philosophy what has also been clear to me is that chinas future lies now with capitalism hong kongand through it a united china including taiwanwill be able to feed itself by employing a market economy that is what capitalism can provide us with now but the way is fraught with danger both in beijing where powerful maoists still exist and inside russia where the kremlin lives in fear of our true independence this too is part of the fearful legacy of the tai pan of all tai pan father when i went back to washington i learned something vital about myself my life is what i have made of it even though you know now that fo saan was part of the yuhnhyun yes even so fo saan trained me but it was my skill he could not and indeed did not seek to influence my interests in just the same way my life today is what i choose to make of it when i say its settled i mean it this must be something that you want of course zilin watched the sun coming down he had been struck by how different the world was outside of his home he had to continually remind himself that this too was china strange he thought now but even the sun looks different here it would take some getting used to the world he knew that he would not have the time to assimilate it all but after he was gone there would be jake he was astonished at how important that thought was to him at last he nodded so be it i have already spoken to andrew sawyer he owes me a debt he can never truly repay he is tai pan because of me that is why he was given the last of the fu shards remember that well sawyer gave me some interesting information which i will pass on to you now sir john bluestone is the kgbs top operative in the asian theater sawyers own comprador for years peter ng was bluestones agent he has already been dealt with bluestone however is another matter entirely when you go to see sawyer i think it would be prudent to keep bluestone in place he is in direct contact with daniel la vorkuta and i believe it would be in our best interests to keep things that way at least for the time being i agree good the only question still remaining is how chimera found out about the fu that information was not leaked by any source i have been able to run down that means theres someone out there on the loose an agent we are ignorant of yes ill find him jake was thinking about all the people lost to him for how long had he believed that he had no family now he had his father back and with him had come uncles nephews and nieces he felt like a man who after years of wandering in the desert had stumbled upon king solomons mines his new wealth astounded him zilin closed his eyes he felt the sun on his face but it was his son sitting beside him who warmed his flesh he felt a hand on his and despite himself he was electrified by emotion so much so that he thought to himself for this moment its all right he was dreaming of paris the molten summer light spread itself like honey across the boulevards he was in his secondstory apartment in the brownstone building in the sixteenth arrondissement the flock of high windows looked out onto a back courtyard that seemed gray even at this time of year the dream which he had at regular intervals always began with a quick flash like an impressionist painting of that courtyard gray it might have been but it was always filled with birds he heard their calling always their sounds were inextricably mixed with the rapping on the door his pulse quickened as she came into the foyer he was consumed by her cool gray eyes they were flecked in precisely the same way as one particular spot in a seurat painting he coveted he could watch that spot for hours as the dots of color swirled forming and reforming creating new hues how he loved that painting how he loved those eyes and the thick honeyblonde hair that cascaded down around her face when she spoke english it was with no discernible trace of an accent in his dream her voice was a visual rather than a sonic presence like the gray birdfilled courtyard it held a magical quality like the painting like seurat she came three times a week never on the same days from week to week never at the same hour always she called him during the day to set the time always she spoke english though his russian was flawless his dream ended with one particular image she was naked standing or sitting he was never quite certain which because of the light it was an artists light he was painting her instead of a brush he used his penis swiping the tip of it against her white white flesh he did this until she was completely covered with the modern runes of computer language always he awoke as he did now with an erection so tight it was painful the dream was like an opiate he rose from it dizzy with delight in a shower filled with steam and the scent of patchouli he spoke her name as if that would recreate her out of the smoke daniella toweled off he shaved staring at his face in a mirror clouded around the edges he dressed in midnightblue linen slacks and a creamcolored ralph lauren polo shirt slipping his feet into his worn topsiders chimera thought about how he in his own way was an artist how with the programs he created for the quarrys gpr mainframe he could make people see what was not there whistling went out to make his report he dreamed of daniella only on the days when he was scheduled to speak with her then the whole day glowed just like the painting by seurat about the author eric van lustbader was born raised and educated in greenwich village he was
