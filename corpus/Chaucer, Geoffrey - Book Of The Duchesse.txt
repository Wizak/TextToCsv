herde that how that they wolde on hunting goon i was right glad and up anoon i took my hors and forth i wente out of my chambre i never stente til i com to the feld withoute ther overtook i a gret route of huntes and eek of foresteres with many relayes and lymeres and hyed hem to the forest faste and i with hem so at the laste i asked oon ladde a lymere say felow who shal hunten here quod i and

hit was on to beholde as thogh the erthe envye wolde to be gayer than the heven to have mo floures swiche seven as in the welken sterres be hit had forgete the povertee that winter through his colde morwes had mad hit suffren and his sorwes al was forgeten and that was sene for al the wode was waxen grene swetnesse of dewe had mad it waxe hit is no need eek for to axe wher ther were many grene greves or thikke of trees so ful of leves and every tree stood by himselve fro other wel ten foot or twelve so grete trees so huge of strengthe of fourty or fifty fadme lengthe clene withoute bough or

his heed adoune and with a deedly sorwful soune he made of ryme ten vers or twelve of a compleynt to himselve the moste pite the moste rowthe that ever i herde for by my trowthe hit was gret wonder that nature might suffren any creature to have swich sorwe and be not deed ful pitous pale and nothing reed he sayde a lay a maner song withoute note withoute song and hit was this for wel i can

three strees of noght that fortune coude do no quod he i can not so why so good sir parde quod i ne say noght so for trewely thogh ye had lost the ferses twelve and ye for sorwe mordred yourselve ye sholde be dampned in this cas by as good right as medea was that slow hir children for iason and phyllis als for demophon heng hirself so weylaway for he had broke his termeday to come to hir another

ever yit be tributary and yiven rente to love hoolly with goode entente and through plesaunce become his thral with good wil body herte and al al this i putte in his servage as to my lorde and dide homage and ful devoutly prayde him to he shulde besette myn herte so that it plesaunce to him were and worship to my lady dere and this was longe and many a yeer or that myn herte was set owher that i did thus and niste why i trowe hit cam me kindely paraunter i was therto most able as a whyt wal or a table for hit is redy to cacche and take al that men wil therin make wherso so men wol portreye or peynte be the werkes never so queynte and thilke tyme i ferde so i was able to have lerned tho and to have coud as wel or better paraunter other art or letter but for love cam first in my thought therfore i forgat hit nought i chees love to my firste craft therfor hit is with me ylaft forwhy i took hit of so yong age that malice hadde my corage nat that tyme turned to nothing through to mochel knowleching for that tyme youthe my maistresse governed me in ydelnesse for hit was in my firste youthe and tho ful litel good i couthe for al my werkes were flittinge and al my thoghtes varyinge al were to me yliche good that i knew tho but thus hit stood hit happed that i cam on a day into a place ther i say trewly the fayrest companye of ladies that ever man with ye had seen togedres in oo place shal i clepe hit hap other grace that broght me ther nay but fortune that is to lyen ful comune the false trayteresse pervers god wolde i coude clepe hir wers for now she worcheth me ful wo and i wol telle sone why so among thise ladies thus echoon soth to seyn i saw ther oon that was lyk noon of al the route for i dar swere withoute doute that as the someres sonne bright is fairer clere and hath more light than any planete is in heven the mone or the sterres seven for al the worlde so had she surmounted hem alle of beaute of maner and of comlinesse of stature and wel set gladnesse of goodlihede so wel beseye shortly what shal i more seye by god and by his halwes twelve it was my swete right al hirselve she had so stedfast countenaunce so noble port and meyntenaunce and love that had herd my bone had espyed me thus sone that she ful sone in my thoght as helpe me god so was ycaught so sodenly that i ne took no maner reed but at hir look and at myn herte forwhy hir eyen so gladly i trow myn herte seyen that purely tho myn owne thoght seyde hit were bet serve hir for noght than with another to be wel and hit was sooth for everydel i wil anoonright telle thee why i saw hir daunce so comlily carole and singe so swetely laughe and pleye so womanly and loke so debonairly so goodly speke and so frendly that certes i trow that evermore nas seyn so blisful a tresore for every heer upon hir hede soth to seyn hit was not rede ne nouther yelw ne broun hit nas me thoghte most lyk gold hit was and whiche eyen my lady hadde debonair goode glade and sadde simple of good mochel noght to wyde therto hir look nas not asyde ne overthwert but beset so wel hit drew and took up everydel alle that on hir gan beholde hir eyen semed anoon she wolde have mercy fooles wenden so but hit was never the rather do hit nas no countrefeted thing it was hir owne pure loking that the goddesse dame nature had made hem opene by mesure and close for were she never so glad hir loking was not foly sprad ne wildely thogh that she pleyde but ever me thoght hir eyen seyde by god my wrathe is al foryive therwith hir liste so wel to live that dulnesse was of hir adrad she nas to sobre ne to glad in alle thinges more mesure had never i trowe creature but many oon with hir loke she herte and that sat hir ful lyte at herte for she knew nothing of her thoght but whether she knew or knew hit noght algate she ne roghte of hem a stree to gete hir love no ner was he that woned at home than he in inde the formest was alway behinde but goode folk over al other she loved as man may do his brother of whiche love she was wonder large in skilful places that bere charge which a visage had she therto allas myn herte is wonder wo that i ne can discryven hit me lakketh bothe english and wit for to undo hit at the fulle and eek my spirits be so dulle so greet a thing for to devyse i have no wit that can suffyse to comprehenden hir beaute but thus moche dar i seyn that she was rody fresh and lyvely hewed and every day hir beaute newed and negh hir face was alderbest for certes nature had swich lest to make that fair that trewly she was hir cheef patron of beautee and cheef ensample of al hir werke and moustre for be hit never so derke me thinketh i see hir evermo and yet moreover thogh alle tho that ever lived were not alyve they ne sholde have founde to discryve in al hir face a wikked signe for hit was sad simple and benigne and which a goodly softe speche had that swete my lyves leche so frendly and so wel ygrounded up al resoun so wel yfounded and so tretable to alle gode that i dar swere by the rode of eloquence was never founde so swete a sowninge facounde ne trewer tonged ne scorned lasse ne bet coude hele that by the masse i durste swere thogh the pope hit songe
