 prologue california he was never coming back the war had taken him from her she felt it felt his death in the emptiness that had spread through her heart felipe was gone the americans had killed himor perhaps his own need to prove himself had done so but as seraphina stood on the high rugged cliffs above the churning pacific she knew she had lost him mist swirled around her but she didnt draw her cloak close the cold she felt was in the blood in the bone it could never be vanquished her love was gone though she had prayed though she had spent countless hours on her knees begging the virgin mother to intercede to protect her felipe after he had marched off to fight the americans who so badly wanted california he had fallen in santa fe the message had come for her father to tell him that his young ward was killed in battle cut down as he fought to keep the town out of american hands his body had been buried there so far away she would never never look on his face again hear his voice share his dreams she had not done as felipe had asked she had not sailed back to spain to wait until california was safe again instead she had hidden her dowry the gold that would have helped to build their life togetherthe life they had dreamed of on so many bright days here on these cliffs her father would have given her to felipe when he came back a hero so felipe had said as he kissed the tears from her cheeks they would build a beautiful home have many children plant a garden he had promised he would come back to her and they would begin now he was lost perhaps it was because she had been selfish she had wanted to stay near monterey and not put an ocean between them and when the americans came she hid her bride gift afraid they would take it as they had taken so much else now they had taken everything that mattered and she grieved afraid it was her sin that took felipe from her she had lied to her father to steal those hours with her love she had given herself before the marriage was sanctified by god and the church more damning she thought as she bowed her head against the vicious slap of the wind she could not repent of her sins would not repent them there were no dreams left to her no hope no love god had taken felipe from her and so defying sixteen years of religious training against a lifetime of belief she lifted her head and cursed god and jumped one hundred thirty years later the cliffs were drenched in the golden light of summer gulls winged over the sea turning white breasts to the deep blue water before wheeling off with long echoing cries flowers sturdy and strong despite their fragile petals pushed their way through hard ground struggled toward the sun through thin cracks of rock and turned the harsh into the fanciful the wind was as soft as a stroke from a lovers hand overhead the sky was the perfect blue of dreams three young girls sat on the cliffs pondering the story and the sea it was a legend they knew well and each had her own personal image of seraphina as she had stood in those final despairing moments for laura templeton seraphina was a tragic figure her face wet with tears so alone on that windswept height with a single wildflower clutched in her hand as she fell laura wept for her now her sad gray eyes looking out to the sea as she wondered what she would have done for laura the romance of it was entwined with the tragedy to kate powell it was all a miserable waste she frowned into the sunlight while plucking at stubby wild grass with a narrow hand the story touched her heart true but it was the impulse of it the mistaken impulse that troubled her why end everything when life held so much more it had been margo sullivans turn to tell the tale and she had done so with a rich dramatic flair as always she envisioned the night electrified by a stormraging winds pelting rain flashing lightning the enormous defiance of the gesture both thrilled and troubled her she would forever see seraphina with her face lifted high a curse on her lips as she leapt it was a pretty stupid thing to do for a boy kate commented her ebony hair was pulled neatly back in a ponytail leaving her angular face dominated by her large almondshaped brown eyes she loved him laura said simply her voice was low thoughtful he was her one true love i dont see why there has to be just one margo stretched her long legs she and laura were twelve kate a year behind them but already margos body had begun to hint at the woman just waking inside she had breasts and was quite pleased about it im not going to just have one her voice rang with confidence im going to have hordes kate snorted she was thin and flatchested and didnt mind a bit she had better things to think about than boys school baseball music ever since billy leary stuck his tongue down your throat youve gotten wacky i like boys secure in her femininity margo smiled slyly and brushed a hand through her long blond hair it streamed past her shoulders thick and wavy and wheatcolored the minute shed escaped her mothers eagle eye shed tugged it out of the band that ann sullivan preferred she tie it back with like her body and her raspy voice her hair belonged more to a woman than an adolescent girl and they like me which was the best part in margos estimation but ill be damned if id kill myself over one automatically laura glanced around to make certain the swear word wasnt overheard they were alone of course and it was blissfully summer the time of year she loved most her gaze lingered on the house crowning the hill behind them it was her home her security and it pleased her just to look at it with its fanciful turrets and high arching windows the soft red tiles of the roof baking in the california sun sometimes she thought of it as a castle and herself as a princess just lately she had begun to imagine a prince somewhere who would one day ride up and sweep her away into love and marriage and happyeverafter i only want one she murmured and if something happened to him it would break my heart forever you wouldnt jump off a cliff kates practical nature couldnt conceive it you might kick yourself for bobbling a routine fly or bombing a test but over a boy why it was ridiculous youd have to wait to see what happened next she too studied the house templeton house her home now she thought that of the three of them she was the one who understood what it was to face the worst and wait shed been eight when she lost her parents had seen her world rip apart and leave her drowning but the templetons had taken her in had loved her and though shed only been a second cousin on the unstable powell branch of the family tree had given her family it was always wise to wait i know what id do id scream and curse god margo decided she did so now slipping as easily as a chameleon into a pose of abject suffering then id take the dowry and sail around the world see everything do everything be everything she stretched up her arms loving the way the sun stroked her skin she loved templeton house it was the only home she remembered she had been only four when her mother left ireland and came there to work though she had always been treated as one of the family she never forgot that she was a servants daughter her ambition was to be more much more she knew what her mother wanted for her a good education a good job a good husband what margo wondered could be more boring she wasnt going to be her motherno way was she going to be dried up and alone before she was thirty her mother was young and beautiful margo mused even if she played both facts down they were facts nonetheless yet she never dated or socialized and she was so damn strict dont do this margo dont do that she thought with a pout youre too young for lipstick and eye powder worried always worried that her daughter was too wild too headstrong too anxious to rise above her station whatever her station was margo thought she wondered if her father had been wild had he been beautiful and shed begun to wonder if her mother had had to marrythe way young girls did she couldnt have married for love for if shed loved him why didnt she ever speak of him why didnt she have pictures and mementos and stories of the man shed married and lost to a storm at sea so margo looked out to sea and thought of her mother ann sullivan was no seraphina she reflected no grief and despair just turn the page and forget maybe it wasnt so wrong after all if you didnt let a man mean too much you wouldnt be too hurt when he went away but that didnt mean you had to stop living too even if you didnt jump off a cliff there were other ways to end life if only mum understood she thought then shook her head fiercely and looked back out to sea she wasnt going to think about that about how nothing she did or wanted seemed to meet with her mothers approval it made her feel all churny inside to think of it so she just wouldnt she would think of the places she would someday visit of the people she would meet shed had tastes of that grandeur living in templeton house being a part of the world that the templetons moved in so naturally all those fabulous hotels they owned in all those exciting cities one day she would be a guest in them gliding through her own suitelike the one in templeton monterey with its staggering two levels and elegant furnishings and flowers everywhere it had a bed fit for a queen with a canopy and thick silkcovered pillows when shed said as much to mr t hed laughed and hugged her and let her bounce on that bed she would never forget the way it felt to snuggle against those soft perfumed pillows mrs t had told her the bed had come from spain and was two hundred years old one day she would have beautiful important things like that bed not just to tend them as her mother did but to have them because when you had them owned them you were beautiful and important too when we find seraphinas dowry well be rich margo announced and kate snorted again lauras already rich she pointed out logically and if we find it well have to put it in the bank until were old enough ill buy anything i want margo sat up and wrapped her arms around her knees clothes and jewelry and beautiful things and a car youre not old enough to drive kate pointed out ill invest mine because uncle tommy says it takes money to make money thats boring kate margo gave kates shoulder an affectionate jab youre boring ill tell you what well do with it well take a trip around the world the three of us well go to london and paris and rome well only stay at templeton hotels because theyre the best an endless slumber party laura said getting into the swing of the fantasy shed been to london and paris and rome and she thought them beautiful but nothing anywhere was more beautiful than here than templeton house well stay up all night and dance with only the most handsome men then well come back to templeton house and always be together of course well always be together margo slung an arm around lauras shoulders then kates their friendship simply was to her without question were best friends arent we well always be best friends when she heard the roar of an engine she leapt up and quickly feigned disdain thats josh and one of his creepy friends dont let him see you kate tugged hard on margos hand josh might have been lauras brother by blood but emotionally he was every bit kates too which made her disdain very genuine hell just come over and hassle us he thinks hes such a big shot now that he can drive hes not going to bother with us laura rose as well curious to see who was riding shotgun in the spiffy little convertible recognizing the dark flying hair she grimaced oh its just that hoodlum michael fury i dont know why josh pals around with him because hes dangerous she might have been only twelve but some females are born able to recognize and appreciate a dangerous man but margos eyes were on josh she told herself it was because he irritated herthe heir apparent the perfect golden prince who continually treated her like a slightly stupid younger sister when anyone with eyes could see she was almost a woman hey brats with the studied cool of sixteen years he leaned back in the drivers seat of the idling car the eagles hotel california blasted out of the radio and rocked the breezy summer air looking for seraphinas gold again were just enjoying the sun and the solitude but it was margo who closed the distance walking slowly keeping her shoulders back joshs eyes were laughing at her beneath a shock of windblown sunbronzed hair michael furys were hidden behind mirrored sunglasses and she couldnt tell where they looked she wasnt overly interested but she leaned against the car and gave him her best smile hello michael yeah was his reply theyre always hanging out on the cliffs josh informed his friend like theyre going to trip over a bunch of gold doubloons he sneered at margo it was much easier to sneer than to consider even for a moment the way she looked in those teeny little shorts shit she was just a kid and practically his sister and he was going to fry in hell for sure if he kept having these weird thoughts about her one day well find them she leaned closer and he could smell her she arched a brow drawing attention to the little mole flirting with the bottom tip of it her eyebrows were shades darker than all that pale blond hair and her breasts which seemed to grow fuller every time a guy blinked were clearly outlined under the snug tshirt because his mouth was painfully dry his voice was sharp and derisive keep dreaming duchess you little girls go back and play weve got better things to do he roared away keeping one eye trained on the rearview mirror margos womans heart pounded with confused longing she tossed back her hair and watched the little car bullet away it was easy to laugh at the housekeepers daughter she thought with bubbling fury but when she was rich and famous one day hell be sorry he laughed at me you know he doesnt mean it margo laura soothed no hes just a male kate shrugged the definition of an ass that made margo laugh and together they crossed the road to start up the hill to templeton house one day she thought again one day chapter one when she was eighteen margo knew exactly what she wanted she had wanted the same at twelve everything but now she had made up her mind how to go about attaining it she was going to trade on her looks her best and perhaps only talent as far as she was concerned she thought she could act or at least learn how it had to be easier than algebra or english lit or any of those other stuffy classes in school but one way or another she was going to be a star and she was going to make it on her own shed made the decision the night before the night before lauras wedding was it selfish of her to be so miserable that laura was about to be married shed been nearly this miserable when mr and mrs t had taken laura and josh and kate to europe the summer before for an entire month and she had stayed home because her mother had refused the templetons offer to take her along shed been desperate to go she remembered but none of her pleas nor any of lauras and kates had budged ann sullivan an inch not your place to traipse off to europe and stay in fancy hotels mum had said the templetons have been generous enough with you without you expecting more so shed stayed home earning her keep as her mother called it by dusting and polishing and learning to keep a proper house and shed been miserable but that didnt make her selfish she told herself it hadnt been as if she hadnt wanted kate and laura to have a wonderful time shed just ached to be with them and it wasnt as if she didnt hope that lauras marriage would be perfectly wonderful she just couldnt stand to lose her did that make her selfish she hoped it didnt because it wasnt just for herself that she was unhappy it was for laura too it was the thought of lauras tying herself to a man and marriage before she had given herself a chance to live oh god margo wanted to live so her bags were already packed once laura flew off on her honeymoon margo intended to be on her way to hollywood she would miss templeton house and mr and mrs t and oh she would miss kate and laura even josh she would miss her mother though she knew there would be ugliness between them before the door closed there had already been so many arguments college was the bone of contention between them now college and margos unbending refusal to continue her education she knew she would die if she had to spend another four years with books and classrooms and what did she need with college when shed already decided how she wanted to live her life and make her fortune her mother was too busy for arguments now as housekeeper ann sullivan had wedding reception on her mind the wedding would be held at church then all the limousines would stream along highway like great glinting white boats and up the hill to templeton house already the house was perfect but she imagined her mother was off somewhere battling with the florist over arrangements it had to be beyond perfect for lauras wedding she knew how much her mother loved laura and she didnt resent it but she did resent that her mother wanted her to be like laura and she never could didnt want to laura was warm and sweet and perfect margo knew she was none of those things laura never argued with her mother the way margo and ann flew at each other like cats but then lauras life was already so settled and smooth she never had to worry about her place or where she would go shed already seen europe hadnt she she could live in templeton house forever if she chose if she wanted to work the templeton hotels were there for hershe could pick her spot margo wasnt like kate either so studious and goaloriented she wasnt going to dash off to harvard in a few weeks and work toward a degree so that she could keep books and read tax law god how tedious but that was kate whod rather read the wall street journal than pore over the glamorous pictures in vogue who could discuss happily interest rates and capital gains with mr t for hours no she didnt want to be kate or laura as much as she loved them she wanted to be margo sullivan and she intended to revel in being margo sullivan one day she would have a house as fine as this she told herself as she came slowly down the main stairs trailing a hand along the glassy mahogany banister the stairs curved in a long graceful sweep and high above like a sunburst hung a sparkling waterford chandelier how many times had she seen it shoot glamorous light onto the glossy white and peacock blue marble tiles of the foyer sparkle elegance onto the already elegant guests who came to the wonderful parties the templetons were famous for the house always rang with laughter and music at templeton parties she remembered whether guests were seated formally at the long graceful table in the dining room under twin chandeliers or wandered freely through the rooms chatting as they sipped champagne or cozied up on a love seat she would give wonderful parties one day and she hoped she would be as warm and entertaining a hostess as mrs t did such things comes through the blood she wondered or could they be learned if they could be learned then she would learn her mother had taught her how to arrange flowers just sothe way those gleaming white roses in a tall crystal vase graced the pembroke table in the foyer see the way they reflect in the mirror she thought tall and pure with their fanning greens those were the touches that made home she reminded herself flowers and pretty bowls candlesticks and lovingly polished wood the smells the way the light slanted through the windows the sounds of grand old clocks ticking it was all that she would remember when she was far away not just the archways that allowed one room to flow into another or the complex and beautiful patterns of mosaics around the tall wide front door she would remember the smell of the library after mr t had lighted one of his cigars and the way the room echoed when he laughed shed remember the winter evenings when she and laura and kate would curl up on the rug in front of the parlor firethe rich gleam of the lapis mantel the feel of the heat on her cheeks the way kate would giggle over a game when she was winning shed imagine the fragrances of mrs ts sitting room powders and perfumes and candlewax and the way mrs t smiled when margo came in to talk with her she could always talk to mrs t her own room how the templetons had let her pick out the new wallpaper when she turned sixteen and even her mother had smiled and approved of her choice of pale green background splashed with showy white lilies the hours shed spent in that room alone or with laura and kate talking talking talking planning dreaming am i doing the right thing she wondered with a quick jolt of panic how could she bear to leave everything everyone she knew and loved posing again duchess josh stepped into the foyer he wasnt dressed for the wedding yet but wore chinos and a cotton shirt at twentytwo hed filled out nicely and his years at harvard sat comfortably on him margo thought disgustedly that he would look elegant in cardboard he was still the golden boy though his face had lost its innocent boyishness it was shrewd with his fathers gray eyes and his mothers lovely mouth his hair had darkened to bronze and a late growth spurt in his last year of high school had shot him to six two she wished he was ugly she wished looks didnt matter she wished he would look at her just once as if she wasnt simply a nuisance i was thinking she told him but stayed where she was on the stairs with one hand resting casually on the banister she knew shed never looked better her bridesmaids dress was the most glorious creation shed ever owned that was why shed dressed early to enjoy it as long as she possibly could laura had chosen the summer blue to match margos eyes and the silk was as fragile and fluid as water the long sweep of it highlighted her frankly lush figure and the long sheer sleeves showcased her creamy ivory skin rushing things arent you he spoke quickly because whenever he looked at her the punch of lust was like a flaming fist in his gut it had to be only lust because lust was easy the weddings not for two hours itll take nearly that long to put laura together i left her with mrs t i thought they well they needed a minute or two alone crying again mothers cry on their daughters wedding day because they know what theyre getting into he grinned and held out a hand youd make an interesting bride duchess she took his hand their fingers had twined hundreds of times over their years together this was no different is that a compliment an observation he led her into the parlor where silver candlesticks held slim white tapers and sumptuous arrangements of flowers were decked jasmine roses gardenias all white on white and heady with scent in the room where sunlight streamed through high arched windows there were silverframed photos on the mantel she was there margo thought accepted as part of the family on the piano sat the waterford compote that she had recklessly spent her savings on for the templetons twentyfifth anniversary she tried to take it in every piece of it the soft colors of the aubusson carpet the delicate carving on the legs of the queen anne chairs the intricate marquetry on the music cabinet its so beautiful she murmured hmm he was busy tearing the foil off a bottle of champagne hed snatched from the kitchen the house its so beautiful annies outdone herself he said referring to margos mother should be a hell of a wedding it was his tone that drew her gaze back to him she knew him so well every nuance of expression every subtle tone of voice you dont like peter josh shrugged uncorked the bottle with an expert press of i thumb im not marrying ridgeway laura is she grinned at him i cant stand him stuffy superior snot he grinned back at her at ease again we usually agree on people if little else because he hated it she patted his cheek wed probably agree on more if you didnt enjoy picking on me so much its my job to pick on you he snagged her wrist annoying her youd feel neglected if i didnt youre even more revolting now that youve got a degree from harvard she picked up a glass at least pretend youre a gentleman pour me some when he studied her she rolled her eyes for christs sake josh im eighteen if lauras old enough to get married to that jerk im old enough to drink champagne one he said the dutiful older brother i dont want you weaving down the aisle later he noted with amused frustration that she looked as though shed been born with a champagne flute in her hands and men at her feet i suppose we should drink to the bride and groom she pursed her lips as she studied the bubbles rising so frothily in her glass but im afraid ill choke and i hate to waste this she winced lowered the glass thats so damn mean i hate being mean but i cant seem to help it its not mean its honest he moved a shoulder we might as well be mean and honest together to laura then i hope to hell she knows what shes doing she loves him margo sipped and decided that cham pagne would be her signature drink god knows why or why she thinks she has to marry him just to sleep with him nice talk well be realistic she wandered to the garden door sighed sex is a stupid reason to get married the fact is i cant think of a single good one of course laura isnt marrying peter just for sex impatient she tapped her fingers against the glass listened to the ring shes too romantic hes older more experienced charming if you like that sort and of course hes in the business so he can slip right into the templeton empire and reign right here so she can stay at the house or choose something close by its probably perfect for her dont start crying im not not really but she was comforted by the hand he laid on her shoulder and she leaned into him im just going to miss her so much theyll be back in a month im not going to be here she hadnt meant to say it not to him and now she turned quickly dont say anything to anyone i need to tell everyone myself tell them what he didnt like the clutching feeling in his stomach where the hell are you going to la tonight just like her he mused and shook his head what wild hair is this margo its not a wild hair ive thought about it a lot she sipped again wandered away from him it was easier to be clear when she couldnt lean on him i have to start my life i cant stay here forever college thats not for me her eyes lit the cold blue fire at the center of a flame she was going to take something for herself and if it was selfish then by god so be it thats what mum wants not what i want and i cant keep living here the housekeepers daughter dont be ridiculous he could brush that off like a stray mote of lint youre family she couldnt dispute that and yet i want to start my life she said stubbornly youve started yours youre going to law school kates going off to harvard a full year early thanks to her busy little brain lauras getting married now he had it and sneered at her youre feeling sorry for yourself maybe i am whats wrong with that she poured more champagne into her glass defying him why is it such a sin to feel a little selfpity when everyone you care about is doing something they want and youre not well im going to do something i want go to la and what im going to get a job she sipped again seeing it seeing herself perfectly centered in the light of excitement im going to model my face is going to be on the cover of every important magazine there is she had the face for it he thought and the body they were killers criminally stunning and thats an ambition he said with a half laugh having your picture taken she lifted her chin and seared him with a look im going to be rich and famous and happy and im going to make it on my own mommy and daddy wont be paying for my life i wont have a cozy trust fund to bounce on his eyes narrowed dangerously dont get bitchy with me margo you dont know what it is to work to take responsibility to follow through oh and you do youve never had to worry about anything but snapping your fingers so a servant can buff up the silver platter youre served on as hurt as he was insulted he crossed to her youve eaten off the same damn platter most of your life her color rose at that shaming her that may be true but from now on im buying my own platters with what he cupped her face in tensed fingers your looks duchess beautiful women clog the streets in la theyll gobble you up and spit you out before you know what hit you the hell they will she jerked her head free im going to do the gobbling joshua conway templeton and no ones going to stop me why dont you do us all a favor and think for once in your life before you jump into something well have to pull you out of this is a hell of a time to start acting up like this he set his glass down so he could push his hands into his pockets lauras wedding day my parents half crazy because theyre worried shes too young your own mother running around with her eyes all red from crying im not going to spoil lauras wedding day im waiting until after shes left on her honeymoon oh thats damn considerate of you fuming he spun around have you thought how annies going to feel about this margo bit hard on her bottom lip i cant be what she wants why cant anyone understand that how do you think my parents are going to feel thinking about you alone in la you wont make me feel guilty she murmured feeling exactly that ive made up my mind goddamn it margo he grabbed her arms throwing her offbalance so that she toppled against him in her heels she was eye to eye with him her heart thudded hurtfully against her ribs she thoughtshe feltsomething was going to happen right here right now josh she said it quietly her voice shaky and hoarse her fingers dug into his shoulders and everything churned inside her yearning the rude clatter on the stairs had them both springing back when she managed to draw a breath he was glaring at her kate clomped into the room i cant believe i have to wear something like this i feel like an idiot stupid long skirts are impractical and just get in the way kate stopped plucking at the elegant silk dress and frowned at margo and josh she thought they looked like two sleek cats about to spring do you two have to fight now im having a crisis margo is this dress supposed to look like this and if so why is that champagne can i have some joshs gaze remained on margos for another humming moment im taking it up to laura i just want a sip beforejeez pouting now kate stared as josh strode out of the room whats with him the same as always hes an arrogant knowitall i just hate him margo said between gritted teeth oh well if thats all lets talk about me help she spread her arms kate margo pressed her fingers to her temples then sighed kate you look fabulous except for the incredibly bad haircut what are you talking about kate ran her hair through the ruthlessly short black cap the hairs the best thing i barely have to comb it obviously well well cover it up with the hat anyway i wanted to talk about the hat youre wearing it instinctively margo held out her champagne to share it makes you look very chic audrey hepburnish ill do it for laura kate muttered then dropped with little grace onto a chair and swung her silkdraped legs over the arm i gotta tell you margo peter ridgeway gives me a pain join the club her thoughts revolved back to josh had he actually been about to kiss her no that was ridiculous more likely hed been about to shake her like a frustrated boy whose toy wasnt working to his liking kate dont sit like that youll wrinkle the dress hell she rose reluctantly a pretty coltish girl with oversized eyes i know uncle tommy and aunt susie arent happy about all this theyre trying to be because lauras so happy shes practically sending off radiation i want to be happy for her margo then we will be she shook off worries of josh of later of la now was for laura we have to stand by the people we love right even when theyre screwing up kate sighed and handed margo the champagne flute i guess we should go up and stand by her then they started up the stairs at the door to lauras room they paused joined hands i dont know why im so nervous kate murmured my stomachs jumping because were in this together margo gave her hand a squeeze just like always she opened the door laura sat at the vanity putting the finishing touches on her makeup in the long white robe she already looked the perfect bride her golden hair was swept up curls falling flirtily around her face susan stood behind her already dressed for the ceremony in a deeprose gown touched with lace the pearls are old she said her voice raw in the shining mirror framed in carved rosewood her eyes met her daughters your grandmother templetons she handed laura the lovely eardrops she gave them to me on my wedding day now theyre yours oh mom ill start crying again none of that now ann sullivan stepped forward she looked lovely and restrained in her best navy dress her deepblond hair in short quiet waves no swollen eyes on our bride today you need something borrowed so i thought you could wear my locket under your gown oh annie laura sprang up to hug her thank you thank you so much im so happy may you stay half so happy for the rest of your life feeling her eyes well ann cleared her throat smoothed the already smooth floral coverlet on lauras fourposter bed id best go down and see if mrs williamson is dealing with the caterers mrs williamson is fine susan took anns hand knowing their longtime cook could handle the most fussy of caterers ah here are the ladiesinwaiting now just in time to dress the bride and how lovely they look that they do ann turned to run a critical eye over her daughter and kate miss kate you could use more lipstick and margo you less well have a drink first susan picked up the champagne since josh was thoughtful enough to bring up a bottle we brought along a glass kate said shrewdly omitting theyd already had some just in case well i suppose its an occasion just half a glass ann warned theyll be tippling at the reception if i know these girls i already feel drunk laura watched the bubbles rise in her glass i want to make the toast please to the women in my life my mother whos shown me that love makes a marriage bloom my friend she said turning to ann who al ways always listened and my sisters who gave me the best of families i love you all so much thats done it susan sniffed into her wine my mascaras shot again mrs templeton maam a maid came to the door all eyes as she peeked in at laura later she would tell the downstairs staff that it had been like a vision all those lovely women standing in a room with the sun streaming patterns through fluttering lace curtains old joe the gardener is arguing with the man whos come to set up the tables and chairs in the garden ill see to it ann began well both see to it susan touched lauras cheek itll keep me too busy to blubber margo and kate will help you dress baby thats how it should be dont wrinkle those gowns ann ordered then slipped an arm around susans shoulders and murmured something quietly as they left the room i dont believe it margos smile spread mum was so distracted she left the bottle drink up ladies maybe one more kate decided my stomachs so jittery im afraid ill throw up you do and ill kill you margo recklessly tossed back the champagne she liked the exotic sensation of it tickling her throat bubbling through her brain she wanted to feel just like this for the rest of her life okay laura lets get you into that incredible dress its really happening laura murmured right but if you want to change your mind change my mind she laughed at kate as margo reverently slipped the fullskirted ivory silk gown out of its protective bag are you crazy this is everything ive ever dreamed of my wedding day the beginning of my life with the man i love eyes misty she circled as she slipped off the robe hes so sweet so handsome so kind and patient she means he didnt pressure her to do the big deed margo commented he respected the fact that i wanted to wait until our wedding night lauras prim expression collapsed into wild glee i cant wait i told you its not that big a deal it will be when youre in love she stepped carefully into the dress as margo held it for her you werent in love with biff no but i was wildly in lust which counts for something im not saying it wasnt nice it was but i think it takes practice ill get lots of practice lauras brides heart fluttered at the thought as a married woman oh look at me stunned laura stared at herself in the chevel glass yards of ivory silk were sparkling with tiny seed pearls romantic sleeves puffed at the shoulders then tapered to snugness when kate and margo finished attaching the train kate arranged it in an artful spill of embroidered silk the veil margo blinked back tears with her advantage of height she slid the pearl circlet smoothly around the neat bun then fluffed the yards of tulle her oldest friend she thought as a tear snuck through the sister of her heart at a turning point oh laura you look like a princess in a fairy tale you really do i feel beautiful i feel absolutely beautiful i know i kept saying it was too fussy kate managed a watery smile i was wrong its perfect im going to get my camera as if there arent going to be half a million pictures by the time its over margo said when kate dashed from the room ill go get mr t then i guess ill see you in church yes margo one day i know you and kate are going to be as happy as i am now i cant wait to be a part of that lets get done with you first she stopped at the door turned again just to look she was afraid that nothing and no one would ever make her feel whatever it was that put that soft light in lauras eyes so she thought as she quietly closed the door she would settle for fame and fortune she found mr t in his bedroom muttering curses and fumbling with his formal tie he looked so dashing in the dove gray morning coat that matched the templeton eyes he had broad shoulders a woman could lean on she thought and that wonderfully masculine height which josh had inherited he was frowning now as he mumbled to himself but his face was so perfect the straight nose and tough chin the crinkles around his mouth a perfect face she thought as she stepped in a fathers face mr t when are you going to learn how to deal with those ties his frown turned to a grin never as long as theres a pretty woman around to fuss with it for me obligingly she moved over to tidy the mess hed made of it you look so handsome nobodys going to give me or any other man a second glance with my girls around you look more beautiful than a wish margo wait until you see laura she saw the worry flicker into his eyes and kissed his smoothly shaven cheek dont fret mr t my babys grown up on me its hard to let him take her away from me he could never do that no one could but i know its hard for me too ive been feeling sorry for myself all day when i should be happy for her footsteps sounded in the hall rushing kate with her cam era margo thought or a servant hurrying to take care of some lastminute detail there were always people in templeton house she mused filling it with sound and light and movement you never felt alone there her heart hitched again at the thought of leaving of being alone yet mixed with the fears was such dizzy anticipation like a first sip of champagne when the rich fizz of it exploded on the tongue a first kiss that soft sultry meeting of lips there were so many firsts she yearned to experience everythings changing isnt it mr t nothing stays the same forever however much youd like it to in a few weeks you and kate will be off to college josh will be back at law school laura will be a wife susie and i will be rattling around this house like a bunch of old bones which was one of the reasons he and his wife were thinking of relocating to europe the house wont be the same without you the house will always be the same thats whats so wonderful about it how could she tell him she was leaving that very night running toward something she could see as clearly as her own face in the mirror old joe will keep on guarding his rosebushes and mrs williamson will be lording it over everyone in the kitchen mum will go on polishing the silver because she doesnt think anyone else can do it properly mrs t will drag you out to the tennis court every morning and trounce you youll be on the phone scheduling meetings or barking orders i never bark he said with a gleam in his eye you always bark thats part of your charm she wanted to weep for the childhood that had gone so fast though she had thought it would never end for the part of her life that was behind her now though she had strained so hard to pull away for the coward that lived inside her that shrank from telling him she was leaving i love you mr t margo misreading her he pressed his lips to her brow before too much longer ill be walking you down the aisle giving you to some handsome young man who couldnt possibly be good enough for you she made herself laugh because crying would spoil everything im not getting married to anyone unless hes exactly like you lauras waiting for you she drew back reminding herself that this was lauras father not hers this was lauras day not hers ill go see if the cars are ready she hurried downstairs and there was josh staggering in his formal wear frowning at her as she paused breathlessly dont start on me she ordered lauras coming down in a minute im not going to start on you but were going to talk later fine she had no intention of talking with him the minute the last grain of rice was thrown she would make a quick and quiet exit she carried the hat shed brought down from her room to the mirror instinctively arranging the wide blue brim to the most flattering advantage theres my fame she thought studying her face and my fortune by god she would make it work lifting her chin she met her own eyes and willed it to begin chapter two ten years later on the wild wild cliffs above the restless pacific margo watched the storm build black clouds boiled in a black sky crushing every hint of starlight with their weight and temper the wind howled like a feral wolf hunting for blood needlebright spears of lightning slashed and snapped and shot the jagged rocks and spewing surf into sharp relief the witchy scent of ozone stung the air before thunder exploded it seemed that her welcome home even from nature was not to be a gentle one an omen she wondered jamming her hands into her jacket pockets to protect them from the biting wind she could hardly expect anyone at templeton house to greet her with open arms and joyous smiles the fatted calf she thought with a wry smile will not be served for this prodigal she had no right to expect it wearily she reached up and pulled the pins out of the smooth twist to let her pale blond hair fly free it felt good that small liberation and she tossed the pins over the edge she remembered quite suddenly that when shed been a young girl she and her two best friends had thrown flowers over that same ledge flowers for seraphina she thought and nearly smiled how romantic it had seemed then the legend of that young girl hurling herself over the edge in grief and despair she remembered that laura had always cried a little and that kate would solemnly watch the flowers dance toward the sea but she herself had always felt the thrill of that final flight the defiance of the gesture the bold recklessness of it margo was just low enough just tired enough to admit that looking for thrills being defiant and embracing recklessness were what had brought her to this miserable point in her life her eyes a brilliant cornflower blue that the camera loved were shadowed shed retouched her makeup carefully after her plane had landed in monterey and had checked it again in the back of the cab shed taken out to big sur christ knew she was skilled in painting on any image required only she would be aware that beneath the expensive cosmetics her cheeks were pale they were perhaps a bit more hollow than they should be but it was those slashing cheekbones that had boosted her onto the cover of so many magazines a good face started with bones she thought and shivered as the next flash of lightning bolted across the sky she was fortunate in her bone structure in the smooth poreless skin of her irish ancestors the kerry blue eyes the pale blond hair had undoubtedly been passed on by some ancient viking conqueror oh she had a face all right she mused it wasnt a matter of vanity to admit it after all it and a body built for sinning had been her meal tickets her pathways to fame and fortune full romantic lips a small straight nose a firm rounded chin and expressive brows that needed only the slightest bit of darkening and shaping she would still have a good face when she was eighty if she lived that long it didnt matter that she was washed up used up embroiled in a scandal and bitterly ashamed she would still turn heads a pity she no longer gave a damn turning away from the cliff edge she peered through the gloom across the road and on the crest of the hill she could see the lights of templeton house the house that had held so much of her laughter and so many of her tears there was only one place to go when you were lost only one place to run when you had no bridges left to burn margo picked up her flight bag and headed home ann sullivan had served at templeton for twentyfour years one year less than shed been a widow she had come her fouryearold daughter in tow from cork to take a position as maid in those days thomas and susan templeton had run the house as they ran their hotels in grand style hardly a week would go by without the rooms overflowing with guests and music there had been a staff of eighteen to ensure that every detail of the house and grounds was seen to perfectly perfection was a trademark of templeton as was luxury as was warmth ann had been taught and taught well that fine accommodations were nothing without gracious welcome the children master joshua and missy laura had had a nanny who in turn had boasted an assistant yet they had been raised by their parents ann had always admired the devotion the discipline and the care with which the templetons had reared their family although she knew it could wealth had never outdistanced love in this house it had been mrs templetons suggestion that the girls play together they were after all the same age and joshua being a boy and four years their senior had little time for them ann would forever be grateful for mrs templeton not only for the position and the simple kindnesses but for the advantages she had offered anns daughter margo had never been treated like a servant instead she was treated as the cherished friend of the daughter of the house in ten years ann had become housekeeper it was a position she knew she had earned and one she took great pride in there was no corner of the house she hadnt cleaned with her own hands no scrap of linen she hadnt washed her love for templeton house was deep and abiding perhaps deeper and more abiding than for anything else in her life she had stayed on after the templetons moved to cannes after miss laura marriedtoo quickly and too rashly to anns mind shed stayed after her own daughter ran off to hollywood and then to europe chasing glitter and glory she had never remarried never considered it templeton house was her mate it stood year after year solid as the rock on which it was built it never disappointed her defied her questioned her it never hurt her or asked more than she could give as a daughter could she thought now as the storm raged outside and rain began to lash like whips against the wide arching windows she walked into the kitchen the slateblue counters were spotless earning a nod of approval for the new young maid she had hired the girl had gone home now and couldnt see it but ann would remember to tell her shed done well how much easier it was she mused to earn the affection and respect of staff than it was to earn that of your own child often she thought shed lost margo the day the girl had been born been born too beautiful too restless too bold as worried as she was about margo after the news had broken she went about her duties there was nothing she could do for the girl she was bitterly aware that there had never been anything she could do for or about margo love hadnt been enough though ann thought perhaps she had held too much love back from margo it was only because shed been afraid to give the girl too much for to give her too much might have made her reach even farther than she had seemed to need to and she simply wasnt very demonstrative ann told herself with a little shrug servants couldnt afford to be no matter how kind the employer she understood her place why hadnt margo ever understood hers for a moment she leaned on the counter in a rare show of selfindulgence her eyes squeezed tight against threatening tears she simply couldnt think of margo now the girl was out of her hands and the house required a final check she straightened breathing deep to balance herself the floor had been freshly mopped and the same slateblue as the counters gleamed in the light the stove an aging sixburner showed no remnants of the dinner it had cooked and young jenny had remembered to put fresh water in the daffodils that stood sunnily on the table pleased that her instincts for the new maid had been on target ann wandered to the pots of herbs sitting on the windowsill above the sink a press of her thumb showed her the soil was dry watering the window herbs wasnt jennys responsibility she thought clucking her tongue as she saw to it herself the cook needed to care for her own but then mrs williamson was getting up in years and becoming slightly absentminded with it ann often made excuses to remain in the kitchen during meal preparation just to be certain that mrs williamson didnt chop off anything important or start a fire anyone but miss laura would have pensioned the woman off by now ann mused but miss laura understood that the need to be needed didnt diminish with age miss laura understood templeton house and tradition it was after ten and the house was quiet her duties for the day were done giving the kitchen one last scan she thought of going into her quarters brewing some tea in her own little kitchen perhaps putting her feet up and watching some foolishness on tv something anything to keep her mind off her worries wind rattled the windows and made her shudder made her grateful for the warmth and security of the house then the back door opened letting in rain and wind and biting air letting in so much more ann felt her heart jolt and stutter in her breast hello mum the bright sassy smile was second nature and nearly reached her eyes as margo combed a hand through the hair that dripped like wet gold to her waist i saw the lightliterally she added with a nervous laugh and figuratively youre letting in the wet it wasnt the first thing that came to anns mind but it was the only practical one close the door margo and hang up that wet jacket i didnt quite beat the rain keeping her voice light margo shut the storm outside id forgotten how cold and wet march can be on the central coast she set her flight bag aside hung her jacket on the hook by the door then rubbed her chilled hands together to keep them busy you look wonderful youve changed your hair ann didnt lift a hand to fuss with it in a gesture that might have been natural for another woman she had no vanity and had often wondered where margo had come by hers margos father had been a humble man really it suits you margo tried another smile her mother had always been an attractive woman her light hair had hardly darkened over the years and there was little sign of gray in the short neat wave of it her face was lined true but not deeply and though her solemn unsmiling mouth was unpainted it was as full and lush as her daughters we werent expecting you ann said and was sorry her voice was so stiff but her heart was too full of joy and worry to allow for more no i thought of calling or sending a wire then i i didnt she took a long breath wondering why neither of them could cross that short space of tile and touch the other youd have heard we heard things offbalance ann moved to the stove put the kettle on to boil ill make tea youll be chilled ive seen some of the reports in the paper and on the news margo lifted a hand but her mothers back was so rigid she let it drop again without making contact theyre not all true mum ann reached for the everyday teapot heated it with hot water inside she was shaking with hurt with shock with love not all it was only one more humiliation margo told herself but this was her mother after all and she so desperately needed someone to stand by her i didnt know what alain was doing mum hed managed my career for the past four years and i never never knew he was dealing drugs he never used them at least not around me when we were arrested when it all came out she stopped sighed as her mother continued to measure out tea ive been cleared of all charges it wont stop the press from speculating but at least alain had the decency to tell the authorities i was innocent though even that had been humiliating proof of innocence had equaled proof of stupidity you slept with a married man margo opened her mouth shut it again no excuse no explanation would matter not to her mother yes a married man with children guilty margo said bitterly ill probably go to hell for it and im paying in this life as well he embezzled a great deal of my money destroyed my career made me an object of pity and ridicule in the tabloid press sorrow stirred inside ann but she shut it off margo had made her choices so youve come back here to hide to heal margo thought but hiding wasnt so very far from the truth i wanted a few days someplace where i wouldnt be hounded if youd rather i go then before she could finish the kitchen door swung open what a wild night annie you should laura stopped short her quiet gray eyes lighted on margos face she didnt hesitate didnt merely cross that short span of tile she leaped across it margo oh margo youre home and in that one moment in that welcoming embrace she was home she doesnt mean to be so hard on you margo laura soothed calming troubled waters was instinctive to her she had seen the hurt on the faces of mother and daughter that they seemed blind to at margos shrug laura poured the tea that ann had brewed and laura had carried up to her own sitting room shes been so worried has she smoking in shallow puffs margo brooded out the window there was a garden she remembered arbors that dripped with wisteria and beyond the flowers the lawns the neat stone walls were the cliffs she listened to lauras voice the calming balm of it and remembered how they had peeked into this room as children when it had been mrs templetons domain how they had dreamed of being fine ladies turning she studied her friend so quietly lovely margo thought a face meant for drawing rooms garden parties and society balls and that apparently had been lauras destiny the curling spill of hair was the color of old gold styled with studied care to swing at her fragile jaw the eyes were so clear so true everything she felt mirrored in them now they were filled with concern and there was a flush on her cheeks from excitement margo mused and worry emotion always brought either quick color to lauras cheeks or drained it come sit laura ordered have some tea your hairs damp absently margo pushed it back so that it cleared her shoulders i was down at the cliffs laura glanced toward the windows where the rain whipped in this i had to build some courage but she did sit took the cup margo recognized the everyday doulton her mother had used how many times had she nagged ann into teaching her the names the patterns of the china and crystal and silver of templeton house and how many times had she dreamed about having pretty things of her own now the cup warmed her chilly hands and that was enough you look wonderful she told laura i cant believe its been nearly a year since i saw you in rome theyd had lunch on the terrace of the owners suite at templeton rome the city spread beneath them lush with spring and her life margo thought had been as full of promise as the air as glittery as the sun ive missed you laura reached out gave margos hand a quick squeeze we all did how are the girls wonderful growing ali loved the dress you sent her for her birthday from milan i got her thankyou note and the pictures theyre beautiful children laura they look so much like you alis got your smile kayla has your eyes she drank tea to wash away the lump in her throat sitting here the way we used to imagine we would i cant believe its not all just a dream she shook her head quickly before laura could speak tapped out the cigarette hows peter hes fine a shadow flickered into lauras eyes but she lowered her lashes he had work to finish up so hes still at the office i imagine hell just stay in town because of the storm or because he preferred another bed to the one he shared with his wife did josh find you in athens margo tilted her head josh was he in greece no i tracked him down in italy after we heardwhen the news started coming through he was going to try to clear his schedule and fly out to help margo smiled thinly sending big brother to the rescue laura hes an excellent attorney when he wants to be didnt he find you i never saw him weary margo rested her head against the high back of the chair that dreamlike state remained it had been barely a week since her life had tilted and poured out all of her dreams it all happened so fast the greek authorities boarding alains yacht searching it she winced as she remembered the shock of being roused out of sleep to find a dozen uniformed greeks on deck being ordered to dress being questioned they found all that heroin in the hold the papers said theyd had him under observation for over a year thats one of the facts that saved my idiotic ass all the surveillance the evidence theyd gathered indicated that i was clean her nerves still grinding she tapped another cigarette out of her enameled case lighted it he used me laura finagling a booking here where he could pick up the drugs another there where he could drop them off id just had a shoot in turkey five miserable days he was rewarding me with a little cruise of the greek isles a prehoneymoon thats what he called it she added sending out smoke in a stream he was smoothing out all the little hitches on his amicable divorce and wed be able to come out in the open with our relationship she took a steady breath then as laura patiently listened studying the smoke twisting toward the ceiling she continued of course there was never going to be a divorce his wife was perfectly willing to have him sleep with me as long as i was useful and the money kept coming in im sorry margo i fell for it thats the worst of it she shrugged her shoulders took one last deep drag and crushed the cigarette out all the most ridiculous cliches she couldnt hate alain for that nearly as much as she hated herself we had to keep our affair and our plans out of the press until all the details of his divorce settlement could be worked out on the outside we would be colleagues business partners friends he would manage my career use all of his contacts to increase the bookings and my fees and why not hed nailed me some solid commercials in france and italy hed finalized the deal with bella donna that shot me to the top of the heap i dont suppose your talent or your looks had anything to do with your being chosen as spokeswoman for the bella donna line margo smiled i might have gotten it on my own but ill never know i wanted that contract so badly not just the money though i certainly wanted that but the exposure christ laura seeing my own face on billboards having people stop me on the street for my autograph knowing i was doing a really good job for a really good product the bella donna woman laura murmured wanting margo to smile and mean it beautiful confident dangerous i was so thrilled when i saw the ad in vogue thats margo i thought my margo stretched out on that glossy page looking so stunning in white satin selling face cream selling beauty laura corrected firmly and confidence and danger dreams you should be proud of it i was she let out a long breath i was so caught up in it all so thrilled with myself when we started to hit the american market and so caught up in alain all the promises and plans you believed in him no at the very least she had that he had been only one more in the line of men shed enjoyed flirted with and yes used i wanted to believe everything he told me enough that i let him string me along with that shopworn line about his wife holding up his divorce she smiled thinly of course that was fine with me as long as he was married he was safe i wouldnt have married him laura and ive begun to realize it wasnt that i was in love with him so much as i was in love with the life i imagined gradually he took over everything because it was easier for me not to have to bother with details and while i was dreaming of this glorious future where the two of us would bop around europe like royalty he was siphoning off my money using it to finance his drug operation using my minor celebrity over there to clear the way lying to me about his wife she pressed her fingers against her eyes so the upshot is that my reputation is in tatters my career is a joke bella donnas dropped me as their spokeswoman and im damned near broke everyone who knows you understands you were a victim margo that doesnt make it better laura being a victim isnt one of the faces im comfortable wearing i just dont have the energy to change it youll get past this you just need time and right now you need a long hot bath and a good nights sleep lets get you settled in the guest room laura rose extended a hand wheres your luggage im having it held i didnt know if id be welcome for a moment laura said nothing merely stared down until margos gaze faltered im going to forget you said that because youre tired and feeling beatup after tucking an arm around margos waist laura led her from the room you havent asked about kate margo blew out a breath shes just going to be pissed at me at the circumstances laura corrected give her some credit is your luggage at the airport mmm she was suddenly so tired it was as if she was walking through water ill take care of it get some sleep well talk more tomorrow when youre feeling better thanks laura she stopped at the threshold of the guest room leaned against the jamb youre always there thats where friends are laura kissed her lightly on the cheek always there go to bed margo didnt bother with a nightgown she left her clothes pooled on the floor where she peeled them off naked she crawled into the bed and dragged the cozy comforter up to her chin the wind screamed at the windows the rain beat impa tiently against the glass from a distance the sound of the surf roared up and snatched her into dreamless sleep she never stirred when ann slipped into the room smoothed the blankets touched her hair offered up a quiet prayer chapter three typical lying around in bed until noon margo heard the voice dimly through sleep recognized it and groaned oh christ go away kate nice to see you too with apparent glee kate powell gave the drape cord an enthusiastic pull and sent sunlight lasering into margos eyes ive always hated you in defense margo pulled a pillow over her face go pick on someone else i took the afternoon off just so i could pick on you in her efficient way kate sat on the edge of the bed and snatched the pillow out of margos hands concern was masked behind an appraising eye you dont look half bad for the waking dead margo muttered she pried open one eye saw kates cool sneering face and shut it again go away if i go the coffee goes kate rose to pour from the pot shed set at the foot of the bed and the croissants croissants after sniffing the air margo warily opened both eyes she was greeted by the sight of kate breaking flaky bread in two the steam that poured out smelled like glory i must have died in my sleep if youre bringing me breakfast in bed lunch kate corrected and took a hefty bite when kate remembered to eat she liked to eat well laura made me she had to run out to some committee meeting she couldnt reschedule still kate lifted the tray sit up i promised her id see that you ate something margo tugged the sheets over her breasts and reached greedily for the coffee she drank first felt some of her jet lag recede then sipping slowly she studied the woman who was briskly adding strawberry jam to a croissant ebony hair cut gamine short accented a honeytoned triangular face margo knew the style wasnt for fashion but for practicality it was kates good luck she mused that it suited so perfectly those large exotic brown eyes and sassily pointed chin men would consider the slight overbite undeniably sexy and margo had to admit it softened the entire look not that kate went in for soft she thought the trim navy pinstriped suit was all business gold accessories were small and tasteful the italian pumps practical even the perfume margo thought as she caught a whiff stated clearly that this was a serious professional woman the dontmesswithme scent margo decided and smiled you even look like a damn cpa you look like a hedonist they grinned foolishly at each other neither of them was prepared for margos eyes to fill oh god dont do that im sorry sniffling margo rubbed her hands over her eyes all this stuff inside me just keeps swinging up and down back and forth im a fucking mess with her own eyes watering kate pulled out two tissues she was a sympathetic crier particularly where her family was concerned and though there was no blood between them margo was family had been family since kate eight years old and orphaned had been taken in and loved by the templetons here blow your nose she ordered briskly take some deep breaths drink your coffee just dont cry you know youll get me started laura just opened the door and let me in margo mopped at the tears and struggled to level her voice just welcome home get some sleep what did you think she would do kick you into the street margo shook her head no not laura this whole ugly mess may bleed over onto her the press is bound to go for that angle soon disgraced celebritys childhood friendship with prominent socialite thats reaching kate said dryly nobody in the states really considers you a celebrity torn between insult and amusement margo leaned back im a very hot name in europe was this is america pal the media will toss a little fish like you back in no time margos lips moved into a pout thanks a lot she tossed the covers aside and rose kate scanned the naked body before reaching for the robe laura had draped over the footboard the centerfold bodylush breasts tiny waist sleek hips and long dangerous legshadnt been adversely affected by the scandal if kate hadnt known better she would have said the figure her friend boasted was the result of modern technology rather than the good fairy of genes youve lost a little weight how come you never lose it in your boobs satan and i have an understanding they used to be a part of my job description used to be margo shrugged into the robe it was her own a long flowing swirl of ivory silk laura had obviously had her luggage delivered most advertisers dont care to have adulterous drug dealers endorsing their products kates eyes clouded she wouldnt tolerate anyone talking about margo that way not even margo you were cleared of the drug charges they didnt have any evidence to charge me thats entirely different she shrugged walked to the window to open it to the afternoon breeze youve always told me i ask for trouble i suppose i asked for this thats just bullshit incensed kate leapt up began to pace like an angry cat her hand automatically dug into her pockets for the always present roll of turns her stomach was already on afterburn i cant believe youre taking this lying down you havent done anything touched margo turned back started to speak but kate was barreling on popping tums in her mouth like candy as she stormed the room sure you showed poor judgment and an incredible lack of common sense obviously you have questionable taste in men and your lifestyle choices were far from admirable im sure i can count on you to testify to that if it should become necessary margo muttered but kate held up a hand to make her point you did nothing illegal nothing that warrants losing your career if you want to spend your life posing so people run out and buy some ridiculously overpriced shampoo or skin cream or in ways that make men lose twenty points of iq on impact you cant let this stop you i know there was moral support in there somewhere margo said after a moments thought i just have to weed it out from my poor judgment questionable taste and foolish career then again i have to remember that your judgment is always good your taste perfect and your career brilliant thats true there was a flush on margos cheeks now and fire in her eyes relieved kate grinned you look beautiful when youre angry oh shut up margo marched to the terrace doors wrenched them open and strode out onto the wide stone balcony with its mini garden of impatiens and violas the weather was clear and fine one of those unspeakably beautiful days drenched with gilded sunlight cupped by blue skies perfumed with flowers the templeton estate big sur stretched out tumbling gardens and tidy stone walls graceful ornamental bushes and stately old trees the pretty stucco stables that were no longer used resembled a tidy cottage off to the south she could just catch a glint that was the water of the pool and the fanciful white gazebo beyond it decked with pretty fouroclocks shed done some dreaming in that flowerdrenched gazebo she remembered imagining herself a fine lady waiting for a devoted and dashing lover why did i ever want to leave here i dont know kate came up behind her draped an arm over margos shoulder in heels she was still an inch shy of margos stacked five ten but she drew margo against her and supported her i wanted to be someone someone dazzling i wanted to meet dazzling people be a part of their world me the housekeepers daughter flying off to rome sunning on the riviera decorating the slopes at saint moritz youve done all those things and more why wasnt it ever enough for me kate why was there always this part of me that wanted one more thing just one more thing i could never get a grip on i could never figure out what it was now that i may have lost all the others i still havent figured it out youve got time kate said quietly remember seraphina margos lips curved a little as she thought of how she had stood on seraphinas cliff the night before and of all the lazy days when she and kate and laura had talked about the young spanish girl the conclusions theyd come to she didnt wait and see margo leaned her head against kates she didnt stop and see what the rest of her life had to offer heres your chance to wait and see well margo blew out a breath as fascinating as that sounds i might not be able to wait for some of it i think i may be in some stormy financial waters she drew back and tried to put on a sunny smile i could use your professional help i figure a woman with an mba from harvard can decipher my poorly kept and disorganized books want to take a shot kate leaned back against the rail the smile didnt fool her for a minute and she knew if margo was worried about something as casual as money it was a desperate time ive got the rest of the day get some clothes on and well get started margo knew it was bad shed expected it to be bad but from the way kate was grumbling and hissing she understood it was going to be a hell of a lot worse after the first hour she stayed out of kates way it did no good to hang over her shoulder and be snapped at so she occupied herself by unpacking carefully hanging dresses that had been carelessly packed into the rosewood armoire meticulously folding sweaters into the scented drawer of the mirrored bureau she answered kates occasional questions and tolerated the more than occasional abuse desperate gratitude flooded through her when laura opened the door sorry i was gone so long i couldnt quiet im trying to perform miracles here margo jerked a thumb at the terrace shes working on my books margo explained when they were outside you cant imagine what she pulled out of her briefcase this little laptop computer a calculator im sure could run equations for the space shuttle even a fax shes brilliant with a sigh laura sat down on one of the wroughtiron chairs and slipped out of her shoes templeton would hire her in a heartbeat but shes very stubborn about not working for family bittle and associates is lucky to have her what is this crap about seaweed kate shouted its a spa treatment margo called back i think its deductible because just let me do the thinking how the hell can you owe fifteen thousand dollars to valentino how many outfits can you wear margo sat down it probably wouldnt be smart for me to tell her that was for one cocktail dress id say not laura agreed the kids will be home from school in an hour or so they always put her in a good mood well have a family dinner to celebrate your homecoming did you tell peter i was here of course you know i think ill make sure we have champagne chilled before laura could rise margo covered her hand hes not pleased with the news dont be silly certainly hes pleased but she began to twist her wedding ring around her finger a sure sign of agitation hes always glad to see you laura it isnt nearly twentyfive years of knowing you that lets me see when youre lying its that youre so lousy at it he doesnt want me here excuses trembled on her tongue but they were useless it was true laura admitted lying was a skill shed never mastered this is your home peter understands that even if he isnt completely comfortable with the situation i want you here annie wants you here and the kids are thrilled that youre here now im not only going to go see about that champagne im going to go bring a bottle up here good idea she would have to worry about guilt later maybe itll help kate keep me in the black this mortgage is fifteen days overdue kate called out and youre over the limit on your visa jesus margo ill bring two bottles laura decided and kept a smile in place until shed left margos room she went to her own wanting a moment to herself shed thought she had gotten over her anger but she hadnt it was still there she realized high and bitter in her throat she paced the sitting room to work it off the sitting room that was becoming more of a sanctuary she could come here close herself in with the warm colors and scents and tell herself that she had correspondence to answer some little piece of needlework to finish but more often she came here to work off an emotion that choked her perhaps she should have expected peters reaction been prepared for it but she hadnt been she never seemed to be prepared for peters reactions any more how could it be that after ten years of marriage she didnt seem to know him at all she stopped by his office on the way home from her committee meeting on the summer ball she hummed to herself as she took the private elevator up to the penthouse suite of templeton monterey peter preferred the suite to the executive offices on the hotels ground level it was quieter he said made it easier to concentrate from her days of assisting and learning the business in the nerve center of the sales and reservations offices she had to agree perhaps it separated him from the pulse from the people but peter knew his job the sheer beauty of the day added to the pleasure of having her old friend home again lifted her mood with a spring in her step she crossed the silvertoned carpet to the airy reception area oh hello mrs ridgeway the receptionist offered a quick smile but continued working and didnt quite meet lauras eyes i think mr ridgeway is in a meeting but let me just buzz through and let him know youre here id appreciate it nina ill only take a few minutes of his time she wandered over to the seating area quietly empty now the leather seats in navy were new and as pricey as the antique tables and lamps and the watercolors peter had commissioned had been but laura supposed hed been right the offices had needed some sprucing up appearances were important in business were important to peter but as she gazed through the wide window she wondered how anyone could care about navy leather seats when that awesome view of the coast presented itself just look at how the water rolled how it stretched to forever the ice plants were blooming pink and white gulls veered in hoping some tourist would offer a treat see the boats on the bay bobbing like shiny expensive toys for men in doublebreasted navy blazers and white slacks she lost herself in it and nearly forgot to retouch her lipstick and powder before the receptionist told her to go right in peter ridgeways office suited the executive director of templeton hotels california with its carefully selected louis xiv furnishings its glorious seascapes and sculptures it was as erudite and flawlessly executed as the man himself when he rose from behind the desk her smile warmed automatically he was a beautiful man bronze and gold and trim in elegant savile row she had fallen in love with that faceits cool blue eyes firm mouth and jawlike a princess for a prince in a fairy tale and as in a fairy tale he had swept her off her feet when shed been barely eighteen hed been everything shed dreamed of she lifted her mouth for a kiss and received an absent peck on the cheek i dont have much time laura i have meetings all day he remained standing tilting his head the faintest line of annoyance marring his brow ive told you its more convenient if you call first to be certain i can see you my schedule isnt as flexible as yours is her smile faded im sorry i wasnt able to talk to you last night and when i called this morning you were out so i went by the club for a quick nine holes and a steam i put in a very long night yes i know how are you laura how are the girls i missed you she waited a moment but he said none of those things youll be home tonight if im able to get back to work i should be able to make it by seven good i was hoping you could were having a family dinner margos back his mouth tightened briefly but he did stop looking at his watch back she got in last night shes so unhappy peter so tired unhappy tired his laugh was quick and unamused im not surprised after her latest adventure he recognized the look in his wifes eyes and banked down on his fury he wasnt a man who cared for displays of temper even his own for gods sake laura you havent invited her to stay it wasnt a matter of inviting her its her home it wasnt anger now so much as weariness he sat gave a long sigh laura margo is the daughter of our housekeeper that does not make templeton her home you can carry childhood loyalties too far no laura said quietly i dont think you can shes in trouble peter and whether or not any of it is of her own making isnt the issue she needs her friends and her family her names all over the papers the news every bloody tabloid show on the screen sex drugs name of god she was cleared of the drug charges peter and she certainly isnt the first woman to fall for a married man his voice took on the tedious patience that always put her teeth on edge that may be true butdiscretion isnt a word she seems to be aware of i cant have her name linked to ours and risk our standing in the community i dont want her in my house that brought lauras head up and erased any thought of placating him its my parents house she tossed back with fury sizzling in every word were there peter because they wanted it to be lived in and loved i know my mother and father would welcome margo and so do i i see he folded his hands on the desk thats a little dig you havent tried in some time i live in templeton house work for the templeton empire and sleep with the templeton heiress when you bother to come home laura thought but held her tongue whatever i have is due to the templeton generosity thats certainly not true peter youre your own man an experienced and successful hotelier and theres no reason to turn a discussion of margo into a fight gauging her he tried a new tack it doesnt bother you laura to have a woman with her reputation around our children certainly theyll hear gossip and allison at least is old enough to understand some of it the flush rose to her cheeks then died away margo is alis godmother and shes my oldest friend shes welcome at templeton as long as i live there peter she straightened her shoulders looked him dead in the eye to use words youll understand those terms are nonnegotiable dinners at seventhirty if youre able to make it she strode out and controlled the urge to slam the door now alone in her room she fought back the resurging temper it never did her any good to lose it only made her feel foolish and guilty so she would calm herself put on that smooth false front she was growing so accustomed to wearing it was important to remember that margo needed her and it was becoming painfully clear that her husband did not can i try your perfume aunt margo the one in the pretty gold bottle please margo looked down at kaylas hopeful face if they were casting angels she mused this one with her soft gray eyes and winking dimples would win the role hands down just a couple of drops margo took the stopper out and dabbed a whisper behind each of kaylas ears a woman doesnt want to be obvious how come because mystery is a spice like pepper ali three years superior to kaylas six years snorted but margo hauled kayla up on her lap and nuzzled her in a manner of speaking want a dab ali all but salivating over the fascinating bottles and pots on the vanity ali tried her best to sound nonchalant maybe but i dont want what she has something different then something playing it up margo waved her hand over this bottle and that bold and daring but not obvious kayla chimed in thats a girl here we are without a thought margo sacrificed a few dabs of a twohundreddollaranounce scent it was bella donnas new tigre she probably had twenty of the gorgeous handblown bottles in her milan flat youre growing up on me she accused and tugged the gold curls spilling to alis shoulders im old enough to have my ears pierced but daddy wont let me men just dont understand these things because she did perfectly she patted alis cheek before shifting kayla on her knee decorating ourselves is a womans privilege giving ali a bolstering smile in the mirror she went back to perfecting her makeup your momll talk him into it she cant talk him into anything he never listens hes very busy kayla said solemnly he has to work and work so we can stand so we wont lose our standing ali corrected and rolled her eyes kayla didnt understand anything she thought sometimes mama did and aunt kate always listened but she had hope great new hope that her glamorous and mysterious aunt margo would understand everything aunt margo are you going to stay now that those bad things happened to you i dont know margo set down her lipstick with a little click im glad you came home ali wrapped her arms around margos neck so am i the unstable emotions were stirring again she rose quickly grabbing each child by the hand lets go down and see if theres anything fun to eat before dinner were having hors doeuvres in the front parlor ali said loftily then giggled we hardly ever get to stay up for dinner with hors doeuvres stick with me kid she stopped at the top curve of the stairs lets make an entrance chins up eyes bored stomachs in fingers trailing carelessly along the banisters she was halfway down behind the girls when she saw her mother at the bottom landing ann stood with her hands folded her face solemn ah lady allison lady kayla were honored that you could join us this evening refreshments are being served in the front parlor ali inclined her head regally thank you miss annie she managed before she bolted after her sister it wasnt until margo had reached the bottom that she caught the twinkle in her mothers eyes for the first time since her return they smiled easily at each other id forgotten how much fun they are miss laura is raising angels i was thinking the same thing myself shes done everything righteverything i havent mum im sorry we wont talk about it now but ann laid a hand briefly over her daughters on the newel post laterbut theyre waiting for you now she started to walk away then paused margo miss laura needs a friend just now as much as you do i hope youll be a good one if somethings wrong tell me ann shook her head its not my place just be a good friend she walked away leaving margo to enter the parlor alone ali was already crossing the room her tongue caught in her teeth her hands full of a flute of fizzing champagne i poured it for you myself well then ill have to drink it she lifted the glass scanned the room laura had kayla on one hip and kate was sampling the finger food arranged on georgian silver a sedate fire flickered in the hearth framed by rich lapis the stunning curved mirror over the mantel tossed back reflections of glossy antiques delicate porcelain and rosy light from globe lamps to being home with friends margo said and sipped eat some of this mini quiche kate ordered over a full mouth its outrageous what the hell margo thought her weight was hardly a burning issue any longer she took one bite hummed in pleasure mrs williamsons still a wonder lord she must be eighty by now seventythree last november laura corrected and she can still whip up the most incredible chocolate souffle she winked at kayla which rumor has it is on for tonight daddy says mrs williamson should be retired and we should have a french chef like the barrymores in carmel because margo had ali sampled a quiche french chefs are snooty to demonstrate margo put a finger under her nose to lift it into the air and they never make jelly tarts with leftover dough for little girls did she do that for you too the image delighted ali did she let you flute the edges absolutely i have to admit your mother was the best at it according to mrs williamson i was too impatient and kate worried too much about getting it just right but your mom had a feel she was the champ jelly tart maker one of my major accomplishments margo heard the edge in lauras voice and lifted a brow with a shrug laura set kayla on her feet thats a fabulous dress margo milan or paris milan if laura wanted the subject changed she could oblige she struck a pose head tilted one hand on her hip the clinging black silk molded itself to her body and stopped daringly short at the thighs the low square neckline hinted at cleavage while sheer sleeves journeyed from the curve of her shoulders to wrists where twin diamond bracelets winked a little something i picked up from a sassy new designer youll freeze before the nights over kate commented not when my hearts so warm are we waiting for peter no laura decided on the spot then buried her annoyance when she caught alis worried look he was afraid his meetings might run over so theres no telling when hell get away well start dinner without him she took kaylas hand then glanced over as ann came to the doorway im sorry miss laura theres a phone call ill take it in the library annie have another glass of champagne she suggested as she started out i wont be long margo and kate exchanged a look one that promised they would talk later deliberately cheerful margo topped off the glasses and launched into a story about gambling in monte carlo when laura came back the children were wideeyed and kate was shaking her head youre certifiable margo betting twentyfive thousand on one spin of a little silver ball hey i won she sighed in memory that time was it daddy ali wanted to know hurrying over to tug on her mothers hand is he coming no distracted laura brushed her fingers over alis hair it wasnt daddy honey she wasnt so distracted she didnt notice the way her daughters shoulders drooped to soothe she crouched down smiling but its really good news something special what is it is it a party better laura kissed alis cheek uncle josh is coming home margo dropped to the arm of the sofa and found she needed to gulp down the champagne wonderful she muttered just wonderful chapter four joshua conway templeton was a man who did things in his own time and in his own way he was driving south from san francisco because hed decided not to fly to monterey from london he could have excused the detour by pretending that templeton san francisco needed a quick study but his familys landmark hotel ran like a wellwound clock the simple fact was that somewhere along the flight hed decided to buy a car and a honey it was too the little jag roared down highway like an eager thoroughbred at the starting gun it took a wide sweeping curve at seventy and made him grin this was home this rugged lonely coast he had tooled along the spectacular amalfi drive in italy sped through the fjords of norway but not even their heartstopping beauty could match the sheer drama of big sur it had more the glinting beaches and gleaming coves the cliffs that speared defiantly from savage sea to pristine sky brooding forests the surprise of a stream that cascaded out of a canyon like liquid silver then there were miles of tranquillity broken only by the din of seals the cold fire of the surf always the glory of it grabbed at his throat wherever he had been however long he had traveled away this single spot on the globe pulled at him so he was coming home in his own time and in his own way recklessly he tested the jag on the wild twisting curves that dropped off to jagged rocks and unforgiving sea he punched the gas on the straightaway and laughed as the wind rushed over him it wasnt hurry that pushed him but the simple love of speed and chance he had time he mused plenty of it and he was going to use it he was worried about laura thered been something in his sisters voice on the phone that alerted him shed said all the right things but then laura always did he would do a bit of probing there he decided there was business to see to hed been happy enough to leave the california executive offices of templeton hotels primarily in peters hands spreadsheets simply didnt interest josh he took an interest in the vineyards the factories even in the daytoday running of a busy fivestar hotel but bottom lines were peters concern not his for most of the past decade hed enjoyed the freedom of traveling through europe spotchecking overseeing the necessary renovations revamping policy changes of the family chain wineries in france and italy olive groves in greece orchards in spain and of course the hotels themselves which had started it all josh understood and supported the longheld templeton view that the difference between a hotel and a templeton was the fact that they served their own wines used their own oils their own produce manufactured their own linens templeton products were always offered in templeton hotels and part of his job was to see that they were used well his title might have been executive vice president but in essence he was a troubleshooter occasionally he handled or supervised the handling of a few of the legal complexities a man with a harvard law degree was expected to keep his hand in still he preferred people to papers enjoyed watching a harvest drinking ouzo with the staff or closing a new deal over cristal and beluga at robuchon in paris it was his charm that was his most valuable asset to templetonso his mother said he did his best not to disappoint her for despite a careless somewhat reckless lifestyle he took his duties to his family and the business seriously they were one and the same to him and as he was thinking of family even as gravel spit out from under his tires and had the family of four in the sedan he shot past gaping in shock he thought of margo she would be depressed he mused shattered penitent miserable not that she didnt deserve to be his lips curved in something between a smile and a sneer hed pulled strings cashed in markers and generally executed a wild tap dance to see that she was quickly and completely cleared of any criminal charges in athens after all templeton athens was an old dignified hotel and with templeton resort athena it lured a great deal of money to the country there was little he could do about the scandal or the damage it had done to the career shed built in europe if you could call sending sulky looks into a camera a career shed just have to get over it he decided his smile now tinged with arrogance and he intended to help her in his own way in an old habit he was hardly aware of he swung over to the side of the road and brought the car to a screeching halt there higher still on the rugged hill surrounded by trees going lush with spring and trailing vines spilling rich blossoms was home stone and wood two of the resources templeton had profited by rose out of the rugged earth the original twostory structure had been built by an ancestor as a country home and stood for more than a hundred twentyfive years surviving storms floods quakes and time wings had been added by subsequent generations spearing out here there tumbling down to follow the shape of the hill twin turrets rose up defiantlyan addition of his fathers fancy wide wooden decks and sturdy stone terraces shot beneath tall arched windows wide glass doors to offer dozens of panoramas flowers and trees were blooming pink and white and yellow spring colors he thought fresh and inviting and the grass was the soft tender green of beginnings he loved the way it flowed up out of a rocky base growing more lush and more tended as it met the house the land and the sea were as intricate and as intimate a part of the house as its curving trim and glinting stone he loved it for what it was what it had been and what it had given him knowing laura watched over it nurtured it warmed him pleasure at simply being there had him swinging fast across the road shooting up the snaking lane carved into the rock then in shock slamming on the brakes to avoid crashing into a high iron gate he scowled at it for a moment before the intercom beside his car buzzed on templeton house may i help you what the hell is this who put this damn thing up imr joshua recognizing the voice he struggled to bank down on his irritation annie open this ridiculous gate will you and unless were under attack leave the damn thing open yes sir welcome home what the hell was laura thinking of he wondered as the gate swung silently back templeton had always been a welcoming place his friends had roared up that curving lane constantly during his youthon foot on bikes then in cars the idea of its being closed off even by something as simple as a gate spoiled his pleasure in the drive from rugged ground to manicured lawns and gardens he swung badtemperedly around the center island planted magnificently with hardy spring perennials and nodding daffodils he left both his keys and his luggage in the car and jamming his hands in his pockets mounted the lovely old granite steps to the front terrace the main entrance door was recessed ten feet high and arched framed by intricately placed mosaics that formed a pattern of trailing purple bougainvillea echoed by the trellises of living blooms spilling over the archway hed always thought it was like walking through a garden even as he reached for the door it was swinging open laura literally leapt into his arms welcome home she said after shed rained kisses over his face and made him smile again for a minute i thought you were locking me out the puzzlement in her eyes made him pinch her chin an old habit whats with the gate oh she flushed a little as she backed up and smoothed her hair peter thought we needed some security security all you have to do is climb over a few rocks to skirt around it well yes but shed said the same herself and since it was josh she gave up it looks secure and important she cupped his face in her hands so do you look important i mean actually she thought he looked windblown dangerous and annoyed to soothe she tucked her arm through his and made admiring noises over the car in the driveway where did you get the new toy in san francisco she drives like a bullet which explains why youre here a full hour before you were expected lucky for you mrs williamson has been slaving all morning in the kitchen preparing all that sweet master joshs favorite foods tell me were having salmon cakes for lunch and alls forgiven salmon cakes laura confirmed allumettes asparagus foie gras and black forest cake quite a combination come in and tell me all about london you did come from london right just a quick business trip id been taking a few days off in portofino oh thats right she moved into the parlor to pour him a glass of the sparkling mineral water that templeton bottled the curtains were open as she preferred them forming frames around window seats made welcoming with colorful pillows thats where i hunted you down when i heard about margo umhmm hed already been hard at work on margos behalf when laura had called but he didnt pass that information along instead he gave a sprig of freesia tucked with its fellows into a meissen vase a careless brush so how is she i talked her into sitting by the pool for a while to get some sun josh this is so terrible for her she looked so beaten when she came home bella donna is going to drop her as their spokeswoman her contract with them was coming up for renewal and its pretty much a given that theyll let her go its rough he sat in the wide wing chair nearest the hearth stretched out his legs so maybe she can tout someone elses face cream you know its not that easy josh shed made a mark in europe endorsing bella donna it was her main source of income and now its cut off if youve paid any attention to the press you know that the chances of her being offered anything like it here in the states is slim to none so shell get a real job loyalty had her jerking up her chin youve always been so hard on her somebody has to but he knew that arguing about margo with his sister was useless love always blinded laura okay sweetie im sorry for what happened to her the fact is she got a raw deal but lifes full of them shes been raking in the lire and francs for the last few years all she has to do now is sit on her portfolio lick her wounds and figure out what comes next i think shes broke that shocked him enough to have him setting his glass aside what do you mean broke i mean she asked kate to look over the figures kate hasnt finished yet but i have a feeling its bad margo knows its bad he couldnt believe it hed taken a good long look at the bella donna contract himself and he knew that the salary and benefits should have set her up comfortably for a decade then he let out a sound of disgust why couldnt he believe it they were talking about margo after all for christs sake what has she been doing heaving her money into the tiber well her lifestyle after all shes a celebrity over there and wasnt she worried enough without having to explain laura wondered hell josh im not sure but i know she had that slime who got her into this mess managing her for the last few years pinhead he muttered so she comes crawling home sniveling she did not snivel i should have expected you to take this line she went on it must be men none of you have any loyalty or compassion peter wanted to toss her out as if let him try josh murmured with a dangerous glint in his eye its not his house laura opened her mouth closed it again if this emotional roller coaster she was stuck on didnt stop soon she was going to jump peter didnt grow up with margo the way we did he isnt attached to her the way we are he doesnt understand he doesnt have to josh said shortly and rose shes out by the pool yes josh youre not going out there and start poking at her shes unhappy enough josh shot her a look ill just go and rub some salt in her wounds then i think ill run out and kick some puppies on my way to foreclosing on my quota of widows and orphans lauras lips curved just try to be supportive well have lunch on the south terrace in about half an hour it would give her time to have his luggage taken upstairs and properly unpacked margo knew the moment he stepped off the flagstone path onto the skirt of the pool she didnt see him hear him smell him her instincts when it came to josh went into a sixth sense when he didnt speak merely sat on one of the padded lounges on the pool terrace she continued to swim it was too cold to swim of course but shed needed to do something the water was warm enough steam rose from it into the cooler air and every stroke she took brought her arms into chilly contact with the freshening breeze she cut through the water in long slow strokes and risked a quick glance at him he was staring off toward the rose garden preoccupied she thought he had lauras eyes she thought it always surprised her to see lauras lovely gray eyes in joshs face his were cooler she thought more impatient and often brittlely amused at margos expense hed gotten a tan somewhere she noted as she pivoted and started back across the length of the pool just a nice warm hint of color that added another dash of appeal to what was already a sinfully handsome face as one who accepted that shed lucked out in the gene pool she didnt set much store by simple good looks it was after all just a matter of fate joshua templetons fate had been superior his hair was shades darker than his sisters tawny margo imagined was the term hed let it grow a bit since the last time theyd run into each other what was thatthree months before in venice it flirted with his collar now the collar of a casual chocolate silk shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows he had she recalled a good expressive mouth it could smile charmingly sneer with infuriating style and worse curve in a smile so cold it froze the blood the jaw was firm and thankfully without the beard hed sported briefly in his twenties the nose was straight and faintly aristocratic over it all was an aura of success confidence and arrogance all shimmering together with a glint of latent danger she hated to admit that there had been a time during her adolescence when shed been both allured by and frightened of that aura she was sure of one thing he was the last person she would allow to see how badly she was now frightened by the present and the future deliberately she stood in the shallow end water slid off her body as she slowly walked to the steps she was freezing now and would have turned into a chunk of bluing ice before she would have admitted it as if shed just become aware she wasnt alone she lifted a brow and smiled her voice was low throaty and just shy of hot well josh the worlds much too small she was wearing a couple of stingy scraps of sapphire spandex her curves were lush sleek with skin as smooth as polished marble with the sheen of fine silk most men she knew took one look at what god had given her and shot straight into fantasy mode josh merely tipped down his wayfarers and studied her over their top he noted that shed lost weight that that glorious skin of hers was prickled with gooseflesh in a brotherly fashion he tossed her a towel your teeth are going to chatter in a minute annoyed she swung the towel around her neck fisted her hands its invigorating where did you drop in from portofino by way of london portofino one of my favorite spots even if the templetons dont have a hotel there did you stay at the splendido where else if she was going to be idiotic enough to stand there and freeze hed let her he crossed his ankles leaned back the corner suite she said remembering where you stand on the terrace and see the bay the hills the gardens that had been his intention a couple of days to wind down to do a little sailing but hed been too busy negotiating via phone and fax with the police and politicians in greece to enjoy the view how did you find athens he was nearly sorry when he noted her eyes flicker but her recovery was quick oh not as accommodating as usual a little misunderstanding thats all taken care of it was annoying though having my cruise disrupted im sure it was he murmured so inconsiderate of the authorities too all that inconvenience over a few pesky kilos of heroin she smiled easily my thoughts exactly negligently she reached out for the robe shed slung over the back of a chair not even pride was going to hold off the shivering much longer i can use the time off though a little break from the routine its been too long since ive been able to squeeze out any real time to visit with laura and kate and the girls she belted the robe and nearly sighed with relief and you of course josh knowing it irritated him she bent down to pat his cheek how long are you going to be in the area he took her wrist knowing it irritated her and rose as long as it takes well then she always seemed to forget he was four inches taller than she until she was faced with that long rangy build itll be just like old times wont it i think ill go in and get into some dry clothes she kissed his cheeks briskly called ciao over her shoulder and strolled down the path toward the house josh watched her go hating himself for being annoyed that she hadnt been teary and wrecked hating himself more much more for the undeniable fact that he was and always had been in love with her it took margo six tries before she settled on the proper outfit for lunch the flowing silk tunic and slacks in fragile pink seemed just casual enough while maintaining a certain elegance and style she accented the outfit with gold doorknocker earrings a couple of bangle bracelets and a long braided chain shoes added another ten minutes before she was inspired to go barefoot that would lend an air of insouciance she couldnt explain why she was always compelled to impress josh or struggle to outdo him sibling rivalry seemed too tame and much too ordinary an explanation it was true enough that he had teased her unmercifully as a child from his lofty advantage of four years had tormented her as a teenager and had as their paths crossed in adulthood made her feel foolish shallow and irresponsible in turn one of the reasons the bella donna contract had meant so much to her was that it was a tangible measure of success that shed been able to flaunt under his disapproving nose now she didnt have that any longer all she had was imagebolstered by the wardrobe and glitters shed desperately collected over the years she could only thank god that shed gotten out of the mess in athens before hed had to come riding in on his white charger to save her that would have been a humiliation hed never have let her forget it was lauras laughter she heard first after descending the stairs and wandering toward the south terrace it made margo stop thats what had been missing the past couple of days she realized lauras laughter shed been too tangled in her own miseries to notice however joshs presence got on her nerves she had to be gratefulhed made laura laugh again she was smiling when she stepped out and joined them whats the joke josh merely leaned back with his water glass and studied her but laura reached for her hand josh is always telling me some horrible secret crime he committed when we were kids i think he does it to terrify me about what ali and kayla are pulling off under my nose the girls are angels margo said as she sat down at the round glass table under an arbor of sweetly blooming wisteria josh was the devils spawn she spread foie gras on a toast point and bit in whats the crime do you remember that night when you and i went out to seraphinas cliffs with matt bolton and biff milard it was summer we were just fifteen kate wasnt with us because she was a year younger and couldnt date yet margo cast her mind back we doubledated with matt and biff a lot that summer until biff tried to unhook your bra and you bloodied his nose what josh immediately came to attention what do you mean he tried to unhook your bra im sure youve attempted the maneuver once or twice josh margo said dryly shut up margo you never told me hed tried to his eyes took on a warriors glint what else did he try laura sighed and decided she was enjoying the salmon cakes more than shed anticipated nothing worth you flying to los angeles to hunt him down and shoot him like a dog for in any case if id wanted him to unhook my bra i wouldnt have punched him in the nose would i to get back to the story that was the night we heard seraphinas ghost oh right i remember margo helped herself to more pate it was the tiffany porcelain lunch service today she noted the monet pattern with its cheerfully bright blue and yellow and to set it off a silver vase filled with yellow frangipani from the greenhouse her mothers touch she thought shed used the same china the same flowers when she allowed margo to have the tea party shed so longed for on her thirteenth birthday was it she wondered her mothers quiet unspoken way of welcoming with a shake she brought herself back we were sitting on the cliffs necking define necking josh demanded she only smiled and stole one of the matchstick potatoes from his plate there was a full moon and all this lovely light on the water the stars were so huge and bright and the sea went on forever then we heard her she was crying like her heart would break laura added it was intense but very soft like something carried up into the air we were terrified and thrilled and the guys were so spooked they forgot all about scoring and kept trying to get us back to the car but we stayed we could hear this whispering and moaning and crying then we heard her speak margo shivered remembering it in spanish i had to translate because youd been too busy painting your nails in class to pay attention to mrs lupez she said find my treasure it waits for love even as margo sighed josh was chuckling it took me three days to teach kate how to say that without fumbling it the kid never had an ear for languages we nearly fell off the ledge laughing when the two of you started to squeal margo narrowed her eyes you and kate we planned it for a week since she didnt seem that interested he forked up her salmon cake and transferred it to his own plate she was feeling pretty left out when you two started dating i got the idea when i came across her sulking on the cliffs everybody knew you two hung out there with dumb and dumber and i thought it would cheer kate up he swallowed and grinned it did if mom and dad had known youd taken kate scrambling down the cliffs to cling to a ledge at night theyd have murdered you it would have been worth it it was all you two talked about for weeks after margo wanted to call in a psychic she winced it was just a suggestion you started looking them up in the phone book josh reminded her and went down to monterey and bought tarot cards i was experimenting she began before a laugh bubbled out damn you josh i blew every penny of my spending money that summer on crystals and palm reading when id been saving desperately for sapphire studs it would have served you right if id stumbled on the secret of seraphinas lost dowry never existed he pushed his plate away before he ate more and regretted it in any case how could a man eat after that hoarse sexy laugh of hers had driven a spike of lust into his gut of course it did she hid it to keep it out of the hands of the invading americans then jumped into the sea rather than live without her lover josh sent margo an affectionately amused glance arent you past the fairytale stage yet its a pretty legend thats all and legends are persistently based on fact if you werent so closeminded truce laura lifted her hands as she rose try not to take any chunks out of each other while i see about dessert im not closeminded he said before his sister had cleared the doors im rational you never had any soul youd think someone who spent as much time in europe as you exposed to rome and paris and some of us work in europe he interrupted and had the satisfaction of seeing her eyes go dark and dangerous thats just the look you had for that perfume ad he said easily what was that called savage that campaign upped bella donnas sales ten percent thats why what i do is considered work right he topped off her water glass so margo did matt ever try to unhook your bra she was calm she told herself she was in control she lifted the glass looked josh dead in the eye i never wore one she watched him frown watched his gaze wander down in those days she added laughing she rose stretched maybe im glad youre home after all i need someone to fight with glad to oblige whats wrong with laura she looked down youre quick josh you always were shes worried about me that might be all but im not sure hed find out he thought and nodded as he rose are you worried about you it surprised her the gentleness in his voice the light brush of his knuckles over her jaw she could lean against him she realized with a jolt she could lay her head on that shoulder close her eyes and for a moment at least everything would be all right she nearly stepped forward before she decided it would be foolish youre not going to be nice to me are you maybe it might have been the confusion in her eyes or that sultry scent that wafted from her skin but he needed to touch he laid his hands on her shoulders rubbed while his eyes stayed on hers do you need help i she could taste something on her lips and was baffled that it was anticipation of him i think excuse me with her face carefully blank ann stood on the terrace holding a portable phone her eyes flickered with something that might have been amusement when josh dropped his hands as though shed caught him tearing off her daughters clothes miss kates on the phone for you margo oh margo stared down at the phone her mother put in her hand thanks um kate hi something wrong you sound no no nothing at all margo interrupted brightly and how are you its coming on to tax time pal how do you think an accountant is which is why i just cant get away to come over there i really want to talk to you margo can you get over here to my office this afternoon i can give you some time between three and threethirty sure i suppose if you great see you margo clicked off the phone shes always been one of the champion communicators its nearly april fifteen crunch time margo lifted a brow he seemed perfectly at ease she noted all that tension all that anticipation must have been her imagination thats about what she said i have to get over to her office id better see if laura can lend me a car take mine its out front keys are in it he gave her dubious expression a quick charming smile hell margo who taught you to drive in the first place you did her eyes warmed and with uncharacteristic patience thats because i was terrified enjoy the drive and if you put a scratch on her ill toss you over seraphinas cliff when she sailed off he sat down again calculating that not only would he get her share of cake but he would now have the opportunity to pry out whatever was troubling his sister chapter five kate powell was consistent focused and often inflexible as margo strode down the corridor of the secondfloor offices of bittle and associates with their buzz of activity ringing phones and clattering keyboards she realized this was exactly what kate had had in mind for herself since childhood she had without detour worked steadily toward it all of her life there had been the advanced math courses in high school which of course shed aced her three terms as class treasurer the summers and holidays shed worked in bookkeeping at templeton resort to advance her training and onthejob experience from there the scholarship to harvard her mba followed by her refusal gracious but firm to take a position in any of the templeton offices no margo thought eyeing the discreet carpet and walls feeling the jittery tension in the taxtime air kate had chosen bittle taken an entrylevel position her salary would have been higher at a firm in los angeles or new york but she wouldnt have been able to stay close to home in that kate was also consistent so shed worked her way up in the firm margo didnt know a great deal about accountants other than they were always whining about taxes and shelters and projected earnings but she understood that kate was now responsible for several important clients in the old respected andin margos opinionmusty firm of bittle and associates at least all those years of effort had earned her a decent office margo mused as she peeked into kates door though how anyone stood being cooped up in four walls facing away from the window all day was beyond her kate however looked contented enough her desk was neat and that was to be expected no tchotchkes no fancy paperweights no frivolous doodads cluttered its surface to kate margo knew clutter was one of the seven deadly sins along with impulse disloyalty and a disorganized checkbook a few files were arranged in an orderly stack on the edge of the plain boxy desk dozens of lethally sharp pencils stood in a lucite holder a jazzy little computer hummed as kate rattled the keys shed taken off her navy jacket and hung it over the back of her swivel chair the sleeves of her crisp white shirt were rolled up in businesslike fashion she was frowning a concentration line dug between her brows above the studious hornrim reading glasses though her phone rang busily it didnt earn a blink of response even as margo stepped in kate held up a single finger continuing to work the keys onehanded then with a grunt she nodded and looked up youre on time for a change close the door will you do you know how many people wait until aprils knocking to hunt up their receipts no everybody have a seat as margo took the dungbrown chair across from the desk kate rose she rolled her shoulders circled her head murmuring what sounded like relax after slipping off her glasses she tucked the temple into the breast pocket of her shirt so that the glasses hung there like a medal then she turned chose two plain white mugs from a shelf and reached for the pot on her coffeemaker annie said josh was home yeah he just got in looking tanned and terrific when did he ever look anything else noting that shed neglected to open her blinds again she did so now and let natural light slant into the room to war with the glow of florescents i hope he plans to stay a while im not going to have any free time until after the fifteenth from her desk drawer she took a bottle of mylanta uncapped it and guzzled like a veteran wino with a bottle of crackling rose christ kate how can you do that its hideous kate only lifted a brow how many cigarettes have you had today champ she said blandly thats hardly the point grimacing margo watched kate tuck the bottle back into the drawer at least i know im slowly killing myself you should see a doctor for gods sake if youd just learn to relax try those yoga exercises i told you about save it kate cut off the lecture in midsentence and checked her practical timex she didnt have the time or the inclination to worry about a nervous stomach certainly not until she finished calculating the realized capital gain and loss summary currently on her screen ive got a client due in twenty minutes and i dont have time to debate our varying addictions she handed margo a mug slid a hip onto the edge of her desk has peter shown up i havent seen him margo struggled for a moment but lecturing kate had always been a study in frustration better she decided to concentrate on one friends problems at a time laura doesnt have much to say about it kate is he living at the hotel not officially kate started to bite her nails before she studiously stopped herself just a matter of willpower she remembered and drank coffee instead but from the buzz i get he spends more time there than he does at home she moved her shoulders still working out kinks her head was throbbing nastily between tax time and the mess her closest friends were in she welcomed each day with a tension headache of course its a busy time of year for him too margo smirked you never liked him kate smirked right back neither did you well if theres trouble in paradise maybe i can help laura through it but if hes just staying away because im there i should leave i could stay at the resort he missed plenty of bed checks before you rolled back into town i dont know what to do about it margo she rubbed tired eyes with unpainted fingertips she wont really talk about it and im lousy at giving advice on relationships anyway still seeing that stud cpa down the hall no kate shut her mouth firmly on that closed book she reminded herself even if it did still burn i dont have time to date the fact is as tied up as i am for the next week or so im really glad youre there with laura and the kids ill stay unless it looks like its complicating things for her absently margo tapped her fingers on the arm of the chair lovely shellpink nails bumping against the chairs dull brown shes awfully happy to have josh back i dont think i realized she was so unhappy until i saw her with him today which reminds me she set the coffee aside kate brewed it strong enough to pump iron werent you worried about risking a haunting by mocking seraphinas ghost kates face went blank what huddling on a ledge and moaning in bad spanish about your dowry laura and i werent fooled for a minute what are you oh oh as memory flooded back kate roared with laughter it was not the laugh of a thin seriousminded woman it boomed straight from the gut grew deeper in the throat and tickled margo into grinning back god id forgotten that oh i was so jealous so pissed that you and laura were dating and uncle tommy and aunt susan were making me wait another year i didnt even want to date but i hated you getting ahead of me as she spoke she got up to top off her coffee christ josh always had the best and wildest ideas she added as she perched on the desk again youre lucky you didnt slip off the ledge and get to meet seraphina face to face we had ropes she chuckled into her coffee i was scared boneless at first but i didnt want josh to think i was lame you know how he is about a dare mmm margo knew very well a templeton never refused a challenge both of you would have been grounded for weeks yeah those were the days kate said with a wistful smile anyway i got caught up in the whole thing playing seraphina and listening to the two of you calling out to her was one of the highlights of my life i cant believe he ratted on me he probably thinks im too mature now to pull out your hair margo tilted her head and smiled im not but you have so little of it to begin with then she clasped her hands around her knee well i know you and you didnt ask me to come into such professional surroundings to have a giggle over old times you might as well give it to me all right it was cowardly kate knew to wish she could postpone the moment we can say theres good news and bad news i can use some good you still have your health at margos nervous laugh kate set her own mug aside she wished she had a better way to do this wished shed been smart enough or clever enough to find an escape clause for margo sorry bad accountant joke you have to have a pretty good idea that you dont have a hell of a lot else margo financially youre fucked margo pressed her lips together nodded dont softpedal it kate i can take it appreciating her kate slid off the desk sat on the arm of margos chair and hugged her i put everything in a computer program and printed out a hard copy and got less than three hours sleep thanks to the extra workload but i thought youd get more out of the whole picture if i boiled it down youve got some choices i dont she had to pause to level her voice i dont want to file bankruptcy only as a last resort kate i know its pride but pride kate understood enormously well i think we can avoid that but honey youre going to have to seriously consider liquidating and youre going to have to be prepared to take a loss on some of your assets i have assets margo asked hollowly you have the flat in milan there isnt a lot of equity as you only bought it five years ago and your down payment was low but you can get out what you put in and with luck a little more because it was personal kate didnt need her notes or the file she remembered all the details you have the lamborghini and its almost paid for we arrange to sell it quickly and youll save on those exorbitant garage and maintenance fees okay she tried not to regret her beautiful flat lovingly furnished or the glamorous car shed adored driving fast in the countryside there were a great many things she couldnt afford margo reminded herself top of the list was selfpity ill put them on the market i suppose ill have to go over and pack everything up and saying nothing kate rose to open a file not to refresh her memory but to give herself something to do with her hands she perched her glasses back on her nose theres the dead animals sunk in depression margo shook her head what your furs thats such an american attitude margo grumbled anyway i didnt kill those stupid minks or the sables kate said dryly peering over the tops of her hornrims sell them and that also saves you cold storage fees now your jewelry it was an arrow straight to the heart oh kate not my jewelry toughen up its just rocks and minerals with her free hand she picked up her coffee again ignoring the faint burning under her breastbone the insurance premiums on it are killing you you cant afford it and you need the cash to meet your debts dressmakers bills salon bills taxes italian taxes are stiff and you didnt exactly save for a rainy day i had some savings alain had been siphoning them off she realized her fingers were aching and made herself untwist them i didnt even know it until last week bastard kate thought but that was then and this was now you can prosecute whats the point margo said wearily it would just feed the press pride again she thought it was useless to ask kate if she could afford a few miserly spoonfuls of pride so basically i have to give up everything everything i have everything ive worked for everything ive wanted okay miserable kate put the file aside im not going to tell you theyre just things margo i know theyre not but this is a way out there are others you could sell your story to the tabloids pick up some quick ready cash why dont i just go down to hollywood and vine and sell my body it would be less humiliating you could go to the templetons margo shut her eyes it shamed her that for a moment just a moment she was tempted theyd bail you out kate said gently float you until you were on your feet again i know i cant do that after all theyve done for me and been to me added to that is how it would make my mother feel ive upset her enough without going begging i can lend you ten thousand right away thats what i have liquid kate said briskly it would put a finger in the dike and i know that laura and josh would plug the other leaks it wouldnt be begging and it would be nothing to be ashamed of just a loan between friends margo said nothing for a moment touched and ashamed she stared down at the sapphires and diamonds winking on her hands so i can keep my pride and my furs and diamonds slowly margo shook her head no i dont think im going to be able to keep any of it but thanks youll want to consider this weigh your options the offer stays open kate took the file proffered it wished there was more the figures are all there i calculated the fair market value of the jewelry from the insurance appraisals ive got the sale value of your car the flat and so forth calculated with a ten percent leeway deducted all the expected fees and taxes if you decide to liquidate youll earn some breathing space not a lot but enough to keep your head above water for a while and then what margo thought but she didnt dare ask okay i appreciate you wading through all the mess thats what i do best just at that moment it seemed pitifully little margo take a couple of days mull it over i will she rose then laughed weakly when her knees shivered christ im shaky sit down ill get you some water no margo held up a hand i really need some air ill go with you no thanks but i need a minute gently kate brushed a hand over margos hair want to kill the messenger not right now instead she gave kate a hard fierce hug ill be in touch she said and rushed out of the office she wanted to be brave all of her life margo had yearned for adventure the glamour and romance of it she wanted to be one of those carelessly daring women who dont simply follow trends but create them she had most of her life quite deliberately exploited her sense of style her looks her sexuality to gain her own ends her education had been no more than a necessary phase something to get through unlike laura or kate she had merely put in time in the classroom what would she need with algebraic formulas or historical facts in her life it was much more important what they were wearing this season in new york or who the upandcoming designers were in milan it was margo thought as she stood on the windswept cliffs above the sea pathetic her life was pathetic even a month before she had thought it perfect of course then everything had been streaming along exactly as she wanted she had a flat in the right part of the city was recognized and catered to in the right restaurants and boutiques she had a circle of friends that included the wealthy the well known and the wild she attended fashionable parties was thrillingly dogged by the press and pursued by men and of course she feigned weariness and ennui over the articles that speculated about her private life she had a career that had put her precisely where she had always wanted to be in the limelight then there was her lover of the moment the suave gorgeous older man as she preferred french married of course but that was merely a technicality an obstacle again fashionable that would eventually be overcome the very fact that they had been forced to keep their affair secret had added a thrill a thrill that she realized now she had so easily mistaken for passion now it was all over she hadnt believed she could be any more shocked or frightened than in those first hours after she had been taken into athens for questioning the terror of being so alone so exposed had bounced her roughly from a privileged world into a dangerous one and when no one from that carefully selected circle of friends had come to her aid or her defense she had been forced to stand on her own and reevaluate margo sullivan but that didnt seem to be enough she sat on a rock absently tugging a woolly white blossom from its slender stem laura would know the name of the wildflower margo mused but then laura despite the privileges of birthright was the wildflower type whereas margo was strictly hothouse she was ruined somehow it had been easier to handle the possibility of being broke before kate had put it all in stark black and white possibilities were abstract and changeable now it was reality she was or soon would be without a home without an income without a life she stared down at the flower in her hand it was simple it was stubborn planting its roots in shallow soil fighting its way to the sun rip off the bloom another would grow she understood now that shed never had to fight for anything and she was afraid deeply afraid that now that she was uprooted she would simply wither waiting for seraphina margo continued to study the flower twirling it as josh settled on the rock beside her no just waiting laura took the girls to dance class so i thought id take a walk actually hed been considering a quick jaunt to the tennis court to work on his serve but then he saw margo on the cliffs from his bedroom window hows kate busy and efficient id say shes found her nirvana with bittle and associates he shuddered scary the quick chuckle felt good tossing her hair back she smiled at him were so miserably shallow josh how do we stand ourselves by never standing still long enough to take a close look is that whats got you down margo he tugged on the hair shed pulled sleekly back from her face have you been looking too close thats what happens when you get a mirror shoved in your face he slipped her shaded glasses off narrowed his own eyes its a hell of a face he said lightly then tucked the glasses back on her nose do you want to know what i see she pushed off the rock wandered closer to the edge of the cliff im not sure i could take another shot today youve never bothered to sugarcoat what you thought of me why should i when a woman looks like you she collects flattery tossing the less inventive lines aside like last years fashions youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen he watched her turn and though her eyes were hidden he sensed her surprise its a sinful face a sinful body they almost punish a man for wanting them for wanting you all that abundant hot sex with hints of the wild driving it and you use it without even thinking a look a tilt of the head a gesture its a phenomenal and occasionally cruel talent you have but youve heard that before not exactly she murmured she wasnt sure if she was flattered or insulted but most of thats an accident of nature he rose and walked to stand beside her you were born to be a fantasy maybe thats all you can manage the hurt was so sharp so sudden she couldnt even gasp thats cold josh and just like you when she started to whirl away he took her arm his grip unexpectedly strong his voice infuriatingly mild i havent finished bright bubbling fury spewed inside her if she could have wrenched away and clawed him she would have let go of me im sick of you and everyone like you im worth bothering with as long as i fit the mold the party girl for a good time call but the minute theres trouble its so easy to say i wasnt anything to begin with just a scrabbler reaching above my station he slid his hands down to cuff her wrists his voice still detestably patient were you im not a damn picture in a magazine i have feelings and fears and needs and i dont have to prove anything to anyone but myself good good for you its about time you realized that with an easy strength that both baffled and infuriated her he simply pulled her back from the cliff and nudged her down on the rock he kept his grip firm as he crouched in front of her youre the one who played with the illusion margo who used it and youre the one whos going to have to shatter it dont tell me what i have to do if you dont take your hands off me shut up just shut up he gave her a brisk shake that made her mouth fall open in shock youll have to get used to that too he told her being treated like a human being instead of a pampered barbie doll lifes finally been tossed in your face duchess deal with it what do you know about life bitterness ached in her throat you were born with everything you never had to struggle for a single thing you wanted never had to worry if youd be accepted or loved or wanted back he stared at her grateful for the moment that she couldnt see that hed spent nearly half of his life worrying that she the single thing he wanted would accept him love him and want him back but were not talking about me are we she turned her face stared hard out to sea i dont care what you think of me fine but im going to tell you anyway youre a spoiled careless and reckless woman who has for a good long time hardly given a thought to anything beyond the moment up till now your ambitions have melded nicely with your fantasies now youve been given a very rude slap itll be interesting to see if youll be able to draw on your other qualities to pull yourself up again oh she began icily i have other qualities he wondered what perverted twist in his makeup caused him to adore that frosty fuckyou tone of hers you come from strong and resilient stock margo a temperament that doesnt take failure lying down absently he lifted her hands and kissed them youre loyal and warm and compassionate to those you care for what you lack in common sense you make up for with humor and charm the emotions that swirled inside her threatened to erupt in laughter or tears or screams she forced them to wither and kept her face as blank and cold as her voice thats a fascinating analysis youll have to bill me for it im a little short of cash no charge he drew her to her feet again brushed at the hair that danced wildly around her face listen if you need something to tide you over until dont you dare offer me money she interrupted with a snap in her voice im not some destitute family retainer it was his turn to be insulted i thought you were a friend well keep your money in your numbered swiss account friend im perfectly capable of taking care of myself as you like after a shrug he held out his hand how about a lift back to the house her lips curved coolly how about you stick out your wellmanicured thumb she strode away picking her way with careless grace over rocks moments later he heard the panther roar of his own car and the skid of tires on pavement christ he thought with a quick laugh he was crazy about her she was still seething with fury when she marched into the house temper carried her well down the central hallway before the sound of voices registered calm reasonable voices overly calm margo realized at once coldly reasonable and bitingly formal it made her shudder to think that husband and wife would speak to each other in such lifeless tones however wrenching it had been she much preferred the passionate exchange shed just had with josh to the kind of studied argument going on between laura and peter in the library the heavy pocket doors were open allowing her to step up to the threshold and observe the entire scene such a civilized room margo thought with its soaring ceiling its two levels walled with books and diamondpaned windows the old bokhara rug and the smell of leather a civilized room she thought again for a civilized argument how perfectly horrible im very sorry you feel that way peter i simply cant agree with you the business the running of templeton hotels our place in society and the media are hardly your fortes laura i would not be in the position im in nor have the responsibilities i have if your parents and the board of directors didnt value and respect my opinion thats true margo stepped quietly to the doorway she could see laura standing in front of the window seat her hands clasped loosely there was such temper and distress in her eyes that margo wondered how peter could remain oblivious to it for himself peter was in front of the lovely old adam fireplace very lord of the manor with one hand on the mantel and the other wrapped around a waterford lowball glass gleaming with light and unblended scotch in this case however laura continued in that same quiet empty voice i dont believe the family would share your concern josh certainly doesnt peter let out a hard dismissive laugh josh is hardly one to worry about reputation hes more at home flitting off to clubs and rubbing elbows with eurotrash be careful laura only murmured the warning but there was force behind it you and josh approach things differently but youre each an important part of templeton my point is that josh fully supports margos remaining at templeton house as long as she chooses and foreseeing this altercation i contacted my parents this morning theyre delighted margo is home his lips went thin and white at that margo would have been pleased by the reaction if his temper hadnt been directed at laura you went behind my back thats typical of you isnt it running to your parents whenever we disagree i dont run to them peter there was weariness now as if giving in to it laura sat down on the padded window seat light streamed in through the lovely arched window at her back causing her to look fragile pale and heartbreakingly beautiful and i dont discuss our private problems with them in this case it was in your words business and business is for me to handle his voice was clipped all reason with an undertone of carefully controlled impatience you only have the house to run and the children to see to both of which youre putting in second place to some misguided sense of loyalty no one and nothing comes ahead of my children really a small smile curved his lips as he took a sip of his scotch i dont suppose you found time in your busy and demanding day of manicures and luncheons to watch television one of the tabloid shows dedicated an entire thirty minutes to your old friend there was a particularly interesting clip of her sunbathing topless on a yacht several of her close friends gave interviews detailing her many affairs and her socalled freespirited lifestyle naturally the show didnt fail to report her connection with templeton and her longstanding friendship with laura templeton ridgeway pleased that she didnt respond he inclined his head it included a picture of the two of you and the children in addition a waiter at the country club was happy to tell them how the two of you and an unnamed woman had a giddy champagne lunch by the pool two years ago laura waited a beat kates going to be annoyed they didnt get her name out of patience she waved a hand and rose and he saw that what he had taken for shame was annoyance really peter its all nonsense the last time we were on the riviera you were irritated with me because i was too shy to go french yet youre condemning margo because she did and if any of those people had been her friends they wouldnt have been chafing to give interviews which they were paid for that gossiped about her and nearly half the women i know get snockered at the club regularly if we wanted to have a giddy champagne lunch to celebrate being together its no ones business youre not only blind and stubborn but youre foolish and this attitude youve developed of late has gone on long enough attitude he set his glass on the mantel with a snap questioning me defying my wishes neglecting your duties in the community margos presence here is merely an excuse for you to go on behaving badly i dont need an excuse apparently not ill put it another way a clearer way laura as long as that woman lives in this house i dont an ultimatum peter very slowly she inclined her head i think you might be rudely surprised by my answer to that on impulse margo stepped into the room hello peter dont worry im every bit as thrilled to see you as you are to see me with a brittle smile she walked over to the decanter though she rarely drank anything other than wine she poured two fingers of scotch she wanted something to do with her hands i know im interrupting but i was on my way back to speak to mum she took a quick bracing sip shuddered it down you seem to be taking your most recent debacle in stride peter commented oh you know me roll with the flow she gestured widely rings glittering im sorry i missed the show you were telling laura about i do hope those shots of me sunbathing were flattering those longrange lenses can distort you know beaming smiles she lifted her glass to him and you and i understand all about appearances dont we peter he didnt bother to conceal his disdain she was as she had always been to him the housekeepers inconvenient daughter people who eavesdrop on private conversations rarely hear anything flattering absolutely true resolved now she took a last sip before setting the glass down as youd be aware if youd ever heard any of my private conversations about you you can rest easy i was coming in to tell my mother i have to go back to milan distress made laura step forward step between them margo theres no need for that she took the hand laura offered squeezed it there is i left dozens of things hanging i needed this little breather but i have to go back and tend to the details ignoring peter she gathered laura close i love you laura dont say it like that alarmed laura drew back searched margos face youre coming back she gave a careless shrug even as her stomach jittered well see how the wind blows but ill be in touch i need to talk to mum before i pack she gave laura a last hug before turning toward the door not sure if shed have another chance she went with impulse again and turned back she offered peter her sultriest smile one more thing youre a pompous egotistical selfimportant ass you werent good enough for her when she married you youre still not good enough for her and you never will be it must be hell for you knowing that as exits went margo thought as she glided out shed never done better im not running away margo insisted as she hurriedly packed arent you with her hands folded at her waist ann watched her daughter always in a rush she thought to get from one place to the next never stopping to think id stay if i could id rather stay but she tossed a cashmere sweater into her bag i just cant out of habit ann took the sweater out folded it neatly replaced it you should take more care with your possessions and your friends youre leaving miss laura when she needs you im leaving to make things easier for her damn it out of patience margo tossed her hair over her shoulder cant you ever give me credit for doing something right shes downstairs right now arguing with peter because of me he threatened to leave her if i stay he doesnt want me here this is templeton house ann said simply and he lives here laura is his wife im just the housekeepers daughter odd you only remember that when it suits you im asking you to stay and do what you can for her oh guilt works so well she thought as she stalked over to wrench a blouse out of the armoire like a bell to pavlovs dog im a cause of tension in her marriage an embarrassment i will not see her torn between me and the man shes been married to for ten years you know i love her yes ann sighed a little yes i know you do loyalty isnt one of your failings margo but im telling you she needs you here her parents are off in africa someplace they know little about whats gone on in this house and little i suspect of whats happened to you they would be here otherwise but youre here and you should stay if you would for once listen to what i say do as i ask i cant she sent her mother a thin smile some things dont change kate and josh are here for her and you she added i have to get out of the way so she can work things out with peter if thats what she wants though god knows why she cut herself off waved a hand in dismissal thats her decision mine is to go back to milan i have to deal with things there i have to pick up my life well youve made the mess of it youll have to clean it up youll hurt her by going she said quietly and me ann thought cant you see how it hurts me to see you walk away again i hurt her by staying too so either way im of no use to her at least in milan i can try to put some of my own pieces back together i need money i need work you need eyes cool ann studied her daughter well then that naturally comes first ill arrange for your cab to the airport mum washed with regret margo took a step after her im trying to do whats right if its a mistake then its a mistake but im trying to do what i think is best try to understand that i only see youre going when youve hardly come home ann closed the door behind her the only goodbye margo would have chapter six margo had fallen hard for milan at first sight she had been dazzled by paris awed by rome amused by london but milan with its busy streets impeccable style and easy panache had won her heart her career had fulfilled her childhood dream of travel tickled the wanderlust that had always been part of her soul yet in her own way she had needed roots a base a place to call her own she had chosen the flat on impulse because she liked the look of the building the charming terraces that offered a view of the street and a glimpse of the spearing towers of the duomo and because it was a convenient stroll from her door to the elegant shops of the montenapoliane she stood on her terrace now sipping chilly white wine watching the lateevening traffic punctuated by the high dou bletoned blare of sirens the sun was setting gilding the view and making her lonely for someone to share it with she had been right to come back it was perhaps the first selfless thing shed done in too long to remember though laura had argued until the cab whisked margo away and josh had simply stood eyeing her coolly with an expression that accused her of running she knew she had done what was best still doing what was right wasnt always comforting she was miserably lonely fears of the present and the future werent nearly as difficult to overcome as the isolation in the week since her return she hadnt answered the phone or returned any of the messages already crowding her machine most of them were from reporters or acquaintances hoping for a tidbit of gossip mixed among them were a few offers she was afraid she would have to consider if she were truly brave and daring she mused shed shimmy into some little black dress and stroll into one of her old haunts to set the room buzzing maybe she would before it was done but for now she had a few more wounds to lick leaving the terrace doors open she walked into the living area other than a few gifts shed chosen each and every piece herself she hadnt wanted a decorator but had enjoyed the adventure of hunting down every pillow and lamp it certainly reflected her taste she thought with a wry smile eclectic hell she correctedscattered an antique curio cabinet crowded with limoges boxes and steuben glass the japanned chest that served as coffee table was topped with a huge waterford compote that was in turn filled with colorful handblown fruit there were tiffany lamps art deco ones even a doulton flambe that featured a seated buddha and had cost her some ridiculous amount at auction just to sit there and look ugly every room of the twobedroom flat was crammed with more inkwells shed collected during some passing stage russian boxes paperweights vases bottlesall purchased for no other reason than that they were what she had been acquiring at the time still it made a lovely cluttered and homey place she thought as she settled down on the deeply cushioned sofa the paintings were good shed been told she had an eye for art and the street scenes that lined her walls were clever and lovely and brought the world into her rooms her world her rooms temporarily at any rate margo thought and lighted a cigarette but she wasnt going to be able to hide in them for much longer maybe she would take the offer from playboy and drive the wolf back away from her door her eyes narrowed in consideration she drew in smoke why not why not sell her pathetic story to the tabloids that called daily to clutter her answering machine tape either way shed have money again either way she would strip herself naked for the grinning world what were those few shreds of pride really doing for her hell maybe she should shock the civilized world and drag all her furnishings out onto the street for one wild goestothehighestbidder bazaar laughing she envisioned how it would distress her very polite and proper doorman her elegant neighbors and how it would delight the everhungry press so what if she spread herself out on the centerfold of a glossy mens magazine with a couple of strategically placed staples who would care if she prostituted her pride to whine about her troubles in a sunday supplement or supermarket paper no one expected any more or any less from her perhaps she thought tiredly crushing out the cigarette neither did she but to sell her possessions to publicly barter things for money that was so middleclass well something had to be done the bills were piling up and she wouldnt have a roof over her head much longer if she didnt pass over considerable lire she supposed the logical step would be to find a discreet and reputable jeweler and sell her glitters it would hold her level until she decided what step to take next she toyed with the squarecut sapphire on her hand she didnt have a clue what she had paid for it it hardly mattered did it she decided kate had calculated the worth and it was what she could get for it now that mattered she pushed herself up and hurried into the bedroom after unlocking the safe built into the cedar chest at the foot of her bed she began pulling out boxes and pouches in moments the lamplight beamed on a pile of glittering treasures worthy of ali babas cave dear god did she really own a dozen watches what was wrong with her and what had possessed her to buy that jeweled collar it looked like something out of star trek marcasite hair combs she never wore hair combs the tension began to ease from her shoulders as she examined separated began to make decisions there were dozens of pieces she discovered that she could part with without a qualm certainly she would reap enough to keep her head above water until she had time to think and clothes with manic energy she leapt up scattering jewelry and dashing to her closet it was enormous lined with dresses suits jackets lucite shelves held shoes bags builtin drawers were packed with scarves and belts a triple mirror ringed with lights reflected her image as she frantically pushed hangers to and fro there were secondhand shops that specialized in designer clothes she knew indeed she had purchased her first fendi bag at one in knightsbridge a lifetime ago if she could buy from a secondhand shop then by god she could sell to one she tossed jackets blouses skirts slacks over her arm rushed out to drop them on the bed dashed back for more she was giggling when the doorbell rang and she ignored it until the constant buzz cut through what she realized abruptly was the edge of hysteria it was a struggle to swallow the next bubble of laughter and for the life of her she couldnt remember the deep breathing exercises from her yoga class maybe im having a breakdown the sound of her own voice was tight and nervy the doorbell continued to buzz like a swarm of angry bees all right all right all right she snapped as she stepped over suede boots that had fallen out of her arms she would face whoever was at the door get rid of them and then deal with the latest mess shed created ready to fight she yanked the door open and stared josh why she wondered was he always the last person she expected to see he took a quick survey of the tousled hair the flushed face the robe that was slipping off her shoulder his first jealous thought was that hed interrupted sex i was in the neighborhood she folded her arms youre checking up on me laura made me the charming smile flirted around his mouth but his eyes were hot who the hell was in the flat whod been touching her i had a little problem to iron out at templeton milan so i promised her id swing by see how you were he angled his head so how are you tell laura im fine you could tell her yourself if youd answer the phone occasionally go away josh thanks id love to come in for a while no no he continued as he nudged by her i cant stay long when she stood firm and left the door open he shut it himself all right but just one drink god he was gorgeous she thought arrogance fit him as sleekly as his linen shirt maybe ill call security and have you tossed out his quick laugh had her clenching her fists as he wandered the room she measured him in leather bomber jacket and snug jeans he looked tougher than she would have expected she wondered if cheerful little marco who manned the door could bite him on the ankle this oil of the spanish steps is new since i was here last he commented eyeing her painting with mild avarice its not bad sixtyfive hundred for the french quarter watercolor she arched a brow you go up five hundred every time you make an offer im still not going to sell it to you it belonged in the lobby of templeton new orleans he shrugged off her refusal he would pry it away from her sooner or later he picked up a paperweight icy white shapes swimming inside icy white glass passed it from hand to hand he hadnt missed the way she kept glancing back toward the bedroom something else on your mind josh murder mayhem but he smiled easily hunger got anything to eat around here theres a nice trattoria just down the street good well walk down later but id love a little wine and cheese now dont trouble yourself he added when she didnt budge ill just make myself at home still carrying the paperweight he headed for the bedroom the kitchens back here margo began panicked his mouth turned grim he knew exactly where her kitchen was he knew where everything was in her flat and whoever was in the bedroom was going to discover that joshua templeton had staked prior claim damn it she caught at his arm and was dragged along with him ill get you a glass of wine just stay out of but it was too late she let out a frustrated groan as he strode over the threshold and stopped dead looking at the scene now she could hardly believe it herself clothes were in a stream from closet to bed sequins piled on denim cashmere heaped on cotton jewelry was spread in a sparkling lake on the rug it looked she realized like some badtempered child had thrown a tantrum but joshs observation was closer to the mark it looks like armani and cartier went to war one of those tricky bubbles of laughter tickled her throat she nearly managed to clear it away but her voice stuttered dangerously i was just sort of organizing the look he sent her was so dry and bland she lost her slippery hold on control holding her stomach she stumbled to the chest and collapsed onto it in a wild explosion of laughter casually josh reached down to pick up a slatebluejacket fingered the material the man is a god he said before tossing the armani onto the bed that sent her off into fresh peals joshua she managed to hitch in enough breath to speak you have to be the only living soul i know who could look at this and not run for the butterfly net because she loved him for it she held out a hand to invite him to sit beside her it was a temporary episode she said and let her head tilt against his shoulder i think im over it with an arm draped around her he surveyed the chaos this is all your stuff oh no she chuckled i have a closet in the second bedroom too its packed of course it is he pressed a kiss to the top of her head frowned at the scattered gems duchess how many earrings do you figure you own i havent the foggiest i didnt get into the costume stuff yet feeling better she sighed earrings are like orgasms you can never have too many i never thought about it quite that way well youre a man she gave his knee a friendly pat why dont i get that wine she was wearing nothing under the robe and his fingertips were beginning to tingle against the thin silk why dont i get it distance he told himself was the key the last thing she needed him to do just then was to lose his mind and start to slobber the kitchen i know where the kitchen is he flashed a grin at her narroweyed stare i was hoping to come in here and intimidate your lover i dont have a lover at the moment thats handy isnt it he strolled out certain that hed given her something to mull over when he came back pleased to have found an excellent barola in her wine rack she was kneeling on the floor carefully putting jewelry back in boxes the robe was flirting off her shoulder again josh was tempted to tug the sash tight himself doubleknot it so the fabric wouldnt continue to slip and slide so devastatingly when she saw him and rose he couldnt avoid seeing the flash of long slim leg every muscle in his body groaned the worst of it was she wasnt trying to drive him to his knees if she had been he could have without qualm tossed her onto the bed and finally fulfilled his fantasies but that careless sexuality was pure margo she took the glass he held out smiled at him i suppose i have to thank you for interrupting the insanity want to tell me what started the insanity just a stupid idea she walked to the doors of the bedroom terrace threw them open night poured in full of sound and scent she drew it in as she drew in the wine i really love milan almost as much as as annoyed with herself she shook her head doesnt matter im working on ways to stay here with some level of comfort going home to templeton house isnt an option youre going to let peter lock you out she bristled at that turning the fairy lights on the terrace twinkled around her and dazzled through the thin silk of her robe i dont give a goldplated shit about peter ridgeway but im not going to complicate things for laura laura can manage she doesnt let peter dust her around the way she used to if you had bothered to hang around youd have seen that for yourself she felt her hackles rise again damn him but she spoke smoothly regardless shes got a marriage to worry about for some ridiculous reason marriage is what matters to her christ knows why she wants to be tied down to one man especially a pompous jerk like peter josh took a contemplative sip werent you planning on marrying alain the slick lying drug smuggler she tried for dignity i didnt know he was a smuggler just a slick liar all right fine you can say that experience gave me a fresh viewpoint on and a general dislike for the institution the point is laura is married and im not going to make it more difficult for her its your home too margo now her heart swelled and broke just a little he cant change that but you cant always go home besides ive been happy here and i can be again he moved closer wanting to read her eyes kate says youre considering selling your flat her eyes were simple to read they were filled with annoyance kate talks too much she turned around to study those last gilding lights he turned her back again shes worried about you so am i you dont have to be im working on a plan why dont i take you to dinner you can tell me about it im not sure im up to the telling stage but i could probably eat we dont have to go out the trattoria will deliver and that way you dont risk bumping into anyone who knows you he concluded and shook his head dont be a coward i like being a coward then youd better get dressed deliberately he skimmed his fingertip over the bare skin of her shoulder up her throat and watched her eyes go dark and wary because youre asking for trouble right here she nearly tugged her robe into place before she stopped herself odd how the skin could tingle youve already seen me naked you were ten he slid the robe into place himself gratified when he felt her quick shiver it doesnt count to test her reaction he hooked his fingers in the belt of the robe gave one gentle tug want to risk it margo danger had snapped into the air abruptly unexpectedly fascinatingly struggling to be cautious she stepped back ill get dressed well go out safe choice but she didnt feel safe when he walked out and closed the door behind him she felt stirred hed done it to push her into going out that was the simple rational conclusion margo came to it seemed the only conclusion when he settled into the busy little restaurant and dived into his firstcourse selection of antipasto di funghi crudi with exuberance try one he held a marinated mushroom to her lips nudged it through nobody does vegetables like the italians nobody does anything edible like the italians but she toyed with her salad of tomato and mozzarella shed grown so accustomed to denying herself full meals that eating heartily still felt like cheating you need a good five pounds margo he said ten wouldnt hurt ten and id have a whopping bill from the dressmaker for alterations in my wardrobe eat live dangerously she nibbled on cheese youre sort of a businessman she began and made him laugh oh if you stretch the point that wasnt meant to be an insult its hard for me to picture you as an executive making corporate decisions your fathers always had this aura of power youre more feckless he suggested no relaxed impatient with herself she huffed out a breath im really not trying to insult you josh what i should say is that whatever it is you do you make it seem easy take peter no thanks in comparison she continued hes tense and driven successful yet ambitious corporate man is etched onto his face and i on the other hand the scion of the templeton for tune am relaxed was it and carefree jetting my way around the worlds hot spots seducing women in between squash matches or is it playing squash in between seducing women im not entirely sure margo said evenly but thats beside the point and the point of this deathless observation is i have insulted you too used to him to be concerned she shrugged you have to have some talent for business because your parents arent fools however much they love you they wouldnt give you free rein to poke into the hotels theyd just let you drain your trust fund and be a wastrel your confidence in me is touching with a sneer he topped off their glasses i think i need another drink and you have that law degree yes the one they gave me after id finished racketing around harvard dont be so sensitive she patted his hand it occurs to me that you must know something about managing things ive had a few interesting offers she began the most lucrative and least complicated is from playboy his eyes went so sharp so flinty it surprised her that they didnt strike sparks off the silverware i see ive posed naked beforeor the next thing to it wary of his enigmatic response she sliced off a bit of cheese european magazines arent as puritanical as american ones and you consider an arty ad in italian vogue on the same level as a centerfold in a skin magazine there were murderous thoughts rocketing through his head making him feel ridiculously like the cuckolded lover no she didnt and felt incredibly foolish same body she said with a careless shrug the point is ive made my living in front of the camera in varying stages of dress and undress this is a way to continue to do so a oneshot deal anyway that would put some distance between me and the creditors with what theyre offering me i could get back on my feet well one foot anyway his eyes never left her face nearby a waiter dropped a tray of dishes with a resounding crash and josh didnt so much as blink are you asking me to look over the offer it had been her thought but she reconsidered and reconsidered quickly at the razoredged tone in the question no i was simply mentioning one of my alternatives is that what you want to be margo some sweatypalmed adolescents wet dream this months pinup in the auto mechanic shop a visual aid at the fertility clinic i think thats in very poor taste she said stiffly thats in poor taste the way he exploded with it had several diners jerking their heads around and murmuring dont shout at me she said under her breath youve never had any respect for what i do i dont know why i thought you might have some sensible comment about this you want a sensible comment terrific he gulped down wine to force the bile back down his throat go right ahead and do it duchess take the money and run dont worry about embarrassing your family why should you care so they snicker the next time your mothers standing in line at the supermarket if the kids tease ali at school its not your problem just make sure youre well paid thats enough she said quietly is it he tossed back im just warming up i said it was an option i didnt say i was going to accept with impatient fingers she rubbed at a headache brewing at her left temple goddamn it its just a body my body youre connected to people id hoped youd begun to realize that what you do affects them i have wearily she let her hand drop all right i have judging from your reaction it wouldnt go over very well inch by inch he reeled in his temper and studied her is that what this was about testing the waters with me she managed a smile yes bad idea sighing she pushed her plate away on to the next we wont bother with the german producer whos offering a considerable pile of marks if i let him showcase me in his latest adult film jesus christ margo i said we wouldnt bother with that so what do you do when you decide to redecorate one of your hotels he rubbed a hand over his face while im trying to make that leap of thought well order the pasta course he signaled the waiter ordered tagliolini for himself and risotto for margo bracing her chin on her palm she began to think through that next option your italians much better than mine that might be helpful too margo darling dont go off on another tangent until ive caught up his blood was still hot at the idea of her being spread out in full glorious color for any man with pocket change to drool over are you asking me for decorating advice no no of course not the very idea made her snicker the headache and unsteady stomach his temper had caused began to ease im curious about what you do with the furnishings when you redo suites you want furniture josh just answer the question what do you do when you change the decor okay fine we rarely do that in one of our established hotels as the clientele appreciates the tradition what the hell was going through that fascinating mind of hers now he wondered but shrugged it wouldnt take long to find out however when we buy out another hotel we will usually revamp the rooms in the templeton style using the locale for inspiration well keep whatever is suitable or up to our standards sometimes shipping pieces off to another location what doesnt suit is normally sold at auction which is where the decorator and buyer would pick up replacements we also buy at antique shops and through estate sales auction she murmured it might be best simplest auctions antique shops estate sales theyre all really just secondhand stores arent they i mean everything there has been owned before used before sometimes people value things more if theyve belonged to someone else she beamed up at the waiter nearly causing him to jostle the plates as his blood pressure spiked grazie mario ho molta fame prego signorina mia piacere buona appetite he bowed away from the table narrowly avoiding a collision with a busboy your italians fine josh said dryly you dont even need words hes a sweetheart he has a lovely wife who presents him with a bambina every year and he never looks down my blouse she paused considered well hardly ever anyway she said digging into the risotto with genuine enthusiasm speaking of secondhand shops were we yes what sort of percentage of the value is customary when you sell it would depend on several factors what are they deciding hed been patient and informative long enough he shook his head no you first why do you want to know im thinking ofwhats the termdownsizing she speared a shrimp from his plate actually rightsizing has become the more politically correct term okay i like that better anyway rightsizing she chuckled over the idea ive been collecting things for ten years i thought i might unload some of them my apartments entirely too crowded and ive never taken the time to weed out my wardrobe since ive got some free time i thought she trailed off he hadnt said a word but she knew he understood she was scrambling for pride i need the money she said flatly its stupid of me to pretend otherwise kate thinks liquidation is the best option she tried to smile again and since playboy is out you dont want me to offer you a loan he murmured you just want me to sit back and do nothing while you sell your shoes for grocery money and my bags and my porcelain boxes and my candlesticks he wasnt going to feel sorry for her she determined by god no one was going to feel sorry for her look streisand did it a couple years ago didnt she not that she needed the money but whats the difference she sold things shed collected over the years and i doubt she turned up her nose at the money it doesnt appear that im going to be able to sell my face for the foreseeable future and i dont intend to sell my body so ive whittled the options down to my things she didnt want sympathy he determined so he wouldnt offer it is that what you were doing tonight when i came by inventory in an impulsive semihysterical sort of way but now im calm and rational and i see that the planactually kates planhas value she covered his hand with hers josh when you saw me back home you asked if i needed help im telling you i do im asking you for it he looked down at her hand the glint of sapphire and diamonds against creamy white skin what do you want me to do first keep this between us for now he turned his hand over linked his fingers with hers all right what else if you could help me figure out how and where to sell what i have to sell how to get the best price i havent managed my money well hell i havent done such a hot job with my life either but im going to start now i dont want to get fleeced because im not sure what somethings worth or because im in too much of a hurry he picked up his wine with his free hand considered not just what she was asking but what it meant and what could be done i can help you if youre sure its what you want im sure youve got a couple of choices as i see it you can get an agent keeping his eyes on hers he topped off their wine i know an outfit here in milan thats very trustworthy theyll come in appraise what youve selected give you around forty percent forty but thats terrible its actually a bit on the high side but we do a lot of business with them and youd probably get it grimly she set her teeth what are my other choices you could try one of the auction houses you could go with an appraiser and then contact some of the antique or collectible shops and see what youd get there he leaned closer watching her face but if you ask me you should sell yourself excuse me margo sullivan can sell anything what else have you been doing for the last ten years but hawking someone elses products sell yourself margo baffled she sat back excuse me arent you the one who just finished rapping my knuckles for mentioning doing just that not your picture you open a shop stock it with your own possessions advertise it flaunt it open a shop her laugh bubbled out as she reached for her glass i cant open a shop why not because i i dont know why she murmured and deliberately pushed her glass aside ive had too much wine if i dont know why your flats already a smallscale department store there are dozens of reasons why it wouldnt work her head spun just thinking about it i dont know anything about running a business keeping books learn he said simply theres taxes and fees licenses rent for christs sake flummoxed she began to run her fingers up and down the jeweled chain she wore im trying to eliminate bills not make more of them id need money an investor someone who would be willing to pump in the startup money whod be stupid enough to do that he lifted his glass i would chapter seven she spent most of the night picking the idea apart tossing in bed and reciting all the sane objections she should have thought of in the first place it was a ridiculous notion reckless and foolish and it had come along just when she was trying so hard to stop being ridiculous and reckless and foolish when tossing in bed frustrated her enough she rose to pace in the dark obviously josh knew little more about business than she did or he would never have suggested such a preposterous plan she wasnt a shopkeeper for gods sake appreciating lovely things only meant she had expensive taste it didnt mean she could turn herself into a merchant and maybe she did know how to sell but being the bella donna woman and urging some tourist to write a travelers check for a daum goldfish were two entirely different matters certainly people would come at first out of curiosity out of glee to see the once famous now notorious margo sullivan hawking her wares she would probably make a few sales too initially and some society matron with too many facelifts could gesture to her curio cabinet to point out the antique snuff bottle shed bought from that poor model whod fallen on hard times margo set her teeth well shed have that snooty matrons money in her pocket wouldnt she catching herself she shook her head no it was an impossible idea starting a business was simply too complicated and maintaining one would be beyond her she would only be setting herself up for another failure coward just shut up josh it wouldnt be your butt on the line just your money and she wasnt going to take his money anyway the idea of being indebted to him was more than her pride could stand even if she swallowed her pride she didnt think her nerves could handle working with him hed undoubtedly be popping up even more than usual checking on her checking on his investment looking at her the way he looked at her absently she rubbed a hand between her breasts had he always looked at her that way had she just begun to notice she recognized hunger in a mans eyes when she saw it was used to seeing it there was no reason for her mouth to go dry and her pulse to start jittering because they were joshs eyes his eyes were as familiar to her as her own shed known those eyes known him all of her life it had to be her imaginationimagination skewed by her emotional upheaval it was just that shed been feeling so unwanted shed mistaken kindness and concern from an old friend for desire that was it of course but she knew she hadnt mistaken her own reaction when he touched her when his fingers skimmed over her shoulder flesh to flesh and for an instant just a quick flash shed actually fantasized that his fingers would dip lower part her robe cup her breasts and and she had to be skirting madness to wind an erotic daydream around josh templeton he was a friend practically family and at the moment the least of her worries she had to concentrate on practicalities not sexual intrigues after alain shed decided that sex romance even the whisper of relationship were going to the bottom of her priority list the most reasonable thing for her to do would be to contact josh in the morning and ask him for the name of the agent hed mentioned she would cull out everything she didnt need for basic survival take the forty percent and go on shed sell the car as well and her furs her standing twicemonthly appointment at sergio valente in rome was out as was her biannual jaunt to les pres et les sources in france there would be no more strolling down the montenapoliane with careless forays into valentino and armani she would make do with what she had or what she had left and find a job damn him for making her too ashamed to snatch up a quick six figures for one harmless photo shoot besides what kind of shop would it be she asked herself as her mind stubbornly circled back people didnt go into a store expecting to buy a gucci bag and a steuben bird in the same place it wouldnt be secondhand clothing or curios or leather goods it would be a hodgepodge confusing unfocused it would be unique it would be hers with her hands pressed to her mouth margo let herself imagine it busy shelves with an elegant yet friendly clutter of pretty useless things glass cabinets gleaming with jewelry tables and chairs and fussy ottomans for relaxing and all for sale a room fashioned like a huge walkin closet for clothes another little seating area where she would serve tea and flutes of champagne china and crystal also priced to sell it could work not only could it work it could be fun an adventure the hell with the details the fine print the sanity shed figure it out somehow with a reckless laugh she dashed into the bedroom and threw on some clothes josh was dreaming and dreaming well he could even smell her that straighttotheglands fragrance that always seeped through her pores she was murmuring his name almost sighing it as he stroked his hands over her god her skin was like satin smooth and white that glorious generous goddess body growing damp as she clung to him arched back trembling and ow goddamn it pinched him he opened his eyes blinked at the dark he would have sworn his shoulder ached where fingers had dug and he could swear that her scent was in the air sorry you were sleeping like the dead margo are you crazy what time is it what are you doing here jesus he continued to swear viciously as the light she turned on speared into his eyes turn that goddamn thing off or ill kill you id forgotten how surly you are when you wake up too cheerful to take offense she switched off the light then moved to the drapes opening them to the lovely muted glow of sunrise now to answer your questions i think i may be its about quarter after dawn im here to thank you she smiled at him as he stared groggily at the coffered ceiling the bed was a lake of rumpled linen sheets and the slick royal blue satin of the spread the headboard was a fantasy of cherubs and fruit all carved and gilded rather than looking ridiculous tucked in all that splendor he looked just right gosh youre cute all heavyeyed and grumpy and that sexy stubble she leaned over to give it a teasing rub then squealed when he yanked her onto the bed with him before she could gather the next breath she was pinned under a long hard male body a fully aroused male body there was no possible way to attribute that to imagination this time her hips arched in response before she could prevent it and his eyes went opaque instinctively she pried a hand free and slapped it to his chest i didnt come to wrestle then why are you here and howd you get into the suite they know me downstairs good god she was out of breath and shaky and hot i just said you were expecting me and said you might be in the shower so the front desk gave me a key his gaze lingered on her mouth made her burn ah listen i seem to have interrupted one of your prurient dreams so i can just wait in the parlor until she trailed off deciding it was best not to continue the thought when he caught her wrist and pulled her arm back over her head until whenever his mouth was close she could almost feel it on hers hard and hungry i wanted to talk to you but obviously i should have waited until youre trembling he murmured and her eyes were delicately shadowed from lack of sleep her hair those sexy miles of it spread wildly over the tumbled sheets nervous she could hear her own labored breaths knew no one could mistake the desire in the sound not exactly he lowered his head scraped his teeth lightly over her jaw when she moaned he hoped he was making her suffer for even one of the nights hed burned for her curious yes he cruised up to her ear and her eyes crossed with lust ever wonder why we havent ended up like this before she was having a hard time keeping a coherent thought in her head as he nibbled along her neck maybe once or twice he lifted his head the light from the rising sun showered over him with his hair tousled his eyes dark his face shadowed he looked rough and reckless dangerously and delectably male dont she didnt know where the denial came from when every nerve in her body was primed to beg for more dont what dont kiss me she let out a shaky breath drew in another if you do were going to have sex im just turned inside out enough to jump in without giving a damn about an hour from now you dont have to give a damn about an hour from now his mouth skimmed along her temple teased the corner of her lips this is going to take longer a lot longer please a few hours ago jesus josh you convinced me that what i do affects other people believe me he murmured im affected her heart drummed in her ears insistently i cant afford to ruin another part of my life i need a friend i need you to be my friend cursing her he rolled off no offense margo but go to hell no offense taken she didnt touch him she was certain that if she did one or both of them would go off like a rocket for a moment they lay there on the rumpled satin spread in silence not moving barely breathing im just saving us both a lot of trouble his gaze shifted pinned hers youre only postponing it well get back to this ive been choosing my own bedmates for some time he moved fast snagging her wrist and hauling her against him you want to be careful duchess about throwing your lovers in my face just now it was exactly what she needed to break the spell her chin angled dont get pushy ill let you know if and when i want to play she saw the change in his eyes and flashed her own try it just try it and ill shred the skin from your bones you arent the first man who thought he could shove me on my back and make me enjoy it he let her go because it was a wiser course than strangling her dont compare me to the wimps and washouts youve wasted your time with knowing her temper was ready to snap she got off the bed i didnt come here to tear up the sheets with you or to fight im here to discuss business next time make an appointment no longer worried about the niceties he tossed back the sheets her eyes didnt flicker as he strode naked into the adjoining bath since youre here order up some breakfast she waited until she heard the shower running before she let out a long relieved breath another minute she admitted and she might have eaten him alive with a hand pressed to her jumpy stomach she told herself they were both lucky shed forced them to avoid that mistake but as she glanced back at the bed she didnt feel lucky only deprived while josh dressed margo enjoyed the first cup of coffee and picked over the silver basket of baked goods on the linendecked table in the window nook of the dining area she relaxed with the view of the piazza the statues of gods and winged horses in white marble as did any suite in any templeton it offered a sumptuous interior as well as the view a massive oriental carpet spread over a floor of ivory tile the walls were papered with roses with golden leaves the fancy work of cornices and textured ceilings added to the opulence curvy settees rich with brocade and tasseled pillows entertainment centers discreetly concealed in intricately carved cabinets the little touches of statuary antique lamps heavy crystal ashtrays giant urns filled with flowers the full ebony bar curved in front of a glass wallall bespoke that distinct templeton flair the art nouveau style was just rich enough just decadent enough to make even the most jaded guest sigh she sighed herself but with templeton style went hand in glove with efficiency a touch of a button on the streamlined white phone in every room of the suite could summon anything from fresh towels to tickets to la scala or a bottle of perfectly chilled cristal in a silver bucket there was a basket of fruit on the pondsize coffee table the grapes plump the apples glossy behind the bar the mini fridge would be stocked with unblended scotch swiss chocolates french cheeses the flowers abundant even in the bath and dressing rooms were fresh watered and replaced daily by one of the welltrained and always amenable staff she sniffed at the pink rose on the breakfast table it was longstemmed fragrant and just opening perfect she mused just as anything with the templeton name was expected to be including she thought as josh stepped into the room the templeton heir because she was feeling just a little guilty about invading his rooms at dawn she poured him a cup from the heavy silver pot adding the generous dollop of cream she knew he preferred service at templeton milan is still the best in the city sos the coffee she passed him the cup when he joined her at the table ill be sure to pass your comments along to the managerafter i fire him for letting you in dont be cranky josh she slanted her most persuasive smile his way only slightly annoyed when she saw it didnt make a dent im sorry i woke you up i wasnt thinking about the time not thinking is one of your most highly honed skills she plucked a berry from the bowl popped it into her mouth im not going to fight with you and im not going to apologize for not sleeping with you just because your egos bruised his smile was thin and sharp as a scalpel duchess if id gotten your clothes off you not only wouldnt have to apologize youd be thanking me oh i see im mistaken your egos not bruised its just painfully swollen lets clear the air here joshua she leaned forward the confidence in her eyes sultry i like sex i think its an excellent form of entertainment but i dont have to be entertained every time someone suggests a party i select the time the place and my playmates satisfied she sat back and lazily chose a tiny cake from the basket that she was sure should settle that you might be able to get away with that she was right he thought the coffee was excellent and put him in a better mood if you hadnt been trembling and moaning under me half an hour ago i was not moaning he smiled oh yes you were yes indeed he was feeling much much better and on the verge of writhing i never writhe you will she bit neatly into the cake every boy should have his dreams now if were finished jousting over sex darling i havent even picked up my lance thats a very weak double entendre she had him there its early why dont you tell me why im having breakfast with you i was up all night the comment that occurred to him was not only weak but crude he let it pass and i couldnt sleep i was thinking about the spot im in the options youd suggested the first seems the most sensible having an agent come in and make me an offer on the furnishings my jewelry it would probably be the quickest solution and the least complicated agreed she pushed away from the table rubbing her hands together as she paced her soft suede boots were as soundless on the tile as they were on the thick carpet its probably time i learned to be sensible im twentyeight unemployed with the wolf snarling at the door i was feeling sorry for myself at first but now i realize i had an incredible run of luck i got to go places and do things be things that id always dreamed of and why she stopped in the center of the room turned a slow circle under the ornate gold and crystal chandelier in tight jodhpurstyle pants and a drapey white blouse she looked voluptuous and vibrant why because i have a face and a body that translate well through the camera thats all a good face a killer body not that i didnt have to work hard be clever and stubborn but the core of it josh is luck the luck of the draw from the gene pool now through circumstances that may or may not have been beyond my control thats done im through whining about it youve never been a whiner margo i could give lessons its time for me to grow up take responsibility be sensible talk to life insurance salesmen josh said dryly apply for a library card clip coupons she looked down her nose spoken like a man born with not only a silver spoon but the whole place setting stuck in his arrogant little mouth i happen to have several library cards he muttered somewhere do you mind sorry he waved her on but he was worried she looked eager and happy but she wasnt talking like margo not his delightfully reckless margo keep going okay i can probably weather this eventually i could wrangle some shoots get a spot on the catwalk in paris or new york it would take time but i could come around struggling to think clearly she traced a finger down a candlestick in the form of a maiden in flowing robes flanked by twin cups holding gold tapers there are other ways to make money modeling i could go back to catalogs where i started selling teddies for victorias secret she whirled fire in her eyes whats wrong with that nothing he broke open a small roll i appreciate a wellsold teddy as much as the next guy she took a slow breath he would not annoy her not now it wouldnt be easy in my current situation to get bookings but i did it before you were ten years younger he pointed out helpfully thank you so much for reminding me she said between her teeth look at cindy crawford christie brinkley lauren hutton for gods sake theyre not teenagers and as far as your brilliant solution the idea of opening a shop is ludicrous i thought of half a dozen valid reasons against it last night over and above the fact that i dont have a clue how to run a business is the larger fact that if i was crazy enough to try i could very well make my situationa very unstable situationworse its more than likely id be bankrupt within six months faced with yet another public humiliation and forced to sell myself on street corners to traveling salesmen looking for cheap thrills youre right its out of the question absolutely so when do you want to start today with a jubilant laugh she dashed to him threw her arms around his neck do you know whats better than having someone who knows you inside out what nothing she gave him a noisy kiss on the cheek if youre going to go down go down swinging he caught her hair in his hand and pulled her laughing mouth to his it wasnt a laughing matter she discovered that very quickly his lips were hot and clever and had hers parting in sighing response the lazy sweep of his tongue sent shock waves of need vibrating out to her fingertips it should have been familiar shed kissed him before tasted him before but those casual brotherly embraces hadnt prepared her for the instant undeniable jolt of pure animal lust part of her mind tried to draw back to remember that this was josh josh who had scorned her prized collection of dolls when she was six who had dared her to scramble with him on the cliffs when she was eight then had carried her back to the house when she gashed her leg on a rock josh who had smirked at her adolescent crushes on his friends who had patiently taught her to handle a fivespeed josh who had always been somewhere right around the corner wherever she had gone in her life but this was like kissing someone new someone dangerously exciting painfully tempting hed been expecting it hadnt he dreamed hundreds of times of tasting her like this of having her go taut in his arms her mouth answering his with a kind of banked fury hed been willing to wait just as hed been willing to dream because he knew she would be his he knew she needed to be but he wasnt going to make it easy he drew back pleased that when her lashes slowly lifted her eyes were dark and clouded he hoped to god the same jittery desire that was churning in his gut was churning in hers youre awfully good at that she managed id heard rumors she realized she was in his lap but wasnt sure if hed pulled her there or if shed simply crawled onto him i believe they might have been understated actually i did sneak outside one night and watch you put the moves on babs carstairs out by the pool i was impressed nothing she could have said could have been more perfectly designed to make desire wilt you spied on me and babs just once or twice hell josh i was thirteen curious jesus he remembered exactly how far things had gone with babs out by the pool on one pretty summer night did you seeno i dont want to know laura and kate and i all agreed she was overmammaried over before he could laugh at the term he winced you and laura and kate why didnt you just sell tickets i believe its perfectly natural for a younger sister to spy on her older brother his eyes glinted im not your brother from where im sitting id say that fact saves our immortal souls the glint turned into a grin you may be right i want you margo there are all manner of incredible nasty unspeakable things i want to do to you well she let out a breath she hadnt realized shed been holding so much for our immortal souls listen i have to say this change is a little abrupt for me you havent been paying attention obviously not she couldnt take her eyes off his it would be wiser to she knew she had survived all the games men and women play by always without exception staying in control those eyes gray and cool and confident warned her that that wouldnt be an option with him not for long im paying attention now but im not ready for the starting gun it went off years ago his hands skimmed up her sides brushed her breasts im way ahead of you i have to decide if i want to catch up she laughed and scrambled off his lap its just too weird the whole concept of you and me and sex then she rubbed a hand over her heart because it was plunging like a mare in heat and its surprisingly tempting there was a time not that long ago id have said what the hell itll be fun and raced you to the bed when he rose she laughed again and put the table between them im not being coy i dont believe in it what are you being cautious for once in my life suddenly her eyes were sober her mouth soft instead of teasing you matter too much and ive just figured out that i matter too not just out here she said gesturing toward her face inside ive got to straighten out my life ive got to do something with it i can be proud of i have all these new plans all these new dreams i want to make them work no she closed her eyes a moment i have to make them work to do that i need to take time and effort sex is distracting if you do it right she smiled again we would he tucked his thumbs in his pockets what are you going to do take a vow of celibacy her smile spread slowly thats an excellent idea i can always count on you for a viable solution his jaw dropped youre kidding im perfectly serious delighted with both of them she walked over and patted his cheek okay im celibate until my life is in order and my business is up and running thanks for thinking of it he circled her throat with his hand but was more inclined to throttle himself i could seduce you in thirty seconds flat now he was getting cocky if i let you she said silkily but its not going to happen until im ready and im supposed to enter a monastery until youre ready your lifes your own you can have anyone you want she turned to wander back toward the cakes looked over her shoulder except me but the idea didnt sit very well nibbling on the cake she contemplated unless of course youd like to make it a kind of bet she was licking those crumbs off her bottom lip on purpose he thought he knew when a woman was trying to drive him crazy what kind of bet that i can abstain longer than you that i can make an adult commitment to control my hormones and seriously pursue a career his face bland he added hot coffee to his cup then hers inside he was snickering she hadnt a clue how long it would take to open the doors to this shop she was planning it could be months she would never last that long he mused as he lifted his cup watched her over the rim hed see to it how much your new car he choked on coffee my car my jag thats right i have to sell my car and i dont know when ill be able to replace it you succumb first i get the jag clear title you ship it to italy and if you succumb first when she gestured dismissing the possibility he grinned i get your art my street scenes her heart actually fluttered at the thought all of them every last one unless youre afraid to risk it she lifted her chin held out a hand done he closed his hand over hers then brought it up brushed his lips over her wrist nibbled lightly to her palm nice try she murmured and shook free now ive got business to tend to im going to go sell my car youre not going to take it to a dealer he objected as she grabbed her bag and jacket theyll scalp you oh no she paused at the door her smile sly and irresistible no they wont chapter eight it amazed margo how quickly she got into the spirit shed never realized how much fun how simply exhilarating wheeling and dealing could be the car started it all it hadnt shamed her a bit to use every ounce of charm all of her sex appeal and generous dollops of femininity not merely as bargaining chips but as weapons godgiven and well honed she was at war after choosing the car dealer she had ambushed her quarry with flattery and smiles fencing expertly with claims of her inexperience in business dealings her trust in his judgment she batted her eyes looked helpless and slowly sweetly annihilated him and had squeezed lire out of him until he was gasping for breath the jeweler being a woman had been more of a challenge margo had selected two of her best and most expensive pieces and after sizing up her opponent as a clever hardheaded unsentimental businesswoman she had adopted the same pose it had been she thought mano a mano female style theyd negotiated argued scorned each others offers insulted one another then come to terms each of them could live with now adding the take from her furs she had enough ready cash to hold her more impatient creditors off for a few weeks with the breathing room she buckled down and completed a tentative cataloging of her possessions and began to pack them up knowing the sooner she thought of them as inventory the easier it would be no longer were they her personal possessions now they were business assets each morning she studied the paper for available space to rent the prices made her wince and worry and eventually concede that she wouldnt be able to afford a prime location nor would she be able to advertise by conventional means if she wanted her money to last which left her a secondrate location that she would have to make work and unconventional means comfortable in leggings and a tshirt she stretched out in a chair and surveyed her living space tables had been ruthlessly cleared off a good many of them were stacked alongside packing boxes and crates her paintings remained on the walls a symbol she thought of what she was risking in so many areas of her life just now shed gone to work elsewhere in the flat as well her wardrobe had been cut down to a quarter of its original size the other seventyfive percent was carefully packed away shed been merciless in her selections with an eye to her new lifestyle rather than sentiment not that she intended to dress down as a merchant she would dress as she would run her business with flair and style and bold pride with luck one of the three locations she had arranged to view that afternoon would be just the one she was looking for she was anxious to begin before the press got a firm hold on her situation there were already dribbles in the papers about la margo selling her jewelry to pay her mounting debts shed taken to sneaking out of the service entrance to avoid the reporters and paparazzi who so often ambushed her outside the building shed begun to wonder if she should just give up the flat after all kate had been righttrying to keep it was whittling her already meager resources to nothing if she found a good location for the shop she could simply move in there temporarily at least she thought with a laugh that way she would have her things around her she wished she had josh to play the idea off of but he was in paris no she remembered by now it was berlin and after that stockholm there was no telling when she would hear from him again much less see him the few days theyd spent together in milan that jarring and exciting morning in his suite were more like a dream now than a memory she might have wondered if shed actually ached when hed kissed her but whenever she thought of it she ached again he was probably nibbling some frauleins ear right now margo thought and kicked at the corner of the sofa as she rose hed never be able to keep those clever hands of his off a willing female the jerk at least she was going to get a car out of the whole mess if nothing else josh templeton was a man of his word she didnt have time to think about himswilling beer and tickling some statuesque german goddess she had to change for her appointments adopt the appropriate image as she dressed she practiced the technique she would employ with the realtor picky she mused braiding her hair no enthusiasm questa camera a dismissive look a gesture of the hand piccola or it would be too large to suit her needs she would make unhappy noises as she wandered around and let the realtor try to convince her of course she would remain unconvinced she would say the rent was absurd she would ask to see something else say she had another appointment in an hour she stepped back studied herself yes the black suit was businesslike but had the flair the italian eye recognized and appreciated the smooth french braid was feminine flattering but not fussy and the oversized bandalino bag was tailored like a briefcase odds were her opponentand she thought of everyone on the other side of her business deals as opponents nowwould have recognized her name he would certainly recognize her face so much the better in all likelihood hed assume he was meeting a flighty emptyheaded bimbo and that would give her not only the advantage but the sizzling satisfaction of proving him wrong drawing a long breath she stared at herself margo sullivan was not a bimbo she insisted to the reflection margo sullivan was a businesswoman with brains ambition plans goals and determination margo sullivan was not a loser she was a survivor she closed her eyes for a moment struggling to absorb the selfadministered pep talk needing to believe it doesnt matter she thought with an inner quaver as long as i can make everyone else believe it damned if she wouldnt the phone was ringing as she shouldered her bag and headed out just leave your name and a brief message she told the insistent twotoned bell and i wont get back to you it was kates impatient voice that stopped her damn it all to hell and back margo are you ever going to answer this thing i know youre there i know youre standing right there sneering at the phone pick it up will you its important its always important margo muttered and kept right on sneering goddamn it margo its about laura margo pounced on the phone jerking the receiver to her ear is she hurt whats wrong was there an accident no shes not hurt take off your earring its clinking on the phone disgusted margo worked it off if youre yanking my chain just to get me to talk to you like ive got nothing better to do at five am on april fifteenth than make crank phone calls listen pal i havent slept in twentysix hours and ive burned off most of my stomach lining with caffeine dont start with me you called me remember im on my way out the door and lauras on her way to see a lawyer a lawyer at five am you said there wasnt an accident shes not literally on her way she has an appointment at ten i wouldnt have even known about it but her lawyers a client of the firm and he thought i knew he said he was sorry she was upset and just nail it down kate sorry im strung out shes divorcing peter divorcing since the chair that had been by the phone was now in the inventory section she sat down abruptly on the floor oh christ kate its not because they fought over me the world doesnt revolve around you margo hell sorry its not your fault she said more gently i didnt get much out of her when i went over but the deciding factor seemed to be that she walked in on him and his secretary and he wasnt dictating a letter youre kidding thats so ordinary kate suggested dryly trite disgusting yes well that sums it up if its happened before shes not saying but i can tell you shes not giving him another turn at bat shes dead serious is she all right she seems very calm very civilized im so bogged down here margo i cant work on her you know how she is when shes really upset sucks it all in margo murmured jiggling the earring impatiently in her hand the kids i just dont know if i could get out of here i would but ive got another nineteen hours before flash point ill corner her then ill be there inside of ten thats what i was hoping youd say ill see you at home i dont know why im surprised youd fly six thousand miles for something like this margo laura competently sewed stars onto alis tutu for her daughters ballet recital its just like you i want to know how you are laura i want to know whats going on margo stopped pacing the sitting room and slapped her hands on her hips she was past exhaustion and into the floaty stage of endless travel ten hours had been typically optimistic it had taken her closer to fifteen to manage all the connections and layovers now she was crosseyed with fatigue and laura just sat there calmly plying needle and thread would you put that silly thing down for a minute and talk to me ali would be crushed if she heard you call her fairy tutu silly but her daughter was in bed laura thought safe and innocent for the moment sit down margo before you collapse i dont want to sit if she did she was certain she would simply fade away i didnt expect you to be so upset you were hardly fond of peter im fond of you and i know you laura youre not chucking a tenyear marriage without hurting im not hurting im numb im going to stay numb as long as i possibly can gently she smoothed a hand over the net of the ballet skirt there are two little girls down the hall who need someone in their life to be strong and stable margo she looked up then with baffled eyes i dont think he loves them i dont think he cares at all i could handle him not loving me but theyre his children she stroked the tulle again as if it were her daughters cheek he wanted sons ridgeways boys to become men and carry on the family name wellshe set the skirt asidehe got daughters margo lighted a cigarette with a quick jerk made herself sit tell me what happened he stopped loving me im not sure he ever did really he wanted an important wife she moved her shoulders he thought he got one in the past couple of years we began to disagree over quite a lot of things or i began to disagree with him out loud he didnt care for that oh its no use going over all the details she waved her hands with selfdirected impatience basically we grew apart he began to spend more time away from home i thought he was having an affair but he was so uncharacteristically furious when i accused him i believed i was wrong but you werent im not sure about then it doesnt matter laura jerked a shoulder picked up the tulle again to give herself something to do with her hands he hasnt touched me in more than a year a year it was perhaps foolish to be shocked at the idea of marriage without intimacy but margo was shocked nonetheless at first i wanted us to go to a counselor but he was appalled by the idea then i thought i should try some therapy and he was beyond appalled laura managed a quick thin smile it would get out and then what would people think what would they say no sex none for a year margo fought her way past the block and concentrated thats just ridiculous maybe but i stopped caring it was easier to stop caring and concentrate on my children the house my life what life margo wanted to ask but held her tongue but i could see in the last few weeks that it was affecting the children ali in particular gently she replaced the tutu folded her hands in her lap to keep them still after you left i decided we had to straighten things out we had to fix what was wrong i went to the penthouse i thought it would be best if we talked there away from the children i was willing to do whatever had to be done to put things back together you were willing margo interrupted leaping up and puffing out an angry stream of smoke it sounds to me like it doesnt matter what it sounds like laura said quietly its what is anyway it was late id put the girls to bed first all the way over i practiced this little speech about how wed had a decade together a family a history it made her laugh to think of it now she rose deciding she could indulge in a short brandy as she poured two snifters she related the rest the penthouse was locked but i have a key he wasnt in the office calmly she handed margo a glass sat down again with her own i was annoyed at first thinking hed gone out for a late dinner meeting or some such thing and id geared myself up for nothing then i noticed the light under the bedroom door i nearly knocked can you imagine how pathetic the situation was margo that i nearly knocked instead i just opened the door she took a sip of brandy he was having a dinner meeting all right his secretary laura gave a snorting laugh like a bad french farce we have the philandering husband sprawled over the bed with his jazzy redheaded secretary and a bowl of chilled shrimp barely margo managed to strangle a giggle shrimp and what appeared to be a spicedhoney sauce with a bottle of dom to wash it down enter the unsuspecting neglected society wife the tableau freezes no one speaks only the strains of bolero can be heard bolero oh jesus her breath hitching margo dropped into a chair im sorry im sorry i cant help it im too tired to fight back go ahead and laugh laura felt a smile breaking through herself it is laughable pitifully the wife says with incredible and foolish dignity im terribly sorry to interrupt your dinner meeting it was an effort but margo managed to wheeze in a breath you did not i did they just goggled at me ive never seen peter goggle before it was almost worth it the fresh young secretary began to squeak and try to cover herself and in her rush for modesty upended the shrimp sauce on peters crotch oh oh god it was a moment laura heaved a sigh wondering which of the three of them had felt more ridiculous i told them not to get up i would see myself out and i left just like that just like that but what does he say how is he handling it i have no idea those soft gray eyes hardened into a look that was pure templetontough hot and stubborn im not taking his calls that stupid electric gate of his has finally paid off as her gentle mouth hardened as well margo thought it was like watching silk turn to steel he cant get in because ive instructed the staff not to admit him in any case hes only tried once youre not going to even talk to him theres nothing to talk about i could and did tolerate indifference i could and did tolerate his utter lack of affection and respect for me and my feelings but i wont tolerate not for an instant his lying and his lack of fidelity he might think that boinking his secretary is simply his droit de signor hes going to find out different are you sure its what you want its the way its going to be my marriage is over she looked down into her brandy saw nothing and thats that the stubborn streak was classic templeton margo thought carefully she tapped out her cigarette touched a hand to lauras rigid one honey you know it wont be that easylegally or emotionally ill do whatever i have to do but i wont play the easily deceived society wife any longer and the girls ill make it up to them somehow some way ill make it right for them little tongues of fear licked at her and she ignored them i cant do anything else all right im behind you all the way look im going to go down and scare up some food kates going to be starving when she gets here kates not coming here tonight she always falls into bed for twentyfour hours after the tax deadline shell be here margo promised youd think i was on my deathbed laura muttered all right ill make sure her rooms ready and yours well put some sandwiches together ill put some sandwiches together you worry about the rooms which would margo thought as she hurried out give her enough time to pump her mother for information she found ann exactly where shed expected to in the kitchen already arranging cold cuts and raw vegetables i dont have much time margo began and headed directly for the coffeepot shell be down in a minute shes not really all right is she shes coping she wont talk about it hasnt yet contacted her parents the scum the slime her legs wobbled with fatigue and made it hard to storm around the kitchen but margo gave it her best shot and that little slut of a secretary putting in overtime she broke off when she caught her mothers eye all right i wasnt much better when it came to alain and maybe believing he was working out a divorce isnt any excuse but at least his wifes family wasnt cutting my paychecks she drank the coffee black to fuel her system you can lecture me on my sins later right now im concerned about laura a mothers sharp eye noted the signs of exhaustion and worry im not going to lecture you it never did any good when you were a child and it would hardly do any good now you go your own way margo you always did but your way has brought you here when a friend needs you does she she was always the strong one the good one she added with a wry smile the kind one do you think youre the only one who feels despair when the world falls apart around you who wants to pull the covers over her head instead of facing tomorrow a quick flare of temper made ann slam down the loaf of bread oh she was tired and heartsick and her emotions were bouncing like a rubber ball from joy that her daughter was home misery for laura and frustration at not knowing what to do for either of them shes afraid and full of guilt and worry its only going to get worse for her she pressed her lips together but couldnt settle herself her home is broken and whether you can see it or not so is her heart its time you paid back some of what shes always given to you and help her mend it why do you think im here margo tossed back i dropped everything i was doing and flew six thousand miles to help her a noble gesture anns sharp accusing eyes pinned her daughter youve always had a knack for the grand gesture margo but holding fast takes something more how long will you stay this time a day a week how long before youre too restless to stick it out before the effort of caring for someone else becomes an inconvenience before you rush back to your glamorous life where you dont have to think about anyone but yourself well because her hand was unsteady margo set the cup down why dont you get the rest of it out mum sounds like youve stored plenty oh its easy for you isnt it to come and go on a whim sending postcards and presents as if that made up for your turning your back on everything real youve been given anns own worries acted as an impetus for resentments harbored for years they spewed out before she could stop them splattering them both with bitterness you grew up in this house pretending you werent the daughter of a servant and miss laura treated you always as a sister who sent you money after youd run off who used her influence to get you your first photo shoot who was there for you always she demanded stacking slices of bread like a irate cardsharp but have you been there for her these past few years when shes been struggling to hold her family together when shes been lonely and sad were you there for her how could i have known because miss kate would have told you and if you hadnt been so wrapped up in margo sullivan youd have listened ive never been what you wanted margo said wearily ive never been laura and i cant be now guilt layered onto weariness and worry no ones asked you to be someone youre not havent you mum if i could have been kinder more generous like laura more sensible more practical like kate do you think i didnt know that didnt feel that from you every day of my life shocked and baffled ann shook her head maybe if youd been more satisfied with what you had and what you were instead of running away from it youd have been happier maybe if youd ever looked at me and been satisfied with what i was i wouldnt have run so far and so fast i wont take the blame for how youve lived your life margo no ill take it why not she thought there was so much on her debit side already a little more would hardly matter ill take the blame and the glory that way i dont need your approval ive never known you to ask for it ann strode out of the room and left margo to stew she gave it three days it was odd they had never actually lived together in the house as adults at eighteen laura had gotten married margo had run to hollywood and kate always struggling to leap over that single years age difference had graduated early and bolted to harvard now they settled in kate used the excuse that she didnt have the energy to drive back to her apartment in monterey and margo claimed to be marking time she decided her mother had been right about some things laura was coping but the difficult situation was only going to get worse already visitors were dropping by mostly the country club set margo noted sniffing for gossip on the breakup of the templetonridgeway merger one night margo found kayla camped outside lauras bedroom door because she was afraid her mama might go away too that was when she stopped believing it would settle down and she would go back to milan her mother was right about something more shed decided it was time for margo sullivan to hold fast and to pay back what had been given to her she called josh its six oclock in the morning he complained when she tracked him down at templeton stockholm dont tell me youve become that monster of civilized society margothe morning person listen up im at templeton house thats all right then its the shank of the evening there what do you mean youre at templeton house he demanded when his brain cleared what the hell are you doing in california youre supposed to be putting a business together in milan she took a moment it would be she realized the first time shed said it aloud the first time she would acknowledge the loss of one part of her life im not going back to milan at least not anytime soon as his voice exploded in her ear with questions accusations she watched one dream fade away she hoped she could replace it with another just be quiet a minute would you she ordered with a snap i need you to do something whatever it is that needs to be done to have my things shipped here your things most of its boxed up anyway but the rest will have to be packed templeton must have a service for that kind of thing sure but ill pay you back josh but i dont know who to call and i just cant handle the extra expense just now the plane fare cut into my resources typical josh thought and jammed a pillow behind his back just typical then why the hell did you buy a plane ticket to california because peter was diddling his secretary and lauras divorcing him you cant just go flying off wheneverwhat the hell did you say you heard me shes filed for divorce i dont think hes going to fight it but i cant imagine the whole thing is going to be friendly either shes trying to handle too much of it on her own and ive decided im not going to let her let me talk to her put her on shes asleep if laura had been wide awake and standing by her side she wouldnt have handed the phone over the icy violence in joshs voice stabbed over the line she had another session with the lawyer today and it upset her the best solution all around is for me to stay here im going to ask her to help me find the right location for the shop itll take some of this off her mind lauras always better at worrying about someone else than she is at worrying about herself youre going to stay in california i wont have to worry about the vat tax or italian law will i she felt hateful tears of selfpity sting her eyes and ruthlessly blinked them back to ensure that her voice remained brisk and steady she set her teeth speaking of law can i give you power of attorney or whatever its called i need you to sell my flat transfer funds all those little legal details details of what she was planning ran through and boggled his mind had he thought typical he mused nothing about margo was ever typical ill draft one up and fax it there you can sign it fax it back to me at templeton milan where the hell is ridgeway rumor is hes still at the penthouse well soon fix that personally she appreciated the cold viciousness in his voice but josh im not sure laura would want you rousting him out at this point i outrank laura in the templeton feeding chain ill take care of the shipment as soon as i can are there any surprises i should be prepared for her american express bill had arrived just before shed left she decided he didnt need another shock just then no nothing worth mentioning im sorry to dump this on you josh i mean that but i dont know how else to stay here with laura and get this shop up and running before im shipped off to debtors prison dont worry about it chaos is my business he imagined her leaving everything in that chaos to rush off to support a friend loyalty he thought was and always had been her most admirable quality how are you holding up im good and still untouched she added are you alone in that bed except for the six members of the allgirl swedish volleyball team helgas got a hell of a spike arent you going to ask what im wearing black speedos sweat and a big smile howd you guess so what are you wearing slowly she ran her tongue around her teeth oh just this little very little white lace teddy and stiletto heels naturally with a pair of sheer hose they have little pink roses around the tops it matches the one im tucking between my breasts right now i should add ive just gotten out of the tub im still a little wet jesus youre too good at this im hanging up her response was a long throaty laugh im going to love driving that jag let me know when to expect the shipment when the phone clicked in her ear she laughed again turned and found herself nearly face to face with kate how long have you been standing there long enough to be confused were you just having phone sex with josh our josh carelessly margo brushed her hair behind her ear it was more foreplay really why okay shed have to give that one some thought now what is this about getting a shop up and running my my you do have big ears dont you margo tugged on them hard enough to make kate yelp well sit down i might as well tell you the master plan kate listened her only comments the occasional grunt snort or mutter i suppose youve calculated startup costs ah right and youve looked into licenses fees applied for a tax number i have a few details to iron out margo muttered and its just like you to toss cold water in my face gee and here i thought it was cool common sense why shouldnt i make a business out of selling my things margo demanded whats wrong with turning humiliation into an adventure just because i hadnt thought about applying for some stupid tax number doesnt mean i cant pull this off sitting back kate tapped her fingertips together it wasnt an entirely insane idea she mused in fact it had some solid financial merit liquidation of assets tied to oldfashioned free enterprise kate decided she could help iron out some of the details if margo was truly set on giving capitalism a try it would be risky certainly but then margo had always been one for taking risks youre going to be a shopkeeper eyes bland margo studied her manicure im thinking of it more as a consultant position margo sullivan kate marveled selling used clothes and knickknacks objets dart whatever amused kate stretched out her legs crossed them at the ankles it looks like hell has finally frozen over chapter nine margo stood in front of the storefront on busy cannery row and knew this one was it the wide display window glinted in the sun and was protected from the elements by a charming little covered veranda its door was beveled glass decorated with an etched bouquet of lilies oldfashioned brass fittings gleamed the peaked roof was topped by rows of spanish tile softened to pink by time and weather she could hear the tinny tune from a carousel the harsh cry of gulls and the busy chatter of tourists scents of cooking from the stands and openair restaurants of fishermans wharf carried on the strong breeze flying off the water bicycles built for two clattered by street traffic was a constant snarl cars desperately seeking a parking spot they were unlikely to find in this busy tourist haven pedestrians strolled along the sidewalks many with children who were either all eyes and grins or whining crankily there was movement everywhere people and noise and action the little shops lining the street the restaurants and attractions drew them day after day month after month all the other buildings the narrow storefronts the empty storage rooms shed viewed had just been steps she thought leading to this its perfect she murmured you havent even been inside kate pointed out i know its perfect its mine kate exchanged a look with laura she had a pretty good idea what property rented for in this location if youre going to dream she thought dream big but then margo always had the realtors probably inside by now arriving late was part of margos strategy she didnt want to appear too eager just let me do the talking let her do the talking kate muttered and rolled her eyes at laura were going to have lunch after this one right she could smell the frying fish and spicy sauces aromas wafting down from fishermans wharf dull nagging hunger pangs attacked her stomach this is the last one before lunch this is the only one shoulders squared for battle margo stepped up to the door she had to force herself not to snatch the for rent sign away little frissons of possession were already sprinting along her spine she didnt question them or the fact that she had certainly walked past this building countless times before and felt nothing she felt it now and that was enough the main room was wide and empty scars were dug into the hardwood floor where counters and display cases had been ripped out the paint had faded from white to something re sembling old paste and was pocked with small holes where the previous tenant had hung wares but she saw only a lovely archway leading into an adjoining space the charm of a set of iron tightwinder stairs spiraling toward the second level the airy circling balcony she recognized the signs in herself the quickening of her pulse the sharpening of vision she often felt the same when she walked into carder and saw something that seemed to be waiting just for her sensing trouble laura put a hand on her arm margo cant you see it cant you just see it i see it needs a ton of manual labor kate wrinkled her nose the air smelled of incense pot old candles and fumigating ignoring her margo walked over to a peeling door and opened it inside was a tiny bathroom with an aging pedestal sink and chipped tile it thrilled her hello the voice echoed down from the second floor following by the quick tap of high heels on wood laura winced oh god not louisa margo you said your appointment was with a mr newman well it was the voice called out again and if there had been anywhere to dive for cover laura would have used it ms sullivan is that you the woman appeared at the top of the stairs she was all in pink from her flowing swing jacket to her clicking heels her hair was the careful ash blond that hairdressers often chose to hold off gray and it was styled ruthlessly into a helmet that curved around pink cheeks gold rattled on her wrists and an enormous sunburst pin exploded over her left breast midfifties margo estimated with an experienced eye and holding desperately on to forty very decent facelift she mused smiling politely as the woman picked her way down the circling stairs chattering all the way regular aerobic classes to keep her in shape possibly aided by a tummy tuck and lipo just refreshing my memory louisa continued bubbling like a brook i havent been in here for several weeks dear johnny was supposed to show you through but he had a teeny little accident with his car this morning when she reached the bottom slightly out of breath she offered a hand so delighted to meet you im louisa metcalf margo sullivan yes of course you are her raisincolored eyes glinted with interest and carefully applied bronze shadow i recognized you right away i had no idea my one oclock was the margo sullivan and youre just as lovely as all your photographs theyre so often touched up arent they then you meet someone whose face youve seen just hundreds of times and its such a disappointment youve led such an interesting life havent you and its not over yet margo said and had louisa tittering with laughter oh no indeed how fortunate to be so young and lovely im sure you can overcome any little setback youve been in greece havent you hello louisa she turned laying a hand over her heart why laura dear i didnt see you there what a delightful surprise knowing the routine laura met her halfway and the women exchanged quick air kisses you look wonderful oh my professional mode louisa smoothed her jacket under which her bosom was heaving happily in anticipation of gossip i so enjoy dabbling a few days a week in my little hobby real estate takes you into such interesting places and you meet so many people with benedict so busy with his practice and the children grown i have to have something to do with my time those glinting eyes sharpened i dont know how you manage dear with those two lovely children all your charity work the social whirl i was just telling barbarayou remember my daughter barbarahow amazing i thought you were managing all those committees and functions raising two children especially now that youre going through such a trial divorce she whispered it as though it were a dirty word such a heartbreak for everyone involved isnt it how are you bearing up dear im fine more out of desperation than manners laura tugged kate forward this is kate powell nice to meet you kate didnt bother to tell her that theyd met at least half a dozen times before women like louisa metcalf never remembered her are you interested in the building laura she continued i understood that the caller was looking to rent but if youre wanting an investment now that youre on your own so to speak this would be perfect for you a woman alone needs to think about her future dont you agree the owner is willing to sell actually its margo who oh of course i do beg your pardon she pivoted toward margo like a cannon bearing to aim from the top of a tank seeing an old friend again you understand and the two of you have been friends for years havent you so nice you can be close by during our lauras time of trouble its a wonderful building isnt it a clever location you wouldnt have the least trouble finding a suitable tenant and i can recommend a very reliable management company buy it to own it margo had to swallow the saliva that pooled in her mouth afraid that louisa might see the territorial light in her eyes she turned away and wandered i havent actually decided whether to rent or buy she rolled her eyes gleefully at kate and laura who were the last tenants oh well that was a bit unfortunate which is why the owner is considering selling out it was a new age shop i dont understand that business myself do you crystals and odd music and gongs it came out that they were also selling drugs she whispered the last word as if saying it might addict her marijuana oh my dear i hope that doesnt upset you with your recent troubles margo sent her an arch look not at all perhaps i could see upstairs certainly its quite roomy its been used as a little apartment and has the most adorable dolls house of a kitchen and of course the view she picked her way back up chattering about the delights of the building while the others trailed after her you cant be serious kate hissed grabbing margos arm you couldnt afford the rent in this location much less the purchase price just shut up im thinking it was hard to think with louisas incessant chirping so margo shut it out shut out everything but sheer delight it was roomy surprisingly so and if the banister circling the second level was shaky so what and the pentagram painted on the floor could be removed maybe it was hot as a furnace and the kitchen alcove was only big enough for one of the seven dwarfs but there were quaint eyebrow windows peeking out offering teasing glimpses of the sea it has wonderful potential louisa went on a bit of cosmetic work some pretty paper or paint of course you know that property in this area rents by the square foot she opened the briefcase shed left on the narrow kitchen counter took out a file this building has six hundred and twentyeight she offered papers to margo the owner has kept the rent very reasonable considering of course the utility fees are the responsibility of the tenant kate turned on the tap watched gray water sputter out and the repairs oh im sure something can be worked out there louisa dismissed kate with a wave of her hand and a jangle of bracelets youll want to look over the lease of course i dont want to pressure you but i feel obliged to let you know we have another interested party coming through tomorrow and once its officially known that the buildings for sale well she let that lay smiling i believe the asking price is only two hundred seventyfive thousand margo felt her dream popan overinflated red balloon thats good to know she managed a shrug though her shoulders felt weighted as i said im not sure if its just what im looking for i have several properties im considering scanning the lease she saw that katedamn herhad been right even the rent was well out of her reach there had to be a way she thought ill be in touch within a day or two she smiled again politely and dismissively thank you so much mrs metcalf for your time oh no trouble at all i so enjoy showing off places homes are more fun of course youve been living in europe havent you terribly exciting for you if youre thinking of buying a second home here in the area i have the most fabulous tenbedroom on seventeen mile an absolute steal the owners are in the middle of a vicious divorce and oh she looked around to make a tittering apology to laura but her eyes continued to gleam she must have gone back downstairs i wouldnt want to upset her by talking about divorce such a shame about her and peter isnt it not really margo said dryly i think hes scum oh her color fluctuated youre just being loyal to your old friend arent you actually no one could have been more surprised than i was when i heard they had separated just the most charming couple hes so well mannered so attractive and gentlemanly well you know what they say about appearances they lie i think ill just poke around for a bit longer if you dont mind mrs metcalf firmly margo took her arm to lead her back to the stairs it might help me make up my mind if i spend a little time alone of course take all the time you like just lock the door behind you i have the key oh and let me give you my card you be sure to call if you want to breeze through again or if youd like to see that wonderful house on seventeen mile i certainly will margo didnt see either kate or laura on the first floor and kept marching louisa toward the door oh do tell laura goodbye for me wont you and her young friend im sure ill see you and laura at the club soon absolutely bye now thank you so much margo closed the door with a quick rattle and do be a stranger she muttered okay where are you two hiding were up here kate called out in the bathroom jesus its really tacky for two grown women to hide in a bathroom once shed climbed the steps again she found them laura sat on the edge of the old clawfoot tub with kate facing her from her perch on the john in any other setting margo would have said they were deep in some intense and serious discussion i really appreciate you leaving me alone with that nosy magpie you wanted to do the talking kate reminded her nothing really to talk about discouraged margo joined laura on the edge of the tub i could probably squeeze out the rent if i didnt eat for the next six months which isnt that much of a problem but i wouldnt have enough left over to handle the startup costs i want to buy it she said with a sigh its exactly what im looking for theres just something about it that tells me i could be happy here maybe its the leftover aroma of stale pot margo sent kate a withering look i only smoked it once when i was sixteen and you had several hits yourself on that memorable evening i didnt inhale she said with a grin thats my story and im sticking to it then explain why you claimed you were doing a pas de deux with baryshnikov i have no recollection of that eventand he told me to call him misha its a damn good thing i only wheedled two joints out of biff margo blew out a breath well this unfortunately is reality i cant afford this place i can laura said what do you mean you can i mean i can buy it and i can rent it to you and well be in business margo nearly threw her arms around laura before sanity and pride prevailed oh no im not starting off this next section of my life that way she dug in her bag for a cigarette lighted it with a violent flick youre not bailing me out no ones bailing me out not this time tell her what you told me kate when i suggested it okay first i asked her if she was out of her mind not that i dont think you couldnt pull off this plan of yours margo but i dont think you can pull it off eyes narrowed margo huffed out smoke thanks so much its an admirable idea kate soothed but starting a new business is a risky venture at any time with anyone the vast majority go tits up in the first year basic economics even if the people have some training and education in retail not to mention that monterey and carmel are already lousy with gift shops and boutiques but kate continued holding up a hand before margo could snarl at her some succeed even thrive now putting your part of it aside for the moment we look at lauras current situation having been married at the ridiculous age of eighteen shes never invested on her own there is the templeton organization of course in which she shares but she has no personal individual stocks bonds or property beyond her interest in templeton as shes just filed for divorce and is solvent financially it makes good economic sense for her to seek investments ive never bought anything on my own laura interrupted never owned anything that wasnt through the family or with peter and when i was looking around this place i thought why not why shouldnt i buy it why shouldnt i take a gamble on myself on us because if i screw it up you wont youve got something to prove here dont you margo all right yes but it doesnt include taking you down with me listen to me eyes serious and soft laura laid a hand on margos knee all my life ive done what i was told taken the quiet welltended path now im going to do something just for the hell of it she felt a giddy little thrill at the thought im buying this building margo whether you want a piece of it or not margo took a deep gulp discovered it wasnt pride she was swallowing it was excitement so how much are you going to gouge out of me for rent the first shock came at the bank a cashiers check for ten percent of the asking price was kates advice not only to nail down a contract but to help negotiate that price down by twentyfive thousand the money wasnt there there must be some mistake i should have at least twice this amount liquid just a moment please mrs ridgeway the teller hurried off while laura tapped her fingers as a sick feeling began to stir in her gut margo laid a hand on her shoulder laura this is a joint account with peter sure we use it primarily as a checking account to run the household im taking out less than half so there shouldnt be a problem were a community property state my lawyer explained all of that the vice president of the bank came out into the lobby shook her hand laura would you come back to my office for a moment frank im in kind of a hurry i just need a cashiers check just for a moment he slipped an arm around her shoulders margo gritted her teeth as laura was guided away you know what that bastard did yeah yeah i do furious kate pressed her fingers to her eyes i should have thought of it christ i should have known its all happened so fast theyd have money scattered around wouldnt they in another bank stocks bonds a portfolio through a broker theyd have to laura might have let peter take over the finances but neither of them is foolish enough to put all their eggs in one basket and theres the insurance limit on funds in a bank this is a drop in the bucket but she had a sick feeling shit he never let me near their books here she comes kate muttered goddamn it its all over her face peter cleaned out the account face pale eyes dazed laura headed for the doors the morning after i found him in bed with his secretary he came in here and took out all but a couple of thousand she had to stop press a hand to her stomach we had started little savings accounts for the girls so they could put money in themselves he took that too he took their money lets find a place to sit down margo murmured no no i have to make calls i have to contact the broker i dont even know his name she covered her face with her hands and tried to breathe so stupid so stupid youre not stupid kate said furiously were going home well find the numbers and well call well arrange to have the rest of your assets frozen there wasnt much to freeze fifty thousand kate sat back slipped off her reading glasses and rubbed her eyes well it was damn generous of him to leave you that much from what i can figure thats about five percent of your joint holdings thoughtfully she unrolled her package of tums the good news is he wasnt able to touch your stock in templeton and he doesnt have any claim on the house their college funds laura said weakly he closed alis and kaylas college funds how could money have meant so much to him moneys probably only part of it hes teaching you a lesson margo poured another glass of wine it might help them all to be a little drunk and he got away with it because youd never have thought of doing the same thing i would have but i wasnt thinking at all maybe your lawyer can get some of it back odds are its all tucked away in the caymans by now kate shook her head in disgust the way it looks hes been busily transferring stock and cash and mutuals out of your joint accounts into a personal one for quite a while he just made a quick final sweep she bit her tongue before she could chastise laura for signing anything peter had handed her but youve got the paperwork copies of the transactions and withdrawals so youll be able to fight when you get to court laura sat back closed her eyes im not fighting him for money he can have it every lousy penny the hell with that margo erupted no the hell with him the divorce is going to be hard enough on the girls without the two of us battling over dollars and cents in court ive still got fifty thousand cashwhich is a lot more than most women start with he cant touch the house because its in my parents name she picked up her glass but didnt drink im the one who was stupid enough to sign whatever he put in front of me without questioning him i deserved to get fleeced youve got the templeton stock kate reminded her you could sell part of your shares im not touching the family stock its a legacy laura to calm her kate laid a hand on lauras im not saying to put the stock on the market either josh or your parents would buy it or margin you a loan against it until everythings sorted out no closing her eyes laura willed herself to settle down im not running to them she drew in a deep breath and opened her eyes again and neither is either of you i made the mistakes ill fix the mistakes kate i need you to figure out how to liquidate enough money for the deposit on the building no way youre going to take more than half of what you have left in cash and buy that place she smiled thinly at margo yes i am oh yes i am im still a templeton its time i started to act like one before she could change her mind she picked up the business card margo had tossed on the table and dialed the phone louisa its laura templeton yes thats right i want to make an offer on the building we looked at this afternoon when she hung up she pulled off her wedding and engagement rings guilt and liberation twisted inside her youre the expert margo how much can i expect to get for these margo eyed the fivecarat roundcut and the band with sparkling channelset diamonds at least she mused there was some small justice in the world kate dont worry about liquidating anything it looks like we got the down payment out of peter after all later that night margo sat in her room scribbling figures drawing rough sketches making lists she needed to think about paint and paper and plumbing the shop space had to be remodeled to include a dressing room and that meant carpenters she could move in on the top floor as it was which would save her the drive down to monterey every day to check on progress in fact she could cut corners if she painted it herself rather than hiring professionals how hard could it be to roll paint on a wall yes come in she called at the knock on her door and wondered if carpenters charged by the hour or the job margo distracted she glanced up blinked at her mother oh i thought it was one of the girls its nearly midnight theyre sleeping i lost track of the time she pushed at the papers scattered over the bed you always did daydreaming ann skimmed her gaze over the papers amused at the numbers her daughter had added and subtracted it had taken bribes and threats and shouts to get margo to do the simplest arithmetic homework when she was a child you forgot to carry the five ann said oh well margo shoved the paper aside i really need one of those little calculators kates always got in her pocket i was talking to miss kate before she left she said youre going into business and thats laughable for someone who doesnt remember to carry the five margo pushed herself off the bed and picked up the wineglass shed brought up with her would you like a drink mum or are you still on duty saying nothing ann moved into the adjoining bath and came out with a tumbler she poured wine miss kate thinks youve thought it through fairly well and though the odds are against you it may work kates always so blindly optimistic shes a sensible woman and shes given me fine financial advice over the years kates your accountant with a little laugh margo sat again i should have known youd be wise to use her services if you go through with this business of yours im going through with this business of mine prepared to see doubt and derision on her mothers face margo flicked her eyes up number one i dont have many options number two selling things people dont need is what i do best and number three lauras counting on me those are three good reasons there was nothing on anns face but a small enigmatic smile miss laura is footing the bill i didnt ask her margo said stung i didnt want her to she got the idea in her head to buy the building and there was no shaking it out when ann remained silent margo crumpled up a sheet of paper and heaved it damn it im putting everything i have into this everything i own everything i worked for its not a lot of cash but its everything i have moneys not so important as time and effort its pretty damn important right now we dont have a lot to start with nodding as she wandered about looking for something to straighten ann considered miss kate told me what mr ridgeway has done ann took a long deep gulp of wine the cold blackhearted bastard should rot in everlasting hell please god with a laugh margo lifted her glass finally something we can agree on ill drink to it miss laura believes in you and miss kate too in her fashion but you dont margo countered i know youyoull make some fancy place out of it where people with no sense at all will come and toss their money around thats the idea ive even got a name for it pretenses margos laugh was quick and amused it suits me doesnt it that it does youre doing this here in california to be with miss laura she needs me yes she does ann looked down into her glass i said some things the night you came back that im sorry for i was hard on you maybe ive always been but you were wrong when you said i wanted you to be like miss laura or miss kate perhaps i wanted you to be what i could understand and you couldnt do that we were both tired and upset margo shifted on the bed not quite sure how to handle an apology from her mother i dont expect you to understand this whole idea about a shop but i hope youll believe im going to try to make something real out of it your aunt ran a trinket shop in cork youve some merchant in your blood ann moved her shoulders her decision made it will cost considerable i imagine in agreement margo indicated her papers i just have to rob peter to pay paul for a while it would help if i could sell my soul if i still have one to sell id feel better if you kept it ann reached into the pocket of her skirt took out an envelope use this instead curious margo took the envelope opened it then dropped it on the bed as if it had sprouted fangs and bitten her its a brokerage account thats right miss kate recommended the firm very conservative investments as i prefer but theyve done well enough its almost two hundred thousand dollars i wont take your savings i can do this on my own im pleased to hear you say so but its not my savings in there its yours i dont have any savings hasnt that been the problem all along you could never hold on to a penny in a clutched fist you sent me money and i banked it for you a little amazed margo stared down at the brokerage statement had she sent so much had so much to send it had seemed so little at the time i sent the money for you i had no need for it did i brow arched ann angled her head it pleased her to see the pride in her daughters face i have a good job a fine roof over my head enough for a nice vacation twice a year because miss laura insists i need it so the money you sent i banked and there it is ann took another sip of wine because that wasnt how shed meant to say it listen to me margo for once the fact that you did send the money was appreciated perhaps id have gotten sick and unable to work and needed it but that didnt happen sending it was a loving thing to do no it wasnt it shamed her as much to know it as to admit it i did it out of pride i did it to show you i was successful important that you were wrong about me understanding ann inclined her head theres not so much of a difference and the results the same it was your money and it still is i had the comfort that you thought to send it that you had it to send youd have frittered it away if you hadnt passed it to me so weve done each other a favor she reached out to stroke margos hair then faintly embarrassed by the show of affection dropped her hand back to her side now take it and do something with it when margo said nothing ann clucked her tongue she set down her glass then cupped margos chin in her palm why are you so contrary girl did you earn the money with honest work or not yes but do what your mum tells you for once you might be surprised to find shes right go into this business venture on equal terms with miss laura and take pride in that now clean up this mess youve made before you go to bed mum margo picked up the papers as her mother paused at the door why didnt you send this to me in milan when you knew i was scraping bottom because you werent ready for it be sure you are now chapter ten mine holding out her arms margo circled the empty main room of the shop on cannery row technically it wasnt hers quite yet settlement was still two weeks away but the offer had been accepted the contract signed and the loan with the templeton name behind it had gone off without a hitch shed already had a contractor in to discuss alterations it was going to cost big and in her new frugal fashion she had indeed decided to do the simple cosmetic improvements herself research was under way on the rental of floor sanders the purchase of caulking guns shed even looked into something wonderful called a paint sprayer more coverage faster more efficient and the building wouldnt actually be hers she reminded herself it would be theirs hers lauras and the banks but in two weeks time she would be sleeping in that little room upstairs in a sleeping bag if need be then by midsummer the doors of pretenses would open and the rest she thought with a laugh would be history she turned at the tap on the glass and saw kate hey open up will you im on my lunch hour thought id find you here gloating she said when margo opened the door it still smells she added after a testing sniff what do you want kate im busy kate studied the clipboard and the pocket calculator on the floor did you figure out how to work that thing you dont have to be a cpa to use a calculator i meant the clipboard ha ha you know the place grows on you hands tucked in her trouser pockets kate wandered its a nice busy area too should pull in some walkin traffic and people on vacation are always buying things they dont have any use for the secondhand clothes though everythings going to be a size eight ive already thought of that im working on some other stock i know a lot of people who ditch their wardrobes every year smart people buy classicsseasonless classicsthen they dont have to worry how many navy blue blazers do you own kate half a dozen she said and grinned then thumbed a tums out of the roll in her pocket her idea of lunch but thats just me heres the deal margo i want in in what in on the building she popped the antacid crunched it ive got some money to invest and i dont see why you and laura should have all the fun we dont need a partner sure you do you need someone who knows the difference between black ink and red bending down she scooped up the calculator and began to run figures you and laura put in twelvefive apiece cash now youll have the settlement costs points insurance taxes which should bringit up to somewhere around oh eighteen each which makes it thirtysix taking glasses out of her breast pocket she put them on as she continued to work divide that by three and it makes twelve each which is less than youve already shelled out she paced as she cleared figures added more now youve got repairs remodeling maintenance utilities business license fees more taxes bookkeepingi can set the books up for you but i dont have time to take on another client right now so youll have to hire someone or learn to add i can already add margo said stung kate merely took out a small electronic memo and entered a reminder to herself to earmark time to give margo a course in basic bookkeeping the cellular phone in her briefcase rang and she ignored it her service would have to deal with that until her current business was concluded theres the overhead for shopping bags tissue paper boxes cash register tape she continued thatll bump things back up into six figures in no time youll have fees to the credit card companies since your clientele will be using primarily plastic tipping the glasses down she peered at margo over the tops you do intend to accept all major credit cards dont you i see you need me satisfied she bumped up the glasses again no joint venture between laura and margo was going to exclude her no matter how many funds she had to juggle of course ill just be a silent partner as im the only one of the three of us who has a real job margo narrowed her eyes how silent oh just a peep now and then all the practicalities were already ordered in her tidy mind youll have to figure out how and when to replace your stock once it starts to sell what your markup percentage needs to be to ensure your profit margin oh then theres legal fees but we can talk josh into handling that how did you get him to let you use his jag that is his new jag out front isnt it margos expression turned smug you could say im testdriving it lifting her brows kate slipped her glasses off and back into her pocket are you testdriving him not yet interesting ill write you a check for the twelve thousand well have a partnership agreement drawn up a partnership agreement jesus you do need me she caught margo by the shoulders and kissed her dead on the lips the three of us love each other trust each other but youve got to make a business legal right now the stock is all yours but lauras added to it margo interrupted and wicked humor glinted were selling everything in peters office good start hows she holding up pretty well shes worried about ali the kid took it hard when peter didnt show up for her ballet recital word is hes in aruba i hope he drowns nope i hope he gets eaten by sharks and then drowns ill get over to the house this weekend and spend some time with the girls she took out a check already written and signed there you go partner ive got to get back we havent cleared this with laura i did kate said breezily as she opened the door and plowed into josh hi she kissed him bye nice to see you too he called after her then cautiously closed the door laura had warned him not to expect much it was a good thing have you and kate been smoking grass in here thats all she ever does on her lunch hour we really have to get her into a program thrilled with herself margo spread her arms so what do you think uhhuh its a building all right josh give me a minute he walked past her into the adjoining room came back looked into the bath gazed up the pretty and potentially lethal staircase he wiggled the banister winced want a lawyer were going to have that fixed i dont suppose it occurred to you that sometimes dipping your toe in is smarter than diving headfirst its not as much fun well duchess im sure you could have done worse he walked over lifted her pouting face to his lets just get this out of the way shall we ive been thinking about it across two continents he pulled her close covered her mouth greedily with his after a moment of token disinterest she let herself melt into a kiss that tasted of frustrated lust so unexpected so thrilling the way his mouth fit on hers the way all those hard lines and planes of his body met and meshed so perfectly with the curves of hers it didnt give her time to think whether it was simply that she had missed that glorious sensation of being held by a man or if it was josh but because it was josh she needed to think i dont know how i missed how potent you were all these years she drew away flashed a quick teasing smile his system was straining like an engine revved too high that was just a free sample come back here and well go for the full treatment i think well take it in stages she walked away opened her bag and took out a pack of cigarettes her elegant case was already boxed into inventory im learning to be a cautious woman cautious he scanned the room again which is how you got from renting a little shop in milan to clear your debts and make a reasonable living to buying a building on cannery row and adding to those debts well i cant change overnight can i she eyed him through a haze of smoke youre not going to get all lawyerly on me are you josh actually i am he picked up the briefcase hed set aside opened it i have some papers for you he looked around for a place to sit and settled on the bottom step of the staircase come here come here he repeated and patted the narrow space beside him i can manage to keep my hands off you she picked up a little tin ashtray and joined him im getting good at papers im thinking of buying a file cabinet he didnt sigh it wouldnt have made any difference is your italian good enough to wade through this she frowned at the papers he offered its a contract of sale on my flat emotions whirled up inside her regret warring with relief you work fast she murmured its a very decent offer he tucked her hair behind her ear are you sure its what you want its the way it is reality doesnt always chew well but im trying to acquire a taste she closed her eyes and leaned her head on his shoulder just let me feel sorry for myself a minute youre entitled selfpitys a bad habit of mine its hard to shake damn it josh i loved that place sometimes id just stand on the terrace and think look where you are margo look who you are well now youre someplace else it wasnt sympathy she needed he decided but a good boot in the butt and you look the same to me its not the same its never going to be the same again toughen up margo youre starting to wallow in it she jerked up easy for you to say joshua conway templeton the bright star of the templeton empire you never lost anything you never groped your way sweating to get a grip on something everyone told you you couldnt have no one ever told you you couldnt have anything and everything you wanted thats the breaks isnt it he said easily you played duchess and you lost whining about it isnt going to change a thing and its very unattractive thanks so much for your support fuming she snatched the contract out of his hand when do i get the money theres time and theres italian time if youre lucky you may have it settled in sixty days the bottom lines on the next page he watched her flip it over her eyes were hot as they skimmed down the heat clouded with distress thats it you didnt have a lot of equity built up the bank gets theirs first then the government takes its share its better than a stick in the eye she muttered barely i drew on your account to square your american express bill i dont suppose it occurred to you to fly back here coach when she only stared coolly he shook his head i dont know why i said that youre back under the max on your visa card but id go easy on it after you distribute the net from the sale of the flat youll only be about a hundred and fifty thousand in the hole excluding interest and penalties pin money she said dryly you shouldnt plan on buying any pins for a while now as your representative im willing to clear your debts and assist you in dealing with any you incur while initiating your business you got a name for this place yet pretenses she said between her teeth as he flipped out more papers perfect ive drawn up the necessary agreements have you she said slowly in triplicate warned by the tone he looked up met her icy stare equally naturally and just what would i be agreeing to counselor templeton to pay back this personal loan in regular installments beginning six months after the date of signing that gives you some breathing space you also agree to live within your means during the term of the loan i see and what are my means in your legal opinion ive worked up a budget for personal expenses food lodging medical a budget hed expected an explosion even perversely hoped for one margos tantrums were always so stimulating it didnt appear that he was going to be disappointed a budget she repeated storming to him of all the unbelievable bloody nerve you arrogant son of a bitch do you think im going to stand here and let you treat me like some sort of brainless bimbo who needs to be told how much she can spend on face powder face powder deliberately he scanned the papers took a pen out of his pocket and made a quick note that would come under miscellaneous luxuries i think ive been very generous there now as to your clothing allowance allowance she used both hands to shove him back a step just let me tell you what you can do with your fucking allowance careful duchess he brushed the front of his shirt turnbill and asser the strangled sound in her throat was the best she could do if there had been anything anything at all to throw shed have heaved it at his head id rather be picked apart alive by vultures than let you handle my money you dont have any money he began but she barreled on as she whirled around the room watching her he all but salivated id rather be gangraped by midgets staked naked to a wasp nest be forcefed garden slugs go three weeks without a manicure he put in and watched her hands curl into claws you go after my face with those ill have to hurt you oh i hate you no you dont he moved very fast one instant he was leaning lazily on the wobbly banister and the next hed flashed out grabbed her he took a moment to enjoy the dark fury on her face the lethal glint in her eyes before he crushed her snarling mouth under his it was like kissing a lightning boltthat heat the jolt of deadly power the sizzling sting of fury he knew that when he finally got her into bed it would be a fullblown storm she didnt resist that would have given him too much satisfaction instead she met him force for force and pleased herself until they both stepped back gasping i can enjoy that and still hate you she tossed her hair back and i can make you pay for it maybe she could there were women in the world who had the innate gift of knowing just how to make a man suffer and burn and beg all of them could have taken lessons from margo sullivan but he wasnt fool enough to let her know it he walked back to the stairs picked up the papers just so we know where we stand darling ill tell you just where we stand darling i dont need your insulting offer im running my life my way and thats been such a rousing success so far i know what im doing take that ridiculous smirk off your face i cant it sticks there every time you say you know what youre doing but he tucked all the papers back in his briefcase closed it ill say this i dont think its an entirely moronic ideathis place well ill sleep easy now knowing i have your approval approvals a little strong its more like hopeful resignation he gave the banister a last wiggle but i believe in you margo temper died into confusion damn you josh i cant keep up with you good he strolled over flicked a finger down her cheek i think youre going to make something out of this shop thatll surprise everyone especially you he leaned down and when he kissed her this time it was light and friendly got cab fare excuse me grinning he pulled keys out of his pocket fortunately i had a spare set to the jag dont work too late duchess she didnt smile until he was well out of sight then she gathered up her bag her clipboard she was going to put her newly healed visa card to use and buy a paint sprayer it took josh less than two weeks at templeton monterey to finetune his strategy for dealing with peter ridgeway he had already made it clear with a single phone call from stockholm that it would be best for his brotherinlaw personally and professionally to take a brief leave of absence from templeton until as hed put it all reason and bonhomie theyd gotten this little domestic matter ironed out he had always steered clear of his sisters marriage as a bachelor he hardly felt that he qualified to hand out marital advice and as he adored his sister and had mildly despised her husband hed also had to consider the indisputable fact that his advice would have been heavily onesided since peter had always performed well as a templeton executive thered been no cause for complaint there he was perhaps a bit rigid in his view of hotel management more than a bit distant from the staff and the daytoday problems and triumphs but hed had a fine hand with the corporate groups and foreign businesses that poured money into templeton coffers still there came a time when professional efficiency had to be weighed against personal disgust because nobody but nobody messed with joshua templetons family and walked away whole hed considered taking the corporate route simply amputating peter from any connection with templeton hotels and using his connections and influence to see to it that the son of a bitch never managed so much as a roadside motel in kansas but that was so easy so bloodless he agreed with kate that the sensible route and the most straightforward was toin kates wordsdrag ridgeways sorry flat ass into court josh knew a half a dozen top family lawyers who would rub their hands together in glee at the prospect of nailing the greedy adulterous husband who had cleaned out his own daughters little savings accounts oh that would be sweet josh mused as he drew in the earlymorning scents of sea and oleander blossoms but it would also be a painful and public humiliation for laura and again he thought bloodless still such matters were best handled in a civilized fashion josh decided the most civilized place to balance the scales was the country club so he waited patient as a cat for peter to return to california peter accepted his invitation for a morning set of tennis without hesitation josh had expected no less he imagined peter calculated that being seen exchanging lobs with his brotherinlaw would quell some of the rumors over peters position with templeton josh was happy to oblige him golf was peters game but he considered himself a fair hand at the net hed dressed for the match in spotless whites his shorts pressed with lethal pleats josh wore a similar uniform if slightly less formal with the addition of a dodgers fielders cap to shade his eyes from the dazzling morning sun later minn whiley and deloris solmes whod been playing their regular tuesday morning set on the adjoining court would sip aftermatch mimosas and comment on what a picture the men had made golden and bronzed and fit muscular legs pumping as they thwacked the bright yellow ball back and forth of course minn would tell sarah metzenbaugh after she joined them for a steam that had been before the incident i dont take time to do this often enough peter commented as they unzipped their rackets eighteen holes of golf twice a week is all i can squeeze in all work and no play josh said affably and didnt miss peters smirk of disdain he knew exactly what ridgeway thought of him the pampered golden boy who spent all his time jetting from party to party i feel deprived if i dont get at least one decent set in every morning taking his time josh set out a bottle of evian im glad you could manage to meet me im sure that between us we can straighten this uncomfortable business out youre staying at the resort now that youre back from aruba it seemed best id hoped that if i gave laura a little time and space shed see reason women he spread his elegant hands uncluttered now by the gold band of his marriage difficult creatures tell me about it lets warm up josh took his place behind the line waited for peter to set volley for serve he called out and hit the ball easily how was aruba restful peter returned pacing himself our hotel there has a few kinks it should be looked into really josh had done a complete check on it less than eight months before and knew it ran brilliantly ill make a note of that deliberately he fumbled a backhand sending it wide of the line rusty he said with a shake of his head your serve tell me peter do you plan to contest the divorce if laura insists on going through with it i hardly see the point it would only add fuel to the gossip shes dissatisfied with my responsibilities to templeton a woman like laura doesnt understand the demands of business or a mans relationship with his secretary teeth flashing in a feral grin josh sent the ball whizzing by peters ear she misinterpreted a situation my point testing a fresh ball peter shook his head frankly josh shed become unreasonably jealous over the time it was necessary for me to spend at the office im sure youre aware of the recent influx of conventions and the tenday visit last month of lord and lady wilhelm they took two floors and the presidential suite we couldnt offer them less than perfection naturally not and laura didnt understand the pressure you were under to deliver shed only been nursed at the breast of the grande dame of hoteliers exactly puffing a little as josh mercilessly worked him cross court peter missed the return it only got worse when that ridiculous foulmouthed margo showed up on the door step naturally laura would take her in without a thought to the consequences softhearted our laura josh said easily and let the conversation lag until hed taken the first set it wasnt exactly gallant old man cleaning out the bank accounts peters lips hardened hed expected laura to have more pride than to go whining to her brother on my lawyers advice simple selfpreservation as she had no sense about finances the move has certainly been justified now that shes proved her lack of sense by going into partnership with margo sullivan shopkeepers for gods sake as bad as innkeepers josh murmured what was that i said who knows what puts ideas in a womans head shell have lost her capital within six monthsif margo doesnt abscond with it before that you should have tried to talk her out of the whole insane notion oh who listens to me he thought about letting peter win the second set then decided he was bored and wanted it over he played it out for a while and just to make it interesting allowed peter to break his serve bad luck the pleasure of beating his brotherinlaw at his own game pumped through peters blood like fine wine youll have to work on your backhand mmm josh jogged to the sideline mopped his face glugged down evian as he recapped the bottle he flashed a smile toward the women in the next court he was darkly pleased at the idea of an audience for the show he had in mind oh before i forget ive been doing some spotchecking at the hotel theres been an unusual number of staff turnovers in the last eighteen months peter arched a brow it isnt necessary for you to involve yourself with templeton monterey or the resort thats my territory oh dont mean to trespass but i was here and you werent he tossed his towel aside plunked the plastic bottle onto it then went back behind the net its odd though templeton has a tradition of longterm employee loyalty interfering bastard pampered fool peter thought carefully controlling his temper as he walked in the opposite direction as you can see if you read the reports lower management made several errors of judgment in hiring weeding out was necessary to continue our standard of service and appearance im sure youre right ill be back at the helm tomorrow so theres no need to concern yourself not concerned at all just curious your serve isnt it joshs smile was as lazy as a nap in a hammock they resumed play peter faulted his first serve then bore down on his irritation and slammed the next cleanly biding his time josh entertained himself by bouncing peter back and forth across the court forcing him to dig and pump barely winded himself he kept up a steady flow of conversation as he took the next game fortylove i noticed a few other things while i was fiddling around your expense account for instance seventyfive thousand in the last five months for client entertainment sweat dripped into peters eyes infuriating him my expense account records have never been questioned in the fifteen years ive worked for templeton of course not all easy smiles josh gathered balls in preparation for the next game youve been married to my sister for twothirds of that time oh and there was that bonus to your secretary idly he bounced a ball on the heart of his racket the one you were fucking ten thousands very gen erous she must make a hell of a cup of coffee stopping bending with his hands on his knees to catch his breath peter squinted over the net bonuses and financial incentives are templeton policy and i dont appreciate your innuendos that wasnt an innuendo peter listen up it was a statement and a pathetically hypocritical one coming from you everyone knows how you spend your time and the family money cars and women and gambling youre right about that with a friendly smile josh stepped behind the serving line bounced the ball lightly and you could say it was hypocritical of me even to mention it he tossed the ball up as if to serve then caught it scratched his head except for one little detail no no it would be two really minor details one its my money and two im not married he tossed the ball up swung and served an ace straight into peters nose as peter dropped to his knees blood gushing out from between his fingers josh strolled over twirling his racket and three its my sister youre fucking with you son of a bitch peters voice was muffled and thick and breathless with pain you crazy bastard youve broken my nose be grateful i didnt aim for your balls crouching down josh jerked peter up by the collar of his bloodsplattered polo now listen to me he murmured while the women on the next court squealed and shouted for the tennis pro and listen carefully because im only going to say this once there were stars wheeling in front of peters eyes nausea welling in his stomach get your damn hands off of me youre not listening josh said quietly and you really want to pay close attention here dont you even speak my sisters name in public if i decide youve so much as had a thought about her i dont like youll pay with more than your nose and if you ever talk about margo again the way youve talked about her to me ill twist off your nuts and feed them to you ill sue you you bastard pain radiated through his face like sunbursts humiliation darted after it ill sue you for assault oh please do meanwhile i suggest you take another trip go back to aruba or try st barts or go to hell but i dont want to see you anywhere near me or mine he let peter go in disgust and as an afterthought wiped his bloodsmeared hand on the front of peters shirt oh and by the way youre fired thats game set and fucking match well satisfied with the mornings work he decided to treat himself to a steam chapter eleven miracles could happen margo thought they only took six weeks aching muscles and somewhere in the neighborhood of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to create six weeks before she had become the official onethird owner of the empty building on cannery row immediately after glasses of templeton sparkling wine had been passed around shed rolled up her sleeves it was a new experience dealing with contractors surrounding herself with the sounds of saws and hammers and men with tool belts she spent nearly every waking moment of those weeks in the shop or on shop business the clerks at the supply stores began to weep with joy when she walked through the door her carpenters learned to tolerate her she debated paint samples with laura agonized over the choice between dusty rose and desert mauve until the slight variance in shades became a decision of monumental proportion recessed lighting became an obsession for days she learned the joy and terror of hardware spending hours picking through hinges and drawer pulls the way she had once perused the jewelry displays at tiffanys she painted learning to love and despise the eccentricities of her variablespeed searsbrand paint sprayer growing neurotically possessive she refused to allow kate or laura to try their hand with it and once after a particularly long session she jumped at the reflection in the mirror margo sullivan the face that launched a million bottles of alpha hydroxy stared back her glorious hair bundled messily under a dirty white cap her cheeks flecked with deeprose freckles her eyes naked and a little wild she didnt know whether to shudder or scream but the shock sent her straight into the clawfoot tub for a hot frothy soak in sea salts and urged her to give herself a full treatmentfacial hot oil manicure just to prove she hadnt completely lost her mind now after six weeks of insanity she had begun to believe that dreams could be made the floors gleamed sanded smooth and slicked with three satiny coats of varnish the walls her personal pride and joy were a soft warm rose windows shed washed herself in her mothers secret solution that relied heavily on vinegar and elbow grease sparkled in their frame of new trim the iron stairs and circling banisters had been securely bolted and shimmered with fresh gilt tiles in both bathrooms had been regrouted and ruthlessly scrubbed and were now accented with fancy fingertip towels with lace edging everything was rose and gold and fresh its like dorian gray margo commented she and laura were huddled in the sitting area of the main showroom struggling to price the contents of a crate it is yeah the shop keeps getting prettier and shinier she pinched her tired cheeks and laughed and im the picture in the closet oh that explains those warts warts instant panic what warts easy it was lauras first good laugh in days just joking christ next time just shoot me in the head as her blood pressure returned to normal margo held up a faience vase painted with stylized flowers what do you think its doulton it was no use asking margo what shed paid for it laura knew she wouldnt have a clue following routine laura glanced at the stack of price guides and catalogs theyd collected did you look it up sort of over the past weeks margo had developed a lovehate relationship with price guides she loved the idea of marking prices hated the knowledge that so much money had already slipped through her fingers i think a hundred fifty go for it tongue caught between her teeth margo slowly tapped the keys on the laptop kate had insisted they couldnt live without stock number g for glassware or c for collectibles um g kates not here to argue the point g damn it i said g she deleted tried again one hundred fifty though it was probably inefficient which kate would have pointed out margo tagged the vase rose to carry it to the glass etagere that was already filling up then came back to light a cigarette what the hell are we doing laura having fun what made you buy something like this smoking contemplatively margo eyed an undoubtedly ugly urn with wing handles i must have been having a bad day well its stinton and signed so maybe she flipped busily through a price book about fortyfive hundred really had she really once been in the position to pay so much for so little she nudged the laptop toward laura theyre coming to paint the sign on the window tomorrow and the crew from entertainment tonight is supposed to be here by two are you sure you want to do that are you kidding all that free publicity margo stretched her arms up her shoulders were aching a sensation shed gotten used to besides itll give me a chance to deck myself out get in front of the camera im thinking the sage green armani or the blue valentino weve already tagged the armani right valentino it is as long as it doesnt make you uncomfortable valentino never makes me uncomfortable you know what i mean laura hefted the urn decided it looked slightly less unattractive on the corner shelf all those questions about your private life i dont have a private life at the moment youve got to learn to shrug off the gossip honey she tapped out her cigarette and knelt to explore the crate if you let every whisper and snicker about you and peter sting the wasps will know and theyll keep after you he came back to town last week her head jerked up is he hassling you no but josh had an incident with him a few days ago i didnt hear about it until this morning an incident amused margo studied a little limoges box replicating a french flower stall christ she loved these little bits of nonsense what did they do draw their mont blancs and duel josh broke peters nose what staggered between shock and glory she nearly bobbled the box josh punched him he broke it with a tennis ball when margo collapsed into hoots of laughter laura scowled there were people in the next court its all over the club peter had to be taken to the hospital and he might very well file charges what assault with a forehand lob oh laura its too delicious i havent given josh enough credit she pressed a hand on her stomach as her ribs began to ache it had to be deliberate well of course it was deliberate josh can bean a speeding car at fifty yards with his backhand he could have played center court if hed taken himself seriously damn i wish id seen it wicked delight sparkled in her eyes did he bleed a lot profusely im told it was wrong laura had to continually remind herself it was wrong to enjoy the image of bright red blood geysering out of peters aristocratic nose hes gone to maui to recuperate margo i dont want my brother smashing tennis balls into the face of the father of my children oh let him have his fun without remembering to tag or log it margo placed the limoges in a curvedfront cabinet where a dozen others were already displayed ah is josh seeing anyone seeing anyone you know as in dating escorting having hot sex with baffled laura rubbed at her tired eyes not that i know of but then he stopped bragging about having hot sex around me years ago but youd know as if it were vital to world peace margo rubbed at a smudge on the display glass youd have heard or sensed hes awfully busy just now so id say probably not why oh she turned back smiling widely just a little wager we have going im starving she realized abruptly are you starving i think we should order something in if kate comes by after work and were not done with this shipment shes going to lecture us on time management again i dont have time for lectures on time im sorry i have to pick up the girls its friday she explained i promised them dinner and a movie why dont you come with us and leave all this luxury margo spread her arms wide to encompass boxes heaps of packing material halfempty cups of cold coffee besides i have to practice my gift wrapping everything i do still looks like it was wrapped up by a slowwitted threeyearold i dont mind really she broke off as the door swung open and kayla burst through mama we came to visit with a beaming smile she launched herself into lauras arms clung just a little too hard hello baby laura squeezed back worrying how long these small reassurances would be necessary how did you get here uncle josh picked us up he said we could come and look at the shop cause we should take an interest in our legacy your legacy huh laughing now laura set kayla down and watched her older daughter come more cautiously less happily into the room well ali what do you think it looks different than it did before she walked unerringly to the jewelry case a girl after my own heart margo declared and wrapped an arm around alls shoulder theyre so beautiful its like a treasure chest it is not seraphinas dowry this time but mine we got pizza kayla called out uncle josh bought lots and lots of pizza so we can eat here instead of in a restaurant can we mama if you like do you want to ali ali shrugged continued to stare at the bracelets and pins it doesnt matter and heres the man of the hour margo crossed the room as josh elbowed the door open his arms loaded with pizza boxes she leaned over them and gave him a smacking kiss on the mouth just for pizza hell i couldve gone for the bucket of chicken actually that was a reward for your tennis prowess she kept her voice low and at the answering gleam in his eyes she took the boxes from him still sleeping alone darling dont remind me he arched a brow you she grinned and trailed a finger down his cheek ive been much too busy for sports of any kind ali i think theres a bottle of pepsi in the refrigerator upstairs got that covered too he said torturing himself with the scent of her perfume can you handle getting the drinks out of the car ali cat me too kayla bulleted for the door i can help come on ali well well josh tucked his hands in his pockets and scanned the room as his nieces slammed the door you have been busy he wandered toward the adjoining room had to smile it looked very much like margos closet back in milan except that all the clothes were now discreetly tagged lingerie and nightclothes are upstairs margo told him in the boudoir naturally idly he picked up a gray suede pump turned it over the sole was barely scraped and the price was ninetytwo fifty how are you pricing oh we have our little system he set the shoe back glanced at his sister i didnt think youd mind if i brought the girls by no not at all what i do mind is you taking it upon yourself to fight with peter he didnt bother to look contrite heard about that did you of course i heard about it everyone from big sur to montereys heard about it by now she refused to warm when he walked over and kissed her i can deal with my marital problems myself sure you can that ball just got away from me like hell margo muttered actually i was aiming for his caps listen laura he continued when she bristled under his hands well talk about it later okay she had little choice since at that moment her daughters came back carrying bags from the car hed thought of paper plates as well and napkins and silly party cups for soda and a good red bordeaux there seemed to be very little margo mused as they spread the makeshift picnic on the floor that josh templeton didnt think of it was a little lowering to realize she had underestimated him all these years he would be a formidable foe which hed proved by one swing of the racket and she was certain he would be a memorable lover josh caught her staring and passed her a plate problem duchess more than likely but she enjoyed herself listening to the children ali seemed to brighten shade by shade under joshs teasing and attention poor thing wants a father margo mused she understood the need the empty ache of it it had been thomas templeton who had helped fill that void for her and who at the same time simply by being kind and caring had made her constantly aware that he was not hers she had never had her ownor had had him so briefly she couldnt remember him her mother had always been so closemouthed about the man she had married and lost that margo had been afraid to ask questions afraid she realized that there had been nothing there for any of them no love she mused certainly no passion one more tepid marriage in the world hardly made a difference to anyone even those she thought involved in it a good irish catholic girl married and had children as was expected of her then accepted gods will with a bowed head ann sullivan wouldnt have mourned and tossed herself cursing god into the sea as seraphina had done ann sullivan had picked herself up moved on and forgotten and so easily margo mused that there had likely been little to remember it was as if she had never had a father at all and hadnt she sought to fill that lifetime gap with men often older men like alain men who were successful and established and always safely beyond commitment married men or oftmarried men or loosely married men with wives who turned a blind eye to an affair as long as their husbands turned a blind eye to theirs there had always been a cozy cushion with men who looked at her as a lovely prize to be pampered and fussed over displayed men who would never stay which of course only made them more attractive only more forbidden her stomach shuddered and she gulped wine to steady it what a horrible realization she thought what a pathetic one are you all right concerned laura laid a hand on her arm youve gone pale its nothing just a little headache im going to take some thing she rose and used every ounce of control she had to walk up the stairs rather than run in the bathroom she riffled through the medicine bottles her fingers rested on tranquilizers before she shifted them firmly to aspirin too easy she told herself as she ran the water cold too easy to pop a pill and make it all go away margo josh came up behind her took hold of her shoulders whats got you demon dreams she shook her head swallowed aspirin its nothing just a nasty little epiphany she would have turned but he held her firm so that their faces reflected back at them nervous about opening the shop next week terrified whatever happens youve already accomplished something important youve taken this place and made it shine its beautiful and elegant and unique very much like you and filled with pretenses priced to sell so what she closed her eyes so what be a friend josh and hold on to me for a minute he turned her gathered her close he heard her loose a long shuddering breath and he stroked her hair do you remember that winter when you went on a search for seraphinas dowry umm i dug up the rose garden and part of the south lawn mum was furious and mortified and threatened to ship me off to my aunt bridgett in cork she sighed a little comforted by the feel of him the scent of him but your father laughed and laughed he thought it was a great joke and that i showed an adventurous spirit you were looking for something you wanted and you went after it his lips brushed her hair to soothe thats what youve always done and ive always wanted the unattainable no he eased back tipped up her chin the interesting id hate to think youd stop digging up rosebushes duchess sighing again she snuggled her head on his shoulder i really hate to admit this but youre good for me josh i know and he thought it was long past time that she figured that out she hadnt expected to be nervous thered been so much to do in the past three monthsappointments meetings decisions to make stock to sort through the decorating the planning even the choice of shopping bags and boxes had prompted hours of debate thered been so much to learn inventory profitandloss ratios tax forms sales tax business tax property tax interviews to give the spread in people had just hit the stands and entertainment weekly had run a blurb on her and her shop a snide blurb but it was print it was all falling into place so she had expected the actual opening to be rather anticlimactic the attack of nerves twentyfour hours before pretenses grand opening was both unexpected and unwelcome over the years margo had taken various courses to deal with nerves a glass of wine shopping a pill sex none of those seemed a viable option now nor did they fit in with the new direction her life was taking she was giving sweat a try instead the exercise facilities at the country club were she supposed top of the line she had through her career played with free weights and pranced through a few aerobic classes but shed been blessed with a killer metabolism long legs long torso and generous breasts that werent echoed in hips and she had smugly scorned the fitness craze now she struggled through the programming of a stair master wondering how anyone could get excited about climbing steps to nowhere she could only hope it would turn her busy mind to mushand keep the weight shed put back on properly distributed the huge room was ringed with windows that offered views of the golf course or the pool for those who werent interested in the great outdoors there were individual television sets affixed above treadmills so one could walk or trot to health while watching katie and bryant or cnn various pieces of what she considered rather terrifying equipment were placed here and there beside her a woman in red spandex doggedly climbed flight after flight while reading the latest danielle steele margo struggled to get her rhythm and focus on the bobbing print of the business section of the los angeles times but she couldnt concentrate this was a whole new world she realized one that had been bumping jogging and grunting along while shed been wrapped up in her own a man with a gorgeous body and biceps like bricks watched himself carefully in a mirror while lifting brutallooking weights a bevy of women trim or pudgy pumped on stationary bikes some of them chattered together others rode to the tune on headsets people crunched twisted bent and punished their bodies mopped sweat from their faces glugged down mineral water then went back for more it was to her amazing for her this was a lark a momentary diversion but for them all these damp straining bodies it was a serious lifestyle choice perhaps they were all slightly insane still werent these the very people she would need to appeal to the businesspeople the clever rich the women who worked out in hundreddollar bike shorts and two hundreddollar shoes after straining and stretching their bodies wouldnt they enjoy a bit of pampering beyond the swedish massages the turkish baths the whirlpools surely they would enjoy strolling into a classy shop to browse be offered a cup of cappuccino a glass of chilled champagne while an attractive woman helped them select the perfect bauble or a tasteful gift of course the challenge would be to convince them that the fact that the bauble or gift was secondhand only made it more interesting and unique calculating she slanted a look at the woman beside her do you do this every day hmm i was wondering if you do this every day with a friendly smile margo sized up her companion midthirties carefully groomed the channelset diamonds on her wedding band were excellent quality and weighed in at about three carats ive just started three days a week its really all you need to maintain obviously willing to be distracted she skimmed a glance over margo losing weight isnt your goal ive gained seven pounds in the last three months with a laugh the woman lifted the towel shed slung over the bar and blotted her throat margo noted the watch was a slim rolex we should all be able to say that and look like you ive lost thirtythree over the last year youre kidding if i put it back on ill kill myself so now im on maintenance im back to a size eight and by god im staying there you look wonderful size eight she thought perfect do you like working out the woman smiled grimly as her stepper pumped up the pace i hate every fucking minute of it thank god margo said sincerely as her calves began to burn sanity im margo sullivan id offer my hand but im afraid id fall off judy prentice margo sullivan she repeated i thought you looked familiar i used to hate you oh when i was cruising toward a size sixteen and id flip through a magazine thered youd be curvy and perfect id head straight for the godivas she offered a quick grin its rewarding to know you sweat just like a human being deciding judy was likable as well as a potential customer margo grinned back isnt there supposed to be something about endorphins oh thats a lie i think jane fonda started it you grew up here didnt you big sur margo confirmed puffing now im back i have a shop in monterey pretenses on cannery row were having our grand opening tomorrow you should drop in look around she gritted her teeth ill make sure we have godivas bitch judy said with a quick laugh i might just do that well thats my twenty minutes of hell fifteen with the free weights and a short session on the nautilus torture chamber and im out of here she grabbed her towel glanced toward the entrance oh here comes the diva candy litchfield margo muttered as she spotted the redhead in a floral unitard know her too well hmm if you have the good taste to loathe her i might just check out that shop of yours oops shes heading this way and shes all yours listen dont but it was too late candy let out a squeal that had every head swiveling margo margo sullivan i just cant believe it hello candy to margos despair candy bounced up to the stepper candy bounced everywhere it was just one of the many reasons to despise her she was bandbox pretty all perky features and tumbling red hair in their high school days candy had been head cheerleader and head pain in the ass shed married welltwicehad two perfect children one from each marriage and spent her days as far as margo knew planning perfect tea parties and indulging in discreet affairs under the surface past the perky face and welltoned body was the heart of a viper to candy other women werent simply members of the same sex and species they were the enemy i heard you were back of course with a perfect pink nail she tapped in her choice of time and program on the machine judy had vacated ive been meaning to call but ive been so busy the diamond studs in her ears winked as she smiled at margo how are you margo you look wonderful no one would ever know wouldnt they all those terrible stories delighted malice flitted around her kewpiedoll lips why it must have been just dreadful for you i just cant imagine the terror of being arrestedand in a foreign country too her voice was just loud enough to catch the interest of several morning athletes neither can i margo struggled not to puff and wished violently for a cigarette i wasnt arrested i was questioned well i was sure the stories were exaggerated her tone was a bright brew of sympathy laced with doubt all those horrible things they said about you why when i heard i told several of the girls over lunch that it was just nonsense but the stories just kept coming the press is so heartless you were wise to get out of europe until the scandal dies down its so like laura to overlook all the talk and take you in there was nothing to say to that but yes its such a shame about bella donna im sure your replacement wont be nearly as effective youre so much more photogenic than tessa cesare bouncing perkily candy sharpened her lance of course shes younger but she doesnt have your experience it was a shaft to the heart well aimed and well honed margos fingers tightened on the bar but she kept her voice easy tessas a beautiful woman oh of course and very exotic that golden skin those wonderful black eyes im sure the company felt they had to go with a contrast her smile was calculatedly tinged with amused disdain youll make a comeback margo dont you worry not if im serving time for murder she said under her breath so tell me everything i heard the most hilarious story about you going into retail i laugh about it all the time we open tomorrow no really her eyes popped wide on a titter then poor laura ridgeway did buy you a building thats so touching laura kate powell and i bought the building together the three of you always did stick together candys smile turned sharp shed always detested them for their unshakable friendship im sure itll be great fun for you and poor laura certainly needs a distraction just now there cant be anything more painful and distressing than seeing your marriage fail unless its seeing your second marriage fail margo returned with a cheery smile is the divorce final candy next month you never did marry any of those men did you margo no i just had sex with them most of them were already married anyway youve always had such a european attitude i suppose im just too american i dont think i could ever be comfortable being a mistress temper shot little lights of red in front of margos eyes darling she drawled its blissfully comfortable believe me but then youre probably right youre not suited for it no alimony she stepped off the machine grateful that her session with candy had taken her mind off nerves and screaming muscles maybe her legs felt like limp strings of linguini but she wouldnt give candy the satisfaction of seeing them buckle instead she carefully wiped off the machine as she had seen judy do do come by the shop candy were having our grand opening tomorrow youve always wanted what i had this is your chance to get it for a price as margo flounced out candy drew a breath up her pert tiptilted nose and turned to the interested woman puffing behind her margo sullivan always pretended to be something she wasnt why if it wasnt for the templetons she wouldnt be allowed through the front gates of this club the woman blinked the sweat out of her eyes shed admired margos style and her sapphire tennis bracelet what was the name of her shop chapter twelve ninefortyfive july twentyeighth fifteen minutes to zero hour and margo was sitting on the bed in the ladies boudoir the bed she had once slept in made love in dreamed in now she was perched on the edge of it holding her stomach and praying for the nausea to pass what if no one came what if absolutely no one so much as stepped through those freshly washed glass doors she would spend the next eight hours trembling staring out the display window now so painstakingly arranged with her charcoal silk taffeta st laurentworn only last year to the cannes film festivalits skirts draped over a louis xiv hall chair that flowing skirt was surrounded by once prized possessions a baccarat perfume bottle rhinestonestudded evening slippers sapphire drop earrings a black satin purse with a jeweled clasp in the shape of a panther the meissen candlestick the waterford champagne flute a display of her favorite trinket boxes and the silverbacked dresser set that had been a gift from an old lover shed placed every piece personally as a kind of ritual and now she feared that those things she had once owned and loved would draw no more than scorn from passersby what had she done stripped herself stripped herself raw and in public she thought she could handle that live through that but she had dragged the people she cared about most into the morass with her wasnt laura downstairs right now waiting for that first customer and kate would dash over on her lunch hour eager to see a sale rung up on the vintage cash register shed hauled in from an antique shop in carmel and josh would probably swing by toward evening strolling in with a smile on his face to congratulate them on their first days success how could she possibly face them with failure when the failure was all hers what she wanted most at that moment was to bolt downstairs and out the door and just keep running stage fright with one arm still wrapped around her queasy stomach she glanced up josh was in the doorway you talked me into this if i could stand up right now id kill you lucky for me those gorgeous legs of yours arent steady he gave her a quick appraising look shed chosen a simple and perfectly tailored suit in power red with a short snug skirt that gave those stunning unsteady legs plenty of exposure to do their work her hair was braided with just a few tendrils calculatingly free to frame her face pale as marble now eyes glassy with fear you disappoint me duchess i figured to find you down stairs revved up to kick ass instead youre up here shaking like a virgin on her wedding night i want to go back to milan well you cant can you his tone was hard as he crossed the room took her by the arm stand up get a grip on yourself those big blue eyes were swimming and he was afraid that if the first tear fell he would break and carry her off anywhere she wanted to go its a damn store for christs sake not a capital trial its just like you to blow it out of proportion its not just a store her voice hitched mortifying her its all ive got then go down and do something about it i dont want to go down what if no one conies or if they only come to stare and snicker what if they dont what if they do there are plenty of people wholl be interested enough to breeze by just to see you fall on your face keep this up and thats all theyre going to see i shouldnt have started out so big since that applies to every aspect of your life i dont see why youre complaining now he studied her face angry with her for letting him see the fear angry with himself for wanting to protect her look youve got five minutes and youll make up your own mind ive got my own problems to deal with he brought out the single red rose hed held behind his back and curled her fingers around the stem let me know how you deal with yours he closed his lips over hers impatiently and didnt wait for her reaction he could have offered a little sympathy she fumed and stalked into the bathroom to retouch her makeup just a little understanding and support no not josh she slammed her blusher back into the cabinet all she got from him was insults and surly remarks well that was fine that was good it reminded her that she had no one to lean on but herself five minutes later she made herself walk downstairs laura was beaming at the big ornate cash register as its bells chimed youve got to stop playing with that thing im not playing face flushed with excitement she turned to margo ive just rung up our first sale but were not open josh bought the little deco lamp before he left he said to box it up and ship it reaching across the counter she grabbed margos hands and squeezed box it up and ship it margo its our first box it up and ship it you can always depend on josh margo let out a shaky laugh damn him it was just like him yeah you can cant you the mantel clock behind the counter chimed the hour zero hour well i guess wed better laura im me too laura drew a long cleansing breath lets open for business partner yeah margo straightened her shoulders and angled her chin as she crossed to the door and fuck them if they cant take a joke two hours later she wasnt sure if she was thrilled or punchdrunk she couldnt claim they were jammed with customers particularly of the paying variety but theyd enjoyed a small steady stream almost from the first minute she had with her own trembling hands rung up the second sale of the day barely fifteen minutes after opening the doors both she and the tourist from tulsa had agreed that the silver cuff bracelet was an excellent buy with some amazement and no little admiration shed watched laura steer a trio of browsers toward the wardrobe room like a veteran shop clerk and flatter them into reaching for their credit cards when kate arrived at twelvethirty margo was closing the sapphire earrings from the display window into one of the bright gold boxes with silver lettering that shed chosen for the shops trademark i know your wifes going to love them she said as she slipped the box into a tiny gold bag her hands werent trembling but they wanted to i did and happy anniversary the minute the customer stepped away from the counter she snagged kates hand and pulled her into the powder room that was fifteen hundred and seventyfive dollars plus tax grabbing kate around the waist she led her into a quick clattering dance were selling things kate that was the idea it had killed her not to be there with laura and margo to open the doors for the first time but responsibility at bittle took priority you own a store you sell things no were really selling them liz carstairs was in and bought the set of tiffany wineglasses for her daughters shower gift and this couple from connecticut bought the gateleg table were shipping it and oh more were not going to be paying that storage bill for the rest of the stock much longer are you logging the sales yeahwell i might have made a couple of mistakes but well fix that come on you can ring something up she paused with a hand on the door its sort of like sex theres this attraction and you build on it then theres foreplay little thrills of anticipation then theres this big bang want a cigarette im dying for one youre really getting into this arent you i had no idea that sales could be so stimulating give it a shot kate glanced at her watch ive only got fortyfive minutes but hey im all for cheap thrills margo snagged her wrist studied the clean lines of the practical timex you know we could get a good price for this control yourself margo she tried but every now and again throughout the day she had to find some quiet corner and simply gloat maybe her emotions were swinging high and wide like a batter too eager to score but she just didnt care if there was a pang now and then when one of her treasured trinkets slipped away in a goldandsilver box there was also a sense of triumph people had come and for every one who snickered there was another who admired and another who bought by three when there was a lull she poured two cups of the tea theyd offered to customers throughout the morning im not hallucinating am i not unless we both are laura winced as she wriggled her toes and my feet hurt too much for this to be a dream margo i think weve actually done it lets not say that yet we could jinx it carrying her cup she walked over to straighten a vase of roses i mean maybe this is just fates way of sneering at us giving us a few hours of success were open for three more hours and the hell with that she whirled around were a hit were a smash i wish youd be more enthusiasticand i wish i could stay and ride the next wave with you wincing laura looked at her watch but the girls have dance class ill wash out the cups before i go no ill take care of them the door opened letting in a group of teenage girls who made a beeline for the jewelry counter we have customers laura murmured and gathered up the cups herself we have customers she repeated grinning ill try to be here tomorrow by one there were so many obligations to juggle and she worried about how long it would be before she started dropping balls are you sure you can handle working the shop by yourself we agreed from the start that youd have to be part time im going to learn how to handle it get going as soon as i wash these she stopped turned margo i dont know the last time i had this much fun nor did she margo thought as she measured her young customers a smile began to bloom teenage girls who wore designer shoes had generous allowancesand parents with gold cards she crossed to the counter took her place behind it hello ladies can i show you something josh didnt mind long hours he could handle being chained to a desk and being buried under paperwork though it wasnt as appealing as zipping across continents to finetune the workings of a busy hotel chain and its subsidiaries he could deal with it cheerfully enough but what really pissed him off was being played for a fool the longer he remained in the penthouse and studied the files generated from the california templetons the more certain he was that peter ridgeway had done just that hed done his job there was no way to accuse him legally of mishandling funds or staff of cutting corners though he had done precisely those things peter had documented it all in terms of his rationale his position and the increase in profit that his alterations had generated but templeton had never been an organization that was motivated exclusively by profit it was a familyowned operation steeped in two hundred years of innkeeping tradition that prided itself on its humanity on its commitment to the people who worked in it and for it yes ridgeway had increased profits but he had done so by changing staff cutting back on fulltime employees in favor of parttime ones and thereby squeezing people out of benefits and slicing their pay stubs hed negotiated a new deal with wholesalers produce distributors and as a result had lowered the quality in the staff kitchens employee discounts in reservations and in templeton hotel boutiques had been cut back reducing the incentive that had always been traditional for templeton people to use templeton services in the meantime his own expense account had increased his bills for meals laundry entertainment flowers travel had steadily grown hed even had the gall to charge his trip to aruba to templeton as a business expense it gave josh great pleasure to cancel peters corporate credit cards even if he did consider it too little too late should have aimed for his balls after all he thought and leaned back to rub his tired eyes it would take months to rebuild trust among the staff a huge bonus and a mountain of flattery would be necessary to lure back the head chef who had quit in a huff at ridgeways interference added to that was the resignation from the longtime concierge at templeton san francisco that hed found buried in peters files there were others as well some could be lured back others were lost to competitors none of them had come to him josh mused or to his parents because theyd believed justifiably that peter ridgeway was a trusted highly placed member of the templeton group he tugged at his tie trying not to think about the amount of work that still lay before him someone was going to have to take over his responsibilities in europe at least temporarily he wasnt going anywhere already the penthouse suite was more his than ridgeways the fussy furniture had been replaced with joshs preference for the traditional american and spanish antiques with deeply cushioned generous chairs were more in keeping with the scheme of templeton monterey after all the hotel and its decor followed the history of the area the resort was more truly of california spanish design but the hotel echoed it in the ornate facade the musical fountains and lush gardens the lobby was done in deep reds and golds offering heavy chairs long high tables winking brass and glossy tiled floors there were potted palms like the one hed chosen for the corner of his office in a huge handthrown clay pot that took two men with beefy arms to lift hed always thought templeton paris more feminine with its mix of the airy and the ornate and templeton london more distinguished so british with its twolevel lobby and cozy tearoom but monterey was perhaps closest to his heart after all not that hed ever pictured himself settling behind a desk here even if it was a duncan phyfe with an eyeblurring view of the coast he loved only a heads turn away it didnt bother him for outsiders to consider him the globetrotting trust fund baby because he knew better the templeton name wasnt simply a legacy it was a responsibility hed worked long and hard to meet that responsibility to learn the craft of not simply owning but managing and expanding a complex organization hed been expected to learn hotels from the ground up and he had done just that by doing so hed developed respect and admiration for the people who worked in the kitchens picked up wet towels from bathroom floors calmed the tired and frazzled incoming guests at the front desks he appreciated the hours that went into public relations and sales and the frustrations of dealing with oversized conventions and harried conventioneers but there was a bottom line and that line was templeton whatever went wrong whatever needed to be fixed smoothed over or polished up was up to him and there was a great deal of fixing smoothing over and polishing up to be done in california he thought about getting up and brewing coffee or just calling down to room service but he didnt have the energy for either hed sent the temp home because shed gotten on his nerves scrambling around like an eager puppy desperate to please if he was going to be stuck behind a desk for the foreseeable future he would need an executive assistant who could match his pace and not go wideeyed with terror every time he gave an order he was going to have to toss the temp back into the pool and go fishing but for now he was on his own he swiveled to his keyboard and began to compose a memo to all department heads with a copy to his parents and the rest of the board of directors it took him thirty minutes to perfect it he faxed a copy with the addition of a personal note to his parents printed out the others and arranged for them to be messengered or overnighted seeing no reason to waste time he set up a full staff meeting at the hotel for eleven am another at the resort at two though it was already after six he contacted legal and left a message on voice mail outlining the urgency of a meeting and setting it up for nine sharp in his penthouse office it was highly probable that ridgeway would sue over his abrupt termination josh wanted his bases covered shifting back to the keyboard he began another memo reinstating the previous employee discounts that he thought was something they would be able to see immediately and hopefully it would build morale standing in the open doorway margo watched him it was a delightful shock to discover that watching him work made her juices flow the loosened tie the hair disarrayed by restless fingers the dark and focused intensity of his eyes had her all but vibrating odd shed never thought of josh talcing work of any kind seriously and she had never realized that a serious man at work could be quite so arousing maybe it was the months of selfimposed celibacy or the heady success of the day maybe it was josh himselfand had been all along she didnt at the moment give a damn shed come here for one thinga good hot sweaty bout of sex she wasnt leaving without it quietly she closed the doors at her back flipped the locks well well she murmured her pulse leaping when his head shot up like a wolf scenting his mate the scion at work quite a picture knowing exactly the kind of picture she madegod knew shed worked on itshe swaggered to his desk after setting a frosty bottle of cristal on the blotter she eased a hip onto the edge am i interrupting his mind had gone blank the moment shed stepped toward him he did his best to snap it back yeah but dont let that stop you he glanced down at the bottle back into her glowing face so how was your day oh nothing worth mentioning she leaned over the desk all but slithered over it and gave him a tantalizing glimpse of pearly lace and cleavage just fifteen thousand dollars in sales she screamed reaching out to tug his hair fifteen thousand six hundred and seventyfour dollars eighteen cents in sales she sprang back off the desk whirled in a giddy circle do you know how i felt the first time i saw my face on the cover of vogue no just like this insane i closed the doors at six and there was half a bottle of champagne left i drank it all myself right from the damn bottle then i realized i didnt want to drink alone open the bottle josh lets get drunk and crazy he rose began to rip the foil he should have known that gleam in her eye had been helped along by bubbly from what youve just said youre already there im only half drunk the cork popped celebrationally this should fix that he went to the kitchen setting the bottle on the counter of granitecolored tile and reaching into a glassfront oak cabinet for glasses thats what you do isnt it fix things you fixed me josh i owe you no that was one thing he didnt want you did it yourself made a start on it im not finished yet she clinked her glass to his but oh its a hell of a start to pretenses then you bet your adorable ass i know it wont be like this every day it cant be fueled with energy she prowled back into the office kate says we can expect sales to dip then level off but i dont care i watched this incredibly ugly woman waltz out with one of my armanis and i just didnt care good for you and i her voice hitched strangled and he set his glass down in pure panic dont do that dont cry im begging you its not what you think dont give me that shit about happy tears theyre all the same to me theyre wet and make me feel like slime i cant get hold of myself as a defense she gulped down more champagne sniffled ive been like this all day dancing on the ceiling one minute bawling in the bathroom the next im selling my life away and it makes me so sad and people are buying it and that makes me so happy jesus frustrated he rubbed his hands over his face lets trade in the champagne for some coffee shall we oh no spurting up again she danced away from him im celebrating okay when she folded he would pour her drunk sexy body into his car and drive her to templeton house but for now she had the right to celebrate to gloat and be ridiculous he sat on the desk picked up his glass again to ugly women in secondhand armani she tossed back the champagne and let it fizz down her throat to teenage girls with rich indulgent parents god love them and tourists from tulsa salt of the earth and hawkeyed old men who appreciate long legs in a short skirt when he only frowned into his glass she laughed and poured them both more and who plunk down cash for meissen tea sets and harmless flirtation before she could drink again he caught her wrist how harmless i let him cluck my chin if hed bought the raku vase he could have pinched any and all of my cheeks its such a rush the clucking no she giggled happily the selling i had no idea id find it so exciting so arousing she spun back sprinkling them both with champagne before he could pluck the glass from her hand and set it safely aside thats why i came to find you you came to find me he repeated too cautious to move forward too needy to move back with a low laugh she slid her hands up his shirt front over his shoulders into his hair i thought you could finish the job she was more than half drunk he calculated and told himself to remember the rules he just couldnt think of them what do you want me to sell she laughed again dragged his mouth to hers for a steamy kiss whatever it is im ready to buy it he came up for air tried for reason youve got champagne on your brain duchess this might not be the time to do business she made quick work of his tie slinging it over her shoulder while her mouth went to war with his its the perfect time i could eat you alive in great big bites jesus it was hard to focus on reason when all the blood was draining out of his head in about ten seconds his mouth clashed with hers again as she dragged his shirt clear of his waistband im not going to give a damn if youre drunk or sober i told you im only half drunk she tossed her head back so that he could see her eyes they were filled with laughter and desire i know exactly what im doing and who im going to do it with what would you say if i suggested we consider that little bet of ours a draw he was busy tugging her buttons free before he realized his hands had moved how about thank you god its probably a mistake she attacked his throat with her teeth a terrible terrible mistake jesus put your hands on me im trying he managed to drag her jacket off while they stumbled toward the bedroom try harder she wriggled out of her shoes tripped and sent them both crashing into the wall when his hands streaked under her skirt hiking it high as they greedily cupped her bottom she arched back dont stop she panted whatever you do dont stop whos stopping desperate he lifted her off her feet so that his mouth could close over her lacecovered breast she moaned once grasping his hair for balance this could ruin our friendship he mumbled his mouth busy with soft hot flesh i dont want to be friends anymore me either she managed as they fell onto the bed shed always thought of sex as one of the quirky bonuses life had to offer with the act itself rarely measuring up to the anticipation there was certainly nothing dignified about two people panting like dogs and groping each other frantically it was if you discounted all the fripperies a laughable if temporarily satisfying experience but shed never made love with josh templeton there was panting plenty of groping even some laughter but she was about to discover that reality could occasionally outdistance anticipation the minute her body was pinned under his it shifted into overdrive she was wild for him wild to feel strong male hands stroke over her to taste the heat and reckless lust of a hungry mouth to hear that animal sound of flesh slapping against flesh the light from the office slanted in cut across the bed so that they rolled from brightness to shadow and back again but there was nothing innocent in the wrestling it was ripe with purpose desperation and edgy greed she could see the dark intensity of his eyes the restless smoke of them focused on hers she could feel the taut muscles of his shoulders under her hands before she tore his shirt aside and reared up to taste when he tugged her skirt impatiently down her hips she thought now thank god now and arched to meet him but he dragged her to her knees and battered her senses with mouth on mouth hot voracious kisses lashed with tongue and teeth the frantic strain of torso against torso with one thin layer of silk between dampening flesh she rocked against him sizzling as those clever hands soothed abraded tormented her skin she thought she might burn from the inside out and fumbled desperately at his waistband then he cupped her fingers streaking under silk plunging inside velvet fire to drive her hard and mercilessly over the edge she came like a geyser release spurting out of her shooting out shock waves that made her nails bite viciously into his back before she could gulp in air he shoved her on her back to devour hed wanted her like thisjust like thismindless and frantic and burning for him hed dreamed of it the way she would move under him the sounds she would make even the scent of her skin as desire shot to quivering need now he had it and even that wasnt enough he wanted to unravel her inch by inch to watch her come apart to hear her scream for him his own needs were brutal unreasonable pumping through his blood like fiery little demons on their way to hell she clutched at him wrapped those glorious long arms and legs around him and slammed him through the wall of his own sanity he yanked her chemise down baring her breasts for ravenous mouth and bruising hands and filled himself with her it was a war now fought with moans and gasps and needs that clashed like swords she rolled slithered tearing at his slacks until with a cry of triumph she wrapped long smooth fingers around him his vision grayed he feared for a moment that he might simply erupt like a novice at that first jolt of pleasure then he focused on her face saw that slow sly smile and was damned if hed let her win i want you inside me she all but purred it even though her pulse was pounding like a wound i want you inside me come inside me dear god he was huge and iron hard and she wanted wanted wanted her smile spread as he lowered his mouth to hers not yet even as she drew breath to curse him he drove her up and over climax slapped into climax like battling tidal waves that left her floundering and gasping for air and as she scrambled frantically toward the next peak he plunged into her fresh outrageous energy blasted through him fired by new unspeakable greed a feral snarl vibrated in his throat as he yanked her hips higher arrowed deeper in response she locked her legs around him arched back like a bow each thrust was like a hammer to the heart battering them both he could no longer see her he desperately wanted to see her face to watch her face as they met and mated but the animal had taken over and it was blind and deaf and insatiable he could see nothing but the red haze that was as much fury as passion then even that vanished as the vicious climax ripped through him and emptied him chapter thirteen she thought shed seen stars of course that had probably been her imagination some latent romantic streak she hadnt been aware of possessing more likely it had been a physical reaction due to near unconsciousness what theyd done margo decided with lazy pleasure had been to nearly fuck each other to death they were sprawled over the bed two casualties of war limp and sweaty and scarred what an intriguing surprise she mused running a hand over her damp torso that josh should have been the most worthy of opponents stirring up the energy to move she turned her head and smiled affectionately at him he was stretched out flat on his stomach facedown he hadnt moved since hed groaned rolled off her and plopped there like a landed trout probably asleep snoring any minute she decided men were so predictable but then she was feeling much too lazy and satisfied to be irked after all she wasnt the kind of woman men cuddled particularly after sex draining them of all signs of life was just one of her little skills she grinned stretched still hed surprised her shed never had a man come so close to making her beg the rough reckless sex had left her feeling very much like a cat with a mouthful of creamdrenched feathers but there had been a few moments thereperhaps more than a fewwhen shed been almost frightened of what he was able to pull out of her good old josh she thought then her gaze skimmed down his long naked body and her pulse went to fast shuffle gorgeous sexy fascinating josh time to move on she told herself before she got wound up for something he wouldnt be able to deliver she sat up gave him a friendly slap on the butt then let out a squealing laugh as his arm snaked out and tumbled her back im finished with you pal she pressed a kiss to his shoulder gotta go uhuh to her surprise he pulled her close shifting until she was curled against him im getting sensation back in my toes again who knows what could be next were lucky we lived through it he nuzzled her hair moving her in new and lovely ways after a brief hesitation she curled an arm over his chest your hearts still pounding thank christ i was afraid it had stopped lazily he stroked a hand up her leg down again margo her eyes were nearly closed it was so sweet to be held to be murmured to hmm you definitely writhed she opened one eye balefully and found him grinning down at her i didnt want to hurt your feelings it seemed so important to you uhhuh not that i was counting he twirled her tumbled hair around his finger but you came five times only five she patted his cheek dont blame yourself ive had a long day he rolled on top of her watched surprise flicker into her eyes oh i can do better think so lips curved she linked her arms around his neck i dare you to try you know the templetons he nipped that curved bottom lip we cant resist a dare when she woke the room was dark and she was alone it surprised her that he was out of bed they hadnt let loose of each other for more than five minutes all night when she glanced over and saw the red glow of the alarm clock she realized she hadnt been asleep much longer than that it was barely after six and the last time theyd collapsed it had been quarter to whatever the press gleefully reported on her exploits shed never actually made love all night before she hadnt believed it was physically possible as she shifted to sit up and every muscle of her body wept she realized it was certainly possible but not necessarily wise because she had to crawl out of bed literally she was grateful not to have an audience josh would surely have made some snide remarkthen jumped her as lowering as it was she was ready to toss in the towel another orgasm might kill her and she was a businesswoman now time to put fun and games aside and get ready to face the day she heard herself moan as she limped across the room a press of a button had the drapes swinging open to admit a dazzling view of the coast the curve of beach the rocky inclines the milky dawn light flowed inand saved her from a painful encounter with a ficus tree planted in a toebruising copper pot there were two of them she noted a little blearyeyed two delicateleaved trees flanking the wide window adding a homey touch to the sheen of the framed elbow chairs done in ivory brocade the high gloss of oak tables reflected back the little pieces of him cuff links loose change keys hed tossed a comb on the bureau she noted beside it stood a bottle of mens cologne and a thick black appointment book she imagined there were womens names and numbers from every time zone around the globe noted in it she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror naked still glowing from the aftermath of good sex well she mused she was here now wasnt she and they werent her gritty eyes popped wide as she noticed the bed reflected behind her how could she have been so involved with josh that she hadnt noticed the bed they had made love throughout the night on a lakesized mattress framed with glinting brass head and footboards subtly curved to embrace jade green sheets but then the elegant simplicity of the jadeandwhite room the shining touches of brass and copper suited templeton the man and the hotel she found one of the plushy white robes the hotel provided in the closet and wrapped it around her the thought of a long hot shower almost made her whimper but curiosity drew her to the door first and she cracked it open josh was wearing nothing but wrinkled slacks that he hadnt bothered to fasten hed opened the shades so the fragile light crept into the room and he held a portable phone to one ear while he paced the room in his bare feet he was speaking french god he was gorgeous she thought not just that wonderful goldtipped hair the long lithe body the elegant surprisingly capable hands it was the way he moved the timbre of his voice that aura of power around him that shed always been too close to see her french was spotty at best so she understood little of what he said it didnt matter it was the way he said it the warm liquid sounds the hand gestures he unconsciously added to emphasize she watched those smoke gray eyes narrowirritation impatiencebefore he rattled off what could have been orders or oaths then he laughed and his voice simply creamed over lovely exotic words suddenly she realized she was holding her breath that she had a hand pressed to her heart like some dreamyeyed teenager over the captain of the football team its just josh she reminded herself and deliberately drew in air firmly dropping her hand to her side it was a matter of pure ego that made her lean provocatively against the door to wait until hed finished ca va simone oui oui oui cest bien ah nous parlerons dans trois heures pausing he listened wandered to the window parce que ils sont les idiots he chuckled non non pas de quoi au revoir simone he clicked the phone off turned toward the desk before he spotted her tumbled blond hair witchy blue eyes and a white robe loosely belted his glands went on full alert a little loose end i left dangling in paris simone watching him margo ran a hand down the soft lapel of the robe tell me is she as intriguing as her name oh more so he walked over slid his hands inside the robe and shes crazy about me pig margo murmured against his mouth and she does whatever i tell her he added walking her backward toward the bed arent you lucky margo shifted jabbed her elbow into his gut when he grunted she slipped out of his arms smoothed her hair i need a shower just for that im not going to tell you shes fiftyeight has four grandchildren and is the associate director of marketing templeton paris she shot a look over her shoulder i didnt ask why dont you order up some breakfast i want to be in the shop by eightthirty he obliged her ordering room service to deliver it in an hour that should give him just enough time he decided as he joined her in the shower she frowned at him when he blocked the best part of the spray its lukewarm he complained its better for the skin and i like privacy when i shower templetons a green company he nudged up the hot water even when she slapped at his hand steam began to rise satisfactorily along the glossy black walls of the stall as vice president its my corporate duty to conserve our natural resources reaching out he worked up the lather in the hair shed just begun to wash the shower was large enough for a party of four she reminded herself there was no reason for her to feel crowded youre just in here because you think you can get lucky again god the woman sees right through me its mortifying when she turned away to finish the job herself he contented himself with washing her back how long does it take to dry all that hair theres miles of it its not the length its the thickness she said absently it was foolish she knew hed already run and rubbed and stroked those hands over every inch of her body but this cleansing ritual was uncomfortably intimate shed spoken no less than the truth she didnt bathe with her lovers she only slept with them in the literal sense when she chose it wasnt just a matter of control though that was part of it it was a matter of maintaining image and illusion now with josh she had not only spent the night with him without intending to but she was sharing the shower with him it was time she decided to lock a few parameters in place she tipped her face under the spray let it stream the suds from her hair when he handed her the soap and turned his back to her she stared blankly your turn he told her her eyes narrowed then lighted with wicked purpose he hissed between his teeth when she slapped lather on his back oh sorry those scratches must sting some hands braced on the tile he looked back at her its all right ive had my shots without realizing it she gentled her strokes it was such a nice back she mused muscled broad at the shoulder tapering to the waist with all that smooth tasty skin between on impulse she pressed a light kiss between his shoulder blades before stepping out of the shower you know josh i was only teasing about simone bending at the waist she turbaned her hair in a towel then reached for another weve both had other relationships and are free to continue to have them were not going to tangle each other up with strings at this point in our lives after securing the towel between her breasts she made do with the complimentary body cream in templetons spiraled bottle on the counter setting a foot on the padded vanity stool she smoothed fragrant lotion onto her legs neither one of us is looking for complications and id hate for us to ruin a simple affair by making promises wed never keep she slicked cream down her other leg humming a little we have an advantage here that most people dont we know each other so well we dont need to play all those games or juggle all the pretenses she flicked a glance toward the shower mildly troubled by his lack of response he could handle the anger that simmered up to his throat that was simply a matter of control but the hurt the little slashing knives that her careless words had dueling in his gut were another matter for those he could have cheerfully murdered her he turned off the water with a snap of his wrist stepped through the double glass doors that separated the shower from the rest of the bath yeah we know each other duchess he said as he flicked a towel from the heated bar she was standing front and center of the eightfootlong bath counter looking perfect in the stark and sophisticated blackandwhite decor her skin glowing from the lotion she still held in one hand inside and out what would two shallow sophisticates like us want with mixing romance with our sex she rubbed her arms despite the billowing steam the room seemed abruptly chilly thats not entirely what i meant youre angry see you do know me okay no strings no games no pretenses he walked over slapped his hands on the counter and caged her but ive got a hard and fast rule of my own i dont share as long as im fucking you no one else is she balled her hands at her sides well thats clear enough and crude enough your call why cloud the issue with euphemisms just because youre angry that i said it first is no reason to there you go seeing right through me again she took a steadying breath theres no reason for either of us to be angry first i dont like to fight before ive had at least one cup of coffee and second i didnt mean that i would stroll out of here and jump into someone elses bed contrary to popular belief i dont juggle men like flaming swords i simply meant that when either of us is ready to move on there wont be any nasty scenes maybe i like nasty scenes im beginning to see that have we finished with this one not quite he caught her by the chin you know duchess this is the only time since you first picked up a mascara wand that ive seen you without makeup with his free hand he tugged the towel off her hair so that it tumbled wet and wild over breasts and shoulders without all that sheen and polish cut it out she tried to jerk her chin free furious that hed reminded her she was without her accustomed shield youre so goddamn beautiful but there was grim purpose rather than admiration in his eyes theyd have burned you at the stake a few hundred years ago theyd never have believed youd gotten that face that body without seducing the devil stop it was that her voice she wondered so weak ready to melt on words she didnt mean her unsteady hands were an instant too late to stop the second towel from sliding to the floor if you think im going to let you let me hell he slipped his hand between her legs and felt her hot and wet and ready you said no pretenses margo so if you tell me you dont want me right now he gripped her hips braced her as he eased slowly inside her if you tell me ill believe you she felt the avalanche of need carrying her under saw by the dark triumph in his eyes that he knew it damn you josh well that makes two of us she skipped breakfast shed simply felt too raw and unsteady to share a civilized meal with him after theyd savaged each other in a steamy bathroom still shed gotten back to the shop changed into a fresh suit and brewed both coffee and tea the coffee she attacked herself drinking half a pot before it was time to open the doors revving on nerves and caffeine she faced her first day alone as a merchant by midday despite several bolstering sales both her spirits and her energy were flagging a night without sleep certainly explained the fatigue and she knew exactly where to point the finger of blame for her sulks right at josh templetons calculating heart she hated the way he had shrugged and bid her an absent goodbye that morning sitting down to his breakfast as if there hadnt been wild sex and angry words between them it hardly mattered that his attitude was exactly what she had outlined that didnt stop her from worrying over the nagging certainty that he was playing some game she hadnt been informed of and he kept shifting the rules to suit himself there had been a cold gleam in his eyes as he glanced up from his coffee she thought and she was sure shed seen a calculating smirk on his mouth before shed shut the door well slammed itbut that was beside the point just what was he up to she knew him well enough to be sure damn it she was beginning to wonder if she knew him at all miss id like to see this pearl choker yes of course it made her feel brisk and efficient to fetch the keys unlock the display spread the gleaming pearls on black velvet theyre lovely arent they beautifully matched a present she remembered from a shipping magnate old enough to be her grandfather shed never slept with him though the press had beat war drums about their affair hed only wanted someone young and attractive to talk to someone to listen while he spoke of the wife hed lost to cancer he had been in the two years she had known him a rare thing in her life a male friend the pearls had been nothing more than a gift from a friend who was pining away from a broken heart and who soon died from it is this clasp eighteenkarat suddenly margo wanted to snatch them back to scream at the woman that she couldnt have them they were hers a reminder of one of the few unselfish and loving things shed ever done in her life yes she forced herself to speak through a smile so stiff it ached italian its stamped would you like to try them on she did and hemmed hawed preened and stroked in the end she handed them back with a shake of her head margo locked the pearls into the display like a guilty secret tourists came in poking through the treasures carelessly clanking porcelain against glass china against wood margo lost three potential customers when she testily informed them not to handle the merchandise unless they were prepared to buy it that cleared the shop long enough for her to run upstairs and pump some aspirin into her system on her way down again she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror her face was set and angry her eyes deadly she felt her stomach jitter with repressed temper want to scare all the customers away margo she closed her eyes breathed deep visualized a cool white screen it was a technique shed often used in modeling when a session had dragged on with hairstylist and makeup artist poking photographer waiting assistants whining all she had to do was go away for a minute remind herself that she could and would fill the blank screen with whatever image they wanted calmer she opened her eyes watched her face smooth out if her head still throbbed no one had to know but herself she walked downstairs ready to greet the next customer she was delighted when judy prentice dropped in bringing a friend with her she poured them tea then excused herself to show another customer into a fitting room at two she opened the first bottle of complimentary champagne and wondered what was keeping laura by twothirty she was feeling frazzled struggling with the gift wrap she was afraid she would never get the hang of and candy breezed in oh what an adorable little shop she clapped her pretty hands together and bounced over to the counter where margo was sweating over a tape dispenser im so sorry i couldnt make it by for your opening margo i just couldnt squeeze it into my day but i made a special point of coming by today particularly since the shop and its owners had been the hot topic at brunch im just going to poke around but dont you worry ill be sure to buy something isnt this fun she said to the woman waiting for the package just like a big yard sale oh what a nice little bowl she danced over running her fingers over the frosted glass looking for chips the price is a little high for secondhand still holding the bowl she turned a sharpedged smile on margo i suppose you inflate it to give your customers room to bargain keep cool margo warned herself candy was just trying to get her goat the same way she had in high school we consider our merchandise priced to sell well with a careless shrug candy set the bowl down i suppose i dont know very much about cost i just know what i like she eyed a pair of enameled candlesticks these are unusual arent they you have lovely things the waiting customer commented as margo slipped the wrapped box into a bag thank you margo shuffled through her tired mind for the name on the credit slip thank you very much mrs pendleton please come again i certainly will she accepted the bag hesitated do you mind if i say i only came in today because ive seen your photograph so many times i spend a lot of time in europe la margos face is everywhere was everywhere no i dont mind i switched to the bella donna line of skincare products primarily because of your advertisements she winced before she could prevent herself i hope youre satisfied with the products its an excellent line as i said i came in because i wanted to see you in person ill come back because you have beautiful things imaginatively presented she slid the bag onto her arm as she stepped back from the counter i think youre a very brave and adventurous woman mrs pendleton flicked a glance toward candy who was frowning over a paperweight and an admirable one she leaned back over the counter her eyes dancing make sure that one doesnt stick something in that chanel bag of hers she looks shifty chuckling margo waved her now favorite customer off and walked over to deal with candy champagne oh such a clever idea i imagine the offer of free drinks lures in a certain type of clientele just a tiny glass how are you managing darling well enough i was just admiring your jewelry coveting it it must be heartbreaking for you to have to sell it my hearts cold steel candy remember when it comes to men candy said breezily and turned to the jewelry case but diamonds i wouldnt think so what did you have to do for those earrings things better not spoken of in polite company would you like to see them considering your last divorce settlement theyre within your price range unless of course dumping a husband doesnt earn a woman what it used to dont be snide margo youre the one peddling your wares and no im not interested in secondhand jewelry in fact im having a hard time finding anything i can use at all your taste is more lets say emancipated than mine not enough gold leaf ill be sure to keep your taste in mind when we restock youre actually planning on keeping this place running she sipped her champagne and giggled margo thats so sweet everyone knows you never finish anything a few of us were having a wonderful time over brunch at the club speculating on how long youd last the customer margo thought was not always right candy do you remember that time all your clothes were stolen from gym class and you were shoved into a locker and stayed trapped in there until mr hansen from maintenance sawed off the lock and got you out naked and hysterical you not mr hansen candys eyes narrowed to lethal slits you i knew it was you but i couldnt prove it actually it was kate because i lost the draw but it was my idea except for calling mr hansen that was lauras now would you like to leave quietly or should i knock you down rip off that laura ashley blousewhich doesnt suit you by the wayand send you out of here naked and hysterical to think i actually felt sorry for you no you didnt margo corrected nipping the flute out of candys hand before it could be hurled youre nothing but a secondrate slut who spent all her life begging for scraps and pretending to be something she never could be candy spat out funny most people consider me a firstrate slut now get the hell out of here before i stop pretending to be what im not and rip off the nose your parents bought you when you were twelve candy shrieked curled her fingers into talons she might have leaped but the sound of the door opening stopped her from making a public display one brow lifted laura assessed the scene hello candy youre looking healthy sorry im late margo but i brought you a present candy whirled intending to give laura a taste of the temper both of her exhusbands could attest to but laura wasnt alone candy shuddered back the venom and beamed a delighted smile mr and mrs templetonhow wonderful to see you both ah candace lichfield isnt it said susan templeton knowing full well margo easily ignoring candys outstretched hand susan glided into margos open arms she kissed both of margos cheeks lavishly then winked we didnt even take time to unpack we just couldnt wait to see you ive missed you she clung hard enveloped by the familiar scent of chanel oh ive missed you you look wonderful beautiful doesnt give me the time of day thomas templeton complained giving his daughters shoulder a quick squeeze he nodded absently to candy as she stalked out then grinned as margo raced across the room she bounded into his arms now thats more like it im so glad to see you im so glad youre here oh im so sorry and she buried her face in his shoulder and wept like a child chapter fourteen better mmm leaning over the sink in the upstairs bath margo splashed water on her face i guess ive been a little on edge nothing like a good cry to smooth out those edges susan offered her a fingertip towel and a quick supportive rub on the shoulder and you always cried well poor mr t as much for comfort as to dry her skin margo buried her face in the towel what a greeting two seconds and im blubbering all over his shoulder he loves having his girls blubber on him it makes him feel strong now susan put her ringstudded hands on margos shoulders turned her around lets have a look she pursed her pretty mouth narrowed her pale blue eyes a little blush a couple coats of mascara and youll do do you have your arsenal up here in answer margo opened the mirror cabinet over the sink inside were neatly arranged bottles and tubes emergency kit thats my girl still using bella donna she commented when margo took out a small tube i threw mine out oh mrs t they made me mad susan jerked an athletic shoulder she was a small woman delicateboned and slim like her daughter she kept in shape in her own style she skied like a demon played a vicious game of tennis and swam laps as though competing in the olympics to fit her lifestyle her sablecolored hair was cut short and sleek to cap a bright interesting face that she cared for religiously i screwed up margo reminded her which was hardly enough cause to dump you as the bella donna woman which is an irritatingly redundant title in the first place all in all youre better off without them margo smiled into the mirror smoothed on a light base i really have missed you what id like to know is why you didnt contact tommy and me the minute you found out you were in trouble with her hands on her hips susan strode to the tub then back to the sink it was weeks before we heard a thing the photographic safari kept us out of touch but josh and laura knew how to reach us i was ashamed she couldnt explain why she could admit it so easily to susan she just could id made such bad choices i was having a seedy affair with a married man i let him use me no worsei was too stupid to realize he was using me i ruined my career destroyed what little reputation i had and nearly bankrupted myself in the process well susan angled her head thats quite an accom plishment how busy you must have been to do all that by yourself i did do it myself she chose taupe shadow to accent her eyes brushing it on with a deft and practiced hand this man you were involved with had nothing to do with it i suppose did you love him i wanted to even that was easier to admit now i wanted to have someone to find someone i could build a life with the kind of life i thought i wanted fun games and no responsibilities and thats past tense it is has to be margo carefully darkened her eyebrows naturally i chose someone completely inappropriate someone who could never offer me permanence thats my system mrs t susan waited a moment watching as margo dashed on eyeliner and mascara with the skill of a master do you know whats always worried me about you margo your selfesteem mum always said i thought too much of myself no on that annie and i have always disagreed and we disagreed rarely your selfworth is too tied up in your looks you were a beautiful child dazzlingly beautiful life is different for children with dazzling looks more difficult in some ways because people tend to judge them by their beauty and then they begin to judge themselves by that same standard it was my only skill kate had the brains laura had the heart it makes me sad that you believe that and that too many people pointed you in that direction you were never one of them she replaced the makeup carefully as a master carpenter would store his tools im trying to go in a new direction now mrs t well then slipping a bolstering arm around margos waist susan led her back into the boudoir youre young enough to take a dozen different directions and smart enough youve wasted your brains for a while made foolish mistakes and poorly considered choices ow with a sheepish smile margo rubbed her heart youve always been able to sneak those jabs in i havent finished youve worried and disappointed your mother a woman ill add who deserves not only your love and respect but your admiration there arent many who at the tender age of twentythree and still grieving could leave behind everything familiar and cross an ocean with a small child to build a new life but thats not the point susan waved that away and nudged margo onto the edge of the bed you squandered your money and danced your way to the edge of a very high and dangerous cliff but she lifted margos chin with a finger you didnt jump unlike our little seraphina you stepped back you squared your shoulders and you showed you were willing to face what life had dealt you that takes more courage margomuch morethan leaping into the void i had people to turn to so do we all its only fools and egotists who think no one will be there to lend a hand and bigger fools and bigger egotists who dont reach out she held out a hand without hesitation margo took it then pressed it to her cheek better laura asked in an echo of her mother as she came to the door it took only an instant to survey the scene and feel relief much after a long breath margo rose smoothed down her skirt sorry to leave you in the lurch down there no problem actually dads having the time of his life hes made three sales and the way hes charming minn whiley right now i think we can count on four minns downstairs amused susan flicked her fingers through her boyish hair ill go add my charm shell walk out loaded down with bags and wont know what hit her she paused at the doorway to rub a hand over lauras back you girls have a lovely place here youve made a good choice were worrying her laura murmured when her mothers greeting to minn floated upstairs you and i i know well just have to show her how tough we are we are tough arent we laura oh sure you bet the disgraced celebrity and the betrayed trophy wife temper snapped into margos eyes youre nobodys trophy not anymore now before i forgetwhy was candy looking at me as if she was hoping to grind up my liver for pate ah remembering the scene put a sneaky smile on her face i had to tell her whose idea it was to call mr hansen when she was trapped naked in her locker laura closed her eyes tried not to think of the next meeting of the garden club she and candy were cochairs had to tell her really had to margo smiled winningly she called you poor laura twice laura opened her eyes again set her teeth i see i wonder how difficult it would be to stuff her bony butt into a locker at the club for tough babes like you and me a snap ill think about it automatically she checked her watch her life now ran on packets of time meanwhile were having a family dinner tonight a real one this time kates meeting us at the house and i left a message for josh ah josh as they started for the stairs margo linked her fingers together pulled them apart wished desperately for a cigarette theres probably something i should tell you mmmhmm look margo chuckling she leaned on the rail dads playing with the cash register and mamas packing boxes arent they wonderful the best how could she tell laura shed spent the night ripping up the sheets at templeton monterey with her brother better left alone she decided in any case the way they had parted it was unlikely to happen again what did you want to tell me um only that i sold your beaded white sheath good i never liked it anyway margo felt shed made the right decision when josh arrived at templeton house he joined the family in the solarium exchanged warm embraces with both his parents then helped himself from the hors doeuvres tray he entertained his nieces argued with kate over some esoteric point of tax law and fetched mineral water for laura as for the woman with whom hed spent the night committing acts that were still illegal in some states he treated her with the absent vaguely infuriating affection older brothers reserved for their pesky younger siblings she thought about stabbing him in the throat with a shrimp fork she restrained herself even when she was plunked down between him and kate at the glossy mahogany table at dinner it was after all a celebration she reminded herself a reunion even ann who considered it a breach of etiquette for servants to sit at the family table had been cajoled into joining in mr ts doing margo thought no one particularly if it was a female could say no to him surely part of joshs problem was that he resembled his father so closely thomas templeton was as tall and lean as hed been in his youth the man margo had frankly adored for twentyfive years had aged magnificently the lines that unfairly made a woman look worn added class and appeal as they crinkled around his smoky gray eyes his hair was still thick and full with the added dash of glints of silver brushed through the bronze he had she knew a smile that could charm the petals off a rose and when roused a flinty unblinking stare that chilled to the bone he used both to run his business and his family and with them he incited devotion unswerving love and just a little healthy fear it was rumored that he had cut a wide successful and memorable swath through the ladies in his youth romancing seducing and conquering at will until thirty when hed been introduced to a young susan conway she had in her own words hunted him down like a dog and bagged him margo smiled listening to him build stories for his goggleeyed granddaughters of herds of elephants and prides of lions we have the lion king video granddaddy kayla toyed with her brussels sprouts hoping a miracle would make them disappear youve watched it a zillion times ali said tossing her hair back in the way shed seen margo do well well have to make it a zillion and one wont we thomas winked at kayla well have ourselves a moviethon whats your favorite video ali she likes to watch kissy movies striking back kayla pursed her lips and made smacking noises she wants brandon reno to kiss her on the mouth i do not mortified ali flushed scarlet it proved there was no secret safe with a little sister youre just a baby she dug for her deepest insult a baby pigface allison dont call your sister names laura said wearily her two little angels had been sniping at each other for weeks oh and she can say whatever she wants just because shes the baby i am not a baby i thought you were my baby thomas sighed sadly i thought you were both my babies but i guess if youre all grown up and dont need me anymore ill be your baby granddaddy eyes wide and sincere kayla gazed up at him then she saw to her delight that a miracle had happened the dreaded brussels sprouts were gone from her plate theyd made the leap to his love swarmed through her ill always be your baby well im not a baby far from ready to surrender ali jutted out her chin but her lip was quivering no i suppose youre not laura cocked a brow at her daughters mutinous face and since youre not you wont fight with your sister at the table oh i dont know margo picked up her wineglass the fairy light of crystal chandeliers and flickering candlelight shot through it in red and gold glints i always fought with kate at the table and you usually started it kate added forking up a bite of lamb you always started it no i always finished it kate peered around josh to grin you always got sent to your room only because mum felt sorry for you you were so outgunned outgunned my butt when it came to a verbal showdown you were always playing with blanks even when i was alis age i could isnt it nice to be home tommy susan lifted her glass in a toast its so comforting to see that no matter how life goes on little changes annie dear how are you managing all our girls without me its a trial mrs t now my ma she kept a switch in the kitchen a good hickory switch war forgotten ali gaped at ann your mother hit you with a stick once or twice she did indeed and sitting down after was a punishment itself mostly just seeing it there on the peg by the door was enough to keep a civil tongue in your head your weapon of choice was a wooden spoon remembering margo shifted in her seat a fine deterrent it was to a sassy mouth too you walloped me once with it annie remember it was josh who spoke really intrigued susan studied her son i never heard about that josh sampled his wine and watched ann squirm out of the corner of his eye oh annie and i decided it would be our little secret and so it has been annie muttered until now she cleared her throat dropped her hands into her lap i beg your pardon mrs t it was hardly my place to spank the boy what nonsense intrigued susan leaned forward i want to know what he did to deserve it i might have been innocent josh objected to which his mother merely snorted you never had an innocent day in your life what did he do annie hed been hounding me even after all the years that had passed ann could remember the insistence in his voice the demon in his eye i tell you the truth ive never known a child so tenacious as master josh he could devil you beyonddeath and thats the truth persistence he grinned at annie then glanced at his father its a trait of the templeton males right dad and plenty the times i earned a warm rear end because of it thomas agreed id love to hear about joshs margo tipped back her glass sent him a smoldering look in fact im dying to how many whacks did you give him mum i didnt count it was i did five in rapid and shocking succession he met margos look sneer for sneer i still say it was margos fault mine oh thats so typical he was teasing you unmercifully ann put in and picking on miss laura and as miss kate had just come to us he had a new target there he was twelve i believe and acting like a bully it was just high spirits josh claimed and i still say margo four years your junior ann said in a tone that made him feel twelve again and you who should have known better daring her and the other girls to clamber down those cliffs looking for that foolish treasure chest calling them names too and going out there after id told you to stay in the yard with them for one blessed hour one blessed hour she repeated shrinking him with a look so i could finish the ironing in some peace but off you went and if i hadnt caught sight of you the lot of you might have dashed yourselves on the rocks oh that time margo smiled id like to know how that was my fault josh cleared his throat because his tie suddenly felt too tight annie he realized hadnt lost her touch you said you knew where it was that youd seen it and even had a gold doubloon so she shrugged i lied which would have earned you a swat if id known that part of it satisfied josh poured more wine see took it like a man did you thomas reached over to slap his son on the back and didnt drag a ladys name into it he yelped like a scalded dog anns dry comment brought a burst of laughter around the table but it hurting me more than him was never truer i was sure i would be fired on the spot and rightfully so for spanking the masters son id have given you a raise susan said easily nothing like a mothers love josh muttered well he came up to me about an hour later seemed he had thought it through well enough now the look ann sent josh was full of warmth he apologized as neat as you please then asked if we couldnt keep the matter between us smart boy thomas slapped him on the back again later when laura was up putting the children to bed they lounged in the parlor it was margo realized moments like this rooms like this that had spurred her quest for more soft rich lights from jewelhued lamps bathed the glossy walls played over the dark windows where drapes had been left open wide the faded colors in the oriental rugs seemed to highlight the gleam of the wideplanked chestnut floors a perfect room in a perfect house she thought with the old heirloom furniture more a statement of permanence than wealth fresh flowers lovingly arranged by her mothers hands speared out of china and crystal terrace doors flung open welcomed a quiet fragrant night with just the right touch of moonlight it was a room that breathed elegance and warmth and welcome and she understood now that when she had run from it to make her own she had focused only on the elegance warmth and welcome had been neglected for too long josh sat at the baby grand improvising blues with kate lazy bloodstirring music she mused that suited him he didnt play often margo had nearly forgotten how clever he was with the keys she wished it didnt remind her how clever those hands had been last night she wished that hearing the companionable way he and kate laughed together seeing the intimate way their heads bent close didnt shoot a burning blast of jealousy through her blood ridiculous reaction she told herself kneejerk which certainly suited the occasion as hed been a complete and utter jerk all evening but he wasnt going to spoil it for her she decided she was going to enjoy her time with the templetons her evening in the house shed always loved and the hell with him couldnt he at least look at her when she was despising him she was too wrapped up in her own foul thoughts to notice the tacit look that passed between the templetons with a nod susan rose she would go upstairs corner laura and find out exactly how her daughter was feeling thomas poured a brandy lighted the single cigar his wife now allowed him per day and sat on the curved settee catching margos eye he patted the cushion beside him arent you afraid ill start bawling again ive got a fresh handkerchief she did sit brushed her fingers over the edge of white in his top pocket irish linen mum tricked me into learning to iron with your handkerchiefs they always felt so soft and smelled so good when they came out of the wash i never see irish linen without remembering standing at the ironing board in the laundry room pressing your handkerchiefs into perfect white squares ironings becoming a lost art it would have been lost years ago if men had had to do it he laughed and patted her knee now tell me about this business youre running shed known he would ask known shed fumble for an explanation kate could give you a better more organized rundown ill get the fine print and bottom line from our kate i want to know what youre looking to get out of it a living i let the one i had get away you fucked up girl no use prettying it up or moping over it what are you doing now it was one of the reasons she loved him no sentimentalizing over mistakes trying to make people buy what i want to sell i collected a lot of things over the years it was one of the things i did best you know mr t i realized when i was packing up that i might not have deliberately surrounded myself with the interesting or the potentially valuable but thats what i did i think i have an eye for buying i wont argue with that you always had a sense of quality even when i didnt have any other kind of sense i tossed my money away on things and now ive found a way that i dont have to be sorry about it buying the building instead of renting was a risk i know if it hadnt been a good investment kate wouldnt have let you do it and she damn well wouldnt have anted up her own money including repair remodeling and startup six hundred and thirtyseven dollars a square foot kate said over her shoulder and some loose change a good price thomas puffed on his cigar who did the renovations barkley and sons handled the carpentry and subcontracted out the plumbing and wiring margo took his snifter for a sip i did most of the painting myself did you now he grinned around his cigar advertising im using my checkered past to get print space with interviews some television kates going to try to squeeze out time to look things over and see if we can budget in advertising money and how are you going to replace your stock looking forward made her nervous but margo answered briskly ill have to try auctions and estate sales i thought i could contact some of the models and designers i know negotiate to buy used clothes that way but ill have to expand from that because weve already gotten a lot of requests for larger sizes she scooted around on the settee curled her legs under her if anyone would understand the thrill of business dealings it would be mr t i know weve only been open for two days but i really think we can make it work no one else has anything like it she forgot to be worried and her voice began to bubble with excitement at least i dont know of any shop that offers secondhand designer clothes along with fashion and fine jewelry furniture glassware antiques dont forget kitchen appliances and art josh put in my cappuccino maker isnt for sale she shot back and neither are my paintings but the restshe shifted back to thomashell id sell my underwear for the right price you are selling your underwear kate reminded her pegnoirs margo corrected negligees laura has already added to the stock of course kate wont part with a bedroom slipper im still wearing them but were drawing people in and a lot of them are buying and youre happy i dont know about happy yet but im determined margo he patted her knee in business thats the same thing why dont you have a display set up in the hotel lobby i we have half a dozen up for boutiques and jewelry stores gift shops why dont we have one from our own girls he jabbed the air with his cigar spilling ashes that margo automatically brushed from his knee josh id have expected you to take care of that templeton takes care of its own and it has a policy of supporting small businesses ive already arranged it josh continued to noodle out boogiewoogie lauras going to select the pieces for the hotel and for another display at the resort margo opened her mouth then set her teeth you might have mentioned it to me i might have he shot a look over his shoulder his fingers never faltering i didnt laura knows what works best for templeton clientele oh and i wouldnt know anything about that here she goes kate murmured i know as much as you do about templeton clientele margo fumed unfolding her legs to get to her feet damn it ive been templeton clientele and if youre interested in displaying merchandise from pretenses then you talk to me fine he stopped playing to glance at his watch ive got a tennis match with mom at seven ive set up the board meeting for ninethirty does that suit you well enough thomas settled back with his brandy well meet at eightfortyfive to discuss those other matters beforehand good josh flicked his eyes back to margo annies got your bag packed by now why dont you go up and get it my bag she found herself teetering between unfinished temper and bafflement why do i need a bag so you wont have to rush back to the shop to change every morning it makes more sense to have your clothes where you sleep her cheeks flushed not from embarrassment but from fury i sleep here or at the shop not anymore he walked over took her hand in a firm grip margos staying with me at the hotel for the time being look you jerk just because i made the regrettable mistake of sleeping with you once neither of us got any sleep he reminded her but well have to tonight ive got a full day coming up lets get going oh ill go all right her toes bumped into his ill be delighted to go with you so i can have the time and the privacy to tell you exactly what i think of you appreciating good timing kate waited until the door had closed behind them before she swiveled on the piano bench okay uncle tommy which one is going to be found in the morning in a pool of their own blood and which one will be holding the blunt instrument my moneys on margo she decided shes vicious when shes cornered he sighed trying to compute the new development have to go with my boy katie girl never known him to lose a fight unless he wanted to chapter fifteen she didnt speak on the drive to the hotel she had a great deal to say but she was saving it up when he carried her garment bag into the bedroom and hung it in the closet she pounced if youre laboring under some egotistical delusion that i came here to have sex with you not tonight honey he loosened his tie im beat the only sound she could make was a strangled growl in her throat as she used both hands to shove him back okay okay if you insist but i wont be at my best dont you put your hands on me dont even think about it because her feet were tired she pulled off her shoes she kept one handy as a weapon tapping it restlessly against her palm as she paced it wasnt bad enough that you told your family id been with you last night you had the nerve to tell my mother to pack my clothes i asked her josh corrected hanging his jacket over the valet i asked if she would mind putting what she thought youd need for a day or two in a bag until you had a chance to take care of the rest yourself and that makes it all right because you said please and thank you which is certainly more than you said to me he flicked open the buttons of his shirt worked out kinks in his shoulders i have no intention of sneaking around the way you did with your last choice of bedmates duchess if were sleeping together we do it metaphorically speaking in the open his shoes went next then socks while she fumbled through her mind for the right retort i havent decided if im going to sleep with you again his gaze flicked up to her face filled with both amusement and challenge well you should have said so it was her good luck that he was sitting on the edge of the bed so much easier to look down her nose at him i didnt care for the way you behaved before i left here this morning that makes us even he rose unhooked his trousers and walked into the bath to turn on the water in the oversized whirlpool tub now that weve settled that lets stop playing the games you claimed we werent going to play we havent finished with each other yet off went his briefs on went the jets now i want to work out some kinks before i go to bed youre welcome to join me you think im just going to pop into the tub with you after you spent most of the evening ignoring me men never ignored her she fumed never he was going to pay for that if for nothing else and the way you were flirting with kate kate genuinely surprised he blinked at her jesus margo kates my sister no more than i am unsure whether he was amused or just plain tired he stepped down into the tub lowered himself and let the hot bubbling water do its job youre right shes not lets put it this way ive always thought of kate as my sister his eyes rested on hers before he laid his head back and sank down i never thought of you that way but if youre jealous he trailed off with a shrug im not jealous the very idea was appalling to the pride id have to give two good damns to be jealous im making a statement will you open your eyes and pay attention to me im paying attention im too damn tired to open my eyes christ for someone who couldnt wait to throw down warning flags about not getting too serious not tangling each other up with strings youre acting more like a nagging wife than a casual lover i am not nagging then she closed her mouth afraid she might have been close to doing so and im certainly not acting like a wife from what ive observed about wives any one of them worth her salt would have booted you out on your pointy head by now he merely smiled dipped down a little lower its my penthouse baby if anyone gets booted out on anything pointy itll be you her hand clamped down on his head from the advantage of surprise and leverage she managed to hold him under the churning water for ten glorious seconds it was even worth the water splashing out on her white linen suit when he surfaced sputtering i believe ill get my bag and check into another room he caught her wrist hard threw her off balance enough that she had to stoop down to brace on the ledge of the tub their eyes met locked you wouldnt she stopped herself before uttering the d word but already implied it was too late he yanked her into the tub and as she hissed and spat like a cat wrapped his arms around her and shoved her under he contemplated the ceiling for a few seconds as she kicked hummed a few seconds more as she thrashed then pulled her up by the hair you bastard you goddamn whoops not done yet he cheerfully dunked her again the tub was big enough for four which was handy because she was slippery and he needed room to maneuver by the time she was gasping and trying to drag her sopping hair out of her eyes hed already dealt with her jacket he was working on removing the clinging wet blouse what the hell do you think youre doing im getting you naked he flicked open the front hook of her bra im not feeling tired anymore eyes narrowed she shifted quickly so that her knee was pressed dangerously close to his crotch do you have some sort of incredibly lame essentially male idea that being manhandled arouses me it was a tricky one he thought yeahin a manner of speaking she increased the pressure whose manner of speaking ah he took a chance reached out to rub his thumb gently over her nipple it was pebble hard i might have resisted if you hadnt dared me the pressure eased off slightly and he figured it was safe to breathe again i want you to stay with me margo his voice was soft now barely a murmur as he stroked a hand up her leg if youd rather book another room until youve thought about it thats fine if youre not in the mood for sex thats fine too for a moment she simply studied him all innocence she mused except for that wicked glint in his eye all patient reasonexcept for the challenging quirk at the corner of his mouth who said i wasnt in the mood she pushed back her dripping hair slanted him that killer look under her lashes are you going to help me out of the rest of these wet clothes or do i have to do it myself oh allow me it was an interesting experience living with a man shed never done so before because she hadnt been willing to share her space or privacy with anyone for longer than a weekend trip to the mountains a jaunt to the seaside or perhaps an extended cruise but it worked well enough with josh perhaps she supposed because they had lived under the same roof for years and because the one that currently covered their heads was a hotel it made it all seem less structured more like an arrangement than a commitment they merely shared rooms she thought business rooms at that the flowers were freshened the furniture polished the towels replaced by staff rarely seen that kept it impersonal almost like an extended holiday fun and games she decided was exactly what she and josh wanted and expected from each other no one in the family questioned her new accommodations after days stretched into a week then two she began to wonder why they didnt her mother at least should have been outraged or tightlipped but she seemed completely unconcerned neither of the templetons so much as lifted an eyebrow and though she caught laura watching her with a worried frown now and then laura also said nothing it was kate who made the single pithy comment break his heart and ill break your neck she said and it was such a ridiculous statement that margo had chosen to ignore it rather than rise to the bait she had too much to do to worry about kates snippy temperament echoes of the nastiness that candy was spreading bounced back to herthe merchandise at pretenses was inelegant and overpriced the service lax rude and inexperienced laura had overextended herself to bail out her reckless undeserving friend and they would be bankrupt within the month the clothing was gray market knockoffs fashioned from inferior materials brooding over candys vindictiveness and the inevitable fallout ate into margos time the shop took up at least ten hours a day six days a week on the one day she closed it she struggled with paperwork until she was crosseyed from trying to learn the fine points of bookkeeping though she had resented every minute shed been forced to sit in a classroom she now considered signing up for a course on business management there she was on a balmy sunday morning a cigarette burning in the ashtray beside her pecking at the keys of the computerthe desktop kate had insisted they couldnt live withoutand struggling to make sense out of a spreadsheet why were there so many bills she wondered there were more eating away at her pockets than there had been when she was unemployed how was anyone supposed to remember how and when and whom to pay and stay sane life had been so much simpler when shed had a manager seeing to all the irritating financial details of life and look where that got you margo she muttered concentrate take charge i told you it was serious at the sound of the voice margo shrieked and jerked back in the chair the computer manual on her lap went flying i see what you mean kate agreed i only hope were not too late why dont you just shoot me next time margo crossed her hands over her breasts and pressed to keep her heart in place what the hell are you doing here rescuing you laura darted over in time to catch the cigarette before it finished rolling to the floor and igniting the papers spread around margos chair she tapped it out neatly talking to yourself drinking alone its coffee closed up in your little room counting your money like silas marner laura finished im not counting my moneythough i have been able to pay off another five thousand despite candy litchfields plot to see me dragged off in chainsim shell start gibbering any minute kate put in told you we should have brought the nets such wit margo grabbed her cigarettes lighted a fresh one since youre so bright and sharp explain all this insurance to me again how come we have to pay thesewhat are they premiums kate said dryly theyre called premiums margo i think they should be called extortion i mean look at this theres fire and theft theres mortgage insurance title insurance earthquake insurance comprehensivewhatever that means because its incomprehensible to me and this umbrella is that some cute insurancespeak for flood protection oh yeah thats it kate rolled her eyes insurance companies are filled with jokers those boys are a laugh a minute youll see that for yourself the first time you file a claim look smartass if youd just explain how it works again no no im begging you laura grabbed kates shoulders please dont explain how it works again and dont get into the thing again the thing kate repeated you know the thing yeah the thing shifting in her chair margo jabbed at the air with her cigarette id like to talk about the thing actually oh that thing kate sniffed at margos coffee decided it was probably palatable and picked up the cup okay heres the thing estimated tax payments are split into quarters she broke off staring blandly at laura thats a very good scream i see where kayla gets it with a sigh she leaned over and to margos distress and envy batted a few keys and had the screen blinking off there all gone feel better now much laura shuddered but it was close well the two of you are in a rare mood margo snatched her coffee back from kate now run along and play some of us have work to do its worse than i thought laura heaved a sigh okay sullivan come quietly or well have to get tough its for your own good margo wasnt sure whether to laugh or call for help when they flanked her and took her arms hey whats the idea shock therapy kate said grimly an hour later margo was naked and sweating lying on her back she let out a long heartfelt moan oh god god god just roll with it sympathetically laura patted her hand itll be better soon mum is that you with a chuckle laura leaned back steam billowed in clouds and drained some of her own tension away maybe shed come up with the idea of a day in the spa facilities of the resort for margos sake but it wasnt doing her any harm either how do you all just lie here like this from her perch on the secondlevel bench kate rolled over stared down at margo i mean are we really having fun i could weep margo murmured id forgotten actually forgotten what it was like she reached out to pat lauras naked knee my life for you im getting a facial and a fango and a pedicure you know honey youre staying right at the hotel the facilities there arent as extensive as here but you could use the sauna get a massage and they give very good facials in the beauty salon shes too busy boffing josh laura winced do you mind thats an image id just as soon not have in my head i kinda like it kate peeked over the edge its like something on the discovery channel two sleek golden animals mating when laura moaned kates grin widened so is he good or what like on a scale of one to ten were out of high school i dont rate men margo said primly and rolled onto her stomach twelve she muttered maybe fourteen really the idea perked kate up good old josh our josh my josh margo nearly said it before she caught herself ignore the idiot in the balcony she told laura does it really bother you josh and me not bother uncomfortable laura shifted its just weird my brother and one of my closest friends and sex its just weird its none of my business shes worried youll toss him out like an old ferragamo pump when youre done with him shut up kate and i dont throw my shoes out anymore i sell them laura josh and i understand each other i promise you i wonder if you do laura murmured and whatever else might have been said was interrupted as the door to the steam room opened look whos here kate said brightly its candy cane because her teeth threatened to grind together she set them in a feral smile wont this just be cozy with her turbaned head erect candy sat down on the bench opposite laura the three of you still travel in a pack i see like rabid dogs kate agreed and since youre the one whos been trying to steal our bone be careful we dont bite i have no idea what youre talking about inferior overpriced merchandise my ass kate shot out youd better watch your mouth candy before you find yourself in the middle of a slander suit expressing an opinion isnt slander shed checked with her second husband the lawyer to be sure its a matter of taste proud of the body her first husband the plastic surgeon had helped create candy spread her towel open one might have thought you had more laura but apparently bloodlines and breeding arent always enough to ensure taste in companions you know i was just thinking that margo sat up both of your exes had such sterling pedigrees go figure with some dignity candy crossed her naked legs i wanted to speak to you laura about the garden club under the circumstances i think it would be best if you resigned as cochair when laura only lifted a brow candy dabbed at her throat with the edge of her towel theres gossip brewing about you and peter about your association with she skimmed her eyes over margo certain unsuitable elements im an unsuitable element margo told kate thats nothing im an undesirable element arent i candy you are simply detestable see grinning kate leaned over staring into margos upturned face im detestable its because im the poor and distant relation the powells were a questionable offshoot of the templetons you know id heard that and im an accountant kate went on which is much worse than a shopkeeper we actually talk about money thats enough laura said quietly you want the chair to yourself candy its all yours she only regretted she wasnt able to break it over candys empty head thatll give me more time to associate with unsuitable and undesirable elements the easy capitulation was disappointing candy had so hoped for a fight and how is peter enjoying hawaii she said with a sneer i heard he took that clever little secretary of his with him this time though now that i think of it they did take several business trips before it must be devastating to find yourself replaced by an employee of your own company shes quite young too isnt she candy likes them young kate said as fury bubbled through her how old is the pool boy youre bumping candy sixteen hes twenty she snapped then seethed at the way she had stepped into the trap at least i can get a man but then you dont want a man do you kate everyone knows youre a lesbian margo snorted had to slap a hand over her mouth to hold the next one in ohoh kate secrets out its a relief kate scooted forward on the bench so that she could leer at candys body ive had my eye on you for years sugar lips but i was too shy to tell you its true conspiratorially margo leaned toward candy shes been afraid of her love for you unsettled unsure candy shifted thats not amusing no its been painful wrenching kate swung her legs over the bench slid down but now that you know the truth i can make you mine at last dont touch me squeaking candy jumped up fumbled with her towel dont come near me i think they want to be alone laura commented and wrapped her towel over her breasts i hate you i hate all of you god kate gave a quick shudder isnt she the sexiest little thing youre revolting fearing for her life candy dashed out of the steam room leaving her towel behind pervert margo said mildly when kate collapsed on the bench careful you might get me hot if i was a lesbian im sure youd be more my type catching her breath she looked over at laura honey dont let her get to you hmm distracted laura glanced back i was just thinkinghow much do you think she paid for that boob job not enough margo rose and tucked the towel in place come on lets go stuff her in a locker for old times sake i do like men kate insisted fidgeting as her toenails were painted the salons cottoncandypink and spunsugarwhite decor was designed to put a woman into a relaxed and festive mood it made kate itchy i just dont have a lot of time for them you wont need time after candy gets done laura said she sipped her sparkling mineral water and relaxed in the deep cushions of the highbacked swivel chair by the time she gets through spreading the word any man within a hundredmile radius is going to avoid you like a vasectomy well maybe its a blessing kate flipped through the stack of fashion magazines on the table beside her and found nothing of interest it might discourage that jerk bill pardoe from calling me all the time bill is a very sweet and decent man then you go out with him let him tickle your knee under the table and call you honeybunch shes always been too picky margo kept her eyes closed nearly purring as her feet were massaged shed have had more fun in her life if shed gone looking for mr goodbar instead of mr perfect i look for more in a date than a fat portfolio and a penis girls girls laura picked up her mineral water again we have to stick together now if candy follows through and files charges for assault it could get sticky but officer margo cooed batting her lashes it was just highspirited girlish fun shit shed never humiliate herself by admitting in public that for the second time in her life shed been trapped naked in a gym locker shell be more subtle than that i say within a week we all have new identities the slut the shrew and the dyke i might like being the shrew laura decided being the wimp gets old fast you were never the wimp margo said loyally oh yes ive been a practicing wimp for years its going to take some doing to make the leap to shrew but i might give it a shot josh she blinked as her brother walked into the salon looking hot and harassed ladies he plopped down in a vacant chair picked up margos glass of water and guzzled it down well dont you all look he paused skimmed his eyes over three faces packed in green goo hideous been having fun go away living with a man didnt mean he had to see you in a seaweed pack margo thought this is a girl thing he set her empty glass down picked up kates and guzzled that too i was into my second set with carl brewster on the courts here you know carl brewster television journalist investigative reporter and anchor on informed that longrunning highly rated and revered newsmagazine the tone of his voice had laura biting her lip ive heard of it how is carl oh fit and sassy not that i wasnt whipping his ass but i digress informed is planning to do a series of reports on the fine hotels of the world with templeton of course as a highlight ive spent weeks arranging for various crews to film our hotels interview staff certain guests all to show the viewing public the fine upstanding sophisticated and unrivaled class and hospitality of templeton worldwide he set aside kates glass laura wordlessly handed him hers im sure they got some wonderful footage oh they did naturally when carl suggested we get some clips of the two of us playing tennis at our landmark resort here in monterey i agreed a nice human touch the vp of templeton enjoying the pleasant surroundings where his guests are always pampered and satisfied he paused smiled charmingly at the hovering beauticians would you mind giving us a moment after theyd moved away a discreet distance his smile turned to a snarl imagine my surprise my distress when one of our regular patrons raced screaming into camera range her templeton spa robe flapping open her eyes wild as she sputtered accusations about being attackedbodily attackedby laura templeton ridgeway and her cohorts oh josh im so sorry laura turned her head away hoping hed take it for shame it would never never do to laugh he showed his teeth one snicker laura just one im not snickering composed she turned back im terribly sorry it must have been very embarrassing for you and wont it just be a laugh riot when they run that little scene of course theyll beep out most of the dialogue to conform to standards and practices but i think the viewing audience the millions of people who tune into informed each week will get the gist she started it kate said then winced when he turned flinty eyes on her well she did im sure mom and dad will understand that completely even the stalwart kate could be cowed it was margos idea margo hissed through her teeth traitor she called kate a lesbian shaking his head josh covered his face with his hands and rubbed hard oh well then get the rope i suppose youd have let her get away with it shes been trying to damage the shop she said nasty things to laura margo went on heating up and just the other day she came into the shop and called me a slut a secondclass slut and your answer was to gang up on her three to one smack her around strip her naked and shove her into a locker we never smacked her not once not margo thought that she wouldnt have liked to as for the locker business it was a matter of tradition we did nothing more than embarrass her which is no more than she deserved after the way she insulted us and anyway a real man would applaud our actions unlike you and your idiot sisters here pitiful insults from crazy women dont bother me and your timing was rare and perfect he leaned forward pleased to be able to pay her back in spades for the real man comment id just begun to get carl to nibble at the idea of doing a sidebar story on the latest innovation of a templeton heir laura templeton ridgeways partnership with old and dear friends margo sullivanyes the margo sullivan and kate powell smart savvy women creating and running a smart savvy business were going to get air on informed thats fabulous he shot margo a disgusted look christ you are an idiot what youre going to get unless i can do some fast and sweet talking is sued and very possibly charged in a criminal action shes claiming assault verbal and physical abuseand now that i know kates a lesbian that explains the sexual abuse she tossed in i am not a lesbian kate fumed though the way she said it was an insult to any rational person who supports freedom of sexual preference from his expression she realized it wasnt the time to get up on any liberal or feminist soapbox instead she shifted sulked and i never touched her in any sexual way this is completely out of proportion josh and you know it she gave us grief and we gave her some back thats all thats not all the templeton resort isnt secondperiod gym class this is the adult world didnt any of you remember her second husband was a litigator a litigator who delights in pursuing and winning just this sort of nuisance suit she could go after the shop every ounce of blood in margos face drained thats ridiculous shed never get it no court would take her that seriously maybe not his voice was a cold snap an unmerciful whip but the time and expense youd have to put into fighting her off could go a long way toward draining your capital he rose shook his head at the three of them if you havent been paying attention the last decade or so schools out so you sit here and enjoy having your toenails painted while i go back to work and try to save your sorry butts hes really steamed kate murmured as he stormed out one of us should go talk to him she looked from margo to laura one of you should go talk to him ill go laura rose feeling ridiculous in her little paper slippers and cotton balls no youd better warn your parents tell them weve put our foot in it margo sighed struggled not to be terrified ill do what i can with josh she gave him an hour it took her nearly that long to put herself together in any case when facing a furious man she thought it wise to look her best he was on the phone at the desk in the office when she walked in and he didnt so much as flick a glance at her so much she thought for a fivehundreddollar session at the spa saying nothing she crossed to the desk and waited for him to complete his call hed frightened her he noted and hed meant to her wild temperament was part of what he found so appealing about her but in the past weeks hed watched her channel that temperament all that passion and energy into building something for herself it infuriated him that with one careless tantrum shed risked damaging it yes i said for a full year any and all services ill draft a memo to that effect youll have it by tomorrow he hung up the phone drummed his fingers on the desk tell me what i have to do she said quietly if an apology will help ill go over and apologize to her right now give me a dollar what give me a goddamn dollar baffled she opened her purse i dont have a single i have a five he snatched it out of her fingers im now your legal counsel and as such im advising you to admit nothing youre not going to apologize for anything because you didnt do anything you dont know what shes talking about now if you tell me there were six other naked women and three attendants hanging around who saw you shove her into the locker ill have to kill you there was nobody else there were not idiots she grimaced i know you think we are but were not stupid enough to have done it in front of witnesses actually we timed it that way so shed be stuck in there longer she smiled weakly it seemed like a good idea at the time when he said nothing she felt her temper simmer again arent you the one who broke peters nose i could afford to indulge myself oh thats typical the templeton heir can behave any way he pleases and damn the consequences his eyes flashed a dangerous edgy glint lets just say i pick my battles she forced herself to stop joshs attitude and position were hardly the point how much trouble am i in she demanded i know youre not a trial lawyer so that five bucks isnt going to do me much good if this actually goes to court it depends on how stubborn she is with an effort he calmed himself her little jab at his character was nothing new templetons official stand will be shock and distress that such an incident occurred while she was a guest were compensating her for her inconvenience and stress with a years complementary services at any of our spa resorts that and the fact that publicizing the incident will be embarrassing for her might do it he ran the fivedollar bill through his fingers laid it on the desk blotter she might be satisfied with badmouthing you and the shop and using her influence to have her friends boycott and since she does have a wide range of acquaintances a boycott will likely sting well get over that calmer she pushed her hands through her hair shed come to apologize and intended to do it right im sorry i know the whole thing wasisembarrassing for you and your family he braced his elbows on the desk his brow on his fists she came shrieking across the court id just hit a line drive barely missed beaning her cameras rolling and there i am trying to look my sixthgenerationalhotelier best the athletic yet intelligent the worldtraveled yet dedicated the dashing yet concerned heir to the templeton name youd be good at that margo murmured hoping to placate him he didnt even look at her suddenly ive got my arms full of this halfnaked spitting swearing clawing mass whos screaming that my sister her lesbian companion and my whore attacked her he pinched the bridge of his nose hoping to relieve some pressure i figured out right away who my sister was though i didnt appreciate the term i deduced you must be my whore the lesbian companion might have stumped me but for process of elimination he lifted his head i was tempted to belt her but i was too busy trying to keep her from ripping off my face its such a nice face too hoping to soothe she walked around the desk and sat on his lap im sorry she took it out on you she scratched me he turned his head to show her the trio of angry welts on the side of his throat dutifully margo kissed them what am i going to do with you he said wearily and rested his cheek on her head then he chuckled how the hell did you stuff her into one of those skinny lockers it wasnt easy but it was fun he narrowed his eyes youre never going to do it again no matter what the provocationunless you sedate her first deal since the crisis seemed to have passed she slipped a hand under his shirt stroked it over his chest watched his brow lift ive been waxed and polished if youre interested well just so the day isnt a complete loss he picked her up and carried her to the bed chapter sixteen it didnt take long for the fallout sales and traffic fell off sharply during the following week sharply enough to have margos stomach jittering as she wrote out checks for the monthly bills oh there were still plenty of tourists and walkins but a great many of the ladies who lunch the very clientele pretenses required in order to move the highend merchandise were giving the shop a wide berth if things didnt pick up within the next thirty days she would have to dip into her dwindling capital just to stay open she wasnt panicked just uneasy shed told josh they could wait it out and she believed it the loyalty of candys country club pals could be measured in their demitasse cups with room to spare but that didnt mean her business didnt need a jolt of adrenaline she didnt want the shop merely to struggle along she wanted it to thrive perhaps she realized she wanted it to be as she had once been in the spotlight admired successful as she arranged and rearranged displays she wracked her brains to come up with a workable concept to turn pretenses from an intriguing little secondhand shop into a star when the door opened she had a brightand she was afraid desperatesmile waiting mum what are you doing here its my day off isnt it ann pursed her lips as she scanned the showroom and i havent come by here since the first week you opened its awful quiet im being punished for my sins you always said i would be i heard of it she clucked her tongue grown women behaving like hoydens though i never liked that woman not even when she was a girl always with her nose in the air this time i put it out of joint shes managed to slice a chunk out of sales though kate says its also part of the natural correction of a new business after its initial opening weeks margo scowled at an amber globe you know how she talks when shes wearing her accountant hat i do yes more often than not i listen to her when shes going on about my investments and just nod soberly without a clue as to what the devil shes talking about for the first time all day margo indulged in a long laugh im glad you came in there havent been many friendly faces in here today well youll have to do something about that out of habit ann checked for dust on a table nodded in approval when she found the surface smooth and glossy have a sale give away prizes hire a marching band a marching bandgood one mum well what do i know about shopkeeping its getting people in thats the trick isnt it absently ann picked up a pretty glass bottle not to put things in she mused perplexed as always with fripperies just to sit about the house your uncle johnny ryan back in cork had himself a pub she continued he would hire musicians now and thenthe yanks liked it especially and would come in to hear the music and buy pints while they did i dont think an irish jug band is the answer to traffic flow in here the dismissive tone was an insult as far as ann was concerned im speaking of fine traditional music youve never respected your heritage you never gave me the chance to margo shot back what youve told me about ireland and my family there could fit into one paragraph it was true enough ann tightened her lips so you couldnt pick up a book i suppose or take a bit of a detour on your gallivanting through europe ive been to cork twice margo said and had the satisfaction of seeing anns mouth fall open surprise and to dublin and galway and clare she shrugged her shoulders annoyed with herself for admitting she had once gone searching for her roots its a pretty country but im more interested in the one im living in now no one wrote me told me youd gone to see them i didnt see anyone when i was there what would have been the point even if id gone around digging up ryans and sullivans we wouldnt have known each other ann started to speak then shook her head no i suppose youre right for a moment she thought she saw regret in her mothers eyes and was sorry for it i have problems now ambitions now she said briskly that have to be dealt with now reminiscing about pennywhistles and pints of guiness wont help get the business moving the way i want it to move music and drink appeal to more than the irish ann pointed out whats wrong with offering a bit of entertainment i need customers margo insisted i need a hook to lure the platinumcard set in past candys boycott and set a standard for pretenses so youll have a sale suddenly ann wanted badly to help youve pretty things in here margo people want pretty things youve only to get them in the door exactly my point what i need is wait margo pressed a hand to her head as an idea tried to form music a harpist maybe an irish harpist maybe in traditional dress music and drink a reception champagne and little trays of canapes like at a gallery opening prizes she grabbed her mothers shoulders surprising ann with the quick hug a prize just one its more alluring to have just one no no no not a prize margo continued circling the shop an auction on one piece the diamond brooch no no the pearl choker proceeds to charity whats a good charity oh laura will know a charity reception mum itll get them in here the girls mind whirled like a dervish ann thought running and spinning from one point to the next that she saw hadnt changed a wit well then youd better get to it she got to it with a vengeance within a week invitations to the charity reception and auction benefiting wednesdays child a program for handicapped and underprivileged children were being printed laura was delegated to handle interviews and margo went to work trying to charm liquor distributors into donating cases of champagne she auditioned harpists begged josh to select waiters from templeton staff to serve and flattered mrs williamson into making the canapes it was just the beginning when josh came back to the penthouse after a long day trip to san francisco he found his lover in bed but she wasnt alone what the hell is this margo tossed back her hair turned on a smile creamy curves of white breasts rose above glossy redsatin sheets those same slick sheets were artfully twisted to showcase a long shapely leg the camera flashed hello darling were nearly done here hold the sheet between your breasts the photographer ordered crouching at the foot of the bed on which margo was sprawled seductively a little lower now tilt your head thats it thats it youre still the best baby lets sell the goods josh set down his briefcase stepped over a cable and earned a mutter from the photographers assistant what are you wearing pearls she skimmed her fingers down them ran her tongue invitingly over her lips as the camera clicked the choker were auctioning off i thought photos would help bump up the bids since she appeared to be wearing nothing else josh had to agree with her just a couple more give me the look oh yeah thats the one got it he stood an agile sharpeyed man with a flowing red ponytail great working with you again margo i owe you zack not a thing he handed off his camera to his assistant then leaned over the bed to kiss margo warmly ive missed seeing that billiondollar face in my viewfinder glad i could help he glanced at josh be out of your way in a shake josh be a doll and get zack and bob a couple of beers without a flicker she dropped the sheet then reached for a robe to cover her lovely breasts a couple of beers his smile was quick and feral sure why not we met before leaving his assistant to pack up zack followed josh back into the office in parisno no rome you dropped by one of margos shoots the green lights of jealousy faded a bit it was hard to forget a man with a footlong red ponytail yeah i think she was dressed at the time zack took the beer just to clear the air here ive seen more naked women than a bouncer in a strip joint its just part of the job not that you enjoy it im willing to sacrifice for my art he grinned winningly pal i fucking love it but its still part of the job if you want a professionals opinion youve got yourself the top of the line some women you have to know how to shoot what angle what lighting so the camerall love them doesnt matter if theyre beautifulthe cameras fickle and its picky he took a long satisfying gulp of beer it dont matter a damn how you shoot margo sullivan it just dont matter a damn the camera fucking worships her he looked toward the bedroom as her warm throaty laugh flowed out and ill tell you if she wasnt set on running this store of hers id talk her into coming back to la with me and giving fashion photography a try then id have to break all the bones in your fingers zack nodded i thought you might and since youre bigger than me i think ill take bob his beer to go good choice josh decided a beer might go down well and was just tipping a bottle back when margo came into the room god it was good to see zack again is there a split of champagne in there im parched id forgotten how hot you get under the lights her face was glowing as she tilted her head back and ran her fingers through her hair shed done something curling and sexy with it he noted so that it spiraled wildly and how much i love it she went on theres just something about the whole process looking into the camera the way it looks at you the lights the sound of the shutter when she let her hair fall and opened her eyes he was staring at her in a way that made her heart stutter what is it nothing his eyes never left hers as he held out the glass of wine hed poured i didnt realize you were thinking of going back to it im not but she sipped knowing that for a moment it had been a tantalizing thought i dont mean id never pose again or take an intriguing offer but the shops my priority now and making it a success is number one on my list number one had he carried this mood back with him from san francisco he wondered or had it dropped on him like a cloud when hed walked into the suite and seen her tell me duchess just what position do you and i rate on that list i dont know what you mean simple question are we five seven have we even made it to the list yet she looked into her glass watched the wine bubble like dreams are you asking me for something i think its about time i did and that i imagine is your cue to exit stage right when she said nothing he set down his beer why dont we try something different you stay and ill go dont she still didnt look at him but kept staring at the bubbles rising and dancing in her glass please dont i know you dont think much of me you care about me but you dont think much of me and maybe i deserve that were even there arent we you dont think much of me either how could she answer when she wasnt at all sure just what she thought of joshua templeton she turned then he was waiting and she was grateful for that halfway across the room but waiting youre important to me she told him more important than i expected or wanted you to be isnt that enough i dont know margo i just dont know why was her hand shaking it was civilized wasnt it just as it was supposed to be if youre if this has run its course for you ill understand she set her glass down but i dont want to lose you altogether i dont know what id do if you werent in my life this wasnt what he wanted this calm gentle understanding he wanted her to rage to throw the wine at his head to scream at him for having the nerve to think he could walk out on her so if i walk out well be friends again yes she squeezed her eyes shut as her heart contracted no relieved he crossed back to her youll hate me if i go gathering her hair in his hand he drew her head back until their eyes met you need me i want to hear you say it ill hate you if you go she reached up framed his face with her hands i need you she pulled his mouth to hers come to bed it was the best way to show him the only way the easy answer he murmured yes it should be easy lets make it easy the moment he lifted her into his arms she tugged at his jacket whispered hot promises in his ear but he didnt intend to make it easy this time for either of them he stood her next to the bed let her undress him with quick eager hands when she would have pulled him down with her to the sheets still warm from the lights and her body he gathered her close and began his assault one long lazy meeting of lips that spun out and trembled and shimmered with something new simple tenderness he took her hands drew them down to her side behind her back and cuffed them there so that his free hand could stroke over her face down her throat into her hair while his mouth continued to seduce josh her heartbeat echoed slow and thick in her head touch me i am he feathered kisses over her cheeks her jaw maybe for the first time im touching you its hard to feel when theres only heat but youre feeling now arent you when her head fell weakly back he nuzzled her throat no ones ever made you feel what im going to make you feel it was frightening this weakness weighing down her limbs clouding her brain she wanted the flash the fire there was simplicity in that and even in dangerous heat safety but mixed with the fear was the dark dizzying thrill of being taken slowly so slowly that each touch each brush of lips lasted eons he could swear he felt her bones melting inside that sleek pampered flesh the drum of her turgid pulse thudded against his fingers low baffled whimpers sounded in her throat where pearls glowed against her skin he slid the robe aside so she wore nothing but them luminous white orbs circling a long slim neck lie down with me she lifted her arm to take him lie down on me her voice alone that husky flow of it could have brought a man to his knees and had he thought too often he stroked his hands down her back up a teasing fingertip caress that had her shuddering had her lips parting on what might have been a plea before his closed over them and swallowed it when she was limp against him when her hands slid weakly back to her sides he lay her on the bed on the slick slippery satin but he didnt cover her again he braceleted her wrists lifted them above her head sigh layered over sigh as he began a slow thorough trail down her body she thought the air had turned gold how else could every breath she took be so rich his mouth was so gentle yet it exploited weaknesses she hadnt known were hidden inside her his hands were impossibly tender and patient yet they made her burn and they made her weep it was more than pleasure she had no words for it it was soft stronger than lust and lovelier than any dream shed ever held in her heart her body simply wasnt hers any longer not hers alone he could feel her opening for him that pliant surrender that was beyond passion and more exciting her skin hummed as his tongue teased over it her muscles tensed in anticipation of climax lazily he backed off and left them quivering and when he met her lips with his again emotions poured like wine he slipped inside her like a wish no he used his weight to pin her as she moved restlessly it wont be fast this time even as the blood pounded in his brain he nipped at her mouth in small torturous bites its me whos filling you margo as no one else has no one else could he moved in her long slow strokes shattering she could see nothing but his face feel nothing but that glorious friction then the gradual the delicious the aching build of luxurious orgasm her hands slid bonelessly off his shoulders no one knows you like i do no one can love you like i do but she was beyond words she was afraid of him it was a staggering realization especially in the middle of the night when she lay wakeful beside him hed changed something between them margo thought shifted the balance so that she felt vulnerable and hed done it by showing her what it was like to feel cherished cautious and quiet she slipped but of bed left him sleeping the champagne was still on the table flat now but she drank it just the same she found a cigarette lit it and told herself to calm down she was terrified it had been a risk certainly to sleep with him but one shed been willing to take but shed never counted on falling in love with him that was a dare she would have turned down cold still could she assured herself and drew deep on the cigarette her emotions were still her own no matter how often or how quickly her life seemed to be changing she was still in charge of her emotions she wasnt going to be in love with anyone most particularly josh she didnt know anything about love not this kind and didnt want to pressing a hand to her head she let out a quiet laugh of coursethat was it she didnt know anything about love so why was she so sure that was what she was feeling more than likely it was just surprise that he could be so sweet and that she could be so susceptible to sweetness and it was the first time shed been involved with a man shed cared for as deeply as she did josh the closely twined history they shared the memories the affection it was easy and foolish of her to twist that all up inside and come out with love more settled she crushed out the cigarette took a deep breath cant sleep she jumped like a cat made him laugh sorry didnt mean to startle you the light from the bedroom pooled behind him as he stepped closer she stepped back problem no he cocked his head and as his eyes adjusted got a good look at her face his smile spread arrogant and male nervous of course not im making you nervous i dont like being stalked when im trying to think she stepped aside evading him ive got a lot on my mind with the reception and she trailed off going blank when his hand skimmed down her arm youre tense he murmured jittery i like it you would i need a clear mind and a good nights sleep im going to take a sleeping pill lets try something else he shook his head when she eyed him balefully cant you think of anything but sex im going to rub your back doubt mixed with interest you are guaranteed to beat off tension and chase away insomnia he promised as he led her back to the bed lie down on your stomach duchess close your eyes and leave it to me wary she twisted her head to look at him just my back neck and shoulders too thats a girl he eased her down straddled her and grinned when all those long lovely muscles bunched into wires he pressed the heels of his hands just at the base of her neck whats worrying you baby things name one you was the first answer on her tongue but she bit that one off those quarterly tax things are almost due and sales are down how down weve never matched the sales from the first two weeks kate says candy hasnt done that much damageits just the natural leveling off of a new business but im afraid i might have made a mistake funneling money into this reception when i should be using it for daytoday expenses god you have wonderful hands thats what they all say the necklace im contributing was priced at eightyfive hundred its a big chunk out of inventory itll also be an excellent deduction thats what kate said her voice thickened as he stroked the tension out of her shoulders im tired of being afraid josh i know i never used to be afraid of anything now everything scares me including me hmm she was drifting off too tired to deny it i dont want to mess things up again im not going to let you he leaned down to touch his lips to her shoulder go to sleep margo everythings on the right track dont go away she managed before she sank when have i ever chapter seventeen it had to be perfect margo was determined that every detail of the night would go off flawlessly it took hours of rearranging stock before she was satisfied that she had achieved just the right presentation the best traffic pattern the most attractive corner for the harpist who was even now tuning up she had redressed the window highlighting the pearl choker with just a few carefully selected bottles and trinket boxes and silk scarves to add color the gilded banister that ringed the second floor was sparkling with fairy lights vases and decorative urns were filled with fall flowers and hothouse roses culled from the templeton gardens and greenhouse and elegantly arranged by her mother on the tiny veranda still more flowers bloomed lusciously out of copper pots and glazed pottery she had personally buffed polished and scrubbed every surface of the shop until it shined it was just a matter of controlling every detail she told herself as she puffed manically on a cigarette of making sure everything was first class and overlooking nothing had she overlooked something turning she studied herself in the wall of decorative mirrors she wore the little black dress shed chosen for her first dinner back at templeton house the neckline that low square was the perfect canvas for the choker it had seemed a smart sales pitch to remove it from the window and display it against soft female flesh and she realized shed chosen well when shed selected that piece to auction not just because it was elegant and lovely she mused because it reminded her of a time of her life that would never come again and a lonely old man she had had enough heart to care for so rare she thought for margo sullivan to have heart to do something out of kindness rather than calculation dozens of margos she mused it had taken her almost twentynine years to realize that there were dozens of margos one who would throw caution to the winds another who would worry endlessly there was the margo who knew how to hotwax an antique table and the one who could laze away the day with a fashion magazine the one who understood the rich pleasure of buying an art nouveau bottle for no more reason than seeing it sit on a shelf and the one whod learned to thrill at selling it the one who could flash a smile and turn men to jelly no matter what their age and the one who was suddenly able to think of only one man where was he sick with nerves she lit yet another cigarette it was nearly time nearly zero hour he should have been there this was a crisis point in her life josh was always there at the crisis points always there she thought with a dull jolt of surprise how odd that he should always be there at her turning points why dont you just chew that pack up swallow it and get it over with kate suggested as she came through the door what if youre going to eat that cigarette you might as well use your teeth traffics murder out there she added i had to park three blocks away and i dont appreciate the hike in these stupid shoes you made me buy shrugging out of her practical coat she lifted her arms well am i going to pass the audition lets have a look margo crushed out the cigarette and with lips pursed circled her finger so kate would turn around the long sweep of the simple black velvet suited the angular frame and the flirty scoopnecked bodice added softness the back dipped alluringly i knew it would be perfect for you despite being all skin and bones and flatchested you look almost elegant i feel like an impostor and im going to freeze kate didnt mind the critique of her body nearly as much as the inconvenience of bare shoulders i dont see why i couldnt wear my own clothes that dinner suit i have is fine that dinner suit is fine for the next accountant convention you go to margo knit her wellshaped eyebrows those earrings what protectively kate closed her hands over earlobes decorated with simple gold swirls theyre my best ones and so department store how could we have been raised in the same house margo wondered and marched over to the jewelry display after sober study she chose jawlength swings of rhinestones im not wearing those chandeliers ill look ridiculous dont argue with the expert put them on like a good girl oh i hate playing dressup badtemperedly kate strode to a mirror and made the exchange she hated more that margo was right they added dash kitchens under control laura started down the winding steps balancing a silver tray with three flutes of champagne i thought wed have our own private toast before she paused at the bottom grinned wow dont we look fabulous margo studied lauras slim black evening suit trimmed in satin winking with buttons of rhinestone and pearl dont we just i dont see why we all had to wear black kate complained were making a statement margo took her glass lifted it to partners after one sip she pressed a hand to her stomach my systems gone haywire want a turns kate asked no unlike you i dont consider antacids a member of the four major food groups oh yeah youd rather hit the xanax chase it with a little prozac i am not taking tranquilizers but she had one in her bag just in case no need to mention it now take that thing you call a coat into the back room before it scares off the guests you sure i shouldnt check upstairs she asked laura everythings fine dont worry so much im not worried this little partys only costing us about ten thousand dollars why should i be worried did i overdo it with the fairy lights they look charming get a grip margo im getting one but maybe a little xanax wouldnt hurt no no she tugged another cigarette out of the pack on the counter im handling this without chemical assistance she caught lauras bland look at the wine and tobacco and hissed out a breath dont expect miracles but she made herself put the cigarette back i know im obsessing well laura said with a bland smile as long as you know what i dont know is how this event got to be worse than the opening maybe its because your parents put off going back to europe to stay for it and because rubbing candys nose in a bustout success wouldnt hurt kate added as she came back from the storeroom there is that margo agreed and found some comfort in it bottom line the shop isnt a means to an end the way i expected it to be and im not just worried that well all lose what we put into it its gotten to be more important than money she glanced around at the setting where what had been hers was offered and im feeling a little guilty i realize that ive dragged this charity this childrens charity into it just so i can keep the doors open thats just plain dumb kate said flatly the charity is going to benefit without fundraisers and patrons eyeing the tax deduction it would have to close its doors be sure to tell me that whenever i get a greedy gleam in my eye and she had one now damn i want to empty some deep pockets tonight thats more like it kate lifted her glass in approval you were starting to worry me she looked around as the door opened oh god my heart she patted her hand against her chest theres nothing like a man in a monkey suit to start it fluttering you look nice too josh sleeked into black tie held out three white roses actually the three of you would knock the breath out of the seventh fleet lets get this charming man some champagne kate taking her friend firmly by the hand laura tugged her toward the steps it doesnt take two of us get a clue kate glanced back noted the way josh and margo were staring at each other and shook her head jesus isnt knowing theyre sleeping together enough without having to watch them smolder people should have some control you have enough for everybody laura murmured and pulled her up the rest of the way i was afraid you wouldnt be here in time josh lifted margos hand to his lips then angled his wrist to look at his watch fifteen minutes to spare i figured if i made a fashionably late entrance youd kill me in my sleep good guess what do you think does everything look right you really expect me to look at anything but you she laughed even as her pulse jittered boy i must be in bad shape when a shopworn line like that hits the mark i mean it he said and watched her smile fade i adore looking at you laying a hand on her cheek he leaned down and buckled her knees with a long slow thorough kiss beautiful margo mine well youre certainly taking my mind off my kiss me again glad to deeper this time longer until everything but him drained from her mind when she eased away his hand remained gentle on her cheek its different she managed youre catching on its not supposed to be new nerves different nerves jittered i dont know if it can be too late he murmured there was the panic again spurting up through mists of pleasure i have to she nearly shuddered with relief when the door opened thought wed beat the rush thomas claimed take your hands off the girl josh and give someone else a chance when margo rushed into his arms he wiggled his brows teasingly at his son she was mine first first didnt mean a damn josh thought as he leaned negligently on the counter last was what counted at least he was trying to believe that by ten two hours after the doors opened for pretenses first annual reception and charity auction margo was in her element this was something she understoodbeautifully dressed people chatting bumping silkcovered elbows as they sipped wine or designer water it was a world she had focused her life on entering and this time theyd come to her we thought a week or two in palm springs would do the trick i dont know how she continues to turn a blind eye to his affairs theyre so blatant i havent seen him since the last time we were in paris small talk among the privileged margo thought and she knew how to chat right back entertaining had been one of her hobbies in milan she knew how to juggle three conversations keep an eye on the roving waiters and pretend she had nothing on her mind but the next sip of champagne she also knew how to ignore when necessary the catty and sly snippets that came to her ears imagine having to sell everything i mean darling even your shoes just last week that peter asked her to file for the divorce so that she could save face the poor things frigid the doctors havent been able to help her margo wouldnt have ignored that one if she could have found the source but before she could ease away and try to locate it there was more so clever the way its all set up like some interesting european flat and i simply adore the collection of compacts i must have the little elephant theres a valentino in the other room darling that just screamed your name you really should see it let them talk as much as they wanted margo decided and pasted a smile back on her face and let them buy great party judy prentice slipped up to margos side thanks i guess candy had a prior commitment matching the gleam in judys eye margo smiled she wasnt invited really judy leaned closer to margos ear thatll burn her ass i do like you in that case you wont mind putting that flora minaudiere aside for me until i can get in to pick it up the judith leiber consider it yours theres a matching lipstick case and a compact too it makes a really fabulous set your middle names satan right judy tossed up a hand put them all aside for me ill be in next week we appreciate your patronage she laid a hand on judys shoulder as she eased by oh and dont forget to save something to bid on the choker i heard it screaming your name you are the devil with a laugh margo moved on to the next group so nice to see you what a gorgeous bracelet shes a natural isnt she susan murmured to her son no one would know theres a nerve in her body see the way shes running her fingers up the stem of her glass she cant keep her hands still when shes tense but shes pulling it off so well that i just had laura put aside two jackets a bag and a jeweled snuff bottle for me tucking her arm through joshs susan laughed at herself they were lauras jackets for gods sake im buying my own daughters castoffs she comes by her excellent taste honestly except in men susan patted his hand she was too young to know any better too much in love to be stopped laura was older now susan thought and hurting youll keep your eye on her and the girls once your father and i leave wont you i guess i havent been doing my brotherly duty very well lately youve been distracted and youve earned your own life her eyes sharp and maternal scanned the room until they found laura im a little worried that shes holding up too well youd rather she fell to pieces id rather be sure that if and when she does someones there for her then she smiled watching kate and margo grab a quick moment with laura they will be weve got to make some sort of list margo whispered otherwise were going to be promising the same things to different people ill never keep it all in my head i told you to keep the cash register open kate grumbled it would be tacky she sent margo a withering look its a store pal margos rightyou dont go ringing up sales and making change at an affair like this god save me from delicate tastes kate blew out a breath that fluttered her bangs ill duck into the storeroom and log the promised merchandise what the hell was it you said a minatoe a minaudiere margo said with a superior smirk just put down jeweled evening bag ill know what it is and dont start playing with the computer you have to mingle im mingled out except theres this one guy hes kind of cute she craned her head zeroed in there the one with the moustache and shoulders see him lincoln howard laura identified him easily married figures muttering kate walked off you ought to make her keep that dress laura commented ive never seen her look better shed look better yet if she didnt walk as though she was late for an audit margo caught herself before she pressed a hand to her jumpy stomach again were going to have to start the auction laura she gripped her friends hand christ i need a cigarette make it fast then the rep from wednesdays child has been giving me the high sign for ten minutes no ill suck it in and make another pass so people can cast avaricious looks at the pearls then ill work my way over to mr t and tell him to start the auction she started the glide pausing here and there to touch someones arm share a quick laugh to note who needed a refill of champagne the minute she saw kate come back out of the storeroom she stepped up to thomas its showtime i want to thank you again for helping us out its a good cause and good business he patted her head affectionately lets hose em damn right she kept her hand in his as they stepped to the front of the room she knew the murmurs would grow as people turned their heads to study them knew how to let them play out as she in turn sized up the room from close by she caught a curious whisper i dont know what candy was talking about she doesnt look debilitated or desperate tommy templeton wouldnt have let things go so far with his son if she was the conniving whore candy claims she is darling if men recognized conniving whores when they saw them it wouldnt be the oldest profession she felt thomass hand tense in hers and looked up at him with an easy smile and hot eyes dont worry rising on her toes she kissed his cheek they got the conniving part right after all if i wasnt a man id punch that jealous cat in the nose his eyes lit up ill get susie to do it maybe later she gave his hand another squeeze turned to the crowd ladies and gentlemen if i could interrupt for a moment she waited while conversations ebbed flowed then politely tapered off id like to thank you all for coming to pretenses first reception the speech had been in her head the one she and laura and kate had finetuned but it was slipping away using her nerve she skimmed her gaze over faces wed especially like to thank you for staying even after youd had your fill of champagne most of you are aware of my checkered career the way it ended with the kind of delectable little scandal we all love to read about she caught lauras eye and the concern in it just smiled when i left europe and came back here it wasnt because i was thinking of america as the land of opportunity and free enterprise i came back because home is where you go when youre broken and i was lucky because the door was open she picked her mother out in the crowd kept her eyes on anns i dont have anyone to blame for the mistakes i made i had family who loved me cared for me watched over me that isnt the case with the children who so desperately need what wednesdays child offers theyre broken because they werent loved and cared for and watched over because they werent given the same chances as those of us in this room tonight with my partners laura templeton and kate powell id like to take a small step toward giving a few of those children a chance she reached back unclasped the choker and let it slide through her fingers bye baby she murmured i hope youll bid generously remember its only money after draping the pearls over a velvet stand she turned to thomas mr templeton miss sullivan he took her hand kissed it youre a good girl now then he turned a cagey eye on the audience as margo slipped to the rear of the room his voice boomed out challenging as he described the single item up for bid and ordering the bidders many of whom he called by name to keep their wallets open that was better than the script laura murmured much better in agreement kate slipped an arm around margos waist lets hope it inspires some of these tightwads all right thomas called out whos going to get this ball rolling and open the bid five hundred five hundred thomass brows lowered jesus pickerling thats pitiful if it wasnt against the rules id pretend i didnt hear that sevenfifty he huffed and shook his head we have a miserly sevenfifty do i hear a thousand he nodded at a raised hand theres a thousand now lets get serious the bidding continued some called out others signaleda lift of the finger a sober nod a careless wave margo began to relax as they slipped over five thousand thats better she murmured im going to try to think of anything else as gravy its making me nuts kate fumbled in her bag for her roll of turns we have six thousand two thomas continued madam you have the throat of a swan these pearls might have been made for you his quarry laughed tommy you devil sixfive how much did you say those were worth kate wanted to know retail at tiffanys maybe twelvefive delighted margo tried to see through the crowd as hands went up theyre still getting a bargain when the bidding topped nine thousand she wanted to dance when it hit ten she wished she had a chair so she could see the bidders i never expected it to go this high i underestimated their generosity and their competitive spirit kate balanced on her toes it seems to be between two or three people but i cant see and its serious now margo murmured no called bids thats twelve thousand looking for twelvefive his sharp eyes darting back and forth thomas guided the bidding twelvefive is bid thirteen at the head shake response he zeroed in on another bidder thirteen yes we have thirteen thirteen is bid will you bid thirteenfive the call is for thirteen thousand five hundred and we have it thirteenfive will you go fourteen theres a man who knows his mind fourteen is bid calling fourteenfive fourteen is the bid on the floor thats fourteen thousand going once and going twice sold for fourteen thousand to the man with exquisite taste and an eye for value there was polite applause pleasant laughter margo was too busy trying to see through the now milling crowd to notice the looks aimed her way we should go congratulate the winner make sure the paper gets a picture whoever gets up there first make sure to hold on to him margo dear she hadnt made it two steps before her arm was snagged staring into the womans face margo searched desperately for a name then settled on the usual out darling how wonderful to see you ive had the best time such a delightful affair and a charming little shop i would have been in weeks ago but i was so swamped if im asked to serve on another committee ill simply slit my wrists one of candys friends margo remembered terri merri sherri im delighted you were able to shuffle us into your schedule oh so am i ive had a wonderful evening and ive got my heart set on those darling earrings the little rubyandpearl ones theyre just so sweet can you tell me how much youre selling them for im going to insist that lance buy them for me since he lost the choker to josh ill have to check theto josh her mind stopped searching for price tags and went blank josh bought the choker as if you didnt know sherris eyes glittered as she tapped margos arm again so clever of you to have him buy it back for you yes wasnt it ill put a hold on the earrings sherri come in anytime next week during business hours and take a look at them youll have to excuse me she worked her way through the crowd bid good night to dozens while struggling to keep that bright careless smile on her face she found josh flirting ruthlessly with the teenage daughter of one of his board members josh i have to steal you away for a minute she began as the girl went automatically to a pout if you could just help me with this little thing in the storeroom she all but shoved him inside shut the door what have you done just giving the kid something to dream about tonight all innocence he lifted his hands palms out never laid a hand on her i have witnesses im not talking about your pathetic flirtation with a child young enough to be your daughter shes seventeen give me a break and i was letting her flirt with me just target practice i said i wasnt talking about that though you should be ashamed of yourself what do you mean buying the choker oh that oh that she repeated do you know what it looks like yeah its three strands beautifully matched pearls with a bowshaped pave diamond clasp on eighteenkarat she made a sound like expelling steam i know what the damn choker looks like then why did you ask dont play lawyer games with me its really more politics than law now she held up her hands closing her eyes until she thought she had a shaky hold on her temper it looks as though i wheedled you into buying itand paying more than its worth on the retail marketjust so i could have my cake and eat it too he decided that telling her she hadnt served any cake would not result in an amused chuckle i was under the impression that the proceeds went to charity the proceeds do but the necklace was offered to the highest bidder people think that i asked you to buy it interested he angled his head yes her face was definitely flushed he noted her eyes bright and hot embarrassment was a new and not unattractive look on her since when do you care what people think im trying to learn to care he considered why because she closed her eyes again i have no idea i have no earthly idea all right then he slipped the pearls out of his pocket running them through his hand as he studied them just grains of sand hunks of carbon tricked into something lovely by time and nature spoken like a man his gaze lifted locked on hers made her stomach tremble i made up my mind to buy it when i was inside you and this was all you were wearing and you looked at me as if nothing else existed but us thats spoken like a man too a man who loves you margo and always has terrified and thrilled she stared at him i cant breathe i know the feeling no i really cant breathe quickly she dropped into a chair and put her spinning head between her knees well thats quite a reaction to a declaration of love he slid the pearls back into his pocket so he could rub her back is it your usual no his grim mouth curved a little thats something then im not ready she drew in air slowly tried to let it out molecule by molecule im just not ready for this for you i love you too but im not ready of all the scenarios hed imagined when she would finally tell him she loved him none of them had included her saying the words with her head between her knees would you mind sitting up and telling me that again just the i love you part cautious she lifted her head i do love you butno dont touch me now the hell with that he hauled her out of the chair and crushed his mouth to hers with more impatience than finesse chapter eighteen kate opened the door of the storeroom and let out a long windy sigh at the sight of josh and margo locked in a passionate embrace maybe it did warm her heart but there was no reason to let them know that do you two mind putting your glands on hold so we can finish out the evening with some sense of decorum josh tore his mouth from margos long enough to suck in a breath scram he ordered and got back to business i will not scram there are still over a dozen people out there who expect to be bid a fond farewell by the owners all three owners and that includes the woman youre currently performing an emergency tonsillectomy on josh gave her a brief glance over the top of margos head kate youre such a romantic fool i know its a weakness of mine she stepped up and pried them apart im sure the two of you can remember where you left off come on partner oh and josh you might want to stay in here until youre a little more presentable he damned near blushed sisters arent supposed to notice that sort of thing this one sees all knows all she whisked margo through the door whats the matter with you she muttered you look like youve been poleaxed i have been give me one of those damn tums youre so crazy about soon as i can get to my purse concerned she rubbed her hand over margos back tell me whats wrong honey i cant now tomorrow and because she understood her job she curved her lips into a bright smile and held out both hands to the woman approaching them so glad you could come i hope you enjoyed the evening she repeated those sentiments with variation for nearly an hour before the last lingerer trickled out necessity along with aspirin and antacids kept her functioning she wanted a quiet room a moment to herself to sort out all the emotions whirling through her but she was swept along when the templetons insisted on taking the family out to celebrate it was nearly one before she walked into the penthouse with josh she should have had it all figured out by now she thought she should know exactly what to say and do but when the door closed behind them and they were alone she didnt have a clue im going to miss themyour parentswhen they go back to europe so am i there was an easy smile on his face his formal tie was loose now as were the studs on his tuxedo shirt margo thought he looked like an elegantly male ad for an outrageously expensive and sexy cologne youve been quiet i know ive been trying to think to figure out what to say when we talk about this you shouldnt have to think that hard he stepped toward her began to slide the pins from her hair ive been thinking about being alone with you finally as her hair tumbled free he tossed the pins on the dresser it didnt take much effort one of us has to be sensible why at any other time she would have laughed im not sure why i just know one of us has to be and it doesnt look as though its going to be you josh im not sure either of us knows how to handle this ive got a pretty good idea how to start his arms slipped around her raced up her back to cup her shoulders and pull her into him this parts easy maybe too easy for both of us i dont think we want that to change why should it he skimmed his mouth along her jaw and the taste of her was warm and silky because weve muddied up the waters how did he expect her to think when he was sampling her as if she was a delicacy hed chosen from under glinting crystal because ive never really been in love before and i dont think you have either her pulse was already stuttering we dont know what were doing so well improvise his mood was soaring too high and too free to let her sudden attack of logic dampen it he tugged on the zipper at the back of her dress and when the silk parted he slid his hands along her skin are you saying things dont have to change bubbles of relief warred against flickers of need as her dress slipped down he wanted to tell her everything had already done so but he knew her so well understood that if he spoke of change of commitment of forever shed balk or evade or simply bolt nothing that we dont want to change this for instance he murmured skimming his thumbs along the soft white swell of her breasts they rose full and white out of the strapless lace of a black body skimmer her stockings stopped high on the thigh another seductive contrast of black against white he let his fingers trail from stocking to flesh to lace and thrilled at each sharply defined texture all the while his eyes stayed on hers the minute you touch me i want you its something i cant seem to control and it worried her worried her enough that she purposely pushed all rational thought aside and eased open his stark white shirt to caress the pale gold tint of the flesh beneath ive never had a lover who stirred me up so much just by being in the same room how long can that last lets find out he eased her onto the bedpale hair spilling milkwhite skin against black silk and lace she was all promising scents and luscious curves long limber limbs that reached out to enfold she held him against her reveling in the feel of his weight pinning her imprisoning sex under sex with slow friction all she had to know for this moment was that she wanted him and her mouth sought his eagerly for that dreamy mating of tongues when had she come to need the flavor of him the scent and texture of his skin after so many years how had friendship and family shot into passion and longing and why when their bodies meshed so perfectly should it matter her skin hummed under his hands those long gliding strokes that shifted in a pulsebeat to rough and possessive what spurted to life inside of her was too layered and complex to analyze she let the heat take her he felt every shift and sigh knew when nerves had melted into acceptance here in this big soft bed there were no questions she was and always had been everything he wanted long lean limbs sumptuous curves sleek perfumed skin her body had been designed to take and give pleasure and no one else he thought as his mouth fused to hers would take it from or give it to her again no one else understood her heart her mind and her dreams as he did no one else her heart leapt then stuttered as his mood turned urgent desperate hands a ravenous mouth raced over her sighs deepened into moans as she matched him beat for beat flame for flame how delicious was madness she rolled over her hands as quick and fast as his to drive him as he was driving her dangerous heights pleasure that was a shuddering kin to pain she rose up in the shadowed lights her skin gleamed like damp silk her eyes wildly blue locked on his one heartbeat two now the demand seemed to shimmer in the air around them in answer he gripped her hips fingers digging in in one fluid move she took him deep deep holding there holding them both trembling on a long feline moan she arched back skimming her hands over her own body from center over torso to breast where she felt her heart thundering slow very slow acutely aware of every tremor of her body acutely aware that his eyes were following her movements she trailed her hands down until they covered caressed that mating of bodies glorying in every breath she sleeked her hands up again lifted her hair and began to ride the pace she set was hard and fast and merciless he watched as she drove herself to the peak shuddered over it sensations battered him like an avalanche blurring his vision but he knew hed never seen anything more glorious than margo lost in her own passion when she cried out flinging herself forward her hands braced on his shoulders her hair curtaining his face he had no choice but to lose himself with her why do i always feel as if ive dived off a mountain whenever i make love with you margo didnt really expect an answer she thought josh was asleep or at least comatose but he shifted his lips brushing over the curve of one breast then the other because you and i together duchess are a dangerous pair and i want you again already he nibbled his way up to her throat found her warm swollen mouth she was ready to float again her arms light and limber as they lifted to circle him its never been like this for me before through the daze of sensations building fresh she felt the change and understood the reason for it i know how that sounds it doesnt matter he didnt want to think about it only wanted to have her to hold her it does to both of us suddenly unsure here where she had always felt so confident she cupped his face in her hands to raise it his eyes were heavy with desire a hint of irritation now working through i think we have to talk about it neither one of us took a vow of chastity that was true enough she also knew that though she had taken lovers before the press had gifted her with a libido and a trail of broken hearts that was well beyond reality we need to talk about it she repeated i havent asked you any questions margo whoever how many ever have been in your life before theres only one now theres only me the cool possessive tone might have annoyed her under other circumstances it was so joshua templetoni see i want i take but they were still linked still warm from each other there havent been as many as you might think josh i didnt sleep with every man i dated fine i didnt sleep with every woman i took to dinner he snapped it out as he turned over on his back to drag the hair off his face its now that matters in any case are we straight about this she wanted them to be it was his anger the cold control of it that told her differently josh my reputations never really mattered to me before in fact it only added to my bank account but now it matters now suddenly chilled she sat up wrapped her arms around herself it matters now because you matter now and i dont know how to handle it i dont know how either of us is going to handle it when it was just sex it was never just sex for me i didnt know that she said quietly i didnt know how you felt or how i felt until it was just there and its so big so important so scary it surprised him not just what she said but the way she said it nerves regrets confusion all those things were so rare in margo when it came to the games men and women played youre scared terrified she hissed out a breath and rose to yank a robe out of the closet and im not happy about it so am i with the beginnings of temper simmering in her eyes she looked at him over her shoulder a long lean male animal she mused his hands tucked behind his head now the start of a smirk on that gorgeous mouth she wasnt sure whether to slug him or jump on him so are you what terrified and not happy about it she tugged the belt on the robe kept her hands in place as she turned really you know what i figure duchess no it was the smirk that drew her had her going back to sit on the side of the bed what is it that you figure its all been so easy for us before too easy and this isnt going to be he took her hand linking fingers casually doesnt look like it maybe ive got a little problem a hitch when it comes to other men after all the woman im in love with has been engaged five times three she jerked her hand free aware that her past was constantly going to sneak up and slap her in the face the other two were products of an overeager press and the three were quickly rectified mistakes the point being he said with what he considered admirable patience that none of my relationships ever progressed that far which could be taken as a fear of commitment on your part could be he murmured but the simple fact is ive been in love with you nearly half my life nearly half my life he said again sitting up so that his eyes dark as shadows were level with hers every woman i touched was a substitute for you josh she only shook her head there was nothing she could say nothing that could rise above the wave of emotion that swamped her its demoralizing margo to watch the woman the only woman you really want turn to anyone but you to wait and to watch it was thrilling and panicking to think it to know it but why did you wait a man has to use what advantage he has mine was time time i know you margo he skimmed a finger down the curve of her cheek sooner or later you were going to get in over your head or just get bored with the high life and youd be right there to pick up the pieces it worked he said lightly and snagged her wrist before she could jump out of the bed no reason to get frosted its a perfect reason you arrogant egotistical son of a bitch just wait till margo fucks up and then step in shed have taken a swing at him if he hadnt anticipated her and grabbed her other wrist i wouldnt have put it exactly that way but he smiled winningly you did fuck up i know what i did she tugged her arms outward and only succeeded in performing a warped rendition of pattycake i also got out of that mess with alain on my own it was the flicker in his eyes that stopped her it was there and gone quickly but she knew every nuance of his face didnt i sure you did but the point is what did you do incensed she batted her trapped hands against his chest you werent in greece id have known if you were how did you fix it i didnt fix it exactly hell look i made a few calls pulled in a few markers christ margo did you expect me to sit around on the beach while they were toying with tossing your butt in jail no she spoke quietly because she was afraid she might scream no i have a crisis you ride to the rescue let go of my hands i dont think so he said judging the temper in her eyes listen all i did was make it go away faster they didnt have anything on you didnt want to have anything on you but there wasnt any point in you cooling your heels in custody longer than necessary all youd done was have the bad taste and poor sense to hook up with some slick con artist who was using you for cover thank you very much dont mention it and since you have mentioned it yet again ill admit that ive had plenty of experience with bad taste and poor sense she jerked her arms fuming when he held firm but im over it now i took charge of my own life damn you and i put it back together piece by piece which is something youve never had to do i took the risk i did the work i im proud of you deflating her completely he brought her fisted hands to his lips dont try to turn this around proud of the way you faced what had to be done and turned it all into something unique and exciting he opened her fingers pressed his lips to her palm and moved by you by the way you stood there tonight by the things you said damn you josh i love you margo his lips curved maybe it was my poor sense that made me love you before but im even more in love with the woman im with now defeated she rested her brow against his how do you do this wind me up spin me out i cant remember why i was mad at you just come here he drew her into his arms lets see what else we can forget later when she lay curled beside him the weight of his arm around her the sound of his heart beating slow and steady under her ear she remembered it all they had she realized resolved nothing she wondered if two people who had known each other so long and so well could understand each others hearts so little until tonight shed never been ashamed of the men she had let into her life fun excitement romance had been everything shed looked for dreamed of most women had viewed her as competition even as a child she had had few female friends other than laura and kate but men she sighed and closed her eyes she understood men had at an early age deduced the power that beauty and sex could wield shed enjoyed wielding it never to hurt she thought she had never played the game with the risk of genuine pain on either side no shed always been careful to choose game partners who understood the rules older men experienced men men with smooth manners hefty wallets and guarded hearts none of them would interfere with her career her ambitions because the rules were simple and always followed fun excitement romance with no spills no tangles no hard feelings when she moved on no feelings at all but plenty of poor judgment now there was josh with him her power was different her dreams were different the rules were different oh the fun was there and the excitement and the romance but there had already been spills and tangles didnt it follow that someone was going to get hurt however much he loved her she hadnt yet earned his trust and inches behind trust she thought was his respect he loved the woman he was with now she remembered but she wondered if he was waiting to see whether she would stay or run and she wondered deep down wondered if she was waiting too after all hed been born to a life of privilege had the intheblood advantage of being able to choose and discard anythingand anyoneat his leisure if it was true that hed wanted her for so long hed waited and watched and being josh hed reveled in the challenge now that the challenge had been met ill hate you for it she murmured and pressed her lips to his shoulder whoever does the hurting ill hate you for it she curled closer wishing he would wake wake and make her mindless again so she wouldnt have to worry and wonder i love you josh she laid her palm over his heart and counted the beats until hers matched them god help both of us chapter nineteen the cliffs were always the place margo went for thinking all of her major decisions had been made there who should be invited to her birthday party did she really want to cut her hair should she go to the homecoming dance with biff or marcus those decisions had seemed so monumental at the time the crash of waves the smell of the sea and wildflowers the jagged sweep of rocks from dizzying heights had both soothed and aroused her the emotions she felt here went into all those decisions it was here she had come the day before she ran away to hollywood just after lauras wedding she thought now she was eighteen and so certain that life with all its mysteries was passing her by she was desperate to see what was out there to see what she could make of it make from it how many arguments had she had with her mother during those last weeks she wondered too many to count she thought now youve got to go to college girl if you want to make something out of yourself its boring its useless theres nothing for me there i want more so you always have more what this time more everything and shed found it hadnt she margo mused more excitement more attention more money more men now that she had come full circle what did she have a new chance something of her own and josh she threw her head back watched a gull swoop skim the air and bullet out to sea far out on the diamondblue water a boat glided glossy and white the sun just catching the brasswork to wink and flash the wind swirled up and spun like a dancer teasing her hair whipping at the draping silk of her white tunic she felt shockingly alone there small and insignificant on the high spearing cliffs with destruction or glory only a few small steps away a metaphor for love she thought amused at herself deep thoughts had never been her forte she was alone without him solitary if commitment to josh was like a leap from a cliff would a woman like her fly up or tumble and crash if it was a risk she was willing to take what would it do to him would he trust her could he would he believe in her stand with her would he most of all be willing to hold through all the ups and downs of a life together and how in gods name had she leaped from love to marriage jesus she was actually thinking of marriage she had to sit down shaky she eased down onto a rock waited for her breath to come back marriage had never been a goal in her life the engagements had simply been a lark a tease no more serious to her than a wink and a smile marriage meant promises that couldnt be broken with a shrug it meant a lifetime a sharing of everything even children she shivered once pressed her hand to her stomach she wasnt the motherly type no no white picket fences and car pools were lightyears out of her realm noshe nearly laughed at herselfit wasnt even to be considered she would live with him the situation as it was now was perfect naturally it was the way he wanted it as well she couldnt understand why shed gotten so worked up over it the penthouse suite suited their needs their lifestyles gave them each a chance to fly off together or separately when the whim struck nothing permanent nothing that hinted at obligation of course that had been the answer all along hotel life was in his blood and it was part of her choice of living tired of looking at the same view pack up your clothes and find another of course that was what he would want and what she would be comfortable with then she turned and looked up higher still at the house with its rocksolid permanence its strength and its beauty towers added by new generations colorful tiles set by the old she knew that memories made there lasted forever dreams dreamt there never really faded away love spoken there bloomed as free and as wild as the tangled vines of bougainvillea but it wasnt hers a home of her own was something that had always eluded her she turned away again looked out to sea surprised that her eyes were stinging what do you want margo what in gods name do you want more more everything figured youd be here kate dropped down on the rocks beside her good day for sea gazing you must be feeling jazzed this morning laura laid a hand on her shoulder last night was a smash beginning to end shes brooding kate rolled her eyes at laura never satisfied im in love with josh margo stared straight ahead when she said it as if speaking to the wind kate pressed her lips together considered because she couldnt see margos eyes behind the shaded lenses she tipped them down on margos nose lowercase or uppercase t kate its not high school laura murmured its still a relevant question whats the answer im in love with josh margo repeated and hes in love with me weve lost our minds you mean it kate said slowly and shifted her gaze from margos eyes to lauras she means it ive got to walk margo rose quickly and began to follow the curving line of the cliffs ive got all this energy i dont know what to do with and all these nerves that keep circling around from my head to my gut and back again that doesnt have to be a bad thing laura told her you were in love with peter werent you laura looked down at her feet told herself it was necessary to watch her step yes yes i was once theres my point you were in love with him started a life together and then it all fell apart do you have any idea how many relationships ive watched unravel or just rip i couldnt count them nothing lasts forever my parents are the shining example of an exception to the rule wait a minute wait a minute kate grabbed at her arm are you and josh thinking of getting married no good god no absolutely not neither of us is the till death do us part type needing to be closer to the sea margo picked her way down some rocks do you want to be in love with him at kates question she looked over annoyed impatient its not a choice of course it is kate didnt believe that love or any other emotion was uncontrollable love isnt a spring suit laura put in that you try on for size kate merely moved her shoulders and scrambled agilely down to the ledge if it doesnt fit you put it aside as far as im concerned so margo does it fit or not i dont know but im wearing it maybe youll grow into it or laura worried grow out of it it was the tone that made margo stop concern was a layer over doubt i really do love him she said quietly i dont know exactly how to handle it yet but i do we dont seem to be able to talk it through sensibly i know i can see that part of him is hung up on the way ive lived the men ive been with oh right like hes been in a monastery copying scripture for the last ten years kate squared her shoulders her feminist flag waving high its none of his damn business if youve taken on the fifth six and seventh fleets a woman has just as much right as a man to be stupidly and irresponsibly promiscuous margo opened her mouth but for a moment she could only laugh at the cleverly insulting support thank you so much sister immaculata anytime sister slut my point is margo continued dryly that its not just gardenvariety jealousy with josh i could overlook that or be annoyed by that in this case he has cause to doubt and im not sure how long it will take to prove to both of us that that part of my life is over i think youre being too easy on him kate muttered and too hard on myself kate smiled cheerfully i didnt say that then i will laura said with an elbow jab to kates ribs its more than the men staring out to sea margo tried to make sense of it all thats just a kind of symptom i suppose he says hes proud of me what ive done to put my life back in order id say hes more surprised than anything else and because of that she said slowly i realize that its unlikely he really expects me to follow it all the way through to stand and to stay why should he she murmured remembering his sharp reaction to her recent photo shoot hes waiting for me to take off again to run to something bigger easier id say you dont have enough faith in him frowning kate studied margos face are you planning to run no it was something at last that she could be absolutely certain of ive finished running but with my track record the two of you better start concentrating on now laura interrupted where you are now and what you feel for each other now all the rest well that just brought you to where youre standing and who youre standing with it sounded so simple so clean margo struggled to believe it okay i think its best if we take it one step at a time margo decided like a recovery program in reverse reaching down she picked up a pebble tossed it out to sea meanwhile were in meanwhile it might be fun loves supposed to be laura smiled when its not hell youre the only one of the three of us whos been there margo glanced at kate for confirmation affirmative if it doesnt bother you would you mind telling me how you came out the other side i mean how did you fall out it did bother her it scraped her raw inside and left her a failure but she would never admit it it was gradual like water against rock gradually wears it down it wasnt a flash like waking up one morning and realizing i wasnt in love with my husband it was a slow nasty process a kind of calcifying of emotions in the end i felt nothing for him at all a terrifying thought margo decided not to feel anything for josh she was sure shed rather hate him than feel nothing for him or worse much worse she realized to have him feel nothing for her could you have stopped it no we might have been able to stop it but i couldnt not alone he never loved me and oh that stung that makes it entirely different than you and josh im sorry laura dont be easier laura leaned against margos supporting arm i have two beautiful daughters thats a pretty good deal all around and you have a chance for something special and uniquely yours i might take that chance she plucked another pebble tossed it well if youre looking to start a love nest an account i have is unloading a property about half a mile south of here getting into the spirit kate scooped up pebbles herself a beauty too california spanish were perfectly happy in the suite safe in the suite a small voice whispered in her head in limbo whatever works for you kate shrugged she believed strongly in the investment value of real estate a home was one thingit couldnt be measured in terms of short or longterm capital gains but property well chosen was a necessary addition to any wellrounded portfolio but its got a killer view how would you know i delivered some forms there once she caught margos smirk gutter mind the client is female she got the house in the divorce settlement and wants to sell it and buy something smaller lowermaintenance is that lily farmers house laura asked one and the same oh its beautiful two stories stucco and tile they had it completely restored about two years ago yep finished it up just in time to say adios he got the boat the bmw the labrador retriever and the coin collection she got the house the land rover and the siamese cat kate grinned there are no secrets from your cpa thats just the sort of thing im talking about and why i dont want a house a fourwheeldrive or a dog the very idea made margos stomach hurt ive simplified my life streamlined it anyway and ill be damned if im going to fuck it up again she had a handful of stones now and was shooting them over the edge like bullets what was it my mother always said begin as you mean to go on well thats just what im doing begin simple keep it simple josh doesnt want all those responsibilities any more than i do well leave it wait laura grabbed her wrist before she could heave the next stone what is that its not a rock frowning margo began to rub it with her thumb someone must have dropped some change i didnt notice its just a oh my jesus as she brushed off the dirt and sand it gleamed at her a small disk nestled in the palm of her hand its gold kate closed her hand over lauras and the three of them were linked its a doubloon holy god its a gold doubloon no no breathless margo shook her head its got to be one of those fake tokens they give away at the arcade in town but it had weight and such a fine gleam doesnt it look at the date laura managed seraphina margo pressed a hand to her head as it revolved like a carousel seraphinas dowry could it be it has to be kate insisted but it was just lying there weve walked along here hundreds of times we even searched here when we were kids we never found anything i guess we never looked in the right place kates eyes danced with excitement as she leaned up to give margo a hard smacking kiss lets look now as laughingly eager as the girls they had once been they crawled over the dirt and rocks ruining manicures nicking fingers maybe she didnt leave it hidden after all margo suggested maybe when he didnt come back and she decided she wouldnt live without him she just chucked it all scattering coins into the sea bite your tongue kate wiped sweat from her brow with a dusty forearm the three of us always swore wed find it and now that weve actually got a piece you want to have her taking the treasure into the sea with her i dont think shed do that muffling a yelp as she scraped a knuckle on rock laura sat back on her heels the dowry wasnt important to her anymore nothing was poor thing she was just a child she blew hair out of her eyes and speaking of children look at us it wasnt the order that made kate and margo stop it was the laughter that rolled out of her such a rare sound these days lauras low gurgling laugh and getting a good look at one of societys most respected matrons with her hair flying her face streaked with dirt her once wellpressed cotton shirt soiled with sweat and grime margo laughed with her then she clutched her stomach and pointed at kate who was on her hands and knees staring at them she managed to clutch a rock before the next spurt of laughter rolled her off the cliff jesus kate jesus even your eyebrows are dirty youre not exactly bandboxfresh yourself pal only you would go treasure hunting in white silk oh shit i forgot wincing margo looked down at herself the once spotless and fluid tunic was now filthy and stuck to her skin she let out a low moan this used to be an ungaro now its a rag kate said smartly next time try jeans and a tshirt like the rest of the peasants kate rose and brushed the dirt off her denim were never going to find anything this way we need to organize we need a metal detector thats actually a good idea margo decided where do we get one by the time margo got back to the penthouse it was dark she limped through the front door and began stripping as she aimed directly for the whirlpool josh halted in the act of pouring a glass of poully fuisse what in gods name have you been doing glass cracked against wood as he rushed to her was there an accident are you hurt no accident and i hurt everywhere she whimpered as she reached to turn on the hot water her fingers cramped painfully josh if you really do love me youll get me a glass of whatever you were pouring and you wont no matter how much you want to laugh at me he couldnt spot any blood as she eased her body into the water relieved he went back and brought two glasses filled with pale gold wine tell me thisdid you fall off a cliff not exactly she took a glass from him and downed the wine in a few greedy swallows she took a breath handed him the empty glass then took the full one thanks he only lifted a brow then went back for the bottle i know you took the girls to the beach and let them bury you in your clothes she leaned back groaned i work out regularly now how can there still be muscles i havent been using how can they hurt this much can you order me a massage ill give you one myself if we can stop playing guess what she opened her eyes she wanted to see if he laughed if she spotted so much as a quiver hed have to die i was with laura and kate and and we were treasure hunting you were he ran his tongue around his teeth hmm was that a chuckle no it was a hmm you spent the afternoon and a good part of the evening treasure hunting on the cliffs we got a metal detector you got a he tried manfully to disguise the laugh with a cough but her eyes narrowed did you figure out how to work it im not an idiot but she pouted and as the water level rose hit the button for jets kate did and before you make any other smart comments go check the pocket of my slacks out there she sank deeper sipped wine and felt as though she might live after all then you can apologize willing to play along he set his glass down on the ledge of the tub and sauntered into the other room her slacks were near the door less than a foot in front of where shed stepped out of her shoes and they were filthy enough to have him lifting them gingerly with two fingertips youre going to need a new treasurehunting outfit honey this ones shot shut up josh look in the pocket probably found a diamond that fell out of somebodys ring he muttered thinks shes hit the mother lode but his fingers closed over the coin with a puzzled frown he drew it out spanish coin more than a century old and bright as summer i dont hear any laughing out there she called out or any apology either she began to hum to herself as the churning water loosened her muscles sensing him in the doorway she flicked him a glance from under her lashes you dont have to grovel a simple please forgive me margo i was a fool will do nicely he flipped the coin and caught it neatly before sitting on the ledge one doubloon does not a treasure make rudyard kipling he had to grin j c templeton oh him she closed her eyes i always thought he was cynical and overblown take a breath darling he warned and dunked her when she surfaced sputtering he turned the coin over in his hand i admit its intriguing where exactly did you find it she was pouting and blinking water out of her eyes i dont see why i should tell you seraphinas dowry is a girl thing okay he shrugged and picked up his wine so what else did you do today at least you could wheedle she said in disgust ive cut way back on my wheedling he passed her the soap you really need this oh all right then one long gorgeous leg shot out of the water she soaped it lavishly it was on the cliffs in front of the house kate put a pile of stones up to mark the spot but we searched there for hours after i found the coin and didnt find so much as a plug nickel and what exactly is a plug nickel just a rhetorical question he said when she hissed at him look duchess im not going to spoil your fun youve got yourself a nice little prize here and the dates right who knows i know and kate and laura know she dragged her fingers through her wet hair and ill tell you something else it meant something to laura she lost that look in her eyes that wounded look that always seems to be there if she doesnt know youre watching when his face went grim she was sorry shed said it she covered his hand with hers i love her too firing the bastard wasnt enough you broke his nose there was that i dont want her hurting i dont know anyone who deserves it less than laura or who seems to handle it better she added giving his hand a quick squeeze you should have seen her today she was laughing and excited we even got the girls in on it i havent seen ali smile like that in weeks it was so much fun just the anticipation of what might be there he eyed the coin again before setting it down to gleam on the ledge so when are you going back we decided to make it a regular sunday outing she wrinkled her nose at the water i might as well be taking a mud bath and pulled the plug im starved do you mind eating in tonight i have to shower off and wash my hair he watched her rise up water sluicing off creamy skin in streams can we eat naked depends she laughed as she padded toward the shower whats on the menu the next morning loose with love she stretched as josh maneuvered through traffic you didnt have to drive me in she told him but i appreciate it i want to drop by the resort anyway check on a few things you havent mentioned any travel coming up things are covered she glanced out the window as if engrossed in the passing scenery once you replace peter youll have to go back to europe i imagine eventually im handling things from here well enough for now is that what you want she needed to keep the question easy for both of them to stay here he was as cautious as she why do you ask youve never stayed in one place for long there was never a reason to her lips curved thats nice but i dont want you to feel tied down both of us have to understand that the others business has demands if pretenses continues to do well ill have to start making buying trips hed considered that had already begun working on a solution where did you have in mind im not sure local estate sales wont do and for the clothing end of it i want to try my contacts first i could probably pitch a better ball in person la certainly and new york chicago and if it all keeps rolling back to milan london paris is that what you want i want the shop to shine sometimes i miss milan the being there the feeling of being in the center of something of having it all buzzing around me she sighed a little its hard to let go completely im hoping that if i can visit there a couple of times a year do business there now and again itll be enough dont you miss it too she turned to face him the people the parties some hed been too busy changing his life and hers to think about it but now that he did think he could admit that the whirl was in his blood theres no reason we couldnt coordinate your buying trips with my business just takes a little planning im getting better at planning when he pulled to the curb in front of pretenses she leaned over to kiss him its good isnt it this is good yeah he cupped her neck to linger over the kiss its very good all they had to do she thought was keep it that way ill take a cab back no i mean it she kissed him again before he could protest i should be there by seven so try not to work too late id love to go somewhere fabulous for dinner and neck over champagne cocktails i think i can arrange that ive never known you to fail he caught her hand as she started to alight i do love you margo she tossed him a brilliant smile i know chapter twenty it was a smug feeling spending the day in her own shop among her own things reaping the rewards of her first successful reception and so she told her mother when ann dropped by in the middle of the day with a box of margos old favorite chocolate chip cookies i just cant believe it all happened margo said over a greedy bite people have been coming in all day this is the first break i could manage mum i really think i have a business i mean i wanted to believe it all along i nearly believed it after the first day went so well but saturday night she closed her eyes and shoved the rest of the cookie into her mouth saturday night i really believed it you did a good job ann sipped the tea shed brewed in the upstairs kitchen though she raised an eyebrow at margos choice of champagnechampagne at lunchtimeshe didnt comment youve done a good job all these years all these years ive squandered my life my time my resources margo shrugged her shoulder the old ant and grasshopper story again mum despite herself ann felt a smile tug at her lips you never listened to that story never stored your larder for winter or so i thought she rose to walk to the doorway glanced into the tastefully decorated boudoir it looks as if youve been storing up after all no thats a different adage necessity being the mother of invention or maybe its desperation since she was working hard on honesty in the new margo she might as well start here i didnt plan it this way mum or want it this way ann turned back studied the woman who sat on the fussy ice cream chair with its hotpink cushion softer than shed been ann thought around the eyes and mouth she wondered that margo who had always been so aware of every inch of her own face didnt seem to notice the change so you didnt ann said at length and now now im going to make it work no thats wrong she picked up another cookie tapped it against her glass like a toast im going to make it fabulous pretenses is going to grow in another year or two ill open a branch in carmel thenwho knows a tastefully elegant little storefront in san francisco a funky shop in la still dreaming margo yes thats right still dreaming still going places just different places she tossed her hair back and smiled but there was an edge to it under it all im still the same margo no youre not ann crossed over cupped her daughters chin in her hand youre not but theres enough of the little girl i raised that i recognize you where did you come from she murmured your grandfathers caught fish to live your grandmothers scrubbed floors and hung out the wash with wooden pegs in high winds she picked up margos hand studied the long narrow palm the tapering fingers accented with pretty rings my mothers hand would have made two of yours big and hard and capable it was like mine she saw the surprise in margos eyes that she should speak so freely so casually of people she had never spoken of at all from selfishness ann had come to realize because if she didnt speak of them it didnt hurt so deeply to be without them oh shed made mistakes ann berated herself big and bad mistakes with the one child god had given her if it stung to try to fix them it was only just my mothers name was margaret she had to clear her throat i didnt mention that to you before because she died a few months after i left ireland and i felt guilty about leaving her when she was ailing and about being unable to go back and say goodbye i didnt talk to you of her or to anyone she would have been sad to know that im sorry was all margo could say im sorry mum so am ifor that and for not telling you sooner how she doted on you in the little time she had with you what the question was there but margo was afraid to ask it afraid it would be brushed off again what was she like anns lips curved in a quiet smile you used to badger me with questions like that when you were a small thing then you stopped asking because i never answered i should have she turned away crossed to the pretty eyebrow windows that offered the sounds and sights of busy streets her sin she realized had been one of cowardice and selfindulgence if the penance was the pain of remembering it was little enough before i answer i want to tell you that i never did before because i told myself not to look back with a small sound of regret she turned and walked to her daughter that it was more important to raise you up right than to fill your head with people who were gone your head was always filled with so much anyway margo touched the back of her mothers hand briefly what was she like she was a good woman hardworking but not hard she loved to sing and she sang when she worked she loved her flowers and could grow anything she taught us to take pride in our home and in ourselves she wouldnt take any nonsense from us and she doled out whacks and hugs in equal measure shed wait for my father to come home from the sea with a look in her eye i didnt understand until i was grown my grandfather what was he like a big man with a big voice he liked to swear so that my mother would scold him a smile ghosted around anns mouth hed come home from the sea smelling of fish and water and tobacco and hed tell us stories grand stories he could tell ann steadied herself brushed a few crumbs from the table i named you for my mother my father called her margo when he was teasing with her though i cant see her in you nor much of myself when it comes to it the eyes sometimes she continued while margo sat silently staring not the color of them but the shape and that stubborn look that comes into them thats me right enough but the colors your fathers he had eyes a woman could drown in and the light of them sweet jesus such a light in them it could blind you you never speak of him it hurt me to ann dropped her hand and sat again tiredly it hurt so i didnt then i got out of the habit and robbed you of him it was wrong of me not to share him with you margo what i did was keep him for myself she said in an unsteady voice all for myself i didnt give you your father margo took a shaky breath it felt as though a huge hard weight was pressing on her chest i didnt think you loved him didnt love him shock came first followed by a long rolling laugh mother of god girl not love him i had such a love for him my heart couldnt hold it every time i looked at him it flopped around like one of the fish hed toss on the table after a catch and when hed sweep me up as he liked to do and swing me around i wouldnt be dizzy from the spinning but just from the smell of him i can still smell him wet wool and fish and man she tried to picture it her mother young and laughing caught up in strong arms and wildly in love i thought i assumed that youd married him because you had to well of course i had to ann began then stopped eyes wide oh had to why my father would have thrashed him within an inch of his mortal life not that he didnt try my johnny she added with a quick smile he was a man after all and had his ways but i had mine as well and went to my wedding bed a proper if eager virgin i wasnt margo picked up her glass took a bracing sip i wasnt the reason he married you i was the reason he married me ann said with a lilt of pride in her voice and im sorrier than i can say that you had that thought planted in your head that i didnt realize it until this very moment i thoughti wondered how to put it margo wondered when there were so many emotions spinning you were so young she began again and in a strange country with a child to raise on your own you were never a burden to me margo a trial many a time she added with a wry curve of her lips but never once a burden nor were you a mistake so get that idea out of your head for good we had to get married margo because we loved each other we were desperate in love sweet and desperate and so young and it was all that sweet and desperate love that made you oh mum im so sorry sorry i had more in those four years god gave us than a less fortunate woman could pack into two lifetimes but you lost him yes i lost him and so did you you didnt have much time with him but he was a good father and god he adored every inch of you he used to watch you sleeping and touch your face with his fingertip as if he was afraid hed break you and hed smile so it seemed his face would split open with it she pressed a hand to her mouth because she could picture it too well still feel it too well still im sorry i never told you that its all right the weight was off her chest now but it welled full of tears its all right mum youve told me now ann closed her eyes a moment how could she explain that grief and love and joy could carry in a heart for a lifetime he loved us both margo and he was a fine man a kind one full of dreams for us for the other children we were going to have she fumbled in her pocket for a tissue and wiped away her tears silly to cry over it now twentyfive years its not silly to margo it was a revelation a beautiful wrenching one if there was grief after a quarter of a century then there had been love sweet and desperate and more enduring we dont have to talk about it anymore but ann shook her head blinked her eyes dry she would finish and give her child her johnnys child what should have been her birthright when they came back that night in the storm oh god what a storm it was wailing and blowing and the lightning breaking the sky into pieces she opened her eyes then met her daughters i knewi didnt want to believe but i knew he was lost before they told me because something was gone in here she pressed a hand to her heart just gone and i knew hed taken that part of my heart with him i didnt think i could live without him knew i didnt want to live without him ann linked her fingers together tight for the next would be harder still to speak of i was almost three months along with another baby you margo wiped at tears you were pregnant i wanted a son for johnny he said that would be fine because we already had the most beautiful daughter in all the world he kissed us goodbye that morning you then me then he laid his hand on me where the baby was growing and smiled he never came back they never found him so i could look at him again one last time to look at him i lost the baby that night in the storm and the grief and the pain lost johnny and the baby and there was only you how did anyone face that and manage to go on margo wondered what kind of strength did it take i wish i had known she took her mothers clasped hands in hers i wish i had known mum i would have tried to be better no thats nonsense after all these years ann realized she was still doing it wrong im not telling you enough of the good things there wasnt only grief and sorrow the truth is i had him in my life for so many years i first set my eyes on him when i was six and he was nine a fine strapping boy he was then johnny sullivan with a devils laugh and an angels eyes and i wanted him so i went after him putting myself in his face you margo sniffled you flirted with him shamelessly and by the time i was seventeen id broken him down and i snapped up his proposal of marriage before he could finish the words she sighed once long and deep understand and believe this i loved him margo greedily and when he died and the baby died inside me i wanted to die too and might have but for you you needed me and i needed you why did you leave ireland your family was there you must have needed them she could still look back to that to rocky cliffs and tempestuous seas id lost something id thought i would have forever something i loved something id wanted all my life i couldnt bear even the air there without him i couldnt breathe it it was time for a fresh start something new were you frightened only to death her lips curved again and suddenly she had an urge for a taste of champagne herself she took her daughters glass sipped i made it work so maybe theres more of me in you than i thought ive been hard on you margo i havent understood how hard until just recently ive done some praying over it you were a frighteningly beautiful child and willful with it a dangerous combination there was a part of me that was afraid of loving you too much because well to love so full again was like tempting god i couldnt show you didnt think i could dare because if i lost you id never have been able to go on i always thought margo trailed off shook her head no say it you should say whats inside you i thought i wasnt good enough for you thats my fault ann pressed her lips together and wondered how she could have let so many years slip away with that between them it was never a matter of that margo i was afraid of and for you i could never understand why you wanted so much and i worried that you were growing up in a place where there was so much and all of it belonging to others and maybe i dont understand you even now but i love you i should have told you more often its not always easy to say it or to feel it but i always knew you loved me but you havent known that im proud of you ann sighed it was her own pride after all that had kept her silent i was proud the first time i saw your face in a magazine and every time after she drank again prepared to confess i saved them margo blinked saved them all your pictures mr josh sent them to me and i put them in a book well books she corrected because there got to be so many she smiled foolishly at the empty glass i believe im just a little tipsy without thinking margo rose to get the bottle from the refrigerator took off the silver cap and poured her mother more you saved my photos and put them in scrapbooks and the articles too the little snips of gossip she gestured with her glass i wasnt always proud of those ill tell you and i have a feeling that boy held back the worst of them margo understood that josh was that boy and smiled he would only have been thinking of you no hes always thought of you ann inclined her head theres a man blind in love if ever there was one what are you made of margo are you as smart as your mother to latch on to a strong handsome man wholl make you dizzy in bed and out she caught herself when margo snorted and she struggled for dignity its the drink its sinful to be drinking in the middle of the day have another and take a cab home maybe i will at that well whats your answer then are you going to leave the man dangling or reel him in proper dangling had seemed a fine idea the best idea and now she wasnt sure im going to have to give that some thought mum thank you for giving my father to me i should have no a little surprised at herself margo shook her head no lets not worry aboutshould haves well be here all day pitching them back and forth between us lets start with now ann had to use her tissue again i did a better job with you than ive given either one of us credit for i have a fine daughter touched margo pressed her lips to her mothers cheek lets say you still have a work in progress and speaking of work she added knowing both of them were about to start weeping again you enjoy the rest of your wine my lunch breaks over and i have to go down and open up i have photographs ann swallowed hard id like to show you sometime id like to see them very much like to see them margo walked to the doorway paused mum im proud of you too and what youve made of your life josh heard the sound of girlish laughter as he circled the east terrace toward the pool the squeals and splashing lightened his heart as the curved sweep of water came into view he grinned a race was on obviously laura was holding back keeping her strokes small and slow when she was serious about her pace no one could beat her it used to infuriate him having his little sister outdistance him but then as captain of her swim team shed gone allstate and had even flirted with the olympics now she was letting her daughters overtake her all but crawling to the edge as ali put on a furious burst of speed i won ali bounced in the water i beat you to the side then her bottom lip poked out you let me i gave you a handicap laura ran a hand over alis slickedback hair then smiled as kayla surfaced her mouth working like a guppys just like you gave your sister a handicap because youre bigger and faster and stronger i want to win on my own the way youre going you will she bent to kiss kayla between the eyes both of you swim like mermaids the thought of that made the mutiny die out of alis eyes and kayla swim backward with a dreamy smile im a mermaid kayla claimed i swim all day with the dolphins im still faster ali started to push off then caught a movement out of the corner of her eye she saw a man tall the suit the glint of hair her heart speared up but when she blinked her eyes clear of water she saw it wasnt her father after all uncle josh uncle josh uncle josh is here kayla kicked her feet to send water flying come in and swim with us were mermaids anyone could see that im afraid im not dressed to play with mermaids but theyre fun to watch to entertain him kayla did handstands somersaults not to be outdone ali rushed to the board to show him how her diving had improved he whistled and applauded offered advice as laura climbed out and toweled off shed lost weight even a brother could see that he had to concentrate on keeping his smile in place for the girls and not allowing his teeth to grind together got a minute he asked her when shed bundled into a terrycloth robe sure girls shallow end that brought groans and complaints but both of them paddled in is there a problem at work not precisely you mentioned you wanted to take a more active part the frown came as he wandered toward a gar denia bush he wanted to be out of the girls hearing youve got a lot on your plate laura i dont want your job josh she smiled and combed her fingers through hair that the water had curling wildly i just think its time i paid attention i let things slide by me before its never going to happen again youll piss me off if you start blaming yourself it takes two people to make a marriage laura sighed making sure she kept her daughters in view as they walked along the edge of the garden in the distance were the stables the lovely old stucco and darkbeamed building tucked behind the slope of the uneven land she wished there were horses inside or frisking in the paddock she wished she had the time to tend to them as she did when she was a girl im not taking it on josh what peter did was inexcusable it was bad enough that he ignored his children but then to take what was theirs and yours he reminded her yes and mine im going to make it back its going to take a while but im going to make it back honey you know if you need money no she shook her head no im not taking money from you or mom and dad im not using templeton money i havent earned to pay for my life not as long as the girls arent doing without she smiled a little running a hand over his arm as they walked lets be realistic josh the three of us have a beautiful home food on the table their tuitions paid there are plenty of women who find themselves in my position and have nothing left it doesnt make your situation any less rotten how long are you going to be able to pay the servants laura and the tuition if youre determined to use only your share of profits from the shop shed worried about the servants how could she let them go when most of them had been at templeton house for years what would mrs williamson or old joe the gardener do if she had to cut the staff pretenses is bringing in money and i have the dividends from templeton stockwhich i intend to start earning ive got time on my hands josh and im tired of filling it up with committees and lunches and fundraisers that was peters lifestyle you want a job actually i thought i might be able to work part time its not that im destitute its that its long past time that i started to make my own way i look at kate and the way shes always worked toward what she wanted and margo then i look at me just stop it ive got something to prove she said evenly and im damn well going to do it youre not the only templeton in this generation who knows hotels i know about putting events together catering entertainment id have to juggle time with the shop and the girls of course when can you start she stopped dead do you mean it laura you have just as much interest in templeton as i do ive never done anything for it or about it not for years anyway why she grimaced because peter didnt want me to my job as he told me often was being mrs peter ridgeway it would she understood always humiliate her to admit it you know what finally occurred to me a year or so ago josh my name was nowhere in there i was nowhere in there uncomfortable he looked over toward the pool where his nieces were having a contest to see who could hold her breath longer i guess marriage is a loss of identity no it isnt it shouldnt be it was salt in a raw wound to admit it but i let it be i always wanted to be perfect perfect daughter perfect wife perfect mother its been a hard slap in the face to realize i couldnt be any of those things he laid his hands on her shoulders and gave her a little shake how about perfect sister you wont hear any complaints from me touched she rested her hands on top of his if i were the perfect sister id be asking you why you havent asked margo to marry you she tightened her grip when he would have slipped his hands away you love each other understand each other id say you have more in common than any two people i know including fear of taking the next step maybe i like the step im on is it enough josh really enough for you or for margo damn youre pushy thats only one required element of the perfect sister restless he moved away stopped to toy with a pale pink rosebud ive thought about it marriage kids the whole package pretty big package he murmured lots of surprises inside you used to like surprises yeah but one thing margo and i have in common is an appreciation for being able to pick up and move whenever we like ive lived in hotels for the last dozen years because i like the transience the convenience hell he broke off the bloom handed it absently to laura ive been waiting for her all my life i always figured after the wait was over id bide my time a year or two of fun and gameswhich is exactly what she expects of me how she thinks of me then id sneak the idea of marriage in on her with a half laugh laura shook her head is this a chess game or a relationship josh its been a chess game until recently move and countermove i finessed her into falling in love with me do you really think so laura clucked her tongue and slid the rosebud into the lapel of his jacket men are such boobs she rose on her toes to kiss him lightly ask her i dare you he had to wince i wish you hadnt put it like that one more element of the perfect sister is knowing her brothers deepest weakness blissfully ignorant of the plans afoot margo watched a satisfied customer walk out the door the way her feet were aching she was relieved that laura would be putting in a half day tomorrow as it was fivefortyfive she considered cashing out for the day maybe nipping out just a few minutes early to go back to the suite and make herself beautiful for the fabulous dinner josh had promised her the advantages to her new life were just piling up she decided as she swung around the counter and slipped out of her shoes not only was she proving that she had a brain as well as a body but she had discovered a whole new aspect of her background to explore her parents had loved each other perhaps it was foolish for a grown woman to find such comfort and joy in that but she knew it had opened something in her heart some things do last forever she thought love held and tonight she was going to tell josh what she knew what she believed and what she wanted a real life a full life a married life it made her laugh to imagine his face when she proposed to him she would have to be clever in her phrasing she mused while she transferred cash out of the till into the bag for deposit a subtle challenge she decided but not too subtle she would make him happy they would travel the world together go to all those exciting places they both loved and always come back here because here was home for both of them it had taken her much too long to accept that she glanced up as the door opened pushed back impatience with a shopkeepers smile then squealed claudio she was around the counter in a dash her hands flung out toward the tall handsomely distinguished man this is wonderful she kissed both of his cheeks before drawing back to arms length to beam at him he was of course as stunning as ever silver wings flew back from his temples into thick black hair his face was smooth and tanned set off by his long roman nose and the light in his chocolatebrown eyes bella he brought both of her hands to his lips molta bella i was set to be angry with you margo mia but now seeing you im weak appreciating him she laughed what is italys most successful film producer doing in my little corner of the world looking for you my own true love ah that was nonsense of course but they had always understood each other perfectly now youve found me claudio so i have and he could see immediately that he need not have worried she was glowing and the rumors and buzzing i heard when i returned from location were true after all la margo is running a shop with a challenging gleam in her eye she lifted her chin so so he spread his hands expressively so let me get you a glass of champagne darling and you can tell me what youre really doing in monterey i tell you i come to search for my lost love but he winked at her as he accepted the glass i had a bit of business in los angeles how could i come so close without seeing you it was sweet of you and i am glad to see you you should have called me when there was trouble for you it seemed a lifetime ago she only shrugged i got through it that alain hes a pig claudio stalked around the shop in the long limber strides he used to stalk a soundstage his burst of gutter italian termed alain as a great deal more and less than a mere pig i cannot but agree margo said when he had run down if you had called my offices the studio they would have gotten word to me i would have swept down on my winged charger and saved you she could picture it claudio was one of the few men who wouldnt look foolish on a winged charger i saved myself but thanks you lost bella donna im sorry for it so was i but now i have this his head angled his mouth quirked a shopkeeper margo mia a shopkeeper claudio come he took her hand again and though his voice was teasing his eyes were serious let me whisk you away from this to roma with me i have a new project to begin in a few months theres a part perfect for you cara shes strong sexy glamorous heartless she laughed delightedly claudio you flatter me six months ago id have snapped it up without worrying that im not an actress now i have a business so let someone else see to it come with me ill take care of you he reached out toyed with her hair but his eyes were serious well have that affair we always meant to have we never got around to that did we thats why we still like each other no claudio though i am very very touched and very very grateful i dont understand you he began to prowl again you werent meant to make change and box trinkets this is not thedio these are your dishes he stopped at a shelf and gawked you have served me pasta on these plates good eye she murmured that eye was dazed as he turned back began to recognize other things he had admired as a guest in her home in milan i thought it was a joke a poor one that you were selling your possessions margo it should not have come to this you make it sound as though im living out of a shopping cart in an alley its humiliating he said between his teeth no its not she bristled then calmed herself he was only thinking of her or the woman he had known she margo realized would have been humiliated its not i thought it would be but i was wrong do you want to know what it is claudio he swore again ripely and gave serious thought to hauling her over his shoulder and carrying her off yes i want to know what it is she came close to him until they were eye to eye its fun he nearly choked fun great wonderful giddy fun and do you know what else im good at it really good at it you mean this youre content no im not content im happy its mine i sanded the floors i painted the walls he paled a little pressed a hand to his chest please my heart i scrubbed the bathrooms she laughed and gave him a bracing kiss and i loved it he tried to nod but couldnt quite pull it off id have some more wine if you please all right but then you have to browse she filled his glass and her own before tucking her arm through his and while were browsing ill tell you what you can do for me anything you know a lot of people her mind was working quickly as she led him toward the stairs people who grow tired of last years fashions or the trinkets they bought you could give them my name id like first shot at the discards jesus was all he could say as they climbed the stairs the first thing josh noted when he walked into the shop was the deposit bag he shook his head at her carelessness then locked the door going behind the counter he tucked the bag back into the tilland noticed her shoes he was going to have a little talk with her about basic precautions but it could wait in his pocket was his grandmothers ring he was still rolling with the excitement hed felt when hed lifted it out of the safety deposit box the squarecut russian white diamond might have been fashioned with margo in mind it was sleek and glamorous and full of cold fire he was going to dazzle her with it he would even go so far as to get down on one kneeafter he had plied her with a little champagne a man needed an edge with margo she would probably balk at the idea of marriage but he would sweettalk her into it seduce her into it if necessary it wouldnt be such a sacrifice the image of her wearing nothing but his ring was alluring enough to calm the nerves in the pit of his stomach enough fun and games he told himself time for serious business he started up the steps nearly called out to her when he heard her laughter drift out like smoke nearly smiled before he heard the low male chuckle that followed a customer he told himself furious at the instant knee jerk of jealousy but when he walked to the doorway of the boudoir the knee jerk jolted into a full vicious kick she was locked in a mans arms and the kiss had enough smolder to singe him where he stood he thought of murder bloody bonebreaking brainsplattering murder his hands clenched into ready fists the snarl already in his throat but pride was nearly as violent an emotion as vengeance it iced over him in a gale wind as margo drew back claudio her voice was a silky purr im so glad you came i hope we can she spotted josh then and myriad emotions flickered over her face surprise pleasure guilt amusement the amusement didnt last his eyes were hard and cold and much too easy to read josh i wasnt expected he said coolly i know but i dont think an apology for the interruptions in order this is a friend from rome she began but he cut off her explanation with a look that sliced to the bone save the introductions margo i wont keep you from entertaining your friend josh he was halfway down the stairs before she reached the landing wait he shot her one last lethal look as he flipped open the lock on the front door stay healthy margo stay away from me cara claudio laid a hand on margos shoulder where she stood shivering at the base of the stairs im surprised he let us live i have to fix it i have to make him listen do you have a car yes of course but if i could suggest giving him a little time to calm it doesnt work that way with josh her hand was shaking as she reached for her purse forgetting her shoes please claudio i need a ride chapter twentyone shed worked up a fine head of steam by the time she burst into the penthouse being angry being furious was better than being terrified and she had been terrified when shed read that cold disgust in his eyes heard the icy dismissal in his voice she wasnt going to tolerate that no sir not for one new york minute he was going to have to crawl josh templeton you bastard she slammed the door at her back and darted toward the bedroom in bare feet how dare you walk out on me that way how dare you embarrass me in front of my friend her breath caught with a jerk of a heartbeat when she saw him at the closet calmly transferring clothes into a garment bag what are you doing packing i have to make a run to barcelona the hell with that youre not just walking out shed taken two strides forward with the intent of ripping the clothes free when he whirled on her dont do it was all he said and it shocked her anger back to fear this is childish she began but her teeth chattered as panic shot frozen fingers up her spine you dont even deserve an explanation but im willing to overlook your filthy attitude and give you one claudio and i i didnt ask for an explanation in quick jerks he zipped the bag no she said slowly youve already made up your mind what you saw what it meant what i am ill tell you what i saw he dipped his hands into his pockets to keep them off her throat but his fingers brushed the velvet box he carried and doubled his fury and pain i saw you in the bedroom a couple of glasses of champagne nice soft light coming in through the lace curtains a very romantic setting you had your mouth on another manyour usual type too if im not mistaken fiftyish rich foreign he lifted the bag from the hanger folded it what it meant margo is that i walked in on the first act you should be able to figure out what that makes you she would rather hed used his fists on her surely there would have been less pain in that you believe that he hesitated how could she sound so hurt how dare she sound hurt after shed ripped out his heart and stomped on it while it was still beating youve sold sex your whole life duchess why should you change what little color that was left in her cheeks drained i suppose thats true it looks like my mistake was giving it to you for free nothings free he bit off the words like stringy meat and you had your fun as well i fit most of the requirements didnt i im not old enough to be your father but i qualify for the rest rich restless irresponsible just another social piranha living off the family fortune thats not true she said furious with panic i dont think we know what we think of each other margo he spoke calmly now had to speak calmly youve never had any more respect for me than you do for yourself i thought i could live with that i was wrong i told you in the beginning i dont share and i dont want a woman who thinks im stupid enough or shallow enough to overlook her old friends josh she stepped forward but he slung the bag over his arm id like you out by the end of the week of course she stood where she was as he brushed by her she didnt cry not even when she heard the door close she simply sank to the floor and rocked byron de witt agreed to take over ridgeways position hell be ready to make the move to california in six to eight weeks thats fine thomas sipped his afterdinner coffee and exchanged a look with his wife as their son prowled the drawing room of their villa hes a good man sharp toughminded youll go back susan crossed her legs through the transitional period its not really necessary things are again in running order i wasnt able to lure our old chef back he flashed a fleeting grin but the one i stole from the bhh is working out well hmm he needed to go back susan thought but she would work on that hows laura doing in conventions shes a templeton he started toward the brandy reminded himself that was too easy and settled for coffee shes got a knack for handling people susan lifted a brow a signal that she was tossing the ball back into her husbands court he picked it up smoothly and shes putting in time at the shop not overdoing is she kate says not shes a reliable source id feel better if one of us could keep an eye on her for a while yet shes in a rough patch dad shes handling it i cant go play babysitter you look tired susan said mildly thats probably why youre so cranky remember tommy how hed squall if he missed his nap jesus im not cranky im trying to get business settled i have to be in glasgow tomorrow afternoon i dont have time to he caught himself as his parents watched him indulgently there was nothing worse than being smiled at like a fretful child unless it was being a fretful child sorry dont give it a thought thomas rose slapped him on the back what you needs a drink a cigar and a nice game of billiards josh rubbed his tired eyes when was the last time hed slept really slept two weeks three it couldnt hurt he decided you go ahead tommy and set things up for your man hour she patted the cushion beside her i want josh to keep me company for a few more minutes understanding tommy strolled off fifty bucks a ball he called out hell trounce me josh muttered as he sat he always does we all have our game she patted his knee hers was a deft and merciless knack for interrogation now are you going to tell me what happened between you and margo hasnt kate given you a full report she ignored the annoyance in his tone was sorry for the bitterness underneath it reports are spotty apparently margo is being stubbornly closemouthed all kate can drag out of her is that the two of you decided to call it a day well then and you expect me to believe its as simple as that when youre sitting here looking mean and miserable i caught her with another man joshua susan set her cup down with a snap no she said positively you didnt i walked into the goddamn bedroom and there they were she hurt for him couldnt help but hurt for him still she shook her head you misinterpreted something what the hell is there to misinterpret he shot back and sprang up to pace again i walked in and she was kissing another man fucking claudio josh she wasnt so much shocked by the word but she had taken his statement literally i dont believe that no i didnt mean frustrated he dragged both hands through his hair it hadnt gotten that far yet i meant she called him claudio oh her heart settled a little well what was her explanation he stopped his pacing to stare at her do you really think i waited around for explanations on a long sigh she picked up her coffee again no of course you didnt you stormed out wishing them both to go to hell im surprised you didnt toss him out the window on your way i thought about it he said with relish i thought about tossing both of them it seemed more civilized to leave more pigheaded she corrected oh sit down joshua youre making me tired just watching you you know you should have given her a chance to explain i didntdontwant excuses and explanations damn it i overlooked the hordes of men from before but ah susan said with a satisfied nod now they had nailed it did you now did you really i was working on it he found he did want a brandy after all and poured a generous snifter before he obeyed her command to sit when i came home and found her posing naked in our bed i took it in stride he caught his mothers eye pretty much in stride that was business and when we go out to a restaurant or to the club and every man within half a mile has drool running down the side of his chin i shrug it off mostly shame on me ive raised a jealous fool thanks for your support you listen to me i understand it must be difficult on one level to love a woman who looks like margo the kind of woman who attracts men inspires fantasies good he gulped at the brandy i feel better now the point is thats the woman you fell in love with now let me ask you did you fall in love with her because she has a beautiful face and a stunning body is that all you see when you look at her its the sort of thing that drills between the eyes but he sighed surrendered no thats not all i see thats not why i fell in love with her shes warm and reckless and stubborn shes got more guts and brains than she realizes shes generous and shes loyal ah loyal susan smiled smugly id hoped you wouldnt overlook that its one of her most admirable traits and a woman with margos sense of loyalty would not have done what you accused her of doing go home josh and deal with this he set the snifter down closed his eyes it wasnt just the men it was seeing her that way and realizing when i did what we had together and didnt have telling her i loved her didnt seem to be enough showing her didnt seem to be enough she doesnt want what i want and shed be shocked speechless if she knew what i wanted what do you want she smiled and brushed at his hair i wont be shocked speechless everything he murmured usually margo understands everything just fine but not this time she doesnt see marriage and family and commitment when she looks at me she sees a pampered idiot whos more interested in finetuning his backhand than in making a contribution to his legacy or building a life i think youre underestimating both of you but if youre right you only proved her point by walking away before you sorted it out id have killed her if id stayed i didnt know she could hurt me like this i didnt know anyone could i know im sorry when you were little and you were hurt i could make it better by sitting you in my lap and holding on he looked at her loved her lets try this he lifted her into his lap and held on i think itll work kate sauntered into the shop at midafternoon shed had to take an hour off but she loved being the messenger hows it going troops laura glanced up as she slid the credit card machine back under the counter automatically she glanced at her watch to be certain she hadnt lost a couple of hours the girls had to be picked up from dance class at sixthirty sharp its going pretty good what are you doing here this time of day taking a break wheres margo shes in the wardrobe room with a couple of customers kate lowering her voice laura leaned over the counter we sold my rubies kates mind shuffled back the necklace oh but laura you loved that necklace she only shrugged peter gave it to me for our fifth anniversarybought it naturally with my money im glad its gone and her share would go a long way toward paying next years tuition for her daughters and theres more my supervisor called me in this morning and gave me a raise kate waited a beat the daughter of the owners has a supervisor and gets a raise i dont understand life i wanted to start at an entry position its only fair okay okay kate held up a hand to hold her off she understood the need to prove oneself had been scrambling to do just that all her life congratulations pal so i guess everybodys happy laura had to sigh as she glanced back toward the wardrobe room not everybody she still being stoic and stubborn i could shake her laura said fiercely she flits around here all day as if nothing in the world is wrong and as if a couple of layers of polished ivory base coat can hide the shadows under her eyes still refusing to move back into the house the resort has everything she needs she loves it there laura sucked air through her nose im going to hit her the next time she says that and shes already making excuses for skipping the treasure hunt this weekend sundays the only time she

we didnt have any shoes that worked ill find someor go barefoot flushed with the pleasure of the hunt the woman elbowed her friend give her your credit card mary kay and live a little okay okay the kids can always get new shoes next month when margo snatched back her hand appalled mary kay let out a long cheerful laugh only kidding but if you want to take an extra ten percent off not on your life she rang up both sales while laura competently wrapped and boxed the gowns i ought to charge you an extra ten for making my heart stop how about we call it even and i tell you i love it in here when my conscience is clear again im coming back for that silver evening bag shaped like an elephant buy it now and take the ten percent i mary kays mouth worked for a moment then she shut her eyes tight ring it up go ahead but i cant watch a few minutes later margo watched the door close then dusted her hands together another satisfied victimi mean customer right killer laura filed the credit slips you gave her a hell of a deal yeah but theyll both be backand the formal wear is slow to move whats going on kate did you run out of red ink oh i can always find a fresh supply actually i had a couple of errands to run so i slipped out a little early and i like to check up on my investment going to audit the books not until the first of the year she said blithely how much is my partners discount on those wineglasses there the ones rimmed with gold my bosss grandson is getting married margo decided to sneak a cigarette you pay the full shot and get your share out of the profits god youre tough well box them up pretty but i want laura to wrap them you still screw it up margo smiled sweetly sorry im on my break box them yourself cant get decent help anymore kate muttered but she ran her tongue around her teeth as she took the box laura handed her and carefully began to pack the glasses oh guess who called the office right before i left donald trump looking for a new accountant i wish she glanced casually at margo and brought the box to the counter josh out of the corner of her eye she watched margos hand freeze on the way to her lips jerk then continue smoke billowed out in a shaky stream id better straighten up the other clothes mary kay and her pal tried on she started to crush out her cigarette in nervous taps and kate continued hes back in town back the cigarette kept smoldering as margos hand dropped away here well at the hotel i want the silver bells laura with a silver ribbon he said he had some business to finish up she smiled sweetly at margo something he left hanging and you just had to rush right over here to rub my face in it nope i rushed right over here to slap your face in it a rude but effective wakeup call laura commented and earned a shocked stare i expected better from you you shouldnt have hands brisk and competent she affixed a shiny silver bow to the box if you dont want to tell us what happened between you and josh fine but you cant expect us to sit around quietly while you mope i have not been moping weve been cleaning up the blood spilling out of your heart for weeks kate passed laura her credit card face it pal youre just no fun anymore and thats all this friendship is about fun i thought i might get a little support a little sympathy a little compassion sorry laura imprinted the card with a steady sweep fresh out well the hell with you she snatched up her purse the hell with both of you we love you margo that stopped her she whirled back to glare at kate thats a lousy thing to say bitch when kate grinned she tried to grin back instead she dropped her purse back behind the counter and burst into tears oh shit shocked kate leaped forward to gather her close oh hell oh shit lock the door laura im sorry margo im sorry bad plan i thought youd just get mad and go tearing off to fix his butt what did the bastard do to you honey ill fix his butt for you he dumped me thoroughly ashamed she sobbed wretchedly on kates shoulder he hates me i wish he were dead i wish i had slept with claudio wait whoa firmly kate drew her back while laura brought over a cup of tea whos claudio and when didnt you sleep with him hes a friend just a friend and i never slept with him the tears were so hot it felt as though her eyes were on fire especially not when josh found us in the bedroom uhoh kate rolled her eyes at laura is it a french farce or a greek tragedy you be the judge shut up kate come on margo lets sit down this time you tell us everything christ i feel like a fool now that everything had poured out she felt not only foolish but empty hes the fool laura corrected for jumping to conclusions give the guy a break kate handed margo another tissue the evidence was pretty damning not that he should have taken off before he listened she added quickly when margo sniffled but you have to look at it from his side a little i have looked at it from his side and she was finished weeping i really cant blame him i wouldnt go that far kate began no i cant the history was there why should he trust me because he loves you laura put in because he knows you thats what i told myself when i was busy hating him but now saying it all out loud its hard for me to believe me he thinks i look at him and the whole relationship as one more exciting amusement and its probably better that it happened before i before you kate prompted before i asked him to marry me suddenly she covered her face with her hands but this time it was laughter that poured out can you believe it i was going to propose i was going to set the scenecandlelight wine musicand when i had him wrapped around my finger i was going to pop the question what a brainstorm i think its wonderful i think its perfect this time it was lauras eyes that overflowed kate tugged a tissue free for herself and i think you should go get him go get him margo snorted he cant even look at me pal you go fix your face get yourself back in gear and he wont have a chance it was such a huge risk margo told herself he wouldnt even come and if he did he wouldnt listen but she was willing to dream one more time fingering the gold coin in her pocket she wandered the sloped lawn in front of the house it was everything kate had said a magnificent example of california spanish at its best with the elegant arched windows the dull red of handrolled tile on the roof the recessed doorway of the entrance tower was framed in floral tiles bougainvillea climbed riotously and the view she turned to it drew in a long greedy breath all sea and cliffs beyond the sweeping road perhaps seraphina had stood there walked there mourning her lost love but margo wanted to believe she had walked there with him when hope and dreams were still vivid she needed that hope now as she saw joshs car zip down the road and swing up the snaking drive oh god just one more chance all or nothing now her heart was pounding like the surf when he stepped out of his car the wind blew through his hair the sun shot light off the dark glasses he wore and she couldnt see his eyes but his mouth was set and cold i wasnt sure youd come i said i would he was still reeling from her call one that had come even as hed cursed himself and reached for the receiver to call her these your new digs no i havent risen back up in the world quite that much it belongs to a client of kates shes moved out its empty her breath was almost steady and she was pleased with the easy measured tone i thought neutral ground would be best fine he wanted to touch her just touch her so badly his hands ached with it do we start with small talk how are you hows business no it was easier to walk than to look at him looking at her she could already feel the humiliation and she accepted it shed already lost him once she could live through anything now ill just say this straight out so we can get it done with i didnt sleep with claudio in fact i never slept with him hes one of those rare finds a true male friend im not telling you this to put things back the way they were i dont want them the way they were but i dont want you believing i was unfaithful i apologize he said stiffly he still wanted to touch her if only to wrap his hands around her throat hed come knowing he would beg her to take him back to forgive him for being a jealous insensitive idiot and she was already telling him she didnt want him and i dont want an apology i might have reacted the same way if the situation had been reversed she turned her head toward him and smiled after id torn her eyes out and stomped on your throat it was a close call he said struggling to match her light tone i know her smile warmed ive known you long enough to recognize murder in your eyes when i see it she only wished she could see his eyes now and i think i understand that you left the way you did before you did something or said something neither of us could live with i said more than i should have certainly more than was warranted ill apologize for that too then ill say im sorry for kissing claudio even though it was a kiss of friendship and gratitude hed come to offer me his help and a part in his next movie it took him only a moment oh that claudio emotions swirled and tightened and threatened to strangle him well thats a break for you could be she said with a careless shrug and started walking again in any case in retrospect i can see just how it looked and why you reacted the way you did he swore lightly just how guilty do you want me to be thats probably guilty enough she turned and this time she laid a hand on his arm but i need to tell you that you were wrong about something else i dont think about you the way you seem to believe i know youre not spoiled and careless maybe i used to think that and maybe i once resented the fact that you were born to all the advantages i thought i wanted hell i did want them she corrected with a quick smile it used to irritate me that you didnt have to fight for them you always made that clear i suppose i did but what i havent made clear is how much i admire the man youve made of yourself i know how important you are to templeton and how important templeton is to you ive come to understand just how much responsibility you have and how seriously you take it since wewell since weve been together its important to me that you believe that you make me feel like an idiot he had to walk away from her crossing the tiled terrace to look out to the cliffs it matters he managed what you think of me matters he turned back i was fascinated and often irritated by the girl you were margo she cocked a brow you always made that clear i still am fascinated and often irritated but i admire the woman youve made of yourself margo i admire her a great deal so there was hope she thought closing her eyes briefly and where there was hope there could be trust and respect and certainly love i want us to be friends again josh youre too important to my life to do without we managed to be friends before i want us to be friends again friends it threatened to choke him i think both of us forgot that part of our history along the way i wouldnt want that to happen again she was smiling at him the wind making a sexy mess of of her fancy braid the sun slanting in her eyes as it drifted lazily down in the west you can stand there and tell me you think friendship is the answer its one of them an important one he couldnt start all over again it would kill him the rage of love inside him would never settle for something as patient as friendship slowly he crossed back to her one of us has lost his or her mind lets give it some time we can start with you giving me some friendly advice smooth as silk she tucked her hand through his arm and guided him around the side of the house isnt this place fabulous wait until you see the fountain in the back its charming of course i think it should have a pool theres enough land for a small freeform and the view from that upper balconythat must be the master suite dont you think its got to be incredible i guess theres at least two fireplaces i havent been inside yet but im hoping theres one in the master bedroom wait a minute hold on his mind was spinning her perfume was clouding his brain and her words jammed into his consciousness and look at this bougainvillea it really should be cut back but i love it wild the terrace is perfect for entertaining isnt it and the location couldnt be better just up the coast from the shop and all but next door to templeton house i said hold it he turned her around took a firm grip on her shoulders are you thinking of buying this place its a onceinalifetime chance her only chance kate says its a fabulous deal a solid investment and you know how pessimistic she is it isnt even going on the market until next weekthere was some problem with clearing the deedso its ground floor jesus duchess you never change her heart lightened a bit at the amused exasperation in his tone should i listen this place has got to run at least three hundred k three hundred fifty but kate thinks three hundred will close it dream on he muttered i am youve been in business less than a year a month before that you were sniffing at bankruptcy there isnt a bank on the planet thats going to approve a loan of this size margo you just cant afford it i know she aimed her best smile the one that had earned her fleeting fame and fortune but you can he did choke you want me to buy a damn house for you sort of she toyed with the button of his shirt shot a look up from under her lashes i thought if you bought it and married me we could both live here he couldnt get a word out when his vision hazed he realized he wasnt breathing either i have to sit down i know how you feel she linked her hands together found them damp as he lowered himself to a bench you want me to buy a house and marry you so you can live in it so we can live in it she corrected together when were not traveling you just got finished telling me you didnt want things back the way they were i dont it was too easy before too easy to dive in too easy to walk i want to make it hard i want to make it very very hard i love you because her eyes were filling she turned away i love you so much i can live without you you dont have to worry that ill jump off a cliff like seraphina if you walk but i dont want to live without you i want to be married to you have a family with you build something here with you thats all i have to say thats all you have to say he repeated his heart had settled back in place but it seemed to be taking up too much room so much that it hurt his chest just as the grin was so wide it hurt his face i guess its my turn to say something id never cheat on you shut up margo you lost your chance to see me crawl over that one i was wrong i was stupid and i was careless with you and it wont happen again and im going to add that i always thought a hell of a lot more of you than you thought of yourself thats all i have to say all right then she struggled to find a dignified exit but he laid a hand on her shoulder and put what he had in his hand under her nose the ring caught fire and light and promise she covered her mouth with her hand as it shot out dreams that dazzled her eyes oh my god grandmother templetons engagement ring you remember her iyes yes it came to me i got it out of the safe deposit box had it in my pocket the day i walked in on you and your italian friend oh oh no youre not going to sit down he jerked her upright and into his arms i want your knees weak i wouldnt mind if you babbled too since youve spoiled my romantic plans of giving you this on one knee in candlelight oh she dropped her head on his chest oh dont cry i cant stand it when you cry im not to prove it she lifted her face and showed him she was laughing i was going to ask you ask me what jesus why cant we keep up with each other she mopped at tears with her fingers that night i was going to ask you to marry me i figured it was going to take a lot of work and flare to talk you into it so i had it all planned i was going to dare you youre kidding take off those damn glasses she snatched them off herself tossed them recklessly over her shoulder heard them shatter on the terracotta i still beat you to it i still asked you first before he could move she snatched the ring out of his hand and you said yes this proves it i didnt say anything yet he corrected and made a grab for her damn it margo come here if i dont get my hands on you ill explode say yes she danced out of reach holding the ring aloft like a torch say yes first all right yes what the hell ill take you on he caught her on the fly whirled her around and she felt something swirl inside her no its not the spinning mum she thought it is the man his mouth was on hers before her feet touched the ground for life he murmured cupping her face no forever she tipped her mouth to his again i want forever he took her hand holding her gaze as he slipped the ring on her finger it fit like a dream done he said dream trilogy book holding the dream chapter one her childhood had been a lie her father had been a thief her mind struggled to absorb those two facts to absorb and analyze and accept kate powell had trained herself to be a practical woman one who worked hard toward goals earned them step by careful step wavering was not permitted shortcuts were not taken rewards were earned with sweat planning and effort that she had always believed was who she was a product of her heredity her upbringing and her own stringent standards for herself when a child was orphaned at an early age when she lived with the loss when she had essentially watched her parents die there seemed little else that could be so wrenching but there was kate realized as she sat still in shock behind her tidy desk in her tidy office at bittle and associates out of that early tragedy had come enormous blessings her parents had been taken away and shed been given others the distant kinship hadnt mattered to thomas and susan templeton they had taken her in raised her given her a home and love given her everything without question and they must have known she realized they must have always known they had known when they took her from the hospital after the accident when they comforted her and gave her the gift of belonging they had known they took her across the continent to california to the sweeping cliffs and beauty of big sur to templeton house there in that grand home as gracious and welcoming as any of the glamorous templeton hotels they made her part of their family they gave her laura and josh their children as siblings they gave her margo sullivan the housekeepers daughter who had been accepted as part of the family even before kate they gave her clothes and food education advantages they gave her rules and discipline and the encouragement to pursue dreams and most of all they gave her love and family and pride yet they had known from the beginning what she twenty years later had just discovered her father had been a thief a man under indictment for embezzlement caught skimming from his own clients accounts he had died facing shame ruin prison she might never have found out but for the capricious twist of fate that had brought an old friend of lincoln powells into her office that morning he was so delighted to see her remembered her as a child it warmed her to be remembered to realize that he had come to her with his business because of the old tie with her parents shed taken the time though she had little to spare during those last weeks before the april tax deadline to chat with him and he just sat there in the chair on the other side of the desk reminiscing hed bounced her on his knee when she was little he said had worked in the same ad firm as her father which was why he told her since hed relocated to california and now had his own firm he wanted her as his accountant she thanked him and mixed her questions about his business and his financial requirements with queries about her parents then when he spoke so casually of the accusations the charges and the sorrow he felt that her father had died before he could make restitution she had said nothing could say nothing he never intended to steal just borrow oh it was wrong god knows i always felt partially responsible because i was the one who told him about the real estate deal encouraged him to invest i didnt know hed already lost most of his capital in a couple of deals that went sour he would have put the money back linc would have found a way always did he was always a little resentful that his cousin rode so high while he barely scraped by and the mangod she couldnt remember his name couldnt remember anything but the wordssmiled at her the whole time he was speaking making excuses adding his own explanations to the facts she simply sat nodding this stranger whod known her father was destroying her very foundations he had a sore spot where tommy templeton was concerned funny when you think it turned out that he was the one to raise you after it all but linc never meant any harm katie he was just reckless never had a chance to prove himself and thats the real crime if you ask me the real crime kate thought as her stomach churned and knotted he had stolen because he was desperate for money and took the easy way out because he was a thief she thought now a cheat and he had cheated the justice system by hitting an icy patch of road and crashing his car killing himself and his wife and leaving his daughter an orphan so fate had given her as a father the very man her own father had been so envious of through his death she had in essence become a templeton had it been deliberate she wondered had he been so desperate so reckless so angry that hed chosen death she could barely remember him a thin pale nervous man with a quick temper a man with big plans she thought now a man who had spun those plans out into delightful fantasies for his child visions of big houses fine cars funfilled trips to disney world and all the while they lived in a tiny house just like all the other tiny houses on the block with an old sedan that rattled and no trips to anywhere so he stole and he was caught and he died what had her mother done kate wondered what had she felt was that why kate remembered her most as a woman with worry in her eyes and a tight smile had he stolen before the idea made her cold inside had he stolen before and somehow gotten away with it a little here a little there until hed become careless she remembered arguments often over money and worse the silences that followed them the silence that night that heavy hurting silence in the car between her parents before the awful spin the screams and the pain shuddering she closed her eyes clenched her fists tight and fought back the drumming headache oh god she had loved them loved the memory of them couldnt bear to have it smeared and spoiled and couldnt face she realized with horrid shame being the daughter of a cheat she wouldnt believe it not yet she took slow breaths and turned to her computer with mechanical efficiency she accessed the library in new hampshire where shed been born and had lived for the first eight years of her life it was tedious work but she ordered copies of newspapers for the year before the accident requested faxes of any article mentioning lincoln powell while she waited she contacted the lawyer back east who had handled the disposition of her parents estate she was a creature comfortable with technology within an hour she had everything she needed she could read the details in black and white details that confirmed the facts the lawyer had given her the accusations the criminal charges the scandal a scandal she realized that had earned print space because of lincoln powells family connection to the templetons and the missing funds replaced in full after her parents were buried replaced kate was certain by the people who had raised her as one of their own the templetons she thought who had been drawn into the ugliness had quietly taken the responsibility and the child and always had protected the child there in her quiet office alone she laid her head on the desk and wept and wept and when the weeping was done she shook out pills for the headache more for the burning in her stomach when she gathered her briefcase to leave she told herself she would bury it just bury it as she had buried her parents it could not be changed could not be fixed she was the same she assured herself the same woman she had been that morning yet she found she couldnt open her office door and face the possibility of running into a colleague in the corridor instead she sat again closed her eyes sought comfort in old memories a picture she thought of family and tradition of who she was what she had been given and what she had been raised to be at sixteen she was taking an extra load of courses that would allow her to graduate a full year ahead of her class since that wasnt quite enough of a challenge she was determined to graduate with honors as well she had already mentally outlined her valedictorian speech her extracurricular activities included another term as class treasurer a stint as president of the math club and a place in the starting lineup of the baseball team she had hopes of being named mvp again next season but for now her attention was focused on calculus numbers were her strong point sticking with logic kate had already decided to use her strengths in her career once she had her mbamore than likely she would follow josh to harvard for thatshe would pursue a career in accounting it didnt matter that margo said her aspirations were boring to kate they were realistic she was going to prove to herself and to everyone who mattered to her that what she had been given all she had been offered had been put to the best possible use because her eyes were burning she slipped off her glasses and leaned back in her desk chair it was important she knew to rest the brain periodically in order to keep it at its keenest she did so now letting her gaze skim around the room the new touches the templetons had insisted she choose for her sixteenth birthday suited her the simple pine shelves above her desk held her books and study materials the desk itself was a honey a chippendale kneehole with deep drawers and fanciful shell carving it made her feel successful just to work at it she hadnt wanted fussy wallpaper or fancy curtains the muted stripes on the walls and the simple vertical blinds fit her style because she understood her aunts need to pamper shed chosen a pretty scrollsided settee in deep green on rare occasions she actually stretched out on it to read for pleasure otherwise the room was functional as she preferred the knock on her door interrupted her just as she was burying her nose in her books again her answer was a distracted grunt kate susan templeton elegant in a cashmere twin set entered her hands on her hips what am i going to do with you nearly finished kate mumbled she caught the scent of her aunts perfume as susan crossed the room midterm math tomorrow as if you werent already prepared susan sat on the edge of the tidily made bed and surveyed kate those huge and oddly exotic brown eyes were focused behind heavy framed reading glasses hair sleek and dark was tugged back into a stubby ponytail the girl cut it shorter every year susan thought with a sigh plain gray sweats bagged over a long thin frame down to the bare feet as susan watched kate pursed her wide mouth into something between a pout and a frown the expression dug a thinking line between her eyebrows in case you havent noticed susan began its ten days until christmas umm midterm week nearly done and its six oclock dont hold dinner want to finish this kate susan rose and snatched kates glasses away josh is home from college the familys waiting for you to trim the tree oh blinking kate struggled to bring her mind back from formulas her aunt was watching her owlishly her dark blond hair curled smoothly around her pretty face im sorry i forgot if i dont ace this exam the world as we know it will come to an end i know kate grinned and rolled her shoulders to loosen them i guess i could spare a couple of hours just this once were honored susan set the glasses on the desk put something on your feet kate okay be right down i cant believe im going to say this to one of my children but susan started toward the door if you open one of those books again youre grounded yes maam kate crossed to her dresser and chose a pair of socks from an orderly pile beneath the carefully folded socks was her secret stash of weighton which had done pitifully little to put more pounds onto her bones after tugging the socks on she downed a couple of aspirin to kick back the headache that was just beginning to stir its about time margo met her at the top of the stairs josh and mr t are already stringing the lights that could take hours you know how they love to argue whether they should go clockwise or counterclockwise tilting her head she gave margo a long study what the hell are you all dolled up for im simply being festive margo smoothed the skirt of her hollyred dress pleased that the scoop neckline hinted at cleavage shed slipped on heels determined that josh should notice her legs and remember she was a woman now unlike you i dont choose to trim the tree wearing rags at least ill be comfortable kate sniffed youve been into aunt susies perfume i have not lifting her chin margo fluffed at her hair she offered me a spritz hey laura called from the bottom of the staircase are you two going to stand up there arguing all night were not arguing we were complimenting each other on our attire snickering kate started down dad and josh are nearly finished with their debate over the lights laura shot a look across the spacious foyer toward the family parlor theyre smoking cigars josh smoking a cigar kate snorted at the image hes a harvard man now laura affected an exaggerated new england accent youve got shadows under your eyes youve got stars in yours kate countered and youre all dressed up too annoyed kate pulled at her sweatshirt whats the deal peters dropping by later laura turned to the foyer mirror to check the line of her ivory wool dress busy dreaming she didnt notice the winces that margo and kate exchanged just for an hour or so i cant wait till winter break one more midterm and then freedom flushed with anticipation she beamed at her friends its going to be the best winter vacation ever i have a feeling peters going to ask me to marry him what kate yelped before laura could shush her quiet she hurried back across the blueandwhitetiled floor toward kate and margo i dont want mom and dad to hear not yet laura you cant seriously be thinking of marrying peter ridgeway you barely know him and youre only seventeen a million reasons against the idea whirled through margos mind ill be eighteen in a few weeks its just a feeling anyway promise me you wont say anything of course not kate reached the bottom of the curving staircase you wont do anything crazy will you have i ever a wistful smile played around lauras mouth as she patted kates hand lets go in what does she see in him kate mumbled to margo hes old hes twentyseven margo corrected worried hes gorgeous and treats her like a princess he has she searched for the word polish yes but ssh she spotted her mother coming down the hallway wheeling a cart laden with hot chocolate we dont want to spoil tonight well talk later ann sullivans brow furrowed as she studied her daughter margo i thought that dress was for christmas day im in a holiday mood margo said breezily let me take that mum far from satisfied ann watched her daughter roll the cart into the parlor before she turned to kate miss kate youve been overworking your eyes again theyre bloodshot i want you to rest them later with cucumber slices and where are your slippers in my closet understanding the housekeepers need to scold kate hooked her arm through anns come on now annie dont fuss its treetrimming time remember the angels you helped us make when we were ten how could i forget the mess the three of you made and mr josh teasing the lot of you and biting the heads off mrs williamsons gingerbread men she lifted a hand to touch kates cheek youve grown up since times like this i miss my little girls well always be your little girls annie they paused in the parlor doorway to survey the scene it made kate grin just the look of everything the tree already shining with lights soared a good ten feet it stood in front of the tall windows that faced the front boxes of ornaments brought out of storage sat ready to be opened in the lapis hearth decked with candles and fresh greenery a sedate fire flickered scents of apple wood and pine and perfume filled the room how she loved this house she thought before the decorating was done every room would have just the right touches of holiday cheer a bowl of georgian silver filled with pinecones would be flanked by candles banks of poinsettias in gilttrimmed pots would crowd all the window seats delicate porcelain angels would be placed just so on glossy mahogany tables in the foyer the old victorian santa would claim his place of honor on the baby grand she could remember her first christmas at templeton house how the grandeur of it had dazzled her eyes and the constant warmth had soothed that ache just under her heart now half of her life had been lived here and the traditions had become her own she wanted to freeze this moment in her mind make it forever and unchangeable there she thought the way the firelight dances over aunt susies face as she laughs at uncle tommyand the way he takes her hand and holds it how perfect they look she thought the delicateframed woman and the tall distinguished man christmas hymns played quietly as she took it all in laura knelt by the boxes lifting out a red glass ball that caught the light and tossed it back margo poured steaming chocolate from a silver pot and practiced her flirting skills on josh he stood on a ladder with the lights from the tree glinting in his bronze hair they played over his face as he grinned down at margo in this room filled with shining silver sparkling glass pol ished old wood and soft fabrics they were perfect and they were hers arent they beautiful annie that they are and so are you not like them kate thought as she stepped into the room theres my katie girl thomas beamed at her put the books away for a while did you if you can stop answering the phone for an evening i can stop studying no business on treetrimming night he winked at her i think the hotels can run without me for one night never as well as they run with you and aunt susie margo lifted a brow as she passed kate a cup of hot chocolate somebodys bucking for another present i hope youve got something in mind other than that stupid computer youve been drooling over computers have become necessary tools in any business right uncle tommy cant live without them im glad your generations going to be taking over though i hate the blasted things youre going to have to upgrade the system in sales across the board josh put in as he climbed down the ladder no reason to do all that work when a machine can do it for you spoken like a true hedonist margo smirked at him be careful josh you might actually have to learn how to type imagine joshua conway templeton heir apparent to templeton hotels with a useful skill listen duchess hold it susan cut off her sons testy remark with an upraised hand no business tonight remember margo be a good girl and pass josh the ornaments kate take that side of the tree with annie will you laura you and i will start over here and what about me thomas wanted to know you do what you do best darling supervise it wasnt enough to hang them the ornaments had to be sighed over and stories told about them there was the wooden elf that margo had thrown at josh one year its head now held on its body with glue the glass star that laura had once believed her father had plucked from the sky just for her snowflakes that annie had crocheted for each of the family members the felt wreath with silver piping that had been kates first and last sewing project the homey and simple hung bough by bough with the priceless antique ornaments susan had collected from around the world when it was done they held their collective breath as thomas turned off the lamps and the room was lit by firelight and the magic of the tree its beautiful its always beautiful kate murmured and slipped her hand into lauras late that night when sleep eluded her kate wandered back downstairs she crept into the parlor stretched out on the rug beneath the tree and watched the lights dance she liked to listen to the house the quiet ticking of old clocks the sighs and murmurs of wood settling the crackle of spent logs in the hearth rain was falling in little needle stabs against the windows the wind was a whispering song it helped to lie there the nerves over her exam the following day slowly unknotted from her stomach she knew everyone was tucked into bed safe sound shed heard laura come in from her drive with peter and sometime later josh returned from a date her world was in order if youre hanging out for santa youve got a long wait margo came into the room on bare feet and settled down beside kate youre not still obsessing over some stupid math test are you its a midterm and if you paid more attention to yours you wouldnt be skimming by with cs schools just something you have to get through margo slipped a pack of cigarettes out of her robe pocket with every one in bed it was safe to sneak a smoke so can you believe josh is dating that crosseyed leah mcnee shes not crosseyed margo and shes built margo huffed out smoke anyone not struck blind could see that compared to margo sullivan leah was barely female hes only dating her because she puts out what do you care i dont she sniffed and smoked and sulked its just so ordinary thats something im never going to be smiling a little kate turned to her friend in a blue chenille robe with her tumbled blond hair margo looked stunning and sultry and sleek no one would ever accuse you of being ordinary pal obnoxious conceited rude and a royal pain in the ass yes but never ordinary margo raised a brow and grinned i can always count on you anyway speaking of ordinary how stuck do you think laura really is on peter ridgeway i dont know kate gnawed on her lip shes been dreamyeyed over him ever since uncle tommy transferred him out here i wish he was still managing templeton chicago then she shrugged he must be good at his job or uncle tommy and aunt susie wouldnt have promoted him knowing how to manage a hotel has nothing to do with it mr and mrs t have dozens of managers all over the world this is the only one lauras gone over on kate if she marries him yeah kate blew out a breath its her decision her life christ i cant imagine why anyone would want to get tied down that way neither can i stubbing the cigarette out margo lay back im not going to im going to make a splash in this world me too margo slanted kate a look keeping books thats more like a slow drip you splash your way ill splash mine this time next year ill be in college margo shuddered what a hideous thought youll be there too kate reminded her if you dont tank your sat well see about that college wasnt on margos agenda i say we find seraphinas dowry and take that trip around the world we used to talk about there are places i want to see while im still young rome and greece paris milan london theyre impressive kate had seen them the templetons had taken herand would have taken margo as well if ann had allowed it i see you marrying a rich guy bleeding him dry and jetsetting all over not a bad fantasy amused by it margo stretched her arms but id rather be rich myself and just have a platoon of lovers at the sound in the hall she shoved the ashtray under the folds of her robe laura blowing out a breath she sat up you scared the wits out of me sorry couldnt sleep join the party kate invited we were planning our future oh with a soft secret smile laura knelt on the rug thats nice hold on eyes sharp margo shifted and took lauras chin in her hand after a moments study she let out a breath okay you didnt do it with him flushing laura batted margos hand away of course i didnt peter would never pressure me how do you know she didnt kate demanded you can tell i dont think you should have sex with him laura but if youre seriously thinking marriage youd better try him on first sex isnt a pair of shoes laura muttered but it sure as hell better fit when i make love the first time its going to be with my husband on our wedding night thats the way i want it uhoh shes got that templeton edge in her voice grinning kate tugged on a curl falling over lauras ear unbudgable dont listen to margo laura in her head sex is equated with salvation margo lit another cigarette id like to know what tops it love laura stated success kate said at the same time well that sums it up kate wrapped her arms around her knees margos going to be a sex fiend youre going to search for love and im going to bust my ass for success what a group im already in love laura said quietly i want someone who loves me back and children i want to wake up each morning knowing i can make a home for them and a happy life for them i want to fall asleep each night beside someone i can trust and depend on id rather fall asleep at night beside someone who makes me hot margo chuckled when kate poked her just kidding sort of i want to go places and do things be somebody i want to know when i wake up in the morning that something exciting is right around the corner and whatever it is i want to make it mine kate rested her chin on her knees i want to feel accomplished she said quietly i want to make things work the way i think they should work i want to wake up in the morning knowing exactly what im doing next and how im going to do it i want to be the best at what i do so that i know i havent wasted anything because if i wasted it it would be like failing her voice broke embarrassing her god i must be overtired because her eyes were stinging she rubbed them hard i have to go to bed my exams first thing in the morning youll breeze through it laura rose with her dont worry so much professional nerds have to worry but margo rose as well and patted kates arm lets get some sleep kate paused at the doorway to look back at the tree for a moment shed been shocked to discover that a part of her wished she could stay here just like this forever never have to worry about tomorrow or the next day never have to concern herself with success or failure or change change was coming she realized it was barreling down on her in the dewy look in lauras eyes the edgy one in margos she turned off the lights there was no stopping any of it she realized so shed better get ready chapter two she got through the days and the nights and the work there was no choice but to cope and for the first time in her life kate felt there was no one she could talk to each time she felt herself tipping needing to reach for the phone or run to templeton house she yanked herself back she could notwould notpour out this misery these fears to the people who loved her they would stand by her there was no doubt about that but this was a burden she had to carry herself and one she hoped she could hide in some dark corner of her mind eventually she would be able to let it rest to stop feeling compelled to pick it up again and again and examine it she considered herself practical intelligent and strong indeed she couldnt understand how anyone could be the latter without the two formers until this her life had been exactly as she wanted it her career was cruising along at a safe and yes intelligent speed she had a reputation at bittle and associates as a clearheaded hardworking cpa who could handle complex accounts without complaint eventually she expected to be offered a full partnership when that time came she would ascend yet another rung on her personal ladder of success she had family she loved and who loved her and friends well her closest friends were family and what could be more convenient than that she adored them had loved growing up at templeton house overlooking the wild sweeping cliffs of big sur there was nothing she wouldnt do for aunt susie and uncle tommy that included keeping what she had learned weeks before in her office to herself she wouldnt question them though questions burned inside her she wouldnt share the pain or the problem with laura or margo though she had always shared everything with them she would suppress ignore and forget that she had to believe would be best for everyone her entire life had been focused on doing her best being the best making her family proud now she felt she had more to prove more to be every success she had enjoyed could be traced back to the moment when they had opened their home and their hearts to her so she promised herself to look forward rather than back to go on with the routine that had become her life under ordinary circumstances treasure hunting wouldnt be considered routine but when it involved seraphinas dowry when it included laura and margo and lauras two daughters it was an event it was a mission the legend of seraphina that doomed young girl who had flung herself off the cliffs rather than face a life without her true love had fascinated the three of them all of their lives the beautiful spanish girl had loved felipe had met him in secret walked with him along the cliffs in the wind in the rain he had gone off to fight the americans to prove himself worthy of her promising to come back to marry her and build a life with her but he had not come back when seraphina learned he had been killed in battle she had walked these cliffs again had stood on the edge of the world and overcome with grief had flung herself over it the romance of it the mystery the glamour had been irresistible to the three women and of course the possibility of finding the dowry that seraphina had hidden away before she leapt into the sea added challenge on most sundays kate could be found on the cliffs wielding a metal detector or a spade for months ever since the morning that margo at a crossroads in her life had found a single gold doubloon the three had met there to search or maybe they gathered not so much in hopes of uncovering a chest of gold as simply to enjoy each others company it was nearly may and after the jangled nerves she had suffered leading up to april and the income tax deadline kate was thrilled to be out in the sun it was what she needed she was sure it helped as work helped to keep her mind off the file she had hidden in her apartment the file on her father that she had carefully organized it helped to block out the worries and the ache in her heart and the stress of wondering if shed done the right thing by hiring a detective to look into a twentyyearold case her muscles protested a bit as she swept the metal detector over a new section of scrub and she sweated lightly under her tshirt she wouldnt think of it she promised herself not today not here she wouldnt think of it at all until the detectives report was complete she had promised the day to herself for her family and nothing would get in the way the gorgeous breeze ruffled her short cap of black hair her skin was dusky an inheritance from the italian branch of her mothers family though beneath it was what margo called accountants pallor a few days in the sun she decided would fix that shed lost a little weight in the last few weeks of crunch timeand yes because of the shock of discovering what her father had donebut she intended to put it back on she always had hopes of putting some meat on her stubbornly thin bones she didnt have margos height or stunning build or lauras lovely fragility she was kate had always thought average average and skinny with an angular face to match her angular body once she had hoped for dimples or the dash of a few charming freckles or deepgreen eyes instead of ordinary brown but shed been too practical to dwell on it for long she had a good brain and skill with figures and that was what she needed to succeed she reached down for the jug of lemonade ann sullivan had sent along after a long indulgent drink kate cast a scowl in margos direction are you just going to sit there all afternoon while the rest of us work margo stretched luxuriously on her rock her sexpot body draped in what for margo sullivan templeton was casual wear of red leggings and a matching shirt were a little tired today she claimed and patted her flat belly kate snorted ever since you found out youre pregnant youve been finding excuses to sit on your butt margo flashed a smile and tossed her long blond hair behind her shoulders josh doesnt want me to overdo youre playing that one for all its worth kate grumbled damn right i am delighted with life in general margo crossed her long gorgeous legs hes so sweet and attentive and thrilled jesus kate weve made ourselves a baby maybe the idea of two of her favorite people being blindly in love starting their own family did bring kate a warm glow but she was bound by tradition to snipe at margo whenever possible at least you could look haggard throw up every morning faint now and again ive never felt better in my life because it was true margo rose and took the metal detector even giving up smoking hasnt been as hard as i thought it would i never imagined i wanted to be a mother now its all i can think about youre going to be a fabulous mother kate murmured just fabulous yes i am margo studied laura who was giggling and digging at a patch of scrubby earth with her two little girls ive got an awfully good role model right there this past years been hell for her but shes never wavered neglect adultery divorce kate said quietly not wanting the fitful breeze to carry her words not a lot of fun and games the girls have helped keep her centered and the shop yeah and speaking of the shop margo turned the detector off leaned on it if these past couple of weeks are any indication we may have to hire some help im not going to be able to give pretenses ten and twelve hours a day after the baby comes always thinking of budget kate frowned the upscale secondhand boutique they had opened on cannery row was primarily margos and lauras domain but as the third partner in the fledgling enterprise kate crunched numbers for it when she could squeeze out the time youve got over six months left that hits holiday shopping time we could think about hiring seasonal help then sighing margo handed the metal detector back to kate the business is doing better than any of us anticipated dont you think its time to loosen up no kate switched the machine back on we havent been open a full year yet you start taking on outside help youve got social security withholding unemployment well yes but i can start helping out on saturdays if necessary and ive got my vacation time coming up work she thought again work and dont think i can give pretenses a couple of weeks full time kate a vacation means whitesand beaches europe a sordid affairnot clerking in a shop kate merely raised an eyebrow i forgot who i was talking to margo muttered the original allworkandnoplay girl that was always to balance you the quintessential allplay girl anyway im a onethird owner of pretenses i believe in protecting my investments she scowled at the ground kicked it hell theres not even a bottle cap to give us a little beep and thrill here are you feeling all right margos eyes narrowed looked closer you look a little washed out and frail she realized frail and edgy if i didnt know better id say you were the one who was pregnant that would be a good trick since i havent had sex in what feels like the last millennium which could be why you seem edgy and washed out but she didnt grin really kate whats going on she wanted to say it spill out all of it knew if she did she would find comfort support loyaltywhatever she needed my problem she reminded herself nothing kate made herself look down her nose disdainfully except im the one doing all the work and my arms are falling off while you sit on your rock and pose for a glamorous motherstobe photo shoot she rotated her shoulders i need a break margo studied her friend for another moment tapping her fingers on her knee fine im hungry anyway lets see what mum packed opening the nearby hamper margo let out a long heartfelt moan oh god fried chicken kate peeked in the hamper five minutes more she decided then she was digging in mrs williamsons chicken was bound to erase the nagging hunger pains is josh back from london hmm margo swallowed gamely tomorrow templeton london did a little remodeling so hes going to bring back some stock for the shop and i asked him to check with some of my contacts there so we may have a nice new supply it would save me a buying trip i remember when you couldnt wait to get on a plane that was then margo said smugly this is now she bit into the drumstick again then remembered something and waved a hand umm forgot party next saturday night cocktails buffet be there kate winced do i have to dress up yes lots of our customers she swallowed again some of the hotel brass byron de witt pouting kate turned off the machine and grabbed a chicken thigh out of the hamper i dont like him of course not margo said dryly hes gorgeous charming intelligent worldtraveled absolutely hateful he knows hes gorgeous and that takes a lot of nerve i dont really give a damn whether you like him or not hes taken a lot of the weight off josh here at the california hotels recovered a lot of the ground peter ridgeway lost for us she caught herself and glanced over toward laura peter was lauras exhusband the girls father and whatever she thought of him she wouldnt criticize him in front of ali and kayla just be civil im always civil hey guys kate called out and watched ali and kaylas pretty blond heads pop up weve got mrs williamsons fried chicken over here and margos eating it all with shouts and scrambling feet the girls dashed up to join the picnic laura came after them and sat crosslegged at margos feet she watched her daughters squabble over one particular piece of chicken ali won of course she was the older of the two and in recent months the more demanding divorce laura reminded herself as ali smugly nibbled her chicken was very very hard on a tenyearold girl ali pour kayla a glass of lemonade too ali hesitated considered refusing it seemed laura thought as she kept cool calm eyes on her daughters mutinous ones that ali considered refusing everything these days in the end ali shrugged and poured a second glass for her sister we didnt find anything ali complained choosing to forget the fun shed had giggling and digging in the dirt its boring really margo selected a cube of cheese from a plastic container for me just being here and looking is half the fun well whatever margo said was to ali gospel margo was glamorous and different margo had run away to hollywood at eighteen had lived in europe and had been involved in wonderful exciting scandals nothing ordinary and awful like marriage and divorce i guess its kinda fun but i wish wed find more coins persistence kate flipped a finger from alis chin to her nose pays what would have happened if alexander graham bell had given up before he put that first call through if indiana jones hadnt gone on that last crusade if armani hadnt sewed that first seam margo put in and earned a fresh giggle if star trek hadnt gone where no one had gone before laura finished and had the pleasure of seeing her daughter flash a smile well maybe can we see the coin again aunt margo margo reached in her pocket shed fallen into the habit of carrying the old spanish gold coin with her ali took it gingerly and because she was awed as always held it so that kayla could coo over it too its so shiny kayla touched it reverently can i pick some flowers for seraphina sure leaning over laura kissed the top of her head but dont go near the edge to throw them over without me i wont we always do it together i guess ill help her ali handed margo the coin but when she stood up her pretty mouth went thin seraphina was stupid to jump just because she wasnt going to be able to marry felipe marriage is no good anyway then she remembered margo and blushed sometimes laura said quietly marriage is wonderful and kind and strong and other times it isnt wonderful enough or kind enough or strong enough but youre right ali seraphina shouldnt have jumped when she did that she ended everything she could have become threw away all those possibilities it makes me feel very sorry for her she watched her daughter head drooping shoulders hunched walk away shes so hurt shes so angry shell get through this kate gave lauras hand a bracing squeeze youre doing everything right its been three months since theyve seen peter he hasnt even bothered to call them youre doing everything right kate repeated youre not responsible for the asshole she knows youre not to blameinside she knows that i hope so laura shrugged and picked at a piece of chicken kayla just bounces and ali broods well i guess were a textbook example that kids can grow up in the same house and be raised by the same people and turn out differently kates stomach wrenched true margo had a lowgrade urge for a cigarette quashed it but were all so fabulous well she smiled sweetly at kate most of us just for that im eating the last piece of chicken kate popped a couple of turns first medication helped her to eat when she had no desire for food nervous heartburn she thought of the low burn just under her breastbone insisted on thinking of it that way i was telling margo that id be able to pitch in at the shop on saturdays we could use the help laura shifted so she could continue the conversation and keep an eye on her daughters last saturday was a madhouse and i could only give margo four hours i can put in a full day wonderful margo plucked some glossy grapes from a bunch youll be hunkered over the computer the whole time trying to find mistakes if you didnt make them i wouldnt have to find them but she held up a hand not so much to avoid the argument as to make a point ill stay at the counter and i have twenty bucks that says i make more sales than you by the time we close in your dreams powell on monday morning kate wasnt thinking about dreams or treasure hunts at nine sharp with her third cup of coffee at her elbow her computer booted she was behind her desk in her office at bittle and associates following her daily routine she had already removed her navy pinstriped jacket draped it behind her chair and rolled up the sleeves of her starched white shirt the sleeves would be rolled back down and the jacket neatly buttoned into place for her eleven oclock meeting with a client but for now it was just kate and numbers and that was how she liked it best the challenge of making numbers dance and shuffle and fall neatly into place had always fascinated her there was a beauty in the ebb and flow of interest rates tbills mutual funds and a power she could privately admit in understanding even admiring the caprice of finance and confidently advising clients how best to protect their hardearned money not that it was always hardearned she thought with a snort as she studied the account on her screen a good many of her clients had earned their money the oldfashioned way theyd inherited it even as the thought crossed her mind she cringed was that her father in her sneering at those who had inherited wealth taking a deep breath she rubbed a hand over the tense spot in the back of her neck she had to stop this seeing ghosts around every thought in her head it was her job to advise and protect and to ensure that any account she handled through bittle was served well not only was she not envious of her clients portfolios she worked hand in glove with lawyers bookkeepers brokers agents and estate planners to provide each and every one of them the very best in short and longterm financial advice that she reminded herself was who she was what she reveled in was the numbers their stoic and dependable consistency for kate two and two always and forever equaled four to realign herself she skimmed through a spreadsheet for ever spring nursery and gardens in the eighteen months since she had taken over that account shed watched it slowly cautiously expand she believed strongly in the slow and the cautious and this client had taken her direction well true the payroll had swelled but the business justified it outlay for the health plan and employee benefits was high and nipped at the profit margin but as a woman raised by the templetons she also firmly believed in sharing success with the people who helped you earn it a good year for bougainvillea she muttered and made a note to suggest that her client ease some of the last quarters profits into taxfree bonds render unto caesar sure she thought but not one damn penny more than necessary you look beautiful when youre plotting kate glanced up her fingers automatically hitting the keys to store her data and bring up her screen saver hello roger he leaned against the doorjamb posed was kates unflattering thought roger thornhill was tall dark and handsome with classic features reminiscent of gary grant in his prime broad shoulders fit beautifully under a tailored gray suit jacket he had a quick brilliant smile darkblue eyes that zeroed in flatteringly on a womans face and a smooth baritone that flowed like melted honey perhaps it was for all of those reasons that kate couldnt abide him it was only coincidence that they were on the same fast track for partnership that she assured herself often had nothing to do with why he annoyed her or just a very little to do with it your door was open he pointed out and strolled in without invitation i figured you werent very busy i like my door open he flashed that wide toothy smile and eased a hip onto the corner of her desk i just got back from nevis a couple of weeks in the west indies sure clears out the system after the tax crunch his gaze roamed over her face you should have come with me roger when i wont even have dinner with you why would you think id spend two weeks frolicking with you in the sand and surf hope springs eternal he took one of the pencils sharpened like swords from her lucite holder slid it idly through his fingers her pencils were always sharpened and always kept in the same place there was nothing in her office that didnt have a proper slot he knew all of them an ambitious man roger made use of what he knew he also made use of charm keeping his eyes on hers smiling id just like us to get to know each other again outside the office hell kate its been almost two years deliberately she raised an eyebrow since okay since i messed things up he put the pencil down im sorry i dont know how else to say it sorry voice mild she rose to refill her coffee though the third cup wasnt sitting well she sat again watching him as she sipped sorry that you were sleeping with me and one of my clients at the same time or that you were sleeping with me in order to get to my client or that you seduced said client into moving her account from my hands to yours which of those are you apologizing for roger all of them because it invariably worked with females he tried the smile again look ive already apologized countless times but im willing to do it again i had no business seeing bess ah mrs turner much less sleeping with her while you and i were involved theres no excuse for it we agree goodbye kate his eyes stayed on hers his voice flowing just the way she remembered it had when she had moved under him climbing toward climax i want to make things right with you at least make peace with you she cocked her head considered there was right and there was wrong there were ethics and there was the lack of them no damn it with his first sign of temper he stood up from the desk the movement jerky and abrupt i was a son of a bitch i let sex and ambition get in the way of what was a good satisfying relationship youre absolutely right she agreed and you didnt know me well the first time around if you have any hope that id let you repeat the performance i stopped seeing bess months ago on a personal level oh well then leaning back in her chair kate enjoyed a good rolling laugh jesus christ youre a case roger you think because youve cleared the field im going to suit up and jump into the game were associates she told him and thats all im never going to make the mistake of getting involved with someone at work again and im neverrepeat nevergoing to give you another shot his mouth thinned youre afraid to see me outside the office afraid because youd remember how good we were together she had to sigh roger we werent that good my appraisal would put us at adequate lets just close the books on this one in the interest of sanity she rose held out her hand you want to put it behind us lets no hard feelings intrigued he studied her hand then her face no hard feelings no feelings at all she thought but decided not to say it fresh sheet she said were colleagues marginally friendly and youll stop pestering me about having dinner or taking trips to the west indies he took her hand ive missed you kate missed touching you all right he said quickly when he saw her eyes narrow if thats the best i can do ill take it i appreciate your accepting my apology fine struggling to be patient she tugged her hand away now ive got work to do im glad we worked this out he was smiling again as he walked to the door yeah right she muttered she didnt slam the door behind him that would have indicated too much emotion she didnt want roger the slime thornhill to get the idea there was any emotion inside her where he was concerned but she did close the door quietly purposefully before sitting back down at her desk she took out a bottle of mylanta sighed a little and chugged he had hurt her it was demoralizing to remember just how much he had hurt her she hadnt been in love with him but with a little more time a little more effort she could have been they had had the common ground of their work which she believed could have served as a strong foundation for more she had cared for him and trusted him and enjoyed him and he had used her ruthlessly to steal one of her biggest clients that was almost worse than discovering hed been jumping from her bed to her clients bed and back again kate took another swig from the bottle before recapping it she had at the time considered going to larry bittle with a formal complaint but her pride had outweighed whatever satisfaction she might have gleaned from that the client was satisfied and that was the bottom line at bittle roger would have lost some ground certainly if shed filed a complaint others in the office would have distrusted him pulled back from him and she would have looked like the whining betrayed female sniveling because she had mixed sex and business and had lost better that shed kept it to herself kate decided and put the mylanta back in her drawer better that shed been able to say straight to his face that she had put the whole incident behind her even if it was a lie even if she would detest him for the rest of her life with a shrug she recalled her data better by far to avoid slick smart gorgeous men with more ambition than heart better much better to stay in the fast lane on the career track and avoid any and all distractions partnership was waiting with all the success it entailed when she had that partnership had climbed to that next rung she would have earned it and maybe she thought just maybe when she reached that level of success she would be able to prove to herself that she was not her fathers daughter she smiled a little as she began to run figures stick with numbers pal she reminded herself they never lie chapter three the minute kate walked into pretenses margo scowled you look like death thanks i want coffee and a moment alone she headed up the curving stairs to the second floor found the pot already brewing she knew she hadnt slept more than three hours not after poring over every detail in the report from the detective back east and every detail had confirmed that she was the daughter of a thief it was all therethe evidence the charges the statements and reading through those papers had killed the faint hope shed hidden even from herself that it had all been some sort of mistake instead she had learned that her father had been out on bail at the time of the accident and had instructed his lawyer to accept the plea bargain hed been offered if he hadnt been killed that night on that icy stretch of road he would have been in prison within the week telling herself to accept it to get on with her life she drank her coffee hot and black she needed to go back down get to work and face a friend who knew her too well to miss signs of stress well she thought carrying her cup with her she had other excuses for a poor nights sleep and there was nothing to be gained by obsessing over facts that couldnt be changed from this moment kate promised herself she would cease to think about it whats going on margo demanded when kate wound her way down the stairs i want an answer this time youve been jumpy and out of sorts for weeks and i swear youre losing weight with every breath this has just gone on long enough kate im fine tired she shrugged a couple of accounts are giving me some problems on top of that its been a weird week kate opened the cash register counted out the bills and coins for morning change monday that scum thornhill came slinking into my office margo turned from setting up the teapot i hope you kicked his ass right out again i let him think weve made up it was easier she said before margo could comment hes more likely to leave me alone now youre not going to tell me thats whats keeping you up at night it gave me some bad moments okay okay margo smiled in sympathy men are pigs and that one is a blue ribbon hog dont waste your beauty sleep on him honey thanks anyway that was only the first weird thing the wacky life of a cpa wednesday i got tossed this new account freeland its a petting zoo kiddie park museum very strange im learning all about how much it costs to feed a baby llama margo paused you lead such a fascinating life youre telling me then yesterday the partners all hud dled together for most of the afternoon even the secretaries were barred nobody has a clue but the rumor is somebodys about to be canned or promoted kate shrugged and closed the cash register ive never seen them powwow like that they had to make their own coffee stop the presses look my little world has just as much intrigue and drama as anyone elses she stepped back as margo advanced on her what just hold still grabbing kates lapel margo pinned on a crescentshaped brooch dangling with drops of amber advertise the merchandise its got dead bugs in it margo didnt bother to sigh put some lipstick on for gods sake we open in ten minutes i dont have any with me and ill tell you right now im not going to work with you all day if youre going to be picking on me i can sell ring up and box just fine without painting my face fine before kate could evade her margo picked up an atomizer and spritzed her with perfume advertise the merchandise she repeated if anyone asks what youre wearing its bella donnas savage kate had just worked up a snarl when laura burst in i thought i was going to be late ali had a hair emergency i was afraid one of us would kill the other before it was over shes getting more like margo every day wishing it were coffee kate strolled over to pour herself tea and used it to wash down a palm full of pills she didnt want either of her friends to see i meant that in the worst possible way she added a young girl becoming interested in appearance and grooming is natural margo shot back you were the changeling in the family still are as you constantly prove by going around like a scarecrow dressed in navy blue serge unoffended kate sipped at her tea navy serge is classic because its serviceable there is only a very small percentage of the population who feel honor bound to fart through silk jesus youre crude margo managed over a laugh i dont even want to argue with you thats a relief hoping to keep it that way laura hurried over to turn the open sign around im still crosseyed from arguing with allison if annie hadnt intervened it would have been hairbrushes at ten paces mum always could defuse a good fight margo commented okay ladies remember were pushing mothers day and in case it slipped both of your minds expectant mothers also warrant gifts kate braced for the onslaught and struggled to ignore the viselike clamp on her temples that was usually the sign of a migraine on the boil within an hour pretenses was busy enough to keep all three of them occupied kate boxed up a hermes bag of darkgreen leather wondering what anyone needed with a green leather purse but the slick slide of the credit card machine kept her cheerful she was by her calculations neck and neck with margo on sales it was a fine feeling she thought as she wrapped the gold and silver box in elegant floral paper watching the business progress and the combo of competition and medication had eased the headache that had been threatening she had to give margo full credit for it pretenses had been a dream rising like smoke from the ashes of margos life just over a year ago margos career as a popular model in europe her exposure and financial rewards as the bella donna woman had been rudely cut off not that margo was blameless kate thought smiling as she handed the purchase to her customer shed been reckless foolish headstrong but she hadnt deserved to lose everything shed come back from milan broken and nearly bankrupt but in a matter of months through her own grit she had turned her life around opening a shop and selling her possessions in it had been josh templetons idea originally his idea kate mused to keep margo from sinking since he was blindly in love with her but margo had expanded the idea nurtured it polished it then laura reeling from her husbands deceit betrayal and greed had taken the bulk of what hed left of her money and helped margo buy the building for pretenses when kate had insisted on acquiring a onethird interest thus making herself a partner it had been because she believed in the investment because she believed in margo and because she didnt want to be left out of the fun of all of them she understood the risks best nearly forty percent of new businesses failed within a year and almost eighty percent went under within five and kate worried over it gnawed on it at night when she couldnt sleep but pretenses margos conception of an elegant exclusive and unique secondhand shop that offered everything from designer gowns to teaspoons was holding its own kates part in it might have been small and her reasons for getting involved certainly straddled the practical and the emotional but she was enjoying herself when she wasnt obsessing here was proof after all that life could be what you made of it she badly needed to hang on to that idea is there something i can show you the man she smiled at was thirtyish attractive in a rugged livedin manner she appreciated the worn jeans the faded shirt the dashing reddish moustache ah well maybe this necklace here she looked down into the display zeroed in on his choice its pretty isnt it pearls are so classic not regular pearls she thought as she lifted the necklace out what the hell were they called she continued to search through her mind as she draped the necklace over a velvet form seed pearls she remembered and beamed at him he really was awfully cute its called a lariat she added shed gotten that off the tag three strands and the clasp or the slide thing has a give me a minute a mabe pearl set in gold tradition with a flair she added enjoying the ad lib i wondered how much hesitating he flipped the tiny discreet price tag over to his credit he winced only slightly well he smiled a little it hits the top of my price range its something shell wear for years is it for mothers day yeah he shifted his feet running a calloused finger over the strands shed go nuts over it she melted toward him any man who would take such time and trouble for a gift for his mother earned top points from kate powell especially when he looked just a little bit like kevin costner we have several other really nice pieces that arent quite so expensive no i think maybe could you put it on so i could get a better picture sure happy to oblige she fastened it around her neck what do you think is it great she angled the counter mirror so that she could judge for herself and added laughing if you dont buy it i might have to snap it up myself it looks awfully pretty on you he said with a shy quiet smile that made her want to scoop him up and bundle him into the back room shes got dark hair like you wears it longer but the pearls look good with dark hair i guess ill have to take it along with that box over there the silver one with all the fancy scrolling still wearing the necklace kate scooted out from behind the counter to get the trinket box hed pointed to two presents she reached up to undo the necklace clasp your mother must be a very special woman oh shes great shes going to like this box she sort of collects them the necklace is for my wife though he added im getting all my mothers day shopping done at one time your wife kate forced herself to keep her lips cheerily curved at the corners i guarantee shell love it but if she or your mother prefers something else we have a thirtyday exchange and return policy with what she considered admirable restraint kate laid the necklace down now will that be cash or charge ten minutes later she watched him saunter out the cute ones she muttered to laura the nice ones the ones who love their mothers are all married there there laura patted kates arm before reaching under the counter to select the proper box it looked like a very good sale puts me at least two hundred up on margo and the days young thats the spirit but i should warn you shes got one back in the wardrobe room now and shes definitely leaning toward versace shit kate turned to scan the main showroom for prey im going for the bluehaired lady with the gucci bag shes mine reel her in tiger kate didnt break for lunch and told herself it was because she wanted to keep up her momentum not because her stomach was acting up again she had tremendous success in the secondfloor ladies boudoir and racked up two peignoirs a stainedglass accent lamp and a tasseled footstool maybe she did sneak into the back room a couple of times to boot up the computer and check margos bookkeeping but only when her lead was comfortable she corrected the expected mistakes rolled her eyes over a few unexpected ones and tidied up the files she was forced to admit in the end that accountants lapse was what cost her the victory when she came back smug already preparing the lecture she intended to deliver to margo on the cost of careless accounting her rival was closing a sale a whopper kate knew antiques a child didnt grow up at templeton house and not learn to recognize and appreciate them her heart sank even as dollar signs revolved in her head when she recognized the piece margo was cooing over louis xvi kate recited in her head a secretaireaabattant probably near the marquetry panels typical of that era included vases and garlands of flowers musical instruments and drapery oh it was a stunner kate thought and one of the remaining pieces from margos original stock im sorry to lose it margo was telling the dapper whitehaired gentleman who leaned on a goldheaded cane and studied the secretaire and the woman who described it with equal admiration i bought it in paris several years ago you have a wonderful eye in fact you have two wonderful eyes oh mr stiener thats so sweet of you in her shameless style margo trailed a finger down his arm i do hope youll think of me now and again when youre enjoying this i can promise you i will now as to shipping just come over to the counter and ill take all the necessary information margo crossed the room hips swinging and shot kate a triumphant look i think that crushes you for the day ace she said when her customer strolled out the days not over kate insisted we still have two hours until closing so until the fat lady singswhich will be you in a few monthsdont count your chickens such a sore loser margo clucked her tongue and was ready to pounce when the door jangled it wasnt a customer but she pounced anyway josh he caught her kissed her then pulled her to a chair off your feet he kept one hand on her shoulder and turned to glare at kate youre supposed to be keeping an eye on her making sure she doesnt overdo dont hang this on me besides margo doesnt stand when she can sit and doesnt sit when she can lie down and i made her drink a glass of milk an hour ago josh narrowed his eyes a whole glass what she didnt spit at me because it amused and touched her to see her big brother worry and fuss kate decided to forgive him she stepped over and kissed him welcome home thanks he stroked a hand over her hair wheres laura upstairs with a couple of customers and theres another one in the wardrobe room margo began so sit josh ordered kate can handle it youre looking pale margo pouted i am not youre going home and taking a nap he decided no way youre going to work all day then run around giving a party kate and laura can finish out here sure we can kate shot margo a smug look a couple of hours should do it keep dreaming powell ive already won won always interested in a bet josh looked from woman to woman won what just a friendly wager that i could outsell her which shes already lost margo pointed out and im feeling generous you can have the twohour handicap kate taking joshs hand she rubbed it against her cheek and when youve lost officially you wear the ungaro slip dress the red to the party tonight the thing that looks like a nightgown you might as well be naked really josh wiggled his eyebrows no offense kate hope you lose come on duchess home bed im not wearing a red slip to any party kate insisted then dont lose margo said with a careless shrug as she walked with josh to the door but when you do have laura pick out the accessories she wore a hammeredgold collar and triangular earrings that danced below her lobes her complaints that she looked like a slave girl captured by the klingons fell on deaf ears even the shoes had been forced on her red satin skyscrapers that had her teetering at three and a half inches over her normal five seven she sipped champagne and felt like a fool it didnt help matters that some of her clients were there margo and joshs acquaintances ran toward the rich the famous and the privileged and she wondered how she was going to maintain her image as a clearheaded precise and dedicated accountant when she was dressed like a bimbo but a bet was a bet stop fidgeting laura ordered when she joined kate on the terrace you look stunning this from a woman tastefully garbed in an elegant suit that covers her extremities what i look she said after another gulp of champagne is desperate i might as well be wearing a sign single woman hiv negative apply in person laura laughed as long as youre hiding out here i dont think you have to worry about it with a sigh she leaned back on the decorative banister god its a beautiful night halfmoon starlight the sound of the sea a sky like that it doesnt seem like anything bad could ever happen under it this is a good house can you feel that kate margo and joshs house its good excellent investment prime location excellent view she smiled at lauras bland stare okay yeah i can feel it its a good house it has heart and character i like thinking of them here together of them raising a family here relaxed now she leaned back with laura there was music drifting through the open doors and windows the friendly sound of conversation the tinkle of laughter she could smell flowers the sea a mix of feminine perfumes exotic tidbits being passed around on silver trays and she could simply by standing there feel the permanence and the promise like templeton house she mused where she had spent so much of her life maybe that was why she had never been driven to make a home of her own why an apartment convenient to work was all shed wanted because she thought with a faint smile she could always go home to templeton house and now she could always come here as well oh hello byron i didnt know you were here at lauras easy greeting kates pretty mood popped she opened her eyes straightened up from the banister and squared her shoulders something about byron de witt always made her feel confrontational i just got here i had some business that ran over you look lovely as always he squeezed lauras offered hand lightly before turning his gaze to kate the shadows were deep enough that she didnt notice his deepgreen eyes widen slightly but she did catch the quick amused grin nice to see you can i get either of you a fresh drink no i have to get back inside laura stepped toward the terrace doors i promised josh id charm mr and mrs ito were in hot competition for their banquet business in tokyo she was gone too quickly for kate to scowl at her would you like another glass of champagne kate scowled down into her glass instead it was still half full no im fine byron contented himself by lighting a thin cigar he knew kates pride wouldnt permit her to bolt normally he wouldnt have stayed with her any longer than manners dictated but at the moment he was a little tired of people and understood that ten minutes with her would be more interesting than an hour with the party crowd especially if he could irritate her as he seemed so skilled at doing thats quite a dress katherine she bristled as hed expected at his use of her full name grinning around the cigar he leaned back and prepared to enjoy the diversion i lost a bet she said between her teeth really he reached out to toy with and tug up the thin strap that had slid off her shoulder some bet hands off she snapped fine deliberately he moved the strap down again so that she was forced to pull it up youve got a good eye for real estate he commented and nodded at the surroundings when she frowned at him you steered josh and margo to this place didnt you yeah she watched him waited but he seemed content to puff on his cigar and study the view he was just the type shed decided to dislike posterboy gorgeous she termed it derisively thick brown hair that showed hints and streaks of gold waved with careless attraction around a heartstopping face what would have been charming dimples in his youth had deepened to creases in his cheeks that were now designed to incite a womans sexual fantasies the firm heros chin the straight aristocrats nose and those dark dark green eyes that could at his whim slide over you as if you were invisible or pin you shuddering to the wall six two she judged with the long limbs and strong shoulders of a longdistance runner and of course that voice with its faint misty drawl that hinted of hot summer nights and southern comfort men like him kate had decided were not ever to be trusted thats new he murmured caught staring and appraising as his sharp green eyes shifted to hers kate looked quickly away what that scent youre wearing it suits you better than the soap and talc you seem so fond of straight up sexy he continued smiling when she gaped at him no games no illusions shed known him for months ever since he had transferred from atlanta to monterey to take over peter ridgeways position at templeton he was by all accounts a savvy experienced and creative hotelier one who had worked his way to the top of the templeton organization over a period of fourteen years she knew he came from money polite southern wealth steeped in tradition and chivalry she had disliked him on sight and had been confident despite his unflagging manners that her feelings were reciprocated are you coming on to me his eyes still on hers filled with humor i was commenting on your perfume katherine if i were coming on to you you wouldnt have to clarify she tossed back the rest of her wine a mistake she knew with a migraine lurking dont call me katherine that always seems to slip my mind like hell exactly and if i were to tell you youre looking particularly attractive tonight that would be an observation not an overture anyway kate we were discussing real estate she continued to scowl even margos favored cristal champagne didnt sit well on a nervous stomach we were or were about to im considering buying a home in the area since my sixmonth trial period is almost over you had a trial period it cheered her considerably to picture him on probation at templeton california i had six months to decide if i wanted to be based here permanently or go back to atlanta reading her mind easily he grinned i like it herethe sea the cliffs the forests i like the people i work with but i dont intend to continue to live in a hotel however well run and lovely it may be she shrugged irritated by the way the wine seemed to be sitting like lead under her breastbone your business de witt not mine he would not he told himself patiently allow her prickly nature to divert him from his objective you know the area you have contacts and a good eye for quality and value i thought you could let me know if you hear about any interesting property particularly in the seventeen mile drive area im not a realtor she muttered good that means i dont have to worry about your commission because she appreciated that she bent there is a placemight be a little big for your needs i like big figures its near pebble beach four or five bedrooms i cant remember but its back off the road a lot of cypress trees and a nice established yard decks she continued squinting her eyes as she tried to remember front and back woodcedar i think lots of glass its been on the market about six months and hasnt moved theres probably a reason for that might be it was waiting for the right buyer do you know the realtor sure theyre a client monterey bay real estate ask for arlene she shoots straight i appreciate it if it works out ill have to buy you dinner no thanks just consider it a she broke off as pain stabbed into her stomach then like a sick echo erupted in her head the glass slipped out of her hand and shattered on the tile even as he grabbed her hold on he picked her up had a moment to notice she was little more than bones and nerves before he eased her onto the cushions of a chair jesus christ kate youre dead white ill get someone no biting back on the pain she grabbed at his arm its nothing just a twinge sometimes alcoholwine on an empty stomach she managed regulating her breathing i should know better his brow knit his voice thrummed with impatience when did you eat last i was kind of swamped today idiot he straightened theres enough food around here for three hundred starving sailors ill get you a damn plate no i ordinarily that vicious look wouldnt have quelled her but at the moment she was feeling shaky okay thanks but dont say anything itll only worry them and theyve got all these people here just dont say anything she repeated then watched him after one last smoldering look stride off her hand trembled a bit as she opened her bag and swigged from a small medicine bottle all right she promised herself she would take better care of herself shed start trying those yoga exercises margo had shown her shed stop drinking so much damn coffee she would stop thinking by the time he came back she was feeling steadier one look at the plate he carried and she let out a laugh how many of those starving sailors do you intend to feed just eat he ordered and popped a small succulent shrimp into her mouth himself after a moments deliberation she scooted over on the cushion a distraction even in the form of byron de witt was what she needed i guess i have to ask you to sit down and share youre always so gracious she chose a tiny spinach quiche i just dont like you de witt fair enough he dipped into some crab souffle i dont like you either but i was taught to be polite to a lady yet he thought of her odder still he dreamed of her a fogdrenched erotic dream he couldnt quite remember in the morning something about the cliffs and the crash of waves the feel of soft skin and a slim body under his hands those big dark italian eyes staring into his it left him uncomfortably amused with himself byron de witt was sure of many things the national debt would never be paid women in thin cotton dresses were the best reason for summer rock and roll was here to stay and katherine powell was not his type skinny abrasive women with more attitude than charm didnt appeal to him he liked them soft and smart and sexy he admired them simply for being women and delighted in the bonuses of quiet conversation hardheaded debate outrageous laughter and hot mindless sex he considered himself as much of an expert on the female mystique as any man could be after all hed grown up surrounded by them the lone son in a household with three daughters byron knew women and knew them well and he knew what he liked no he wasnt remotely attracted to kate still the dream nagged at him as he prepared for the day it followed him into the executive weight room tugged at the back of his mind as he pushed himself through reps and sets and pyramids it lingered while he finished off his routine with twenty minutes of the wall street journal and the treadmill he struggled to think of something else the house he intended to buy something close to the beach so that he could run on the sand in the sun instead of on a mechanical loop rooms of his own he mused done to his own taste a place where he could mow his grass turn his music up to earsplitting levels entertain company or enjoy a quiet private evening there had been few quiet private evenings in his childhood not that he regretted the noise the crowds he had grown up with he adored his sisters had tolerated their everincreasing hordes of friends he loved his parents and had always considered their busy social and family life normal indeed it had been the uncertainty as to whether he could bear to be so far away from his childhood home and family that had made him put the sixmonthtrialperiod clause into his agreement with josh though he did miss them hed realized he could be happy in california he was nearly thirtyfive and he wanted his own place he was the first de witt to move out of georgia in two generations he was determined to make it the right move if nothing else it would stop the notsosubtle family pressure for him to settle down marry start a family the distance would certainly make it difficult for his sisters to continually shove women they considered perfect for him under his nose he had yet to meet a woman who was perfect for him as he stepped into the shower back in his penthouse office suite he thought of kate again she was definitely wrong if hed dreamed about her it was only because shed been on his mind annoyed that she continued to be byron turned up the radio affixed to the tiles until bonnie raitt bellowed out the challenge to give them something to talk about he was merely concerned about her he decided shed gone so pale become so quickly and unexpectedly vulnerable hed always been a sucker for a damsel in distress of course she was an idiot for not taking care of herself health and fitness werent an option in byrons mind but a duty the woman needed to learn to eat properly cut back on the caffeine exercise build up some flesh and jettison some of those jangling nerves she wasnt half bad when she lost the attitude he decided stepping out of the shower with bonnie still blasting shed given him a decent lead on the kind of property he was interested in and theyd even managed to have a reasonable conversation over a shared plate and she had looked interesting in that excuse for a dress shed been wearing not that he was interested byron assured himself as he lathered up to shave but she had a certain gamine appeal when she wasnt scowling almost audrey hepburnish he swore when he nicked his chin with the razor put the blame for his inattention directly on kates head he didnt have time to analyze some bony unfriendly numbers cruncher with a chip on her shoulder he had hotels to run chapter four kate knew it was a mistake even when she set up the appointment it was she admitted like picking at a scab ensuring that a wound would never heal cleanly her fathers friend steven tydings was more than willing to meet her for lunch she was after all his new cpa and hed told her he was a man who liked to keep his finger on the pulse of his finances she was sure she could work with him do her job yet every time kate had opened his file shed fought off a sick feeling in her stomach flashback memories of her father bitter complaints about bills about just missing that big break she had forgotten all of that forged her memories of her parents more out of need she realized now than reality hers had not been a happy home nor had it been a stable one though she had woven it as such in her dreams now that it was impossible to pretend otherwise she realized it was equally impossible not to probe not to poke not to know she had nearly balked when tydings insisted on meeting at templeton monterey the dining room there was the best in the area the view of the bay superb none of the excuses that she came up with had changed his mind so at twelvethirty sharp she sat across from him at a window seat with a chefs salad in front of her it didnt matter where she was kate told herself as she picked at her meal laura was working at pretenses if anyone recognized her and mentioned it it would be a simple matter to tell laura shed been lunching with a client it was after all true for the first half hour kate guided the conversation to business strictly business whatever the circumstances his account was entitled to and would receive her best and he was pleased telling her so often as she constantly eased her dry throat by sipping templeton mineral water your dad had a way with numbers too tydings told her he was a toughly built compact man in his middle fifties who beamed at her out of darkbrown eyes success sat as stylishly on him as his suit did he kate murmured staring down at tydingss hands wellmanicured businessmans hands no flash but a simple gold band on his finger her father had liked flashheavy gold watches the small diamond ring he wore on his pinky why should she remember that now i dont remember well you were just a little thing but ill tell you linc had a gift for numbers he could run figures in his head youd have thought he had a calculator in there it was her opening and she had to take it i dont understand how someone that good with numbers could make such an enormous mistake he just wanted bigger things katie tydings sighed eased back in his chair he had a run of bad luck bad luck bad luck and bad judgment tydings qualified the ball got away from him mr tydings he embezzled funds he was going to prison she took a deep breath braced herself was money so important to him that he would steal that he would risk everything he risked just to have it you have to see the whole picture understand the frustrations the ambitions well the dreams katie linc always felt he was overshadowed outclassed by the templeton branch of the family no matter what he did how hard he tried he could never measure up that was a hard pill for a man like him to swallow just what kind of a man was he that he would be so envious of someone elses success it wasnt like that exactly obviously uncomfortable tydings shifted in his seat linc had a powerful need to succeed to be the best yes she struggled against a shudder tydings might have been describing the daughter rather than the father i understand that he just felt that if he could catch a break just one break he could build on it make something he had the potential the brains he was a smart hardworking man a good friend with a weakness for wanting more than he had he wanted the best for you tydingss smile spread again i remember the day you were born katie how he stood there looking at you through the glass and making all these big plans for you he wanted to give you everything and it was hard for him to always settle for less she hadnt needed everything kate thought later when she sat alone at the table she had only needed parents who loved her and loved each other now she would have to live knowing that what her father had loved most was his own ambition something wrong with your lunch she glanced over and the hand she had pressed protectively against her stomach fisted as byron slid into the chair that tydings had vacated are you on dining room detail i thought the brass stayed up in the lofty regions of the penthouse oh we mingle with the lower floors occasionally he signaled to a waitress hed been watching kate for ten minutes she had sat completely still staring out of the window her meal untouched her eyes dark and miserable the chicken bisque he ordered two i dont want anything i hate to eat alone he said smoothly as the waitress cleared the dishes you can always play with it like you did your salad if youre not feeling well the bisque should perk you up im fine i had a business lunch under the table she pleated her napkin in her lap she wasnt ready to get up wasnt sure her legs were strong enough who eats at business lunches everyone leaning forward he poured two glasses of mineral water you look unhappy i have a client with an imbalance of passive income that always makes me unhappy what do you want de witt a bowl of soup a little conversation you know i developed this hobby of conversation as a child ive never been able to break it thank you lorna he said when the waitress set a basket of warm rolls between them ive noticed that you often have a bit of trouble in that area id be happy to help you as im sort of a buff i dont like small talk there you are i do he held out a roll hed broken apart and buttered in fact im interested in all manner of talk large small meaningless profound why dont we start this particular session with me telling you that ive got an appointment to view that house you recommended good for you since the bread was in her hand now she nibbled the realtor speaks highly of you when kate only grunted then scowled down at the bowl of soup that was slipped under her nose byron smothered a grin damned if she wasnt too much of a challenge to resist i may just solicit your services myself as ill be staying in monterey hardly practical to keep my accountant back in georgia its not necessary to have an accountant in the same location if youre satisfied with his or her work theres no need to change thats the way to drum up business kid i also have a habit of eating he continued if you need help along those lines i can tell you that you start by dipping your spoon into the soup im not hungry think of it as medicine it might put some color back in your cheeks you not only look unhappy kate you look tired beaten down and closing in on ill hoping it would shut him up she spooned up some soup boy now im all perked up its a miracle when he only smiled at her she sighed why did he have to sit there acting so damn nice and making her feel like sludge im sorry im lousy company was your business meeting difficult yes as a matter of fact because it was soothing she sampled the bisque again ill deal with it why dont you tell me what you do when youre not dealing with difficult business problems the headache at the edges of her consciousness wasnt backing off but it wasnt creeping closer i deal with simple business problems and when youre not dealing with business she studied him narrowly the mild polite eyes the easy smile you are coming on to me no im considering coming on to you which is entirely different thats why were having a basic conversation over a bowl of soup his smile widened flirted it also gives you equal opportunity to consider whether or not youd like to come on to me her lips twitched before she could stop them i do appreciate a man who believes in gender equality she also had to appreciate that for a few minutes hed taken her mind off her troubles that he knew it yet didnt push the point i think im beginning to like you kate you are i believe an acquired taste and ive always enjoyed odd flavors thats quite a statement my hearts going pittypat he laughed a quick fullthroated masculine sound that appealed however much she would have preferred otherwise yeah its definite i like you why dont we expand this conversation thing over a full meal say dinner tonight she was tempted to agree for the simple reason that being around him made her think about something other than herself but she set her napkin beside her bowl she thought it would be best to err on the side of caution with a man like byron de witt i dont want to form habits too quickly i have to get back to the office she rose amused when he automatically got to his feet gender equality or not she decided he was southern gentleman through and through thanks for the soup youre welcome he took her hand held it lightly and enjoyed the faint line that popped up between her brows thanks for the conversation we will have to do it again hmm was her best response as she slid the strap of her briefcase over her shoulder and walked away he watched her go and wondered what problem business or otherwise had made her look so devastated and so alone the rumor mill was working overtime at bittle and associates every tiny underripe fruit plucked from the grapevine was chewed lavishly at the water cooler the copy room the storage closet larry bittle and his sons lawrence junior and martinjust call me martycontinued their closeddoor meetings with the other partners every morning copies of accounts were delivered to the group by bittle seniors tightlipped sharpeyed executive assistant regularly if she knew anything went the wisdom of the water cooler she wasnt saying theyre working their way through every account roger told kate hed hunted her down in the stockroom when she went to replenish her supply of computer paper marcie in accounts receivable said theyre even going over internal ledgers and beth the dragon ladys assistant says theyve been on the hot line with the lawyers lips pursed kate grabbed a handful of ticonderoga number s are all your sources female he grinned no but mike in the mail room is coming up dry whats your take gotta figure internal audit yeah thats mine but heres the question kate why in truth that very question had been on her mind for days she considered smart ambitious ruthless people had the best gossip since roger fit all the requirements she decided to share her thoughts in hopes of priming his pump okay weve had a couple of really good years in the past five weve increased our client base by fifteen percent bittles growing so im thinking expansion maybe a new branch theyd put lawrence in charge add more associates and give some of us the option of relocating a big step like that would take a lot of thought and planning and the partners would want to focus hard on the bottom line could be theres been noises before about opening in the la area snagging more media accounts but ive been hearing other grumblings too he leaned closer lowered his voice and his eyes were bright with excitement larrys been thinking about passing the torch retiring why would he kate whispered in response they sounded like conspirators hes only sixty sixtytwo roger glanced over his shoulder and you know how his wife likes those cruises shes always bugging him to take one to europe around the med that sort of thing how do you know that beth assistant to the assistant she got brochures for the old man the bittles fortieth anniversary is coming up this year if he retires early theres going to be a partnership slot up for grabs a new partner it made sense perfect sense all the meetings the account checks the current partners would have to weigh and judge debate and discuss who would be most qualified to move up she barely stopped herself from dancing a jig she had to remember who it was she was talking to roger was her toughest competitor maybe she shrugged though inside glee was spreading like a lovely pink balloon but i dont see larry sailing off into the sunset yet no matter how much his wife nags him well see roger kept a sly smile on his face but somethings going to happen and its going to happen soon kate walked sedately back to her office closed the door put her supplies neatly away then she danced her jig she didnt want to get ahead of herself didnt want to start projecting the hell she didnt dropping into her chair she spun herself around once twice and a giddy third time she had an mba from harvard had graduated in the top ten percent of her class in the five years shed worked for bittle she had brought in twelve new accounts through client recommendations and had lost only one to that jerk roger but even that hadnt gone out of house she personally generated over two hundred thousand a year in billing so did roger she admitted she kept an eye on him but when marty had awarded her a raise last year hed told her she was considered the cream of bittles associates larry bittle called her by her first name and his wife and daughtersinlaw had been known to drop by pretenses to shop a partnership at twentyeight she would be the youngest partner ever at bittle she would have exceeded by years her own rigid expectations of herself and wouldnt it in some way erase this taint she felt this secret she had buried inside if she was a success it would overshadow all the rest she allowed herself to dream about itthe new office the new salary the new prestige she would be consulted on policy her opinion would be weighed and respected giggling she leaned back in the chair and spun again she would have a private secretary she would have everything shed ever wanted kate imagined picking up the phone calling the templetons in cannes theyd be so happy for her so proud of her finally she would be able to believe that everything theyd done for her was deserved shed have a celebration with margo and laura oh that would be sweet at long last kate powell had come into her own had done something important and solid years and years of work and study of aching shoulders tired eyes and a burning stomach would have paid off all she had to do was wait forcing herself to push the dream to the back of her mind she swiveled to her computer and got to work she hummed as she ran figures calculated expenditures logged tax deductions clucked over capital gains and figured depreciation as usual she tuned in to the work and lost track of time kate came up blinking when the beep from her watch told her it was five oclock another fifteen minutes to close the file she decided then glanced up in mild annoyance at the knock on her door yes ms powell lucinda newmanor the dragon lady as she was unaffectionately called among the rank and filestood imposingly in the doorway youre wanted in the main conference room oh kates heart gave a wild joyful leap but she kept her face composed thanks ms newman ill be right there well aware that her hands were trembling with anticipation kate pressed them together in her lap she had to be cool and professional bittle wasnt going to offer a partnership to a giddy giggling woman she had to be what she always was what they expected her to be practical levelheaded and oh she was going to savor the moment remember every detail later when she was out of sight and earshot she would scream all the way to templeton house kate rolled down her sleeves shrugged into her jacket and smoothed it into place she hesitated over taking her briefcase then decided it only made her look more dedicated to the job with measured steps she took the stairs to the next floor walked past the partners offices toward the executive conference room no one who chanced to see her in the quiet corridor would have realized her feet werent touching the tasteful tan carpet she thumbed an antacid out of the roll in her pocket knowing it would do little to calm her jittery stomach she wondered if a bride on her wedding night could feel any more nervous and thrilled than she did as she raised a hand to knock politely on the thick paneled door come in she lifted her chin put a polite smile on her face as she turned the knob they were all there and her heart gave another skipping leap all the partners the five powers of the firm were seated around the long glossy table large tumblers of water stood by each place she skimmed her gaze over each of them wanting to remember this moment fusty calvin meyers with his usual suspenders and red bow tie elegant and terrifying amanda devin looking stern and beautiful marty of course sweet and homely and rumpled lawrence junior steady balding and cool and of course the senior bittle she had always thought he looked like spencer tracythat livedin face the sweep of white hair the stocky powerful little body her pulse bumped aware that all eyes were on her you wanted to see me sit down kate from his seat at the head of the table bittle gestured to one at the foot yes sir he cleared his throat as she took her chair settled we thought it best to meet at the end of the workday youre aware im sure that weve been involved for the past several days in a check of our accounts yes sir she smiled speculations been racing down the corridors when he didnt smile back she felt a nervous tickle at the back of her throat its hard not to get on the rumor train sir yes he let out a breath folded his hands a discrepancy in an income tax payment came to mr bittle juniors attention last week a discrepancy her gaze shifted to lawrence in the sunstream account he clarified thats one of mine the nervous tickle at the back of her throat changed to a nervous dread in her stomach had she made some sort of stupid error in the chaos of the tax crunch what kind of discrepancy the clients copy of the tax form indicates a federal payment due of seven thousand six hundred and fortyeight dollars lawrence opened a file took out a thick stack of papers is this your work ms powell he was the only bittle who called her ms powell everyone in the firm was accustomed to his formality but it was the clipped manner of his speech that put her on alert carefully she took out her glasses and slipped them on as the papers were passed down to her yes she said after a quick glance its my account i did the tax work this is my signature and as with several of our clients the firm cuts the checks for tax payments for this one some prefer it she dropped her hands into her lap it distances them a bit from the sting and its more convenient convenient amanda commented and drew kates eye for whom this was trouble was all kate could think but from what and where many clients prefer to come into the office discuss the tax situation and the resultsargue and vent they all knew this she thought scanning the table again why did she have to explain the client will sign the necessary forms and the account exec will issue the check out of escrow ms powell lawrence took another stack of papers from his file can you explain this as smoothly as possible kate wiped her damp palms on her skirt then studied the forms passed to her her mind went momentarily blank she blinked focused swallowed hard im not sure i understand this is another copy of the filed for sunstream but the tax due amount is different twentytwo hundred dollars less amanda pointed out this is the form and the payment made on april fifteenth of this year to the irs the check drawn out of escrow was for this amount i dont understand when or how the other copy was generated kate began all work sheets are filed of course but any excess forms are shredded kate bittle drew her attention with one quiet word the excess money was transferred via computer out of the clients escrow account in cash in cash she repeated blank since this came to our attention we initiated a check on all accounts bittles face was grave as he watched her since late march of this year amounts that total seventyfive thousand dollars have been withdrawn from escrow accounts seventyfive thousand in excess of tax payments computer withdrawals in cash from your accounts from my clients she felt the blood drain out of her face couldnt stop it its the same pattern calvin meyers spoke for the first time tugging on his bright red tie two copies of the s small adjustments on various forms to total excess on the clients copy in amounts ranging from twelve hundred to thirtyone hundred dollars he puffed out his cheeks we might not have caught it but i golf with sid sun hes a whiner about taxes and kept after me to look over his form and be certain there was nothing else he could use to cut his payment embezzlement were they accusing her of embezzlement was this some awful nightmare they knew about her father and thought no no that was impossible while her hand flexed nervously in her lap she kept her voice even you examined one of my accounts calvin lifted an eyebrow the last thing hed expected from steadyasshegoes kate powell was blankeyed panic i did so to get him off my back and in examining his copy i found several small errors i thought it best to look further and pulled out our file copy of his latest return she couldnt feel anything even her fingertips had gone numb you think i stole seventyfive thousand dollars from my clients from this firm kate if you could just explain how you think this might have happened marty began were all here to listen no her father had stolen from clients her father not her how could you think it her voice shook shamed her we havent come to any firm conclusion amanda countered the facts the numbers however are here in black and white black and white she thought as the print blurred as it overlapped with visions of newspaper articles from twenty years past no i she had to lift a hand rub her eyes to clear them its not i didnt amanda tapped one scarlet nail on the tabletop shed expected outrage had counted on the outrage of the innocent instead what she saw was the trembling of the guilty if marty hadnt gone to bat for you if he hadnt insisted we search for some rational explanation even incompetence on your part we would have had this meeting days ago amanda bittle said quietly but she shook her head larry this is embezzlement and over and above the legal ramifications client trust and confidence have to be considered we need to clear this matter up quickly ive never taken a penny not a penny from any client though terrified that her legs would buckle kate shot to her feet she would not be sick she told herself though her stomach was heaving into her throat i couldnt it seemed to be all she could say i couldnt lawrence frowned at his hands ms powell money is easily hidden laundered spent youve assisted a number of clients in investments accounts in the caymans in switzerland investments bad investments she pressed a hand to her throbbing temple no that had been her father thats my job i do my job you recently opened a business calvin pointed out im a onethird partner in a secondhand boutique grief and fear and nausea swirled inside her made her hands shake she had to be coherent she ordered herself shaking and weeping only made her look guilty it took almost all my savings to do it she drew in a breath that burned stared straight into bittles eyes mr bittle but her voice broke and she had to begin again mr bittle ive worked for you for five years you hired me a week out of graduate school ive never given this firm anything but my complete loyalty and dedication and ive never given a client anything but my best im not a thief i find it difficult to believe you are kate ive known you since you were a child and always considered my decision to hire you one of my best judgment calls i know your family he paused waiting for her to rebound to express her fury at being used to demand to assist the firm in finding the answers when she did nothing but stare blindly he had no choice however he said slowly this matter cant be ignored well continue to investigate internally for now it may become necessary to go outside the firm with this to the police the thought of it dissolved her legs so that she had to brace herself with a hand on the table her vision grayed and wavered youre going to the police if it becomes necessary bittle told her we hope to resolve the matter quietly bittle and associates is responsible at this point for adjusting the escrow accounts bittle studied the woman standing at the end of the table shook his head the partners have agreed that it is in the firms best interest for you to take a leave of absence until this is cleared up youre suspending me because you think im a thief kate we need to look into this carefully and we have to do whatever is in the best interest of our clients a suspected embezzler cant handle accounts the tears were going to come but not yet she could hold them back just a little longer youre firing me a leave of absence bittle repeated its the same thing accusations disgrace you dont believe me you think ive stolen from my own clients and you want me out of the office he saw no other choice at this time yes any personal items in your office will be sent to you im sorry kate marty will escort you out of the building she let out a shuddering breath i havent done anything but my best picking up her briefcase she turned stiffly and walked to the door im sorry christ kate with his lumbering stride marty caught up with her what a mess what a disaster he started huffing when she took the stairs down to the main level i couldnt turn them around she stopped ignoring the pain in her stomach the throbbing in her head do you believe me marty do you believe me she saw the flicker of doubt in his earnest myopic eyes before he answered i know theres an explanation he touched her gently on the shoulder its all right she made herself push through the glass doors on the lobby level walk outside kate if theres anything i can do for you any way i can help he trailed off lamely standing by the door as she all but ran to her car nothing she said to herself theres just nothing at the last minute she stopped herself from running to templeton house to laura to annie to anyone who would fold her in comforting arms and take her side she swung her car to the side of the road rather than up the steep winding drive she got out and walked to the cliffs she could stand alone she promised herself she had had shocks survived tragedies before shed lost her parents and there was nothing more devastating than that there had been boys shed dreamed over in high school who had never dreamed back shed gotten over it her first lover in college had grown bored with her broken her heart and moved on she hadnt crumbled once years before she had fantasized about finding seraphinas dowry all alone of bearing it proudly home to her aunt and uncle she had learned to live without that triumph she was afraid she was so afraid like father like daughter oh dear god would it come out now would it all come out and how much more damning then what would this do to the people who loved her who had had such hopes for her what was it people said blood will tell had she done something made some ridiculous mistake christ how could she think clearly now when her life had been turned upside down and shattered at her feet she had to wrap her arms tight around her body against the spring breeze which now seemed frigid shed committed no crime she reminded herself shed done nothing wrong all shed done was lose a job just a job it had nothing to do with the past nothing to do with blood nothing to do with where she had come from with a whimper she eased down onto a rock who was she trying to fool somehow it had to do with everything how could it not shed lost what she had taught herself to value most next to family success and reputation now she was exactly what shed always been afraid she was a failure how could she face them any of them with the fact that shed been fired was under suspicion of embezzling that she had as she always advised her clients not to put all of her eggs in one basket only to see it smashed but she would have to face them she had to tell her family before someone else did oh and someone would it wouldnt take long she didnt have the luxury of digging a hole and hiding in it everything she was and did was attached to the templetons what would her aunt and uncle think they would have to see the parallel if they doubted her she could stand anything anything at all except their doubt and disappointment she reached in her pocket chewed viciously on a tums and wished for a bottle of aspirinor some of the handy tranqs margo had once used to think shed once been so disdainful of those little crutches to think she had once considered seraphina a fool and a coward for choosing to leap rather than stay and face her loss she looked out to sea then rose and walked closer to the edge the rocks below were mean that was what shed always liked best about them those jagged unforgiving spears standing up defiantly to the constant violent crash of water she had to be like the rocks now she thought she had to stand and face whatever happened next her father hadnt been strong he hadnt stood he hadnt faced it and now in some twisted way she was paying the price byron studied her from the side of the road hed seen her car whiz past as he was leaving joshs house he wasnt sure what impulse had pushed him to follow her still wasnt sure what was making him stay there was something about the way she looked standing there at the edge of the cliff so alone it made him nervous and a little annoyed that vulnerability again he supposed a quiet neediness that called to his protective side he wouldnt have pegged her as the type to walk the cliffs or stare out to sea he nearly got back into his car and drove off but he shrugged and decided that since he was here hed might as well enjoy the view hell of a spot he said as he walked up to her it gave him perverse pleasure to see her jolt i was enjoying it she muttered and kept her back to him plenty of view for two to enjoy i saw your car and when he got a look at her he saw that her eyes were damp hed always been compelled to dry a womans tears bad day he murmured and offered her a handkerchief its just windy not that windy i wish youd go away ordinarily i try to comply with womens requests since im not going to in your case why dont you sit down tell me about it he took her arm thinking the tension in it was edgy enough to cut glass think of me as a priest he suggested dragging her with him i wanted to be one once to use some clever phrasing bullshit no really he pulled her down on a rock with him i was eleven then puberty hit and the rest is history she tried and failed to tug free and rise did it ever occur to you that i dont want to talk to you that i want to be alone to soothe because her voice was catching helplessly he stroked a hand over her hair it crossed my mind but i rejected it people who feel sorry for themselves always want to talk about it that next to sex was the main reason i decided against the seminary and dancing priests dont get lots of opportunity to dance with pretty womenwhich i suppose is the same thing as sex well enough about me he put a determined hand under her chin and lifted it she was pale those long spiky lashes were wet and those deep does eyes damp but your eyes arent red enough for you to have had a good cry yet im not a sniveler listen kid my sister highly recommends a good cry and shed deck you for calling her a sniveler gently he rubbed his thumb over kates chin screamings good too and throwing breakables there was a lot of that in my house theres no point venting he interrupted smoothly purging there arent any breakables around here but you could let out a good scream emotions welling up inside her threatened to choke her furiously she jerked her face free of his hand i dont need you or anyone to charm me out of a mood i can handle my own problems just fine if i need a friend all i have to do is go up to the house up to the house she repeated as her gaze focused on the towering structure of stone and wood and glass that held everything precious to her covering her face with her hands she broke thats a girl he murmured relieved by the natural flow of tears come here now he drew her close stroking her hair her back get it all out she couldnt stop it didnt matter who he was his arms were strong his voice understanding with her face buried against his chest she sobbed out the frustration the grief the fear let herself for one liberating moment be coddled he rested his cheek on her hair held her lightly lightly because she seemed so small so fragile a good grip might shatter those thin bones tears soaked through his shirt cooled from hot to cold on his skin im sorry damn it she would have pulled away but he continued to hold her humiliated she squeezed her aching eyes shut i never would have done that if youd left me alone youre better off this way its not healthy to hold everything in automatically he kissed the top of her head before easing her back to study her face why it should have charmed him wet blotchy streaked with mascara as it was he couldnt have said but he had a terrible urge to shift her onto his lap to kiss that soft sad mouth to stroke her again not quite so consolingly bad move he cautioned himself and wondered how any man faced with such sexy distress could think like a priest not that you look better he took the handkerchief shed balled up in her fist and mopped at her face but you should feel better enough to tell me why youre so upset it has nothing to do with you so what she could feel another sob bubbling in her chest and blurted out the words before it could escape i got fired he continued calmly cleaning and drying her face why they think her voice hitched they think i take a breath he advised and say it fast they think i stole money out of client escrow embezzled seventyfive thousand watching her face he stuck the ruined linen back in his pocket why becausebecause there are duplicate s and money missing and theyre my clients and my fathermy father but she couldnt say that not out loud in fits and starts she babbled out the gist of her meeting with the partners a great deal of it was incoherent details crisscrossing and overlapping but he continued to nod and listen i didnt take any money she let out a long unsteady breath i dont expect you to believe me but of course i believe you it was her turn to gather her wits why leaning back a little he took out a cigar shielding the flame on his lighter with a cupped hand in my line of work you get a handle on people quickly youve been around the hotel business most of your life you know how it is there are plenty of times with a guest or staff that you have to make a snap judgment youd better be accurate puffing out smoke he studied her my take on you katherine in the first five minutes waswell among other thingsthat youre the type of woman who would choke on her integrity before she loosened it to breathe her breath came out shaky but some of the panic eased i appreciate it i think id have to say you worked for a bunch of shortsighted idiots she sniffled theyre accountants there you go he smiled ran a finger down her cheek when she glared a flash there in those big brown eyes thats better so are you going to take it lying down rising she straightened her shoulders i cant think about how or what i can take now i only know i wouldnt work at bittle again if they came crawling on their hands and knees through broken glass thats not what i meant i meant someones embezzling and pointing the finger at you what are you going to do about it i dont care you dont care he shook his head i find that hard to believe the katherine powell ive seen is a scrapper i said i dont care and her voice hitched again if she fought looked too close demanded too much they might uncover what her father had done then it would be worse theres nothing i can do youve got a brain he corrected it doesnt feel like it at the moment she put a hand to her head everything inside was mushy and aching they cant do anything else to me because i dont have the money and theyd never be able to prove i do as far as im concerned right now finding whos skimming is bittles problem i just want to be left alone surprised at her he stood up id want their ass right now i just want to be able to get through the next few hours i have to tell my family she closed her eyes earlier today i actually thought hoped that i was going to be called in and offered a partnership signs indicated she said bitterly i couldnt wait to tell them brag but he said it gently with hardly any sting i suppose look at what i did be proud of me because well thats done now i have to tell them that i lost it all that the prospects of getting another position or finessing any clients are nil for the foreseeable future theyre family he stepped toward her and laid his hands on her shoulders families stand by each other i know that for a moment she wanted to take his hand he had such big competent hands she wanted to take it and press it to her cheek instead she stepped back turned away that makes it worse i cant begin to tell you how much worse now im feeling sorry for myself all over again it comes and goes kate well aware that they were doing a little dance and dodge of physical contact he draped an arm around her shoulders do you want me to go up with you no she was appalled because for an instant shed wanted to say yes to lean her head against that broad shoulder close her eyes and let him lead no i have to do it she slipped away from him again but faced him this was awfully nice of you really nice he smiled his dimples deepening that wouldnt have been insulting if you hadnt sounded quite so surprised i didnt mean to be insulting she managed a smile of her own i meant to be grateful i am grateful father de witt testing he lifted a hand skimmed his fingers through her short cap of hair i decided i dont want you to think of me as a priest after all his hand slid down the back of her neck its that sex thing again she felt it herselfinconvenient little hormonal tugs hmm it seemed as good a response as any and certainly safe id better go get this done eyes warily on his she backed up ill see you around apparently you will he stepped forward she backed up again what are you doing amused at both of them he raised his eyebrows going to my car im parked behind you oh well as casually as possible she turned and walked to the car as he fell into step beside her i ah have you seen the house yet the one on seventeen mile i have an appointment to view it tonight as it happens good thats good she jangled her keys in her pocket before pulling them out well i hope you like it ill let you know he closed a hand over hers on the door handle when her gaze flew suspiciously to his he smiled my daddy taught me to open doors for ladies consider it a southern thing she shrugged slid into the car well bye ill be in touch she wanted to ask what that was supposed to mean but he was already walking toward his own car besides she had a pretty good idea chapter five its outrageous its insulting in a rare show of temper laura stormed around the solarium thirty minutes before kate had interrupted homework time and laura had shifted from solving the mysteries of punctuation and multiplication tables with her daughters to the shock of hearing kates story watching her friend kate was glad shed had the presence of mind to ask to speak to laura privately the flash in the gray eyes the angry flush staining those cool ivory cheeks and the wild gestures might have frightened the children i dont want you to be upset kate began you dont want me to be upset laura rounded on her the curling swing of chinlength bronze hair flying the soft pretty mouth pulled back into a snarl then what exactly should i be when my sister gets plugged between the eyes oh yeah kate thought this definitely would have given the girls a jolt if she hadnt been so miserable she would have laughed laura the cool had metamorphosed into laura the enraged despite being five two she looked capable of going ten rounds with the champ dont want me to be upset laura repeated her small almost fairylike frame revving high as she stalked around the lush glasswalled room well im not upset im past upset and heading beyond pissed how dare they how dare those pinheaded idiots think for one minute for one instant that youd steal money she slapped at the swaying fronds of a potted palm when i think how many times the bittles have been guests in this house it makes my blood boil treating you like a common criminal escorting you out of the building im surprised they didnt bring out the cuffs and the swat team sun pouring through the glass walls glinted fiercely in her eyes bastards idiot bastards she pounced all five feet two inches of raging fury on the slim white phone beside the padded chaise were calling josh were suing them hold it no hold it laura torn between tears and laughter kate slapped a hand over her friends for the life of her kate couldnt remember why shed hesitated to come here to templeton house this was exactly what shed needed to snap her back i cant tell you how much i appreciate the tirade but you havent begun to see a tirade ive got nothing to sue them about the evidence i dont give a fuck about evidence at kates bubble of laughter her eyes narrowed just what the hell are you laughing at ill never get used to hearing you say fuck its just not natural but she swallowed because the laugh had come perilously close to hysteria and seeing you storm around this elegant room with all the hibiscus and ferns is quite a show she caught her breath i didnt come here to send you on a rampage though its doing wonders for my bruised ego this isnt about ego laura struggled to get a grip on her temper she lost it rarely because it was a powerful thing a dangerous thing its about defamation of character loss of income were not going to let them get away with this kate weve got a lawyer in the family and were going to use him there was no use in pointing out that josh wasnt a litigator she certainly wouldnt have told laura that the very thought of pursuing the matter particularly through the legal system had her feeling nauseated again instead she struggled to keep it light maybe we could have him tack on loss of consortium just for kicks i always liked that one how can you joke because youve made me feel so much better suddenly she felt like crying again and hugged laura tight instead i knew in my heart youd stand behind me but in my head in my gut i was just so shattered oh god she eased away to press a hand to her stomach im going to start again oh kate oh honey im so sorry gently now laura slipped a hand around her waist lets sit down well get some tea some wine some chocolate and figure this out kate sniffed back the tears nodded teas good alcohol hasnt been agreeing with me lately she managed a smile chocolate never fails okay just sit right here normally she would have gone to the kitchen herself but she didnt want to leave kate alone instead she crossed the glossy fieldstone floor to the intercom by the doorwaythe system peter had insisted they install to summon the servants after a few murmured instructions she came back to kate and sat down i feel so useless kate said so stripped i dont think i appreciated really how margo must have felt last year when she had the rug pulled out from under her you were there for her just like margo and i and everyone will be here for you anyone who knows you wont believe you did anything wrong even one who doesnt she murmured thinking of byron still plenty will believe it its going to get out i can promise you that im used to defending myself she continued skinny girls with more brains than charm tend to hide through high school or fight through it and you always fought im out of practice she closed her eyes and leaned back the room smelled like a garden she thought peaceful calm she badly needed to find calm again i dont know what im going to do laura its probably the first time in my life i dont have a plan she opened her eyes again met the concern in lauras i know its going to sound foolish but everything i am and wanted to be was tied up in my career i was good at it more than good i needed to be i chose bittle because it was an old established firm there was plenty of room and opportunity for advancement because it was close to home i liked the people thereand i dont like that many people i felt comfortable and appreciated youd feel comfortable and appreciated at templeton laura said quietly and took her hand you know theres no question that you could have a position there tomorrow mom and dad wanted you in the organization with a taint on her she thought that stretched back a generation no that she would not ask theyve done enough for me kate thats ridiculous not to me i cant go crawling to them now id hate myself it was the only thing she felt capable of standing firm on maybe it was pride but it was all she had left its going to be hard enough to call them and tell them about this you know exactly what their reaction will be but ill do it if you like would they remember kate wondered just for an instant remember and doubt that she had to face as well alone no ill call them in the morning she ran a hand over her slim navy skirt and tried to be practical ive got a little time to weigh my options money isnt an immediate problem ive got some set aside and theres the income meager though it is from the shop her hand jerked oh god oh my god is this going to affect the shop of course not dont worry dont worry kate sprang up her stomach began doing flipflops again pretenses third partner suspected of embezzlement cpa skimming client accounts former templeton ward under investigation she squeezed her eyes shut terrified of what that investigation might uncover blood will tell think of now she ordered herself one step at a time jesus laura it never occurred to me until this second i could ruin it a lot of my clients shop there just stop it youre innocent i wouldnt be surprised if a great many of your clients dismiss this whole business as nonsense people have a funny attitude about their money laura and about the people they hire to handle it for them that may be but youre going to start handling mine dont even think about arguing laura said before kate could open her mouth i dont have a lot to work with since peter scalped me in the divorce but i expect you to fix that and its about time you started pulling your weight at the shop margo and i are adequate bookkeepers but thats a matter of opinion pleased laura cocked a brow well then youd better get busy protecting our investment you were too busy before but now youve got time on your hands so it seems and by putting in some time behind the counter as well you can take some of the pressure off margo and me kates mouth fell open you expect me to clerk regularly damn it laura im not a saleswoman neither was margo laura said placidly and neither was i circumstances change bend or break kate she wanted to remind laura that she had an mba from harvard shed graduated with honors a full year early shed been within a breath of a partnership at one of the most respected firms in the area had handled millions of dollars a year in accounts she closed her mouth again because none of it was worth a damn at the moment i dont know an armani from anything youll learn it was selfindulgent but she pouted anyway i dont even like jewelry the customers do i dont understand why people need to clutter up their house with dust catchers laura smiled if kate was arguing she thought she was coming around thats easy to keep us in business good point kate conceded i havent done too badly the few saturdays ive been able to help out its just dealing with people day after day youll learn to live with it we really need you on the books we didnt push it before because we didnt want to pressure you actually margo did but i talked her out of it one of the many wounds shed been planning to lick healed over really no offense kate but weve been open about ten months margo and i decided after about ten days that we really hate accounting we hate spreadsheets we hate percentages we hate figuring the sales tax we have to send off every month laura let out a sigh lowered her voice i shouldnt tell you she asked me not to but what well margo we didnt think we could add to our overhead with a fulltime bookkeeper not yet anyway so margos been looking into taking classes classes kate blinked accounting classes margo jesus christ and business management and computers laura winced now with the baby coming along it seems like a lot to handle im fairly computerliterate she added hoping to press her point i have to be working conventions and special events at the hotel but retails a different matter entirely knowing the value of timing she waited a beat let it sink in i just dont see how i could squeeze any classes in myself between working at templeton the shop the girls of course not you should have told me you were having that rough a time id have picked up the ball youve been crosseyed with work for six months it didnt seem fair fair hell its business ill come in first thing in the morning and take a good look at the books laura managed to keep her smile pleasant rather than smug as ann sullivan wheeled in a tea cart the girls have finished their homework ann began i brought extra cups and plates so they could join you i thought you might enjoy a little tea party thank you annie miss kate its good to see her smile of greeting faded the minute she looked into kates swollen redrimmed eyes whats the matter darling oh annie kate caught the hand ann had lifted to her cheek soothed herself with it my lifes a mess ill get the girls laura said rising and another cup she added nodding at ann well have our tea party and work on straightening it out because kate had always been the awkward one and the feisty one she held a special place in anns heart after pouring two cups selecting two chocolatefrosted cakes ann sat down and draped an arm around kates shoulder now you drink your tea and eat some sweets and tell annie all about it sighing kate burrowed dorothy from kansas was right she decided there really was no place like home i dont like the way she keeps talking about software behind the counter of pretenses margo muttered into lauras ear the only software i want to know about is cashmere we dont have to know laura muttered right back because she knows think about all the sunday evenings we sweated over the books right but margo pouted actually i thought i was getting pretty good at it the way she talks its like i was braindead want to go into the back room and help her out no that was definite margo scanned a browsing customer calculated nine more seconds before the next subtle sales pitch but i dont like the way shes taking this whole mess no way our kate walks away from a fight shes hurt shaken though laura was worried over it herself this is just recovery time it better be im not going to be able to hold josh back from storming into bittle much longer a martial light glowed in her mediterranean blue eyes im not going to be able to hold myself back for that matter creeps jerks she continued to mutter as she approached the customer but her face underwent a metamorphosis easy sophisticated beauty thats a gorgeous lamp isnt it it belonged to christie brinkley margo trailed a finger down the motherofpearl shade confidentially it was a gift from billy and she didnt want to keep it around any longer truth or fiction laura wondered muffling a laugh the ownership was fact but the little sidebar was probably fantasy laura with the longsuffering look shed worn after the first hour with the books kate stepped out of the back office do you realize how much money youre wasting by shortordering boxes the more you order at a time the less each costs the way we go through them ah yes youre right out of defense and necessity laura looked at her watch oops piano lessons gotta go youre buying tape at the dime store rather than through a wholesaler kate added dogging laura to the door i should be shot bye and she escaped her foot tapping kate turned with the intent of nagging margo but her partner was busy fussing with a customer over some silly little lamp that didnt look as if it could light a closet much less a room it helped to nag it felt good to take charge even if it was over boxes and tape miss oh miss another woman came out of the wardrobe room carrying a pair of white spangled pumps do you have these in an eight narrow kate looked at the shoes looked at the woman and wondered why anyone would want a pair of shoes covered with iridescent sequins everythings out thats in stock but these are too small she all but wailed it thrusting the shoes at kate theyre perfect with the dress ive chosen i have to have them look kate began then ground her teeth together as margo caught her eye with a fiery warning look she remembered the routine margo had drummed into her head hated it but remembered pretenses is almost exclusively one of a kind but im sure we can find something that works for you already missing her computer she guided the customer back into the wardrobe room it took a great deal of control not to yelp shoes were tumbled everywhere rather than neatly arranged on the shelves half a dozen cocktail dresses were tossed haphazardly over a chair others had slipped to the neat little aubusson been busy havent we kate said with a frozen smile the woman let out a trill of laughter that cut right through the top of kates skull oh im just in love with everything but im very decisive once ive made up my mind that was a statement for the books okay which dress have you become decisive about it took twenty minutes twenty hemming and hawing oohing and ahing minutes before the customer settled on a pair of white slingbacks with satin bows kate struggled to arrange the yards of white tulle in the skirt of the dress the woman couldnt live without tulle kate thought as she finally zipped it into a bag that would certainly make the woman resemble an oversized wedding cake her work complete kate handed over dress shoes and sales receipt and even managed a smile thanks so much for shopping at pretenses oh i love it here i just have to see these earrings earrings kates heart sank these i think theyd be wonderful with the dress dont you could you just take it out of the bag again so i could see you want me to take the dress out of the bag with a fierce smile kate leaned over the counter why dont you oh the austrian crystals just make those earrings dont they dashing around the counter margo gave kate a shove that knocked her a full foot sideways i have a bracelet thats just made to go with them kate why dont you take the dress back out while i unlock the case ill take the damn dress back out kate muttered with her back turned but im not putting it in again no one can make me spoiling for a fight she scowled as the door jingled open her scowl only deepened at byrons quick smile hello ladies ill just browse until youre free youre free margo said meaningfully to kate ill finish up here one devil was the same as another kate supposed and walked reluctantly out from behind the counter looking for something mothers day i bought my mothers birthday present in here a couple of months ago and it made me a hero i figured id stick with a winner he reached out skimmed a knuckle along her jaw how are you feeling fine embarrassed at the memory of sobbing in his arms she turned stiffly away did you have anything specific in mind in answer he put a hand on her shoulder turned her around i thought wed parted on semifriendly terms at least we did she reeled herself in there was no point in blaming him though it was more satisfying im just a little wired i nearly punched that customer lifting an eyebrow byron glanced over kates head at the woman currently sighing over a bracelet because she wanted to see earrings kate said between her teeth good god what is the world coming to if you promise not to hit me i swear i wont even look at a pair of earrings in here i may never look at a pair anywhere again she supposed that deserved at least a smile sorry its a long story so what does your mother like earrings sorry he let out a rumbling chuckle hard to resist shes an internist with nerves of steel a wicked temper and a sentimental streak for anything that has to do with her children im thinking hearts and flowers anything that falls into that basic symbolism thats nice she did smile she was a sucker for a man who not only loved his mama but understood her i dont know the stock very well its my first week on the job she looked neat as a pin he mused in her tidy little gray suit with a windsorknotted striped tie the sensible shoes shouldnt have led him to speculate on her legs surprised that that was exactly what he was doing he cleared his throat hows it going she glanced back at margo i think my coworkers are plotting my demise other than that good enough thanks but when he continued to study her she shifted you did come in for a gift rightnot to check up on me or anything i can do both id rather you the door opened again heralding the entrance of three laughing chattering women kate grabbed byrons arm in a steely grip okay im with you you need my undivided attention ill give you ten percent off if you take up all my time until they leave a real people person arent you katherine im a desperate woman dont screw with me she kept her hand firmly on his arm as she steered him to a corner of the shop your scents different again he commented indulging himself with a sniff close to her hair subtle yet passionate something margo squirted on me when i was distracted she said absently this was her new life she reminded herself the old was gone and she was going to make the best of what she had left she likes us to push the merchandise shed have hung jewelry all over me if i hadnt escaped from her safe distance she glanced back and made a face at her partner look she made me wear this pin he glanced down at the simple gold crescent adorning her lapel its very nice and drew the eye to the soft swell of her breasts simple classic subdued yeah right what do pins do but put holes in your clothes okay back to business it so happens theres this music box that might make you a hero again music box he brought himself back to the business at hand could work i remember it because margo just picked it up at an estate sale in san francisco shed know the circa this and the design that i can tell you its lovely she lifted it a glossy mahogany box large enough for jewelry or love letters on its domed lid was a painting of a young couple in medieval dress a unicorn and a circle of flowers the lid opened to deepblue velvet and the charming strains of fur elise theres a problem he began why her back went up its beautiful its practical its romantic well he rubbed his chin how am i going to take up all your time when youve shown me the perfect gift first thing oh kate glanced over her shoulder again the three fresh customers were in the wardrobe room making a lot of femaleonthehunt noises trying not to feel guilty she looked over at margo who was expertly rebagging the tulle want to buy something else its never too early to shop for christmas he angled his head youve got to learn to gauge your clientele kid heres a man coming in to buy a mothers day gift three days before the mark a gift that he will now have to have shipped overnight to atlanta that type doesnt shop for christmas until sometime after december twentyfirst thats very impractical i like to use up my practicality at work life is different when he smiled at her the creases in his face deepened she liked the look of them caught herself wondering how it would feel to trace her finger along those charming dents surprised at herself she blew out a breath steady girl then maybe you should look at something else to like compare no this is it it intrigued him to see that he was making her uncomfortable and that the discomfort was sexual deliberately he put his hands over hers so that they held the box together why dont i dawdle over the wrapping paper that she decided was definitely a comeon shed have to think about whether or not she liked it later okay thatll work she sent margo a beaming smile as they crossed paths then set the music box carefully on the counter margo closed the door behind her nowsatisfied customer and aimed an automatically flirtatious smile at byron hello byron its wonderful to see you margo he caught her hand brought it to his lips the gesture was as automatic as her smile you look incredible as always she laughed we just dont get enough men in here particularly handsome gallant ones have you found something you like kate saved my life with a mothers day gift did she as kate studiously boxed byrons selection margo leaned over the counter caught kate by her redandbluestriped tie and tugged viciously im going to kill you later excuse me byron i have customers kate kept her hot eyes on margos retreating back see i told you she wants me dead one definition of family is a constant state of adjustment kate lifted a brow from websters from de witts lets try the paper with the little violets margos a remarkable woman ive never known a man who didnt think so no thats wrong she said as she measured wrapping paper lauras exhusband couldnt stand her of course that was because shes the housekeepers daughter and hes a pussfaced snob and i think it was because he wanted her men do and it irritated him intrigued by the brisk way she worked the almost mathematical manner in which she aligned the box and folded corners on the gift wrap he leaned on the counter her hands were really quite lovely he noted narrow competent unadorned how did he feel about you oh he hated me too but that didnt have anything to do with sexual fantasy im the poor relation who has the nerve to say what she thinks when her stomach jittered she glanced up and frowned i dont know why i told you all that could be repressed conversation urges you dont talk to people for long periods then you get caught in a conversation and forget you dont like to talk to people i told you it can be a pleasant hobby i dont like to talk to people she muttered most people you want purple ribbon or white purple you interest me kate wary she looked up again i dont think thats necessary just an observation i assumed you were cold prim rude annoying and selfinvolved im not ordinarily that far wrong with people she jerked the ribbon into a knot snipped off the ends youre not this time either except for the prim no the rude and annoying probably stick but ive been reevaluating the rest she chose a large elaborate bow i dont want an evaluation i didnt ask its another hobby of mine gift card frowning again she found the one to match the paper and slapped it on the counter in front of him we can overnight it im counting on it he handed her his credit card then took out a pen to write on the card oh by the way i made an offer on the house you recommended like the music box its exactly what i was looking for good for you after a brief search she found the shipping form set it down beside the box she suppressed the urge to ask him about it the house what had appealed to him the terms damn conversation if youll fill in the name and address where you want it shipped well have fedex pick it up in the morning shell get it with twentyfour hours to spare and save you a whining phone call his head lifted my mother doesnt whine i was referring to you her smug smile faltered when two more customers came in isnt that handy byron dashed off his mothers name and address were all done just in time for you to help some new customers listen de witt byron no no dont bother to grovel youre on your own he pocketed his card the receipt then tore off his copy of the shipping form himself see you around kid he strolled toward the door the sound of miss could you show me these earrings was music to his soul chapter six byron didnt like to interfere with his department heads but he knewand wanted them to knowthat at templeton problems rose to the top his interest in hotels and all their crosshatched inner workings had begun during a summer stint at atlantas doubletree three months as a bellman had taught him more than the proper way to handle a guests luggage and had earned him more than enough cash to buy his first vintage car hed learned there were dramas and tragedies playing out daily not just behind the closed doors of rooms and suites but behind the front desk in sales and marketing in housekeeping and engineering in fact everywhere within the buzzing hive of a busy hotel it had fascinated him had pushed him toward sampling other aspects from desk clerk to concierge his curiosity about people who they were what they expected what they dreamed of had given him a career he wasnt the doctor his parents had not so secretly hoped he would be nor had he been the travelweary trustfund kid his circumstances could have made him he had a career he enjoyed and the constant variety of life in a big hotel continually intrigued him he was a problem solver one who considered the individual as well as the big picture his choice of moving into the templeton organization had been a simple one hed spent a great deal of time studying hotelsthe luxurious the opulent the small and tidy the chains with their brisk pace the old europeans with their quiet charm the las vegas ones with their flash and gaudiness templeton had appealed to him because it was familyrun traditional without being stodgy efficient without sacrificing charm and above all personable he didnt have to make it his business to know the names of the people who worked with and under him it was simply a part of his makeup to take an interest to retain information so when he smiled at the woman currently checking in a guest called out a casual good morning linda he wasnt aware that her pulse picked up several beats or that her fingers fumbled on the keyboard as she watched him pass through on his way to the offices another section of the beehive was here ringing phones clicking faxes humming copiers the clack of keyboards he passed stacks of boxes crowded desks he exchanged a few greetings as he went causing several pairs of shoulders to straighten and more than a few female employees to wish theyd checked their lipstick the door to his destination was open and he found laura templeton with a phone to her ear she offered him a harried smile and gestured to a chair im sure we can arrange that mr hubble in catering yes yes i understand how important it is mr hubble she broke off rolled her eyes at byron how many extra chairs would you like ms bingham she listened patiently a small smile playing at the corners of her mouth no of course not and im sure youll have plenty of room if you make use of the terrace no i dont believe its calling for rain it should be a lovely evening and im sure your reception will be elegant mr hubble now she gritted her teeth why dont i talk to mr hubble for you and get back to you yes by noon i will absolutely youre welcome ms bingham she hung up ms bingham is insane is she the orthodontist convention or the interior decorating decorating she has decided at the last minute that she simply must give a reception tonight for sixty of her closest friends and associates for reasons i cant explain she doesnt trust bob hubble to pull it off templeton byron said and smiled at her the trouble is your name is templeton which puts you in a lofty position you wouldnt know it from her office he thought it was tiny cramped and windowless he knew shed chosen the position and the work space herself when she had decided to squeeze out time for a parttime job at the hotel byron didnt know how she managedher family and home the shop the hotel but she seemed to him to be the soul of serenity and quiet efficiency until you looked close enough at the eyes there shadowed in their lakegray depths were doubt and worry and grief remnants he thought of a shattered marriage you didnt have to come down here byron she finished scribbling notes to herself as she spoke i would have made it up to your office this morning its all right problem with the tooth soldiers youd think orthodontists would have a little decorum wouldnt you with a sigh she pulled papers out of a file weve had complaints from both bars but thats nothing i cant handle ive yet to come across anything you cant handle i appreciate that but theres a delicate situation one of the doctors apparently was having a lets say intimate moment with one of the other doctors when her husband decided to pay an unannounced surprise visit god i love this job byron settled back its like a longrunning soap opera easy for you to say i spent an hour this morning dealing with the penitent woman she sat where you are spilling out tears and the whole sordid story of her marriage her affairs her therapy weary with the memory laura pressed her fingers to the inside corner of her eye almost relieving the tension that was living there this is her third husband and she claims to be addicted to adultery she should go on oprah women who are addicted to adultery and the men who love them do you want me to talk to her no i think i sent her off steady enough our problem is the husband wasnt too thrilled to find his wife and hisshe wincedhis brotherinlaw wrapped in matching templeton robes it just gets better dont stop now the husband popped his brotherinlawwho i should add for clarification is married to our heroines sisterin the mouth knocked out several thousand dollars worth of caps and so forth there was some damage to the room nothing major a couple of lamps and crockery she waved that away but our problem is that the guy with the broken mouth is threatening to sue the hotel another victim if he hadnt been so amused with the scenario he would have sighed whats his rationale that the hotel is responsible for letting the husband in hethe husbandcalled room service from a house phone ordered champagne and strawberries for his wifes room he had a dozen roses with him she added then he waited until the wine arrived slipped into the room behind the waiter andwell the rest is history i dont think weve got any real problem here but ill take the file i appreciate it relieved laura passed the torch id talk to the man myself but i get the impression hes not too keen on women in authority and to be honest im swamped the orthodontists have their banquet tonight and the cosmetic people are coming in tomorrow and of course ms bingham right she checked her watch and rose id better get down to catering there was one other little thing standing up himself he raised an eyebrow the decorators are wrestling in the atrium not yet because she appreciated him she smiled it was second nature to laura to hide nerves it was an idea i had for the shop but since it involves the hotel i wanted to run it by you laura its your hotel no at the moment i work here and youre the boss she picked up her clipboard and passed it from one of her hands to the other last fall we put on a reception and charity auction at the shop we intend to do it every year but i was thinking we could plan another event straight advertising really a fashion show using clothes and accessories from the shop during the holiday season the white ballroom would be ideal and its not booked for the first saturday in december i thought we could feature gala attire formals ballgowns in addition to accessories all from the shop wed advertise it in both the hotel and the resort with percentageoff certificates issued to templeton employees and guests youve got marketing in the blood listen laura you work conventions and special events he put an arm around her shoulders as they left the office you dont need my goahead i like to dot my is so to speak after ive talked it over with margo and kate ill work up a proposal fine shed given him the opening hed been hoping for so how is kate shes holding up of course she occasionally drives margo and me crazy a born salesman kate isnt laura said with feeling but shes competitive enough to make it work her smile softened spread and if margo or i so much as breathes on the books she hisses so thats a blessing still still they damaged something inside her i dont know how seriously yet but shes too together too controlled she wont talk about it wont even discuss what should be done just closes up when any of us try to draw her out kate used to be a champion tantrum thrower now her fingers fidgeted restlessly tapping a pencil plucking at papers on her clipboard shes taking this without a fight when margos career blew up and she lost her spot as the spokeswoman for bella donna kate wanted to organize a protest she actually talked about going down to la and picketing on rodeo drive remembering put a smile back on lauras face i never told margo because i managed to talk kate out of it but thats the way she is she spits and claws and slaps when shes up against a personal problem but not this time this time shes pulled in and i dont understand it youre really worried about her byron realized yes i am sos margo or she would have strangled kate half a dozen times by now she wants us to fill out a sheet in something called a columnar pad every day once an accountant he said she carries one of those electronic memo pads in her pocket all the time shes starting to talk about colinking and getting online its terrifying when he laughed laura caught herself and shook her head ask a simple question she began does everybody dump on you this way you didnt dump i asked josh said you were the only man he wanted in this job its easy to see why youre so different from peter this time she didnt just catch herself she clenched her teeth no im not getting started on that im already behind schedule and ms binghams waiting thanks for taking the orthodontists off my hands my pleasure you might not hear it very often but youre an asset to templeton im trying to be as she walked away byron turned in the opposite direction studying her careful and precise report as he went at the end of the day he met with josh at templeton resort the office there was a sprawling room on the executive level with windows offering a view of one of the resorts two lagoonlike pools surrounded by hibiscus in riotous bloom and a patio with redwood tables under candypink umbrellas inside it was built for comfort as well as business with deeply cushioned leather chairs deco lamps and a stylish watercolor street scene of milan want a beer at the offer byron merely sighed low and deep he accepted the bottle from josh tipped it back sorry to hit you at the end of the day its the first i could get away there is no end of the day in the hotel business josh said your mother said that byron grinned susan templeton was one of his favorite people you know if your father would just step aside like a gentleman id beg her to marry me he drank again then nodded at the file hed put on joshs desk i started to fax this business over then thought id just swing by personally instead of going behind the desk josh picked up the file and stretched out in the chair opposite byron he skimmed the reports with varying reactions a chuckle a groan a sigh an oath that sums up my feelings byron concurred i had a talk with dr holdermen myself a few hours ago hes still a guest hes got temporary caps on and a real beaut of a black eye my take is he doesnt have a case but hes pissed off enough and embarrassed enough to pursue it josh nodded came to his own conclusions and your recommendation let him agreed josh tossed the file onto his desk ill pass it along to legal with that recommendation now josh settled back the beer bottle cupped loosely in his hand his eyes curious why dont you tell me why youre really here you can handle this kind of nuisance in your sleep byron rubbed his chin we know each other too well ten years on and off should be enough whats on your mind by kate powell joshs brows shot up really not in that context byron said a bit too quickly it was something laura said today that got me thinking about the whole situation bittle made some serious allegations against her yet they havent pursued it and neither has she its going on three weeks now im going to get pissed off again feeling his temper bubbling josh rose and paced it off my father used to play golf with larry bittle i dont know how many times hes been over to the house hes known kate since she was a kid have you talked to him kate almost took my head off when i threatened to scowling josh gulped down his beer that was okay but then she just shut down she seemed so shaky over the whole thing i didnt push hell ive been so wrapped up in margo and the baby i let it slide we did this heartbeat thing at the doctors today it was so cool you could just hear it beating away this quick little bopping he stopped when he caught byrons grin kate he began again thats okay you can indulge in obsessive expectant fatherhood for a minute theres more its not an excuse for letting my sister dangle he sat again with a muscle in his cheek twitching weve decided to settle with ridgeway goddamn bastard cheats on laura scalps her ignores his children alienates half the staff at the hotel and we end up cutting him a check for a quarter million just to avoid a premature termination suit its rough byron agreed but hell be gone he better stay gone you could always break his nose again byron suggested there is that willing himself to relax josh rolled his shoulders you could say ive been a little distracted the last few weeks and kate shes always been so selfreliant you begin to take it for granted lauras worried about her laura worries about everyone but laura josh brooded for a minute i havent been able to get through to kate she wont talk about it at least not to me i hadnt considered going over her head to bittle is that what youre getting at its none of my business the thing is byron studied his beer for a moment then lifted those calm clear eyes to josh hed thought it through as he did any problem and had come to one conclusion if bittle does decide to pursue a case against her wouldnt she be better off to take the offensive now the threat of a nice fat libel suit an unjustified suspension loss of income emotional distress byron smiled and finished off his beer well youre the lawyer it took him the best part of a week but josh was hotly pleased when he strolled into pretenses hed just come from a meeting with the partners of bittle and associates he caught his wife around the waist and kissed her thrillingly to the delight of the customers milling about the shop hi hi yourself and what are you doing in my parlor in the middle of the day i didnt come for you he kissed her again and barely restrained himself from laying a hand on her stubbornly flat stomach he couldnt wait for it to grow i need to talk to kate captain queeg is in the office rolling marbles and talking about strawberries josh winced i thought you were calling her captain bligh these days he wasnt insane enough shes redoing the filing system colorcoded good god whats next margo narrowed her eyes she put up a bulletin board she must be stopped ill go in he drew a deep breath if im not out in twenty minutes remember ive always loved you very funny she muttered and managed to hold the smile back until hed slipped into the rear office josh found kate mumbling over files her hair stood up in spikes and the first two fingers of her right hand were covered with rubber tips less than a year she said without turning around and you and laura have managed to misfile half of everything why the hell is a fire insurance invoice in the umbrella file someone should be flogged unamused she turned eyed him i dont have time for you josh your wifes making my life a living hell funny she says the same thing about you despite her ferocious glare he walked over and kissed the tip of her nose i hear youre colorcoding the files somebody has to the software i installed keeps clean records but youre better off backing up with hard copy in retail i told margo to do this months ago but shes more interested in selling trinkets god knows how you can expect to keep a retail business running by selling things she drew in a breath refusing to hear how foolish she sounded my point is you can hardly keep any business successful if you dont concern yourself with the details shes been logging shoes under wardrobe instead of accessories she needs to be punished he grabbed kates shoulders let me do it chuckling she shoved him back go away i dont have time to laugh right now i didnt come by for laughs i need to talk to you he pointed to a chair so sit cant this wait i have to be back in the showroom in an hour i want to get the files in shape first sit he repeated and gave her a brotherly nudge i just had a meeting at bittle the impatience drained out of her eyes leaving them cold and blank excuse me dont take that tone with me kate its past time this was dealt with she continued to take that tone quiet and icy as fear clawed at her insides and you decided you were the one to deal with it thats right as your attorney youre not my attorney she shot back who went to court to get you out of that speeding ticket three years ago you but and who looked over your lease for your apartment before you signed it yes but who wrote your will her face turned mutinous i dont see that that has anything to do with it i see idly he studied his manicure just because ive handled all the pesky little legal details of your life doesnt make me your lawyer it doesnt give you the right to go behind my back and talk to bittle particularly since i asked you to leave it alone fine it doesnt being your brother does bringing up family loyalty was in kates opinion hitting below the belt she sprang to her feet im not the inadequate incapable little sister and i wont be treated like one im handling this how primed to fight he got to his feet as well by colorcoding the files in here yes since he was shouting now kate matched her voice to his by making the best of the situation by getting on with my life by not whining and crying by backing down and doing nothing he poked his finger against her shoulder by going into denial well its gone on long enough bittle and company know that theyre facing legal action legal action the blood drained out of her face she could feel every drop flow you told them i was going to sue oh my god dizzy she leaned on the desk hey he grabbed her in alarm sit down catch your breath leave me alone leave me the hell alone what have you done what needed to be done now come on honey sit down jesus christ she exploded and rather than a poke on his shoulder she landed a punch on it how dare you her color was back flaming how dare you threaten legal action i didnt tell them you were going to sue i merely left them chewing over that impression i told you to leave it this is my business mine she threw up her arms spun around what gave you this brainstorm joshua im going to kill margo margo didnt have anything to do with it though if you would open your beady eyes for five minutes youd see how worried she is about you how worried everyone is because he might poke her again he decided his hands were safer in his pockets i shouldnt have let it go this long but ive had things on my mind if by hadnt dropped by and given me a push it would have taken me longer but id have gotten to it stop breathing hard she held up a hand playback byron de witt talked to you about me realizing his misstep josh tried a quick retreat your name came up in conversation thats all and it started me my name came up now she was breathing between clenched teethteeth that matched the fists ready at her sides anger was better she realized than panic oh i just bet it did that son of a bitch i should have known he couldnt keep his mouth shut about what dont try to cover up and get out of my way her shove was fierce enough and unexpected enough to knock him back before he could make the grab she was sailing past him just a damn minute i havent finished you go to hell she shot back over her shoulder causing several customers to glance around nervously as she stormed out of the office she sent margo one seething glare before slamming the front door behind her well struggling with a smile margo handed a bagged purchase to a wideeyed customer thats thirtyeight fiftythree out of forty still smiling she handed over the change and the show was free please come again with the wariness of a man who understood trouble when it stared at him from sultry blue eyes josh approached the counter sorry about that well deal with sorry later she said under her breath what did you do to upset her just like a woman he thought to take the womans side i tried to help her you know how she hates that why instead of taking your head off did she storm out of here looking like she was going to take someone elses head off he sighed scratched his chin shuffled his feet shed finished taking my head off now shes going for byrons he sort of suggested that i help her margo tapped coraltipped nails on the glass counter i see i really ought to call him give him some advance warning but when josh reached for the phone on the counter margo laid a firm hand over his oh no i dont think so we wouldnt want to spoil kates advantage margo its only fair fair has nothing to do with it and youre going to be too busy waiting on customers to make personal calls now he stuck his hands in his pockets duchess ive got a meeting in a couple of hours i dont have time to help you out around here thanks to you im shorthanded knowing that that wouldnt get her very far she let her shoulders slump and im feeling a little tired tired panic came on wings you should get off your feet youre probably right though she felt strong as a horse she scooted a stool over to the cash register and perched on it ill just sit here and ring up sales for the next hour oh josh darling be sure to offer the customers champagne enjoying herself she slipped off her shoes and prepared to watch her adorable husband handle a storeful of customers the only show she would have preferred to witness was the one that would be starting shortly in the penthouse office of templeton monterey the first analogy that came to byrons mind was that of a wild possibly rabid deer charging kate cut through his shocked protesting assistant like a sharp knife through quivery jelly snarled like a feral shewolf and might very well have delivered the knockout punch of a flyweight champ if byron hadnt signaled his assistant to retreat well katherine he barely missed a beat when she slammed the door with a resounding crack what an unexpected pleasure im going to kill you im going to rip off your meddling nose and stuff it in your flapping mouth as much fun as im sure thatll be would you like a drink first some water youre a bit flushed who the hell do you think you are she sprang toward the desk smashed her palms down on its polished and just now crowded surface what possible right do you have to mix in my business do i strike you as some weakwilled emptyheaded woman who needs a man to defend her which one of those questions would you like me to answer first why dont i take them in order he said before she could shout again you know exactly who i am i didnt mix in your business any more than any tentative and concerned friend would and no no indeed i dont see you as weakwilled or emptyheaded i see you as stubborn rude and potentially dangerous you havent got a clue how dangerous pal that threat might have more weight if youd take off those filing tips they spoil the image a strangled sound erupted from her throat as she looked down and discovered the brown rubber tips still on her fingers smooth and quick she ripped them off and threw them at him just as smooth just as quick he caught them both before they hit his face good arm he commented i bet you played ball in school i thought i could trust you for reasons she didnt want to analyze thinking of that made her eyes sting i even for one brief foolish moment thought i could learn to like you now i see that my first impression of you as an arrogant selfimportant sexist jerk was totally on the mark her sense of betrayal was every bit as keen as her fury i was reeling when you found me on the cliffs i was vulnerable everything i said there i said to you in confidence you had no right to run to josh with it he set the rubber tips on his desk i didnt say anything to josh about that day on the cliffs i dont believe you you went to him i dont lie he said sharply she glimpsed the steel beneath the polish yes i went to him sometimes it takes someone outside the family to put things on the table and your family is torn up about what happened to you kate more worried about the way youre behaving my behavior isnt any of my business he finished for her odd that something as harmless as my speaking with josh sends you into a tailspin of revenge and retribution but being questioned about embezzlement makes you curl up in the fetal position and suck your thumb you dont know what im doing what im feeling and you have no right to pass judgment no thats all quite true if you werent so selfinvolved youd see that no ones passing judgment but as an outsider i can tell you that your family is hurting for you her flush died until her cheeks were bonewhite dont lecture me about my family dont you dare theyre the most important people in the world to me im handling this my way because of my family he cocked his head which means which means that too is none of your business she pressed her fingers to her eyes fighting for control nothing and no one is more on my mind than my family he believed that without hesitation and only felt more sorry for her your way of handling this situation isnt working how the hell do you know because people talk to me his voice was gentle now and the edge of temper had smoothed out of it margo laura josh because i know how worried and angry id be if it was my sister well it isnt your sister the anger snapped back into her voice but her cheeks stayed white im capable of dealing with this josh has enough on his plate without being guilted into taking this on do you really think guilt has anything to do with it she fumbled recovered dont twist my words around de witt those were your words powell now if youve finished with your tantrum we can discuss this tantrum id heard you were good at them but now that ive had a firsthand demonstration i see the reports were understated hed never thought that dark glossy brown could turn to fire until he watched it happen in her eyes ill show you a tantrum with one swipe she sent most of the papers on his desk flying then raised her fist come out from behind that desk oh you tempt me his voice was ominously quiet his eyes dangerously cool ive never hit a woman in my life and never have i found it necessary to make that statement before but you tempt me katherine to break all kinds of records now either sit down or get out im not sitting down and im not getting out until we she broke off strangling a cry as she pressed a hand under her breasts now he did come around the desk cursing all the way damn it damn it what are you doing to yourself dont touch me the burning pressure made her eyes water but she struggled when he led her to a chair youre going to sit down youre going to try to relax and if you dont have your color back in thirty seconds im hauling your skinny butt to the hospital just leave me alone she fumbled out her antacids knowing it was like trying to put out a forest fire with a water pistol ill be fine in a minute how often does this happen none of your business she yelped in pain and shock when he pressed two fingers to her abdomen do you have your appendix keep your hands off me dr feelgood he only continued to frown and moved his fingertips to the inside of her wrist been skipping meals again before she could evade he caught her face in his hands and took a long objective look her color was seeping back slowly and her eyes were filled with temper again rather than pain but he saw other things youre not sleeping youre tired overstressed and undernourished is that how youre handling this her stomach quivered an echo of pain and nerves i want you to leave me alone you dont always get what you want youre exhausted kate and until you start taking better care of yourself someone else will have to do it for you be still he ordered in an absent murmur holding a hand on her shoulder as he checked his watch im tied up here until after six ill pick you up at seven will you be at the shop or at home what the hell are you talking about im not going anywhere with you i realize im annoyed with myself for handling this matter badly you do seem to bring out the worst in me he added mostly to himself so youre going to get a decent meal and the opportunity to discuss these gripes of yours in a civilized manner it was frightening her the casual manner he assumed the glint of heat in his eye that warned he could shift out of casual mode at any moment i dont want to have dinner with you and im not feeling civilized considering he rocked back on his heels so that their eyes were level lets try it this way you go along with this or i pick up the phone and call laura it should take her about two minutes to get up here and when she does ill tell her that twice now ive seen you go white and double over you have no right no kate what i have here is the hammer that beats the hell out of rights he checked his watch again i have a conference call coming through in about five minutes or wed finish more of this now since the reasonable thing for you to do is go home and get some rest i assume youll go back to the shop ill pick you up at seven trapped she nudged him aside and got to her feet we close at six then youll have to wait wont you and dont slam the door on your way out of course she did and he found he had to smile but the smile faded when he picked up the phone and hurriedly punched in a number dr margaret de witt please its her son another look at his watch brought out a mild oath no i cant wait would you ask her to call me when shes free the office before six at home after seven thanks he hung up then began to put in order the papers kate had scattered almost amused he pocketed the filing tips shed left behind he doubted that kate would appreciate him calling his mother the internist for an overthephone diagnosis of her symptoms but somebody had to look out for her whether she wanted it or not chapter seven she was going to be calm kate promised herself that shed made a fool of herself barging into byrons office shouting and raging she wouldnt have minded that so muchif it had worked there was nothing worse than having a good temper fit snuffed out by reason patience and control it was more than humiliating she didnt much care for taking orders either frowning she looked around the shop shed just closed she could simply walk out she considered drumming her fingers on the counter she could just stroll right out go anywhere she wanted home for a drive to templeton house for dinner that might be the best option she thought rubbing a hand absently over the grinding ache in her stomach she was hungry that was all a good meal at templeton house an evening with laura and the girls would soothe all the pangs and nerves it would serve byron right if she wasnt there when he came gunning for her for that she was sure was his intention soothe the victim with reason with promises of calm discussions then pow shoot her between the eyes and that she knew was the reason she was staying put kate powell never walked away from a challenge let him come she told herself grimly as she began to wander about the shop she could handle byron de witt in her sleep men like him were so used to getting their own way with a quick smile a murmured word they didnt know how to act with a woman who stood firmly on her own feet besides now that her finances were a little strained she acknowledged the advantage of a free meal the grinding came back like a sneering echo nerves she thought again of course she was nervous she knew better than anyone that pretenses could barely support three incomes and stay afloat they were lucky to have made it through the first year but the odds were still against them she frowned down at a stylish glass rhinoceros in pale gold how long she wondered were they going to be able to sell things quite that foolish the price tag made her laugh nine hundred dollars who in their right mind would plunk down nearly a thousand dollars for something so ridiculous margo she decided and her lips curved up again margo had a keen eye for the expensive the ridiculous and the salable if pretenses went down the toilet margo would be fine she had josh now a baby on the way a beautiful home a far cry from her circumstances a year ago kate mused and was glad for her but there was laura to worry about and the girls they wouldnt starve kate knew the templetons wouldnt allow it they would live in templeton house which would give them far more than a roof over their heads it would give them a home since laura was too proud to touch the income from her templeton stocks she could work at the hotel and earn a living a good one but how badly would her ego be bruised if the business she started herself failed kate had discovered a great deal about the difficulties of functioning with a scraped ego they had to make the shop work it was margos dream and it had become lauras it was all kate had to hold on to all her neat little plans were ruined there would be no partnership at bittle no possibility of striking out with her own firm at some future date no pretty brass plaque on her office door no office she thought and sat down on a painted wooden bench right now she had sleepless nights headaches that never quite faded a stomach that refused to behave and pretenses pretenses she thought with a thin smile margo had named it well the three owners were just full of them the knock on the door made her jolt then swear then straighten her shoulders as she rose and went to unlock it she nudged byron aside stepped out onto the little flowerdecked veranda and locked up again pedestrian and street traffic churned past with all the noise and bustle that usually accompanied it tourists she thought absently searching for just the right spot to enjoy a vacation dinner members of the workforce heading home after a long day couples out on dates just where did kate powell fit in im not going because you told me i was going she said without preliminary im going because i want the opportunity to speak calmly and clearly about the situation and because im hungry fine he cupped a hand under her elbow well take my car i managed to find a space in the lot across the street its a busy area its a good location she began as he led her to the curb a stones throw from fishermans wharf and the water tourists are a big part of our business but a lot of the locals come here to shop too two young boys on a rented tandem bike whizzed by behind her laughing like hyenas it was a beautiful evening full of soft light and soft scents a night for beach walking she mused or for tossing hunks of bread to the gulls as the couple by the water was doing just now a night she thought for couples kate nibbled her lip as byron guided her across the street i can follow you there are a dozen restaurants within walking distance for that matter well take my car he repeated gently and firmly maneuvering through the crowded parking lot and ill bring you back to yours when were finished it would save time and be more efficient if kate he turned and looked at her really looked and scotched the annoyed remark hovering on his tongue the woman was exhausted why dont you try something new go with the flow he opened the passenger door of his vintage mustang and waited with some amusement for her badtempered shrug he wasnt disappointed she watched him round the hood hed ditched his tie and jacket she noted opened his collar the casual easy look suited those linemans shoulders she supposed the beachcomber hair she decided to realign her strategy and wait until they were at dinner before beginning the lecture shed been planning she could when necessary manage small talk with the best of them so youre into classic cars he settled behind the wheel the minute he turned the key the radio exploded with marvin gaye byron turned it down to a murmur before cruising through the lot sixtyfive mustang with a v a car like this isnt just a mode of transportation its a commitment really she liked the creamy white bucket seats the trainedpanther ride but couldnt think of anything more impractical than owning a car older than she was dont you have to spend a lot of time babying it finding parts thats the commitment runs like a dream he added with an affectionate stroke to the dash as he merged into traffic she was my first first what first car thats right he grinned at her baffled stare bought her when i was seventeen shes got over two hundred thousand miles on her and still purrs like a kitten kate would have said it was more roars like a lion but that wasnt her problem nobody keeps their first car its like your first lover exactly he downshifted eased around a turn as it happens i had my first lover in the backseat one sweet summer night pretty lisa montgomery he sighed reminiscently she opened a window to paradise for me god bless her a window to paradise unable to resist kate craned her neck and studied the pristine backseat it wasnt very difficult to imagine two young bodies groping all that in the back of an old mustang classic mustang he corrected just like lisa montgomery but you didnt keep her you cant keep everything except memories remember your first time in my college dorm room i was a slow starter marvin gaye had given way to wilson pickett kates foot began to keep time he was captain of the debate team and seduced me with his argument that sex next to birth and death was the ultimate human experience good one ill have to try it sometime she slanted a look at his profile hero perfect she judged with just a hint of rugged i dont imagine you need lines it never hurts to keep a few in reserve so what happened to the captain of the debate team he was used to getting his point across inside of three minutes that ability bled over into the ultimate human experience oh byron fought back a grin too bad not really it taught me not to build up unrealistic expectations and not to depend on someone else to fulfill basic needs kate scanned the scenery her foot stopped tapping as she tensed up again why are we on seventeen mile its a pretty drive i enjoy taking it every day did i mention that i was able to arrange renting the house im buying until we settle no you didnt but she was getting the drift you said we were going to have dinner and a civilized discussion and we are you can take a look at the favor you did for me at the same time even as she formulated several arguments against byron turned into a driveway and pulled up behind a dramatically glossy black corvette its a first year the stingray rolled out of detroit he said with a nod toward the car three hundred sixty horsepower fuelinjected an absolute beauty not that the original vette wasnt a honey before the redesign they dont make bodies like that anymore why do you need two cars need isnt the issue anyway i have four cars the other two are back in atlanta four she murmured and found this little quirk of his amusing fiftyseven chevy cubicinch v baby blue white sidewalls all original equipment there was affection in his voice kate thought the southern heat of it flowed over the words like a man describing a lover every bit as classy as the songs they wrote about her billie jo spears kate knew her music trivia fiftyseven chevrolet thats the best surprised and impressed he grinned at her keeping her company is a gto three deuces and a four speed right his grin widened and a she grinned back just what the hell are three deuces automotively speaking if you dont know already it would take a little time to explain just let me know if you ever want a serious lesson then he put a hand over kates and shifted his gaze to the house she was relaxed enough not to pull away its great isnt it its nice all wood and glass she mused bilevel decks flowers already blooming riotously that wonderful cypress bent and magical ive seen it before from the outside knowing shed never wait for him to come around to her door he leaned across her to open it and inhaled the simple scent of soap enjoying it he let his gaze wander lazily from her mouth to her eyes youll be another first excuse me god was he losing his mind or was he actually starting to look forward to that edgy tone my first guest he got out of the car retrieved his briefcase and jacket as they started up the walk he took her hand in a friendly gesture you can hear the sea he pointed out its just close enough ive caught a couple of glimpses of seals too it was charmingalmost too charming she thought the setting the sounds the scent of roses and nightblooming jasmine what was left of the setting sun spread vivid heartbreaking color across the western sky the twisted shadows from the trees were long and deep a lot of tourists drive along here she said fighting the spell isnt that going to bother you no the house is set back from the road and the bedrooms face the water he turned the key in the lock theres just one problem she was glad to hear it perfection made her nervous what i dont have much in the way of furniture he opened the door and proved his point it shouldnt have delighted her bare floors bare walls bare space yet she found it delightful the way the entranceway flowed into a room the simplest of welcomes the wide glass doors on the facing wall exploded with that stunning sunset almost demanded to be opened wide to it the yellow pine floors gleamed under her feet as she stepped inside crossed over them there was no rug as yet to tame that ocean flood of shine he would get one she imagined it was practical sensible but she thought it would also be a shame from her outside survey of the house she hadnt guessed that the ceilings were so high or that the stairs leading to the next level were open as open as the carved pickets in the ornate railing that skirted the second story she could see how cleverly how simply one room became another so that the house appeared to be one large living space white walls golden floors and the beautiful bleeding light from the west great view she managed and wondered why her palms were damp casually she wandered to a crate on which stood an elaborate stereo system the only piece of furniture was a ratty recliner with duct tape holding the arms together youve got the essentials i see no point in living without music i picked up the chair at a yard sale its so awful its wonderful want a drink just some club soda or water alcohol was off the list for a couple of reasons and he was one of them ive got some templeton mineral water she smiled then youve got the best ill take you on a tour after ive gotten dinner started come in the kitchen and keep me company you know how to cook it was the shock of it that made her follow him actually i do you like grits and chitlins right he waited a beat turned and wasnt disappointed with the look of sheer horror on her face just kidding how about seafood not those crawfish things i make a hell of a crawfish etouffee but well save that for when were better acquainted if the rest of the house hadnt already sold me this would have done it the kitchen was done in dramatic maroon and white tiles with a center island that gleamed like an iceberg a builtin banquette curved in front of a wide window that looked out on blooming flowers and the deepgreen lawn subzero byron commented running a loving hand over the stainlesssteel front of a wide refrigerator convection oven jennair range teak cabinets there was a big blue bowl of fresh glossy fruit on the counter the grinding in kates stomach told her if she didnt eat soon shed die you like to cook it relaxes me okay why dont you relax ill watch she had to admit it was an impressive show she sipped chilled water while he sliced an array of colorful vegetables his movements were brisk and as far as she could tell professional intrigued she moved closer watched his hands very nice hands now that she took a good look long fingers wide palms with a neat manicure that didnt take away from the basic masculinity did you like take a course or something or something we had this cook maurice byron turned a red bell pepper into long neat strips he told me hed teach me how to box i was tall and skinny regularly got the shit beat out of me at school kate stepped back did a slow survey broad shoulders trim waist narrow hips long limbs certainly and with his sleeves rolled up for cooking she could see forearms that looked just a bit dangerous what happened steroids he chuckled and went briskly to work on an onion i grew into my arms and legs after a while started working out but i was about twelve and pathetically awkward yeah kate sipped remembering her own adolescence the trouble was shed never grown into anything still the runt of the litter she mused its a rough age so maurice said hed teach me to defend myself but i had to learn to cook it was according to him just one more way to become selfsufficient byron drizzled oil into a large castiron pan already heating on the stove in about six months i whipped curt bodines bad asshe was the bane of my existence at the time i had candy dorall now litchfield kate put in conversationally she was always my bane the terminally pert candace litchfield redhead smug foxy face annoying little giggle anyone who described candy so accurately deserved a smile i think i might like you after all did you ever punch candy in her sassy nose its not her nose she had rhinoplasty kate snacked on a strip of pepper and no but we did stuff her naked into a locker twice not bad but thats girl stuff me i just beat the hell out of curt salvaged masculine pride while earning the appropriate macho rep and i could produce a chocolate souffle to die for when she laughed he paused and turned to face her do that again when she didnt respond he shook his head you really ought to laugh more katherine its a fascinating sound surprisingly full and rich like something youd expect to hear floating out of the window of a new orleans brothel im sure thats a compliment she lifted her water glass again made herself keep her eyes level with his but i rarely laugh on an empty stomach well fix that he tossed minced garlic into the hot oil the scent was immediate and wonderful the onion went in next and she began to salivate he pried the lid off a covered bowl slid shelled shrimp and scallops into the pan she thought it was a bit like watching a mad scientist at work a glug of white wine a pinch of salt a slight grating of what he told her was ginger quick stirs and shakes to mix all those pretty strips of vegetables in less time than it might have taken her to peruse a menu she was sitting down to a full plate its good she said after her first bite its really good why arent you in food services cookings a hobby like conversation and old cars vintage cars it pleased him to see her eat hed decided on the menu because hed wanted to get something healthy into her he imagined her snatching junk food when she remembered to eat at all snacking on antacids no wonder she was too thin i could teach you teach me what to cook she speared a shrimp i didnt say i couldnt cook can you no but i didnt say i couldnt and i dont need to as long as theres takeout and microwave ovens because shed refused his offer of wine he stuck with water himself i bet theres a place reserved for you at mcdonalds drivethrough window so its quick its easy and its filling nothing wrong with the occasional french fry but when its a dietary staple dont start with me byron this is why im here in the first place remembering her plan she got down to business i dont like people particularly people i barely know interfering in my life we have to get to know each other better no we dont it was weird she realized how easily shed become distracted and interested and at ease time had slipped by when all shed meant to do was give him the sharpest edge of one piece of her mind your intentions might have been good but you had no business going to josh your eyes are fabulous he said and watched them narrow with suspicion i dont know if its because theyre so big so dark or because your face is narrow but they really pack a punch is that one of your reserved lines no its an observation i happen to be looking at your face and it occurs to me that it has all these contrasts the snooty new england cheekbones the wide sexy mouth angular nose the big doe eyes it shouldnt work but it does it works better when youre not pale and tired but that adds a rather disconcerting fragile quality she shifted im not fragile im not tired and my face has nothing to do with the subject under discussion but i like it i liked it right away even when i didnt like you now i wonder kate he continued laying a hand over hers twining fingers why did you put so much effort into making sure i didnt look twice in your direction i didnt have to put any effort into that im not your type any more than youre mine no youre not he agreed still i occasionally enjoy sampling something different im not a new recipe she pulled her hand free pushed her plate aside and i came here to have as you termed it a civilized discussion this seems civilized to me dont pull out that reasonable tone she had to squeeze her eyes shut and count to ten she made it to five i hate that reasonable tone i agreed to go to dinner with you so that i could make myself clear so that i could do so without losing my temper the way i did earlier today for emphasis she leaned forward a little was distracted by discovering that there was a thin gold halo around his pupils i dont want you meddling in my life i dont know how to make it any more plain than that thats plain since they seemed to have finished the meal he picked up the plates and carried them to the counter sitting again he took a cigar from his pocket lit it but theres a problem ive developed an interest in you yeah right you find that difficult to believe he puffed out smoke considered so did i initially then i realized what kicked it off im driven to solve problems and puzzles answers and solutions are essential to me do you want coffee no i dont want coffee didnt he know it drove her crazy the way he could slide from one topic to the next in that slow southern drawl of his of course he did and im not a problem or a puzzle but you are look at you kate you whiteknuckle your way through life he reached out deliberately uncurled her fist i can almost see whatever fuel you bother to put inside you being sucked away by nerves you have a loving family a solid base an excellent mind but you pick at details as if they were knotted threads you never consider just snipping one off yet when youre faced with the injustice the insult of being fired from a job that was a huge part of your life you sit back and do nothing it grated and hurt and shamed and because she couldnt explain to him or to those who cared for her it festered im doing what works for me and i didnt come here for an analysis i havent finished he said mildly youre afraid to be vulnerable even ashamed of it youre a practical woman yet youre aware youre physically rundown and youre doing nothing about that either youre an honest woman but youre putting all of your energy into denying there might be even a mild hint of attraction between us so you interest me he took a last drag on his cigar tamped it out the puzzle of you interests me she got to her feet slowly to prove to both of them she was still in control i realize it might be difficultno next to impossiblefor you to realize that im not interested in you im not vulnerable im not ill and im not even mildly attracted well he unfolded himself and rose we can put at least one of those statements to the test his eyes stayed watchful on hers as he cupped a hand behind her neck unless youre afraid youre wrong im not wrong and i dont want he decided it was simpler not to let her finish the woman could argue with the dead he covered her mouth with his quietly with barely a whisper of pressure and promise when her hands jerked up to his chest he scooped an arm around her waist and brought her gently closer for his own pleasure he skimmed his tongue over her lips then dipped inside when they parted he thought foolishly that he could hear a new window to a new paradise begin to creak open then she trembled and he forgot to be amused at both of them when he eased back he saw that she was still pale her eyes dark and clouded testing he pressed light kisses on either side of her mouth and watched her lashes flutter i donti cantgod the hand pressed against his chest balled into a fist i dont have the time or the inclination for this why because her head was spinning her pulse was pounding and her juices were running in a way they hadnt inever youre not my type that clever mouth curved youre not mine either go figure men who look like you are always scum she knew better absolutely knew better but she couldnt stop her hands from streaking up his chest and grabbing all that wonderful goldtipped hair its like the law his lips curved whose law she could have had a snappy comeback for that if shed just been able to concentrate oh the hell with it she muttered and dragged his mouth back to hers nerves and needs seemed to pulse from her in fast greedy waves he couldnt stand against them could barely stand at all once her mouth started its assault he should have known she wouldnt believe in the slow and the gradual or the easy sweetness of a lazy seduction but he hadnt considered that the firedrenched demands of that mobile mouth would undermine his innate sense of reason in the space of a heartbeat he went from enjoying her to devouring her his arms banded around her forgot about her long fragile bones and soft spare flesh he used his teeth because that mouth that wide sultry mouth seemed to have been made for him to ravish the scent of soap was absurdly sexy he could almost taste it as he ran hot wild kisses down her throat its only because i havent had sex in so long she gasped out the rationale even as her eyes crossed okay whatever he curled his hands around her tiny tight butt and muffled a moan against her throat a year she managed okay its been nearly two but after the first few months you hardly jesus touch me im going to scream if you dont touch me where he nearly panicked he was unable to tell one part of her from another he was steeped in all of her instinct had him tugging her crisp white shirt out of the waistband of her skirt fumbling with buttons upstairs he swore ripely as the buttons refused to yield he didnt have enough sanity left to be appalled at how his fingers shook we should go upstairs ive got a bed desperate she grabbed his hand and pressed it to her breast herself youve got a floor right here he managed a laugh im beginning to love practical women you havent seen anything then it hit her the first wave of pain was followed so swiftly by a second she barely managed a choked gasp what what is it did i hurt you no its nothing he was trying to straighten her up as she doubled over its just a twinge its but the burning was spreading like wildfire and the fear burst through with it as she felt her skin break out in a cold clammy sweat just give me a minute blindly she reached out for something to balance her and would have fallen if he hadnt scooped her up the hell with this the words exploded between gritted teeth the hell with it im taking you to the hospital no stop it desperate for relief she hooked an arm under her breasts and pressed just take me home in a pigs eye like a warrior hoisting his conquest he carried her out of the house save your breath and yell at me later right now youre doing what youre told i said take me home she didnt bother to fight him when he strapped her into the car all of her energy had to focus on dealing with the pain he backed out of the drive saying nothing as she tore tums out of the roll habitually in her pocket instead he snatched up the car phone and punched in a number mom he drove fast whipping the car around curves and interrupted his mothers apology for not returning his call its okay listen ive got a friend a woman five sevenish maybe a hundred and five pounds midtwenties he swore lightly cradling the phone on his shoulder as he shifted gears its not that he said at the inevitable chuckle im taking her to the hospital right now shes got abdominal pain it seems to be habitual its just stress kate managed between shallow breaths and your lousy cooking yes thats her she can talk and shes lucid i dont know he glanced briefly at kate any abdominal surgery kate no dont talk to me yeah id say she lives with a lot of stress brings most of it on herself wed eaten about fortyfive fifty minutes before he said in response to his mothers brisk questions no no alcohol no caffeine but she lives on goddamn coffee and eats tums like chocolate drops yeah is there a burning sensation he demanded of kate its just indigestion she muttered the pain was backing off wasnt it please wasnt it yes he listened again nodded he was grimly aware of where his mothers questions were heading how often do you get that gnawing ache under the breastbone none of your business you dont want to piss me off right now kate you really dont how often a lot so what youre not taking me to any hospital and the grinding in the stomach because he was describing her symptoms with pinpoint accuracy she closed her eyes and ignored him he spoke to his mother another moment punched up the gas thanks thats what i figured im going to take care of it yeah ill let you know i will bye he hung up kept his eyes firmly on the road congratulations you idiot youve got yourself a nice little ulcer chapter eight no way did she have an ulcer kate comforted herself with that thought and the image of how foolish byron was going to look for rushing her to the hospital with a case of nervous heartburn ulcers were for repressed wimps who didnt know how to express their emotions who were afraid to face what was inside them kate figured she expressed her emotions just fine and at every opportunity she was simply dealing with more stress than usual who wouldnt have a jittery stomach after the two months shed just had but she was handling it she told herself shutting her eyes tight against the incessant burning pressure she was handling it her way the minute byron stopped the car she would explain yet again calmly that kate powell took care of kate powell she would have too if she could have caught her breath but he jerked to a halt in front of the emergency room slammed out of the car and plucked her out of her seat before she could so much as squeak then it was worse because she was inside with all the sounds and scents of a hospital emergency rooms were all the same everywhere the air inside was thick with despair and fear and fresh blood antiseptics alcohol sweat the slap of crepesoled shoes and the whisper of wheels on linoleum it paralyzed her it was all she could do to keep herself from curling into a ball in the hard plastic chair where hed dumped her stay he ordered curtly before marching over to the admitting nurse she didnt even hear him flashes of memory assaulted her she could hear the high desperate scream of sirens see the red lights pulsing and spinning she was eight years old again and the dull throb deep inside her ached like a wound and bloodshe could smell it not hers or very little of her blood shed barely had a scratch contusions they had called them minor lacerations a mild concussion nothing lifethreatening nothing lifealtering but they had wheeled her parents away even while shed screamed for her mother and they had never come back its your lucky night byron said when he came back to her not much going on theyre going to take a look at you now i cant be here she murmured i cant be in a hospital thats the breaks kid this is where the doctors are he lifted her to her feet surprised when she went along like an obedient puppy he passed her off to a nurse then settled down to wait kate told herself the more she cooperated the quicker they would let her go and they had to let her go she wasnt a child now who had no choice she stepped into the narrow examining area shuddering once at the sound of the curtain being drawn closed behind her lets see what weve got here the doctor on duty was young and pretty a round face narrow eyes behind wireframed glasses dark hair scooped back at the side with simple bobby pins it had been a man before kate remembered hed been young too but his eyes had been exhausted and old mechanically kate answered the standard questions no she didnt have any allergies shed had no surgery she was taking no medication why dont you lie back ms powell im dr hudd im going to check you out are you having pain now no not really the doctor lifted an eyebrow no or not really kate closed her eyes and struggled to steep herself in the here and now some tell me when it increases soft hands kate thought as they began to probe her doctors always seemed to have soft hands then she hissed as the doctor applied pressure under her breastbone thats the spot huh how often does this happen it happens do you find the discomfort occurs after a meal say an hour or so after a meal sometimes she sighed yes and when you drink alcohol yes is there any vomiting no kate swiped a hand over her clammy face no dizziness no well not really dr hudds unpainted mouth pursed as she pressed her fingers to kates wrist your pulse is a little fast i dont want to be here kate said flatly i hate hospitals yeah i know the feeling the doctor continued as she made notations on a chart describe the pain for me kate stared up at the ceiling pretended she was talking aloud to herself its a burning in the torso or an aching she wouldnt stay here she reminded herself calmly on this table behind these curtains more like sharp hunger pains in my stomach they can get pretty intense i bet how have you been dealing with it my heartburn kate said dully mylanta the doctor chuckled patted kates hand are you under a lot of stress ms powell my father was a thief ive lost my job and the cops could be knocking on my door any minute theres nothing i can do about it nothing that wont make it worse who isnt she tried not to jerk when the doctor lifted her eyelid and shined a light to check her pupils how long have you been having these symptoms somewhere around forever i dont know theyve gotten worse in the last couple of months sleeping well no taking anything for that no how about headaches no thanks i have plenty of them nuprin she said anticipating the question excedrin i switch off mmhmm when was your last physical when kate didnt answer me doctor eased back pursed her lips again that long ago huh whos your regular doctor i go see minelli once a year for a pap i dont get sick youre doing a good imitation of it now ill follow that up with my imitation of an exam lets check your blood pressure kate submitted to it she was calmer now certain that the ordeal was almost over she imagined the doctor would dash off a prescription and be done with it blood pressures a little high hearts strong youre underweight ms powell dieting no i never diet lucky you hudd said with a considering look in her eye it was a look kate recognized one that made her sigh i dont have an eating disorder doctor im not bulimic not anorexic no binging no purging no pills ive always been thin so you havent lost any weight lately a few pounds maybe kate admitted my appetites been kind of sporadic look ive had some problems at work and its stressed me out thats all believe me if i had a choice id rather have curves than angles well when we solve this problem you should put them back on after we run a few tests kates hand shot out curled around the doctors wrist tests what kind of tests nothing that involves torture chambers i promise we need some xrays a barium certainly and i recommend an upper gi these are to pinpoint and to eliminate i dont want any tests give me a pill and let me out of here ms powell its not quite that simple well get you in and out of xray as quickly as possible ill try to schedule the gi for first thing in the morning once we get you admitted panic was white kate realized white rooms and women in white uniforms youre not keeping me here just overnight the doctor soothed its not that i dont respect your boyfriends diagnosis hes not my boyfriend well id work on that if i were you but in any case hes not a doctor his mother is he talked to his mother on the way over ask him i want you to get him back here i want you to get him all right try to calm down ill go talk to him just lie down here and try to relax the doctor eased kates shoulders back once she was alone kate struggled to breathe deeply evenly but terror was circling still arguing byron began when he stepped into the room kate popped up like a spring i cant stay here she snatched at his shirt front with trembling hands you have to get me out now listen kate i cant stay here overnight i cant spend the night in a hospital i cant her voice lowered to a broken whisper my parents confusion came first did she expect him to call the templetons in france to back her up then he rememberedher own parents were dead had been killed in an accident hospital and he saw that what he had taken for pain and bad temper in her eyes was sheer terror okay baby to soothe her he pressed his lips to her brow dont worry youre not going to stay i cant she felt her breath hitch felt the simmering hysteria start its greasy rise you wont i promise he cupped her face until her swimming eyes met his i promise kate im going to talk to the doctor now then ill take you home hysteria receded replaced by trust all right okay she closed her eyes all right just give me a minute he stepped to the other side of the curtain with the doctor shes got a phobia i didnt realize it look mr de witt most people dont like spending time in hospitals there are times i dont like it myself im not talking about ordinary resistance frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair thats all i thought it was but its a lot more listen her parents were killed in some sort of accident when she was a kid i dont know the details but there must have been some hospital time shes panicked at staying here and she isnt the panicking type she needs these tests the doctor insisted dr hudd is it dr hudd shes got an ulcer textbook symptoms we both know it because your mother said so my mothers chief of internal medicine at atlanta general hudds brows shot up dr margaret de witt she sighed again impressive ive read a number of her papers though i tend to agree with her diagnosis im sure shed agree with my procedure signs point to a duodenum ulcer but i cant discard other possibilities these tests are standard and if the patient is so distressed emotionally wrecked that the idea of the tests aggravates the preexisting condition he waited a beat neither one of us is going to be able to force her to have them shell just walk out of here go on popping tums until shes got a hole in her stomach you could sink a putt through no i cant force her to have the tests hudd said irritably and i can give her medication in exchange for a promise that she comes back as an outpatient for a barium xray if symptoms recur ill see that she does youd better her blood pressures up her weights down shes hoarding stress id say shes got a breakdown on the boil ill take care of her dr hudd hesitated a moment measuring him then nodded im sure you will she reached for the curtain glanced back is your father dr brian de witt thoracic surgery and youre in hotels he smiled charmingly but my sisters are doctors all three of them theres one in every family im sorry kate murmured she kept her head back resting it against the cars seat kept her eyes closed just follow doctors orders take your medicine get your rest cut back on the jalapenos she knew he said it to make her smile and tried to oblige him and i was just craving some i didnt want to ask until i was sure wed managed the great escape but how did you talk her out of admitting me reason charm compromise and by invoking my mothers name shes a big deal oh and a promise he added that if it happens again you go in for xraysas an outpatient he laid a hand over hers squeezed this isnt something you can ignore kate you have to take care of this and yourself she fell silent again it was all too embarrassing and there were still little hot licks of panic flickering in her stomach when she opened her eyes again she saw the moonkissed sweep of big sur the rise of cliffs the flash of forests the wild curve of the road with thin mists of fog hovering tears stung her eyes shed asked him to take her home and hed understood home was templeton house the lights were glowing against the windows glowing in a warmth and welcome that was as dependable as sunrise she could smell the flowers hear the sea even before he had fully stopped the car at the top of the drive the door swung open laura raced out oh honey are you all right her robe swirling around her legs laura wrenched open the car door and all but absorbed kate into her arms ive been so worried its all right its so silly i then she spotted ann hurrying out and nearly broke there darling girl crooning ann tucked an arm around kates waist lets get you inside now i but it was too easy to just let her head rest on anns shoulder here were memories of warm cookies and sweet tea of soft sheets and cool hands byron laura cast a distracted look back at him im so grateful you called i she looked toward kate already halfway to the house with ann please come in let me get you some coffee no ill head on home it was obvious that laura was oblivious to everyone but kate ill come by later and see how she is go ahead thank you thank you so much she dashed away he watched her catch up and flank kate on the other side the three of them slipped into the house as one she slept for twelve hours and awakened rested and dazed she was in the room of her middle childhood the wallpaper was the same the subtle pastel stripes the blinds of her late adolescence had been replaced by lace curtains that swayed at the open windows they had been kates grandmothers had hung in her own mothers bedroom aunt susie had thought they would bring her comfort when she had first settled in templeton house and shed been right they brought her comfort now there had been many a morning kate had lain in the big soft fourposter and watched those curtains flutter and felt her parents close if she could just talk to them now she thought just try to understand why her father had done what he had done but what comfort would there be in that what excuse could possibly justify it she had to concentrate on the now had to find a way to live in the now and yet how could she not drift back it was the house most of all she supposed it held so many memories there was history here eras people ghosts like the cliffs the forests those wildly shaped cypress trees it held magic she turned her face into the pillow encased in irish linen ann always saw to it that the bed linen was scented lightly with lemon there were flowers on the night table a waterford vase filled with sweetsmelling freesia a note was propped against it recognizing lauras handwriting she stirred herself to reach out kate i didnt want to wake you when i left margo and i are at the shop this morning we dont want to see you there annie has agreed to lock you in your room if necessary youre to take your next dose at eleven sharp unless you sleep through it one of us will come home at lunchtime youre expected to stay in bed if you ever scare us like this again ill threaten you in person i love you laura just like her kate mused and set the note aside but she couldnt very well stay in bed all day too much thinking time in bed no she decided to call it by its name brooding time so she would find something to keep her from brooding her briefcase had to be somewhere she decided shed just and what do you think youre about young lady ann sullivan stood in the doorway with a tray in her hand and a hard light in her eyes i was going to go to the bathroom thats all cautiously kate finished climbing out of bed and ducked into the adjoining bath smiling ann set down the tray and moved to fluff the pillows all her girls thought they could lie when the chips were down she mused and only margo was any good at it she waited her back soldier straight until kate came back in then ann merely pointed at the bed now im going to see to it that you eat take your medicine and behave yourself with smooth efficiency ann fit the tray over kates lap an ulcer is it well were not putting up with that no indeed now mrs williamson has fixed you some nice soft scrambled eggs and toast and theres herb tea she says chamomile will soothe your innards youll eat the fruit too the melons very mild yes maam she felt as though she could eat for hours annie im sorry for what for being knotheaded well you should be but she sat on the edge of the bed and in the timehonored fashion laid her hand over kates brow to test for fever working yourself up until youre sick and look at you miss kate nothing but a bag of bones eat every bite of those eggs i thought it was heartburn she murmured then bit her lip or cancer what is this nonsense appalled ann snagged kates chin in her hand you were worrying you had cancer and did nothing about it well i figured if it was heartburn i could live with it and if it was cancer id just die anyway she grimaced at the violent glare i feel like such a fool im glad to hear it for you are clucking her tongue annie poured kates tea miss kate i love you but never in my life have i been more angry with anyone no you dont dont you dare tear up while im yelling at you kate sniffled took the tissue ann held out and blew her nose fiercely im sorry she said again be sorry then exasperated she handed over another tissue i thought margo was the only one of you who could make me crazy you may have waited twenty years to do it my girl but youve matched her did you once tell your family you were feeling poorly did you once think what it would mean to us if you ended up in the hospital i thought i could handle it well you couldnt could you no eat those eggs before theyre cold theres mrs williamson down in the kitchen fretting over you and old joe the gardener cutting his precious freesia so you could wake to them thats to say nothing of margo who kept me on the phone thirty minutes or more this morning so worked up over you she is and mr josh who came by and looked in on you before he would go on to his work and do you think miss laura got a wink of sleep last night as she lectured ann piled toast with raspberry preserves and handed it to kate thats to say nothing of how the templetons are going to feel when they hear oh annie please dont dont tell them ann said with a fierce look at kate is that what you were going to say missy dont tell the people who loved and cared for you who gave you a home and a family no one kate thought miserably piled on jam or shame like ann sullivan no ill call them myself today thats better and when youre feeling more yourself youre going to go and thank mr de witt in person for taking care of you i foreseeing fresh humiliation kate toyed with her eggs i did thank him and youll thank him again she glanced up as a maid knocked quietly on the open door excuse me these just arrived for miss powell she carried in a long white florists box and set it on the foot of the bed thank you jenny wait just a moment and well see what vase well use no you finish eating ann continued ill open this she undid the bow opened the lid and the room was filled with the scent of roses two dozen longstemmed yellows bloomed against a bed of glossy green she allowed herself one quiet feminine sigh fetch the baccarat will you jenny the tall one in the library breakfront yes maam now i know im sick cheered kate plucked up the envelope imagine margo sending me a bunch of flowers but when she tore out the card her jaw dropped not from margo i take it with the privilege of time and affection ann slipped the card out of kates fingers and read relax byron well well well its nothing to well about hes just feeling sorry for me two dozen yellow roses are something aside from sympathy girl thats moving toward romance hardly seduction anyway kate remembered the wild embrace in his kitchen hot intense rudely interrupted maybe sort of if i was the seducing type we all are thank you jenny ill take it from here ann took the vase from the maid and went into the bathroom to fill it she wasnt surprised and not just a little pleased to see kate sniffing thoughtfully at one of the blooms when she came back drink your tea now while i arrange these its a relaxing thing arranging flowers she took a pair of scissors from the old kneehole desk spread the tissue that had covered the flowers on the dresser and got to work something you take your time about enjoy plunking them by the handful into a handy vase doesnt bring any joy kate dragged her thoughts away from detailing a list of byron de witts qualities confident kind interfering sexy meddlesome sexy it gets the job done if thats all youre after in my opinion miss kate youve always been in a hurry to get the job done whatever it may be youve forgotten the pleasure of doing rushing through something to get to the next something might be productive but its not fun i have fun kate muttered do you now from what ive seen youve even turned your weekly treasure hunts into a scheduled chore let me ask you this if you were by some wild chance in your quest for efficiency to stumble over seraphinas dowry what would you do with it do with it thats what i asked would you take the riches and sail around the world lie on some lazy beach buy a fancy car or would you invest it in mutual funds and taxfree bonds properly invested money makes money ann slipped a stem gently into the vase and for what so it can pile up neatly in some vault is that the only means to the end or end to the means not that you havent done a tidy job with helping me build up a fine nest egg darling but youve got to have dreams and sometimes they have to be beyond your immediate reach i have plans i didnt say plans i said dreams wasnt it odd ann mused her own daughter had always dreamed too much miss laura had dreamed simple dreams that had broken her heart and little miss kate had never let herself dream enough what are you waiting for darling to be as old as me before you indulge yourself enjoy yourself youre not old annie kate said softly youll never be old tell that to the lines that crop up on my face daily but she smiled as she turned what are you waiting for katie i dont know exactly her gaze shifted to the crystal vase behind ann filled to bursting with yellow flowers that glowed like sunlight she could if she bothered to count on one hand the number of times a man had sent her roses i havent really thought about it then its time you did top of the list is what makes kate happy youre good at list making god knows she said briskly then went to the closet for the robe kate always left in her room at templeton house now you can sit out on the terrace in the sun for a while you sit there and do nothing but dream for a bit chapter nine a week of pampering was excellent medicine for kate it was also nearly an overdose yet anytime she made noises about going home and getting back to work everyone within earshot ganged up on her telling herself she would turn over a new leaf if it killed her she struggled to let it ride to go with the flow to take life as it came and wondered how anyone could live that way she reminded herself that it was a gorgeous evening that she was sitting in the garden with a child snuggled in her lap another at her feet her ulcerif it was an ulcerhadnt given her any real trouble in days and she had found there in the home of her childhood a peace that had been missing i wish you could live with us forever and ever aunt kate kayla looked up her gray eyes soft in her angels face wed never let you get sick or worry too much aunt margo says youre a professional nitpicker ali giggled at the term and carefully brushed pink polish on kates toenails whats a nit aunt margo wasnt it bad enough kate thought that she was going to have hotpink toenails without adding insult to injury good thing for her i happen to like nits if you didnt go back to your apartment we could play with you every day for kayla this was the ultimate bribe and you and mama could have tea parties like annie said you used to when you were little we can all have tea parties when i come visit kate reminded her thats more special but if you lived here you wouldnt have to pay rent ali capped the polish and looked entirely too wise for a ten year old until you regain your financial feet a fresh smile flitted around kates mouth whered you get that youre always saying stuff like that ali smiled and pressed her cheek against kates knee and mamas working a lot now and nothings the way it used to be its better with you here i like being with you too touched and torn kate stroked alis curly hair a sunshineyellow butterfly flitted through the air and landed gracefully in the cup of a red petunia for a moment kate caressed the child and watched the butterflys wings gently open and close as it fed how hard would it be she wondered to simply stay here like this forever just drift forget everything not hard at all she realized and wasnt that part of the reason it wasnt possible for her i have to go back to my own place that doesnt mean i wont spend lots of time with you every sunday for sure so we can find all of seraphinas gold she looked up in relief at the sound of footsteps if this kept up shed be ready to agree to anything her nieces wanted theres the nit now margo only raised an elegant eyebrow as the girls giggled ill consider that a private joke im too jazzed to be annoyed with you look after tugging up her sleek linen tunic she pulled out the elastic waist of her slacks i couldnt get my skirt zipped this morning im starting to show her face glowing she turned to the side can you tell you look like a beached whale kate said dryly but kayla bounced up and rushed over to press an ear against margos tummy i cant hear him yet she complained are you sure hes in there absolutely sure but i cant guarantee the he part abruptly her lips trembled her eyes filled kate it moved this afternoon i was helping a customer decide between an armani and a donna karan and i felt this this fluttering i felt the baby move i felti felt she broke off and burst into wild tears oh jesus jolting up kate gathered the goggleeyed girls and nudged them toward the flagstone path this is a good thing she assured them shes crying because shes happy tell mrs williamson we want a whole jug of lemonade the kind she makes that fizzes whirling back to margo she hugged her close i was only kidding before youre not fat i want to be fat margo sobbed i want to waddle i want to stop being able to sleep on my stomach okay torn between amusement and concern kate patted her okay honey you will in fact i think youre already starting to waddle a little really margo sniffed caught herself oh shit listen to me im crazy im doing this kind of thing all the time these days i felt the baby move kate im going to have a baby i dont know anything about being a mother im so scared im so happy hell ive wrecked my mascara thank god shes coming back a little shaky herself she eased margo into a chair what does josh do when you have one of these crying jags passes the tissues great without much hope kate searched her pockets i dont have any i do margo sniffed and blew and sighed wacky hormones she used a fresh tissue to dab then ran an expert hand over her fancy french braid i came out here to see how you were feeling unlike you there doesnt seem to be anything going on in my stomach its fine i think that ulcer business was just bullshit recovered margo lifted a brow oh do you do you really because she recognized that tone kate braced for a fight dont start on me ive waited for days to start on you but youre feeling fine now so i can tell you youre an insensitive selfish idiot you sent everyone who has the poor judgment to care about you into a tailspin of worry oh and it would have been sensitive and selfless of me to whine and complainwhich youre an expert atand take care of yourself margo finished see a doctor no not you youre too smart for that too busy for that get off my back pal ive just climbed on and im staying there like that monkey in the story youve had a week of everyone patting your head and stroking you now you can take your dose of reality mr and mrs t are on their way back here guilt heaped on kates head why theres no need for them to come all this way its just a stupid ulcer ah now you admit its an ulcer margo popped up again whirled around the chair if this was a twelvestep program youd have made it to step one theyd have been on the first plane the minute laura called them but she and josh convinced them everything was under control and to finish up their business first but nothing would stop them from seeing for themselves that their kate was well i talked to them myself i told them it was nothing major no no nothing major you get suspended under suspicion of embezzlement end up in the er nothing for them to worry about she propped her hands on her hips who the hell do you think you are i josh is furious blaming it all on bittle and beating himself up because he didnt jump on them the minute they axed you that has nothing to do with it kate sprang up as well her shouts matching margos decibel for decibel josh has nothing to do with it thats just like you thats just perfectly like you nobody has anything to do with anything when it applies to you thats why lauras been blaming herself for not paying attention to how you were feeling what you were doing that doesnt mean a damn to you with fizzing lemonade sloshing in a glass pitcher laura all but ran toward the sounds of battle whats going on here margo stop yelling at her shut up margo and kate shouted in unison as they faced off i could hear you all the way in the kitchen struggling not to slam glass on glass laura set the pitcher down on the table wideeyed and fascinated her daughters watched the threeway bout i have to yell margo insisted to get the sound through that thick head of hers youre too busy feeling sorry for her to yell dont drag laura into this but even as she said it kate whirled on laura and you have no business blaming yourself for my problems you are not responsible for me if you took better care of yourself laura snapped back no one would have to be responsible for you ladies not sure whether he should be amused or wary josh stepped behind his nieces took the glasses they carried out of their hands is this any way to throw a party stay out of this kates voice vibrated with fury all of you stay out of my life i dont need to be watched over and worried over im perfectly capable of making yourself sick margo finished everybody gets sick kate roared everybody has pain and those who are capable seek help laura put her hands on kates shoulders and firmly shoved her into a chair if youd had any sense youd have gone to the doctor gone into the hospital for tests instead you act like an idiot and send the entire family into an uproar i couldnt go to the hospital you know i cant cant remembering laura rubbed her hands over her face this is where temper got you she thought sniping at a hurting friend okay her voice gentle now she eased onto the arm of kates chair when her eyes met margos she saw that margo had also remembered kates shuddering childhood fear thats done now you have to start taking care so it doesnt happen again which means you have to start practicing to be human margo said but there wasnt any sting in it are they still mad kayla whispered still clutching joshs trouser leg with one hand maybe a little but i think its safe now mama never yells unsettled uneasy ali chewed on her nails she never yells she used to yell at me it takes a lot to make her yell it has to really really matter and once she hit me right in the nose josh said fascinated kayla reached up and rubbed her fingers over joshs nose as he bent down did it bleed and everything and everything kate and margo had to pull her off me then she felt really bad then he grinned even though i started it what do you say we have some of that lemonade ali walked behind her uncle and studied her mother with a curious and considering eye it had to be done kate reminded herself it was sunday morning her aunt and uncle were expected by midafternoon before she faced them she had to face byron it was her new plan for a healthy life deal with your personal and emotional problems as carefully as you dealt with the practical ones why she wondered was it so much harder shed secretly hoped he wouldnt be home a lot of people went to brunch on sunday mornings or to the beach somewhere but both of his cars were in the drive even parked behind them she could hear the music pounding out of the windows creedence clearwater revival she spent a moment listening to john fogertys fervent warning about a bad moon on the rise she hoped it wasnt an omen it was difficult to reconcile a man with his lookssmooth elegantand his obvious preference for downanddirty rock and edgy motown well she wasnt here to analyze his musical tastes she was here to thank him and then turn the page on this awkward chapter in her life prompting herself as she went kate got out of the car started toward the house she would be casual brief friendly cheerful she would turn the whole matter into a joke on herself show the proper appreciation for his consideration and concern and get out she drew a breath rubbed her hands over the thighs of her jeans then knocked and laughed at herself superman wouldnt have heard a knock over the blast of ccr she pressed the doorbell hard at the tinny notes of hail hail the gangs all here she gaped in shock then shook with laughter enjoying the absurdity she pressed it again then a third time he came to the door sweaty and incredibly sexy in tattered shorts and a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off the doorbell tune isnt mine he said immediately i cant change it until after the settlement i betthats what you tell everyone she indulged herself with a long thorough look did i interrupt a wrestling match weight lifting he stepped back come on in look i can come back when youre not busy pumping iron christ he had amazing muscles everywhere how had she missed that i was nearly finished anyway gatorade he held up the bottle in his hand and when she shook her head glugged from it himself how are you feeling fine thats why i dropped by to he leaned close closed the door behind her and made her jump to tell you i was fine and to thank you for things the flowers they were nice any flareups no its not a big deal really nervous she shrugged her shoulders rubbed her palms together one out of ten people ends up with a peptic ulcer all socioeconomic levels too theres no clear evidence that they hit on you know people with a lot of stress and harried schedules been researching have we a smile flirted around his mouth well it seemed the logical thing to do all in all uhhuh and did your research also reveal that people with chronic anxiety tend to be more susceptible and to aggravate the condition she dipped her restless hands in her pockets maybe sit down he gestured to the single chair before he walked over to turn down the music i cant stay my aunt and uncle are coming in today their flights not due until twothirty hed know of course she caught herself twisting her fingers together and made herself stop yes but i have things to do and so do you so ill just she was saved by a scrabbling sound and the surprising sight of two running balls of yellow fur oh god automatically she went down on her knees and caught the deliri ously happy puppies in her arms oh youre so cute arent you sweet arent you wonderful in unanimous agreement they bathed her face with eager tongues yipped and wiggled crawling over each other to get closer thats nip and tuck byron informed her as he got down on the floor with them which is which he sent one puppy into slanteyed ecstasy by scratching a furry belly i dont know i figured wed work it out with time ive only had them a couple of days kate picked one up to nuzzle and forgot shed been anxious to get in and out what are they a little of this and a little of that some golden retriever some lab before the second puppy could desert her she kissed his nose followed you home right i adopted them from the animal shelter theyre eight weeks old byron found the remnants of a wellchewed rawhide bone on the floor and skidded it over the polished wood for the pups to chase mind if i ask what youre going to do with two puppies when youre at work take them with mefor a while i figure i can fence in part of the backyard and theyll have each other for company when im not here they came barreling back jumped him i was only going to get one but then well theyre brothers and it seemed only fair he glanced over found her smiling at him what you wouldnt know it to look at you wouldnt know what youre a sucker he shrugged tossed the bone again id think a practical woman like you would see the value of taking both a backup dog is a sensible plan yeah right jesus kate have you ever been in one of those shelters they break your heart he tolerated wet sloppy kisses from the rebounding puppies theyre doing a great jobdont get me wrongbut all those cats and dogs just waiting for somebody to come along and take them or yeah or she reached over rubbing her hand over the dog in his lap you saved them her gaze came back to his youre good at that he reached out curled a hand around her calf and slid her over until their knees bumped i tend to get attached to things i save you look good anticipating her he kept his hand on her leg and kept her from scooting back rested i didnt do much more than rest all week and eat she smiled a little i gained three pounds well strike up the band it may not seem like much to you ace but ive spent most of my life trying to develop something resembling a figure i tried everything you read about in the back of magazines and sunday supplements he had to grin get out of here no really there i was faced with margowho i think was born builtand lauras feminine little body i always looked like their undernourished younger brother you dont look like anyones younger brother kate believe me feeling foolishly flattered she shrugged anyway despite the amazing weight gain and the lack of symptoms he interrupted you are going to see your regular doctor i dont have much choice my familys ganged up on me thats what familys for you gave us a scare i know ive been lectured by experts on my careless selfish ways he smiled and patted her legs sting bigtime im thinking about just having im sorry tattooed on my forehead so i dont have to keep repeating myself and speaking of apologies she blew out a breath fluttered her bangs i was going to try to get out of here without bringing this up but im trying to reform her brows knit as they did whenever she had to face a thorny problem or unsettling task this qualified for both the other night before i had my little attack we were on our way to the floor as i remember he reached over the puppy that had fallen asleep in his lap brushed at the hair above her ear looks like we got there after all what i want to say is that things got out of hand my fault as much as yours she added faults assigned when theres a mistake thats my point she should have known it wouldnt be simple nip or tuck was draped across her thigh snoring she busied herself with stroking his head we donti dont jump into bed with men i hardly know it was going to be the floor he reminded her he still had a hard time going into his own kitchen without imagining what might have been and i never assumed you did otherwise it wouldnt be two years since youve had sex her mouth dropped open where did you get an idea like that you mentioned it he said easily when i was trying to get your clothes off she closed her mouth let air out her nose oh well that only strengthens my point uneasy she watched him gently lift the puppy from his lap and set it aside where it curled deeper into sleep what happened was just a moment he repeated the procedure with the second puppy kates heart began to thud a hormone burst uhhuh he didnt even touch her just leaned forward until his mouth slid expertly over hers kate could almost feel her mind tilt and her brains flow out well she needed a distraction didnt she an outlet for all this tension it seemed like the most sensible thing in the world to unfold her legs wrap them around his waist and dive in this only proves it she murmured she threaded her hands through his hair and gripped proves im right shut up kate okay it was wonderfully brutally hot she hadnt known until that instant how cold she had been until his unshaven cheeks rubbed roughly over her skin she hadnt known how soft she could be or how gratifying it could be to be the soft one she let out a long grateful moan when his hands streaked under her tshirt to stroke her back slid around to cup and squeeze her tingling breasts the flick of his thumbs over her nipples shot a bolt of heat through her center that vibrated achingly in her crotch arching back she pulled his head down until his mouth replaced his hands he suckled through cotton tormenting himself with fantasies of what her flesh would feel like taste like sliding under his tongue she was so slight that neat almost boyish torso should never have appealed to him there was no womanly flare of hip and her breasts were small and firm and warm the way she moved against him that edgy eagerness of a woman already teetering on the edge was viciously arousing he wanted needed to shove her back rip aside that denim and drive himself inside her until they were both screaming instead he dragged his mouth back to hers slid a hand between their bodies and sent her freefalling over the edge he shuddered himself when she convulsed ordered himself to breathe when her head dropped limply on his shoulder well he thought that should hold one of us it took her a moment to realize that hed stopped was just holding her what she managed why the dazed questions nearly made him smile i decided i didnt want it to be a hormone burst for either of us he eased her back studied her flushed face the heavy glazed eyes better now i dont think couldnt think i dont knowdont you want to he crushed his mouth to hers in a kiss that tasted of dark and swirling frustration does that answer your question taking her by the shoulders he gave her a quick satisfying shake youre trying to confuse me part of her brain was starting to regenerate and with it temper this is some kinky version of gaslight this time he did smile god youre a pain in the ass listen to me katherine i want you i havent the smallest clue why but i just want the hell out of you if id followed my first instinct youd be flat on your back naked and id be feeling a lot better than i do right now but ill be goddamned if youre going to pick yourself up afterward and claim i just helped you end your sexual drought her eyes snapped back into focus thats a hideous thing to say yeah it is and thats just how youd have rationalized it im not giving you the chance what i am doing is giving you the chance to get used to the idea of having me as a lover of all the just keep quiet for once he said mildly were going to take this slow go out together in public have a few reasonable conversations take some time to figure each other out in other words its going to be all your way he angled his head nodded yeah that sums it up when she tried to wriggle free he simply sighed and held her in place honey im as stubborn as you are and a hell of a lot stronger that puts me one up youre not going to keep me here when i dont want to be here he gave her a friendly kiss on the nose you may be a scrapper but youve got toothpick arms we can work on that he added ignoring the strangled sounds she made in fact theres no time like the present she thought shed had all the shocks she could handle for one morning but she got a fresh one when he hauled her up and slung her over his shoulder are you insane put me down you musclebound son of a bitch ill have you hauled in for assault its muscles were going to deal with he said mildly as he carted her into an adjoining room believe me theres nothing like a good workout to relieve tension considering your ulcer and your desire to gain weight this is something you should add to your daily routine he set her down caught the fist she swung at him in his hand gave it an affectionate squeeze you want to be able to put some power behind that punch well work on your biceps this isnt happening she said and closed her eyes im not even here we need to work on diet and nutrition too but well get to that they were going to get to a lot of things he thought as soon as she didnt look as if he could knock her flat with one exhale right now i think you should start off with threepounders he took two metal dumbbells from a rack youll work up to five youre going to want to go buy yourself some girl weights she opened her eyes again did you say girl weights no offense they make these nice plasticcoated sets of free weights in colors he put a weight into each of her hands curled her fingers around them the only thing that stopped her from dropping them on his feet was curiosity why are you doing this you mean besides because i find myself oddly attracted to you he smiled into her eyes as he positioned her elbows at her waist i think im starting to like you now pretend youre lifting and lowering these through mud concentrate on your biceps and keep your elbows in place i dont want to lift weights hadnt this man just minutes ago taken her to rough and blistering orgasm i want to hit you just think about how much harder youll be able to hit me once youve got some muscle he guided her arms down then up just like that but resist both ways these are too light its silly they wont feel so light after a few sets youre going to work up a nice sweat before im finished with you she sent him a sweet smile yeah thats what i thought before pleased with herself she lowered the weights lifted them then her brain flashed goddamn you byron are you saving me again he stepped behind her positioned her shoulders just pump iron kid well work out the details later chapter ten it was always good to have aunt susan and uncle tommy home kate had worried that something would show in her faceor worse that there would be something in theirs the knowledge of crimes past the doubt of her own innocence but there had been only concern and acceptance their visit also meant extending her stay at templeton house it was difficult seeing them every day with the questions she tried to ignore drumming in the back of her mind questions she couldnt bring herself to ask she used the routine to carve out the path she intended to follow days at the shopwork to challenge the brain and keep it busy evenings with her family to soothe the heart the occasional date with byron to keep her on her toes he was a new element seeing him wondering about him helped keep her from brooding about the turn her life had taken shed decided to think of him as a kind of experiment kate preferred that term to relationship and it wasnt an altogether unpleasant experiment a few dinners a movie now and again perhaps a walk on the cliffs then there were those long stirring kisses he apparently loved to indulge in kisses that had her heart flopping in her chest like a landed trout sent her senses cartwheeling into each other then ended leaving her aching and baffled and itchy the entire relationshipno experiment she correctedleft him far too much in control now that she was feeling a little steadierall right healthiershe was going to work on balancing the power thats good to see susan templeton stood at the doorway her arm tucked through her husbands our kate never did enough daydreaming did she tommy not our sensible girl he closed the door to the office behind them he and his wife had worked out the logistics of this maneuver and following their plan they flanked the small desk where kate had been pretending to work i was trying to calculate our advertising budget for the next quarter she flipped the screen saver onto her monitor if youre smart you two will hide in here before margo can put you to work i promised her a couple of hours thomas winked she thinks she charmed me into it but i get a kick out of working that old cash register maybe youll give me some tips on salesmanship i cant quite get the knack of it love what you sell katie girl even if you hate it he cast an experienced eye around the office noted the tidy shelves the organized work space somebodys been streamlining in here nobody puts things and people in their place better than kate susan laid a hand over kates kept her soft blue eyes level why havent you put bittle in his kate shook her head because shed been waiting for days for one of them to bring it up she didnt panic she had her rationale ready its not important but susans eyes stayed on hers calm patient waiting it was too important she corrected im not going to let it matter to me now you listen here girl tommy susan murmured no he cut his wife off with a snap of sizzling temper in contrast to susan his slategray eyes were sizzling i know you wanted to softpedal this business susie but damned if i will he loomed over the desk a tall man powerfully built well used to taking control be it in business or family i expected better of you kate letting yourself get run roughshod over giving up without a fight turning your back on something you worked for your whole life worse getting yourself sick over it instead of standing up to it im ashamed of you those were words hed never said to her before words shed worked her entire life to keep him from saying now they struck her like a backhanded slap ii never took any money of course you didnt take any money i did the best i could i know i let you down im sorry were not talking about me he shot back were talking about you youve let yourself down no i ashamed of her he was ashamed of her and angry i put everything i had into my job i tried toi thought i was on the fast track to partner and then youd so the first time you take a knock you crumble he leaned forward poking his finger at her is that your answer no unable to face him she stared at her hands no they had evidence i dont know how because i swear to you i never took any money give us some credit katherine susan said quietly but they had the forms my signature the breath was backing up in her lungs if id pushed they might have filed charges it might have gone to court id have to youd have to i know people are whispering about it and thats embarrassing for you but if we just leave it alone itll pass itll just pass this time susan held up a hand before her husband could interrupt she too was accustomed to control youre concerned that were embarrassed it all reflects its all of a piece isnt it she squeezed her eyes tightly shut i know that what i do reflects on you if i can just wait it out build something here with the shop i know i owe you what bullshit is this thomas exploded hush tommy susan sat back folded her hands id like kate to finish what do you owe us kate everything she looked up then eyes swimming everything everything i hate disappointing you knowing ive disappointed you i had no way to stop it to prepare for it if i could fix it if i could go back and fix she broke off shuddering as she realized she was mixing past and present i know how much youve given me and i wanted to pay you back once id made partner it would have been a proper return on our investment susan concluded she got slowly to her feet because every muscle in her body was tingling that is insulting arrogant and cruel aunt susie be quiet do you actually believe we expect payment for loving you how dare you think such a thing but i meant i know what you meant all but shaking with fury she clutched her husbands shoulder you think we took you into our home into our lives because we felt pity for the poor orphaned child do you think it was charityworse the kind of charity that comes with strings and expectations oh yes she continued fired up now the templetons are known for their charitable works i assume we fed you clothed you educated you because we wanted the community to witness our largesse and we loved you comforted you admired you disciplined you because we expected you to grow into a successful woman who would then pay us back for our time and effort with the importance of her position rather than interrupt what he couldnt have said better himself thomas handed kate a handkerchief so she could wipe her streaming eyes susan leaned over the desk her voice was low had remained low even in anger yes we pitied the little girl who had lost her parents so tragically so brutally so unfairly our hearts ached for the child who looked so lost and so brave but ill tell you something katherine louise powell the minute you stepped through the door of templeton house you became ours ours you were my child then and you still are and the only things any of my children owe me or their father is love and respect dont you ever ever throw my love in my face again she turned on her heel sailed out of the room and let the door click quietly behind her thomas huffed out a long breath his wifes tirades were few and far between but they were brilliant put your foot in it didnt you katie girl oh uncle tommy she could see the world shed tried to piece back together shattered in her hands i dont know what to do start by coming over here when shed crawled into his lap and buried her face in his chest he rocked her never knew such a bright child could be so stupid im screwing everything up i dont know what to do i just dont know how to fix it whats wrong with me plenty id say but nothing that cant be mended she was so angry with me well that can be mended too you know one of your problems kate youve focused on figures so long you think everything has to add up and be equal its just not true with people and feelings i never wanted to bring either of you into this to hurt you remind you she broke off shook her head fiercely i always wanted to be the best for you the best in school in sports everything and we admired your competitive spirit but not when it eats a hole in your gut exhausted from tears she laid her head against his shoulder it was cowardice she thought that had eaten that hole in her gut now she had to face it all what had been what was and what would come im going to fix things uncle tommy take my advice and give susie a little time to cool off she gets hard of hearing when her tempers on boil okay kate drew a deep breath and sat up then i guess ill start with bittle his face broke into a huge grin now thats my kate in the parking lot of bittle and associates kate flipped down her rearview mirror to take one last critical look at her face margo had performed a little miracle shed dragged kate upstairs and with cold compresses eyedrops lotions and makeup had erased all traces of damage kate decided she no longer looked as though she had spent twenty minutes bawling like a scolded child she looked efficient composed and determined that was perfect she told herself it didnt bother her that conversations stopped when she sailed into the firstfloor lobby she didnt mind the stares and murmurs the strained smiles and curiositylaced greetings they were in fact an eyeopener the few people who greeted her warmly who detoured to stop her on her march to the second floor and offer support showed her that shed made more friends at bittle than shed realized it took only one twist of the corridor to bring kate face to face with the dragon newman raised a brow gave kate one brief chilly stare ms powell may i help you im on my way to see marty do you have an appointment kate angled her chin the fingers gripping the handle of her briefcase tightened ill take that up with marty and his secretary why dont you go tell mr bittle senior that the disgraced associate has invaded the hallowed halls like a swiss guard protecting royalty newman shifted her stance i see no reason for you to kate roger poked his head out of his office rolled his eyes behind newmans back and beamed a smile good to see you i was hoping youd make it by oh ms newman ive got that report mr bittle senior needed like a magician pulling a rabbit out of his hat roger produced a sheaf of papers he was anxious to see it very well she shot kate one last warning glance then hurried down the hallway thanks kate murmured i think we might have come to blows my money was on you he put a supportive hand on her shoulder this situation really sucks id have called you but i didnt know what to say he dropped his hand stuck it in his pocket how to act it doesnt matter i didnt have anything to say myself until now now she had plenty to say listen he nudged her toward his office door but didnt kate noted wryly invite her inside i dont know how much pressure your lawyers putting on my lawyer templeton the partners went into a powwow after he came in and stirred them up maybe thats a good thing i dont know youve got to handle it the way you think best i can tell you that it looks like the partners are divided over whether or not to pursue and prosecute his brow creased and his voice like a conspirators was low and dramatic amandas leading the charge and bittle juniors behind her my take is that calvin and senior are on the fence with marty solidly against its always good to know whos in your corner and whos going for your throat kate murmured all this craziness over a lousy seventyfive k roger said in disgust its not like you killed anyone kate stepped back studied his face stealing is stealing seventyfive cents or seventyfive k and i didnt take any money i didnt say you did i didnt mean it that way but there was doubt in his voice even as he took her hand to squeeze it i meant everybody overreacted i get the impression that if you came up with the money it would all go away slowly firmly she drew her hand free would it i know its a lousy deal either way but hell kate the templetons sneeze that much money away every day it would offset the chance of you being charged ruining your whole damn life sometimes youve got to choose between the rock and the hard place and sometimes youve got to stick thanks for the advice kate he took a step after her but she didnt stop or look back with a shrug he went back into his office word was already out marty came to his door personally to meet her he offered his hand shook hers in a friendly professional manner kate im glad you came by come inside i should have come before she began as she followed him past his secretary who was doing her best to look busy and disinterested i thought you would want anything coffee no it was the same old marty she thought as she took her seat from the wrinkled shirtsleeves to the affable smile im cutting back i want to say first that i appreciate you seeing me like this i know you didnt skim any funds kate the quiet statement stopped the neat little opening speech shed prepared if you know that why well why i know it he said because i know you the signatures the forms indicated otherwise but im sure as im sitting here that theres another explanation he wagged a finger signaling her that he wasnt finished but was formulating his thoughts the gesture nearly made her smile it was so famil iar so marty certain people ah believe that i feel so strongly in this matter because im attracted to you well thats just silly actually i amwas am stopping himself he rubbed his hands over his rapidly coloring face kate i love my wife i would never that is other than the occasional thought which i would never act on i would never never he finished leaving her quite literally speechless um was all she could think of in response im not bringing that up to embarrass either one of us though it seems to have done just that he cleared his throat as he rose and with nervous hands poured two mugs of coffee as he handed her one he remembered sorry you said you didnt want any ill take it what was a little afterburn in comparison with staggered shock thanks i only mentioned that because people who know me well have sort of noticed that inot that youve done anything to encourage or that i would have done anything even if you had i get the picture marty she allowed a breath to ease quietly through her lips studied his wide harmless homely face im flattered it muddies the waters so to speak im sorry for that but i feel your record with this firm stands for itself ill continue to do everything i can to prevent formal charges being filed and to get to the bottom of this situation i dont think i appreciated you enough when i worked here she set her mug aside and rose marty i want to talk to the partners all of them i think its time i took a stand he nodded as though hed merely been waiting for her to say so ill see if i can arrange it it didnt take him long he might have been considered the puppy dog of bittle but he knew what buttons to push within thirty minutes kate was again seated at the long polished table in the conference room in keeping with the strategy shed outlined on the drive over she made eye contact with each partner then settled her gaze firmly on bittle senior ive come here today without my lawyer in an effort to keep this meeting informal even personal i realize your time is valuable and i appreciate each of you taking that time to listen to what i have to say she paused once again glanced at the faces around the table once again addressed herself to the senior partner and founder i worked for this firm for nearly six years i dedicated my professional and a good deal of my personal life to it my goals were not selfless i worked very hard to bring in accounts to keep accounts assigned to me satisfied and viable in order to increase bittles revenue and reputation with the ultimate aim of sitting at this table as a partner not once during my employment here did i ever take one penny from an account i was raised as you know mr bittle by people who value integrity it is your accounts that remain in question ms powell amanda put in briskly your signature if youve come here today with an explanation we are prepared to hear it i havent come here for explanations i havent come to answer questions or to ask them ive come here to make a statement i have never done anything illegal or unethical if there is a discrepancy in the accounts i am not responsible for it im prepared to make this same statement if necessary to each client involved just as i am prepared to go to court and defend myself against these charges her hands were beginning to shake so she gripped them tightly together under the table if charges are not brought and this matter is not satisfactorily resolved within thirty days i will advise my attorney to file suit against bittle and associates for unjustified termination and slander you would dare to threaten this firm though his voice was quiet and clipped lawrence fisted a hand on the table its not a threat she said coolly even as her stomach jittered and churned my career has been sabotaged my reputation impugned if you believe i would sit idly by and do nothing about that then im not surprised that you believe i would embezzle from my accounts because you dont know me at all bittle leaned back in his chair he steepled his hands considered its taken you some time to come around to this position kate yes it has this job meant everything to me im starting to believe that everything is just too much i couldnt have stolen from you mr bittle you of all people know me well enough to be sure of that she waited a moment wanting him to remember her personally if you want a question to ponder she continued ask yourselves this why would i have pilfered a measly seventyfive thousand when if i had needed or wanted money i would only have had to go to my family why would i have worked my butt off for this firm all these years when i could have taken a top position in the templeton organization at any time we have asked ourselves those questions kate bittle told her and those questions are the very reason this matter hasnt been resolved she rose slowly then ill give you the answer im not sure its an attractive one but i know the answer is pride im too goddamn proud to have taken a dollar from this firm that wasnt mine and im too proud to do nothing when im accused of embezzlement ms devin gentlemen thank you for your time she shifted her gaze smiled thanks marty not a single murmur followed her out the door she stopped shaking when she hit highway and realized where her instincts were taking her even before she pulled her car to the shoulder got out to walk toward the cliffs she was calm again there were fences to mend work to do responsibilities to handle but for a moment there was just kate and the soothing roar of the sea today it was sapphire that perfect blue that called to lovers and poets and pirates the foam far below the lapped shale and rock was like the froth of lace on the hem of a womans velvet skirt she climbed down a ways enjoying the swirl of wind the taste of salt and sea that flavored it wild grasses and flowers defied the elements and grew fighting their way out of thin soil and cracks in stone gulls wheeled overhead their breasts as white as moonlight the golden sun flashing off their spread wings diamonds glittered on the water and further out whitecaps rode the sea like fine horses the music never stopped she thought the ebb and flow the crash and thunder the eerily female screams of the gulls how often had she come here to sit to watch to think she couldnt count the number of hours sometimes she was pulled here simply to be other times to sit in solitude and work out some thorny problem in her early years at templeton house she had come here to these cliffs above this sea under this sky to quietly grieve for what she had lost and to struggle with guilt over being happy in her new life she didnt dream here had always told herself to wait for that until next year or the next the present had always taken priority what to do now she stood on the comfortably wide ledge and asked herself what to do now should she call josh and tell him to go ahead with preparation for a suit against bittle she thought she had to as difficult and potentially dangerous as such an action was she could no longer ignoreor pretend to ignorewhat had been done to her life she hadnt been born a coward nor had she been raised as one it was time she dealt with that part of herself that was constantly in fear of failure in a way she supposed she had acted like seraphina metaphorically tossing her life over a cliff rather than working with the hand shed been dealt that was over now a little late she admitted but she had done the right thing the templeton thing she thought with a smile as she picked her way down a rough and crooked incline uncle tommy had always said that you couldnt be stabbed in the back if you faced your attackers the first step she needed to take was to face her aunt somehow she had to make things right there again kate looked back and though she was too far down the slope to see the house she could picture it always there she mused tall and strong and waiting offering shelter hadnt it been there for margo when her life had smashed around her for laura and her girls during the most difficult period of their lives it had been there for her kate thought when she had been lost and afraid and numb with grief just as it was there now yes shed done the right thing kate thought again as she looked back out to sea she hadnt given up shed finally remembered that a good noisy fight was better than a quiet dignified surrender she laughed a little and drew a deep breath the hell with surrender she decided it was no more palatable than a cowardly plunge off the cliffs the loss of a job a goal a man wasnt an ending it was just another beginning byron de witt was another step she needed to take she decided time for another beginning there the man was driving her crazy with his patience and it was past time for her to take control again maybe she would just ride over there later and jump him the thought of that had her laughing loud and long imagine his reaction she mused clutching her stomach what did a proper southern gentleman do when a woman threw him down and tore off his clothes and wouldnt it be fascinating to find out she wanted to be held and touched and taken she realized as the laughter in her stomach melted into warm liquid need but not by just anyone by someone who could look at her the way he did the way he looked deep as though he could see places inside her that she hadnt dared to explore yet she wanted the mystery of that wanted to match herself against a man strong enough to wait for what he wanted hell she admitted she wanted him if she was strong enough to screw up her courage and face the partners at bittle if she had enough left inside her to deal with the damage shed done to the aunt she adored then she damn well had enough grit to handle byron de witt it was time she stopped planning and started doing turning she started back up the narrow path it was right there as if it had been waiting at first she simply stared sure that she was imagining things hadnt she just come that way hadnt she and laura and margo combed every inch of this section of the cliffs over the past months slowly as if her bones were old and fragile she bent down the coin was warm from the sun glinting like the gold it surely was she felt the texture the smooth face of the longdead spanish monarch she turned it over in her palm twice each time reading the date as if she expected it to change or simply vanish like a waking dream seraphinas treasure that small piece of it had been tossed at her feet chapter eleven kate broke records on the drive back to pretenses even the state trooper who stopped her to issue a lecture on traffic laws and a speeding ticket didnt dampen her spiritsor slow her down she made it into monterey in under twenty minutes too wired to cruise for a legal parking space she zipped through traffic doubleparked and raced through the strolling wall of tourists she spun to the left narrowly avoiding a collision with a kid on a skateboard and all but stumbled through the door of the shop her eyes were more than a little wild i started to call from the car gasping she pressed both hands to her thudding heart as margo gaped at her im winded she realized im going to have to take those workouts byrons come up with more seriously you had an accident margo bolted from the customer shed been waiting on and made it to kate seconds before thomas got there he was calling for susan as he hurried over to take kates arm are you hurt youd better sit down he halfway carried her to a chair im not hurt there wasnt an accident her adrenaline was so high she was surprised everyone couldnt see it bouncing off the walls well there was the skateboard incident but we both escaped unharmed i didnt call because it wouldnt have seemed dramatic enough over the phone then she began to laugh so hard and so deep she was forced to clutch her ribs margos hand snaked out and pushed kates head between her knees get your breath back margo ordered maybe she had a flareup maybe we should call the doctor no no no still laughing kate dug into her pocket and held up the coin like a trophy look damn it kate howd you get my coin its not yours kate nipped it back before margo could make the grab this ones mine she bolted up and kissed margo hard on the mouth mine i found it on the cliffs it was just lying there out in the open look it didnt even have any sand or salt on it it was just there after deciding the glowing flush on kates face didnt jibe with an ulcer attack margo exchanged a quiet look with thomas sit down kate catch your breath let me finish up here she doesnt believe me kate grinned hugely as margo moved off to her customer she thinks i snatched hers and went crazy its all the stress im under letting her head fall back she laughed like a loon stress is a killer maybe some water thomas murmured and looked up in relief as his wife hurried down the stairs kate seems to be a little hysterical calmly efficient susan took the bottle of champagne from the ice bucket and poured half a glass drink she ordered then breathe okay kate obeyed but she couldnt stop snickering youre all looking at me as if id grown another head i havent snapped uncle tommy i promise i just found part of seraphinas dowry i was walking on the cliffs and it was right there bright as a penny and a lot more valuable just sitting there margo hissed as she walked by carrying a limoges box in the shape of a sun hat like hell take her upstairs will you mrs t ill be up as soon as i can good idea kate agreed theres more champagne up there were going to need a lot of it she tucked the coin back in her pocket toyed with it as she climbed the winding stairs first things first she ordered herself and turned as she stepped into the kitchen i need to talk to you aunt susie hmm her back stiff susan crossed to the stove and put a kettle on to boil the pretty little eyebrow windows were open to the breeze and all the bells and whistles that were summer on cannery row but susan said nothing youre still angry with me kate sucked in both breath and triumph i deserve it i dont know how to apologize but i hate knowing that i hurt you i hate knowing you feel the way you do kate shifted her feet staring at the pretty footed glass bowl filled with fresh fruit that sat on the counter she tried to find the right words you never gave anything to me with strings attached i put them there susan turned met kates eyes why im no good at explaining things that dont add neatly up im better with facts than with feelings but i already know the facts dont i susan said quietly youll have to make an attempt at explaining your feelings if were going to settle this kate i know i love you so much aunt susie the words and the simple emotion in them neatly sliced away a layer of susans anger but the bafflement was still there and under it the hurt ive never doubted that kate i wonder why you should doubt how very much i love you i dont its just knowing she was already fumbling it kate slid onto a stool folded her hands on the counter when i came to you you were already a unit whole templeton house you and uncle tommy all so open and perfect like a fantasy a family her words stumbled over each other in their hurry to get out there was josh the crown prince the heir apparent the clever golden son laura the princess sweet and lovely and kind margo the little queen stunning dazzling really and so sure of her place then me bruised and skinny and awkward i was the ugly duckling that makes you angry she said when susans eyes fired i dont know how else to describe it deliberately she made herself slow down choose her words with more care you were all so good to me i dont mean just the house the clothes the food i dont mean the things aunt susie though they were staggering to a child whod come from my barely middleclass background do you think we would have treated you differently if we hadnt had certain advantages no kate shook her head briskly absolutely not and that was only more staggering pausing she stared down at her hands when she lifted her eyes again they were glossy with threatening tears all the more staggering she repeated now because i found out about my father susan simply continued to stare her head angled attentively found out about what he did about the charges against him sick and terrified kate watched her aunts brow crease then slowly clear oh she let out a long long sigh god id forgotten youyoud forgotten stunned kate ran a hand through her hair youd forgotten he was a thief youd forgotten that he stole was charged that you paid off his debts and took his daughter into your home the daughter of a stop it it was a sharp order rather than the sympathy susan would have preferred but she knew her kate youre in no position to judge what a man did twenty years ago what was in his mind or heart he stole kate insisted he embezzled funds you knew all of it when you took me in you knew what hed done what he was now im under suspicion for essentially the same thing and it becomes clear why you sat back and took it and made yourself ill oh you poor foolish child susan stepped forward cupped kates face in her hands why didnt you tell us why didnt you let us know what you were thinking feeling we would have helped you through it why didnt you tell me why didnt you tell me what he had done to what purpose a griefstricken child has burden enough he made a mistake and he would have paid for it you paid for it she tried to swallow couldnt you took your own money and made restitution for him for me do you think that matters that tommy or i gave that part of it even a moments thought you mattered kate only you mattered she smoothed back kates hair how did you find out a man a client who came in he was a friend of my fathers he thought i knew im sorry you found out that way susan dropped her hands stepped back maybe we should have told you when you were older but after a while it just passed away what timing she murmured heartsick you found this out shortly before the business at bittle a couple of months before i looked into it found articles from newspapers hired a detective kate susan wearily pressed her fingers to her eyes why if youd needed to know to understand we would have explained you had only to ask if youd wanted to talk about it you would have after a moment susan nodded all right all right thats true i just needed to know for certain then i tried to put it aside i tried aunt susie to forget it to bury it maybe i could have i dont know but then all of a sudden i was in the middle of this the discrepancy of funds from my clients accounts what was my explanation internal investigations suspension her voice broke like glass but she made herself go on it was a nightmare like an echo of what must have happened to my father i just couldnt seem to function or fight back or even think ive been so afraid kate pressed her lips together i didnt think i could tell you i was ashamed to tell you and afraid that you might thinkeven for just a second you might think that i could have done it because hed done it i could stand anything but that i cant be angry with you again even for such foolishness youve had a rough time of it kate susan gathered her close itll come out kate murmured i know it will and people will talk some will assume i took money because my father took money i didnt think i could stand that but i can she sat back scrubbed away her tears i can stand it but im sorry im so sorry it touches you i raised my children to stand on their own feet and to understand that family stands together i think you forgot the second part of that for a while maybe aunt susie she had to finish finish all of it you never made me feel like an outsider not from the first moment you brought me home you never treated me like a debt or an obligation but i felt the debt the obligation and wanted always to be the best i never wanted you to question whether youd done the right thing by taking me by loving me with her own heart still aching susan folded her arms do you think we measure our love by the accomplishments of the people we care for no but i diddo its my failing aunt susie not yours at first id go to bed at night wondering if youd change your mind about me in the morning send me away oh kate then i knew you wouldnt i knew you wouldnt she repeated youd made me part of the unit part of the whole and im sorry if it makes you angry or hurts you but i owe you for that i owe you and uncle tommy for being who and what you are id have been lost without you did you ever consider kate what you did to complete our lives i considered what i could do to make you proud of me i couldnt be as beautiful as margo as innately kind as laura but i could be smart i could work hard plan things out be sensible and successful thats what i wanted for myself and for you and theres something else you should know susan turned to switch off the spurting kettle but didnt pour the hot water over the waiting tea what kate i was so happy at templeton house and i would think that i wouldnt be there with you with everyone if the roads hadnt been icy that night if we hadnt gone out and the car hadnt skidded and crashed if my parents hadnt died she lifted her eyes to susans and i wanted to be there and as the years passed i loved you so much more than i could remember loving them and it seemed horrible to be glad i was with you instead of them and youve nurtured that ugly little seed all these years susan shook her head she wondered if parents and their children ever really understood each other you were a child barely eight years old you had nightmares for months and you grieved more than any child should have to why should you go on paying for something over which you had no control kate her fingers stroked gently over kates temples why shouldnt you have been happy would you have been better off clinging to the pain and the grief and the misery no so you chose guilt instead it seemed that the best thing that had ever happened in my life had grown out of the worst i could never make sense of it it was as if my life began the night they died i knew if a miracle had happened and my parents had come to the door of templeton house i would have run to you and begged you to keep me kate susan shook her head smoothed kates hair back from her face if god almighty had come to the door id have fought him tooth and nail to keep you with me and i dont feel the least bit guilty about it what happened wasnt your fault or mine it doesnt make sense it just is nearly believing it kate nodded please say youll forgive me susan stepped back eyed her her child she thought a gift given to her out of tragedy so complicated so layered so precious if you feel you have to owe me forhow did you put itmaking you part of the unit the payment is that you accept who you are what youve made yourself well be even then ill work on it but in the meantime youre forgiven but she continued as kate sniffled were going to work on the rest of this together together kate when bittle deals with one templeton hell deal with all of them okay kate knuckled a tear away i feel better im sure you do susans lips curved so do i eyes wide and a little wild margo burst into the kitchen let me see that coin she demanded and thrust a hand into kates pocket before kate could move hey oh my god margo goggled at it then goggled at the matching doubloon she held in her other hand i checked my purse i really thought you were playing some sort of idiotic joke on me theyre the same and the world somehow settled neatly back into place i was trying to tell you kate began then grunted when margo grabbed her and squeezed theyre the same margo shouted and held the coins in front of susans face look mrs t seraphina theyre certainly from the right place and the right time struggling to switch gears susan frowned over the coins you just found this one kate no this one in a proprietary move kate snatched the coin from margos left hand mine she stated i cant believe it all these months since i found the first one all these months weve been searching and scraping and hauling that silly metal detector around and you just stumble over it it was just there exactly margo crowed in triumph just like the first one was just there its a sign kate rolled her eyes its not magic margo its luck theres a difference i just happened to be there after the coin got kicked up or washed up or whatever hah was all margo had to say to that weve got to tell laura oh who the hell can remember where she is with that insane schedule of hers if youd bother to look at the weekly schedule ive posted in the office youd know exactly where she is feeling superior kate glanced at her watch if memory serves shes at the hotel for the next thirty minutes then she has a meeting with alis teacher after that we dont need after that well just margo stopped short hell we cant just close the shop in the middle of the afternoon go ahead susan told her tommy and i can mind the store for an hour really margo beamed at her i wouldnt ask but this is so exciting and were in it together youve always been in it together susan said it perked her up margo loitered in the lobby after their brief contact with laura its frustrating to have to wait until sunday to go back and look but with her schedule were lucky to manage that dont you think shes taken on an awful lot kate scanned the sweeping lobby with its elaborate potted plants half hoping to see byron breeze by on some executive mission instead she saw wandering guests bustling bellmen a group of women standing near the revolving doors with shopping bags heaped at their feet and a look of happy exhaustion on their faces i know she likes to fill her time kate continued and it probably helps keep her mind off things but she barely has a minute in the day just for herself ah you finally noticed then margo shook her head and sighed i cant nag her about it anymore when i suggested that the shop could probably swing a parttime clerk and that she could cut back there she almost took my head off absently she rubbed a soothing hand over her belly as the baby kicked i know the bulk of her salary here at the hotel is earmarked for the kids tuition that bastard peter kates teeth began to grind even as she thought of it he was a slimy creep for taking lauras money but taking his own childrens that makes him whatevers lower than slime she could have fried his sorry ass in court thats what id have done margo agreed amused she noted that two men in one of the lobbys plush seating areas were trying to catch her eye what youd have done laura has to handle this her own way and her way is to hold down two jobs raise two children on her own support a full staff because shes too softhearted to lay anyone off she cant keep working twenty out of twentyfour hours margo you try telling her out of long habit she sent the hopeful men a quick flirtatious smile stop playing with those insurance salesmen kate ordered is that what they are carelessly margo scooped her long hair back anyway josh and i have pushed laura as far as we can push shes not budging nobody could tell you to take a vacation could they to see a doctor okay okay that was the last thing kate wanted to hash over i had reasons and ill explain it to you when we have a little more time i should have told you before what well talk about it she promised then baffled her friend by leaning in and kissing her i love you margo okay what have you screwed up nothing well everything but im starting to fix it now back to laura well just have to do more to pick up the slack maybe take the girls off her hands a few hours every week or run some of the errands shes always got a million of and worrying about this is spoiling my mood she pulled the coin out of her pocket watched it glint once we find seraphinas dowry the rest will be irrelevant once we do im going to open a new branch of pretenses in carmel i think surprised kate swept her gaze up to margos face id have figured you for a cruise around the world or a new haute couture wardrobe people change margo shrugged but i might add in a short cruise and a swing down rodeo drive its a relief to know people dont change too much but maybe they could kate mused maybe they should look theres something i want to do can you handle the shop until closing with mr and mrs t there i dont have to go back myself with a chuckle margo dug out her car keys if i could keep them in the shop for a month wed double our profits oh say hi to byron for me i didnt say i was seeing byron margo sent a sly smile over her shoulder as she walked away sure you did pal it was demoralizing to realize she was so obvious demoralizing enough that kate nearly talked herself out of going up to the penthouse she was still arguing with herself when she stepped out of the elevator when she was told mr de witt was in conference she decided it was for the best at loose ends she rode back down but rather than heading to her car she wandered out to the pool leaning on the stone wall that skirted it she watched the play of the courtyard fountain the people who sat at the pretty glass tables sipping colorful drinks under festive umbrellas she spotted name tags pinned to lapels that identified conventioneers taking a break from seminars in striped lounge chairs around the curving tiled pool lounged bodies slicked with sunscreen magazines and bestsellers were being read headphones were in place waitpeople in cool pastel uniforms delivered drinks and snacks from the poolside bar and grill other guests splashed and played in the water or simply floated dreaming they knew how to relax kate thought why had she never acquired this simple skill if she were to stretch out in one of those lounge chairs shed be asleep in five minutes that was how her body was trained or if sleep refused to come restlessness would have her up and gone with her mind ordering her not to waste time since this appeared to be a redletter day in the life of kate powell she decided to give wasting time a try she slid onto a seat at the bar and ordered something with the promising name of monterey sunset she lingered over it for nearly half an hour watching people come and go catching snatches of conversation then she ordered another it wasnt so bad this time wasting she decided especially when she felt so hollowed out inside a good feeling she realized as if shed purged herself of something that had been gnawing at her too long it was time to repair those rents in her life or perhaps to ignore some of them and move on there was promise in this hollow feeling in the possibilities of how to fill it carrying her drink she wandered through the hotel gardens reminding herself to enjoy the scents of camellia jasmine to appreciate the vivid shades of the tumbling bougainvillea she sat on a stone bench near a pair of cypress and wondered how people managed to do nothing and not go insane it was probably best to try it in stages she decided like exercise an hour the first time out was probably overdoing she rose with the idea of going back to the shop and checking inventory then she heard his voice be sure to crosscheck the details with ms templeton tomorrow shell need to be aware of these changes yes sir but it will require more staffat least two more waitpeople and an extra bartender three more waitpeople we want this smooth i think ms templeton will agree that this is the best position for the third bar setup we dont want staff running through the guests with ice buckets do we now lydia ms templeton has her finger on this particular pulse yes sir but these people keep changing their minds thats their prerogative its our problem to accommodate them what i wanted to discuss with you lydia is the complimentary coffee setup on the east terrace every morning we refined that a bit at the resort a couple of weeks ago and its working out well he came around the path as he spoke caught sight of kate sitting on the stone bench with a pretty drink in her hand and a quiet smile on her lips and lost his train of thought mr de witt lydia prompted the coffee setup ah right check with my assistant for the memo its all laid out let me know what you think he didnt precisely push her along but the intent was there well go over all of this with ms templeton in the morning once lydia was on her way he stopped at the bench looked down at kate hi hi im practicing practicing what doing nothing he thought it was like coming across a fawn in an enchanted gardenthose dark deep oddly slanted eyes the warm and humid scent of flowers hows it going its not as easy as it looks i was about to give up lets give it another minute he suggested and sat beside her i didnt think the brass worried about little things like complimentary coffee setups every detail is a piece every piece makes up the whole and speaking of detailshe turned her face toward his touched his lips to hersyou look wonderful really id say revived i feel revived its a long story he grinned id like to hear it i think i might like to tell you she thought he was someone she could tell no she realized she knew he was i came by to tell laura a portion of it then decided to hang around and try the nothing experiment he struggled with disappointment the way hed found her sitting there it had been as though shed been waiting for him want to go into the details over dinner id love to she rose held out a hand if youre cooking he hesitated hed been very careful to avoid being completely alone with her when he was alone with her he seemed to forget little things like timing and finesse now she was standing there holding out her hand with her lips curved in a way that let him know she understood his dilemma and was enjoying it fine itll give me a chance to try out the barbecue grill i picked up a couple days ago tell you what ill bring dessert and meet you there sounds like a plan testing both of them she stretched onto her toes and closed her mouth softly lingeringly over his im a terrific planner he stood where he was his hands firmly tucked in his pockets while she walked away he decided one of them was about to have their plans tumbled it would certainly be interesting to see which one it was flaky creamy decadent chocolate eclairs had seemed the perfect choice kate set the bakery box on the table in his kitchen and watched him through the window hed left the door unlocked in invitation shed accepted it had come in to a blast of searing bruce springsteen noted hed added a couple of pieces of furniture to complement the ratty recliner the low coffee table with the checkerboard inlay looked expensive and unique as did the stainedglass lamp and the thick geometricpatterned area rug she admitted she was dying to see the rest of the house but she made herself go into the kitchen and there he was in the backyard wrestling the puppies over a sock he looked as at home in jeans and a tshirt as he had earlier in his tailored suit and silk tie it made her wish shed taken the time to swing by home and change into anything she thought but this tidy pinstriped suit and sensible shoes in compromise she took off her jacket and undid the top button of her shirt before she went out to join him she stepped onto the redwood deck a deck she noticed that hed made his own with the simple addition of pottery planters filled with geraniums and pansies and trailing vines a complex and somewhat terrifying gas grill stood shiny and new near the double glass doors and a pair of redwood chairs deeply cushioned in navy were positioned to offer a view of the lawn leading down to the sea hed had the yard fenced in she noted with wooden pickets to keep his precious pets in but still leave it all open to the view a gate stood by the beach steps offering easy access to the sea hed planted something at regular intervals along the fencing she could see tender young plants and the carefully packed mulch around them she imagined hed done the digging there himself some sort of trailing flowering vine she supposed that would in time grow and tumble color over the fence a patient man byron de witt she mused one who would enjoy watching those vines grow and bloom and tangle year after year and she knew he would experience a quiet satisfaction when the first bud blossomed then he would tend it the man enjoyed tending things puppies yapped the sea murmured and the wind trailed lightly through the fluttering cypress leaves as the sky deepened from blue to indigo splashed with scarlet she felt a quick flutter around her heart there were she supposed perfect spots in the world it seemed byron had found one of them and claimed it and so did he look perfect she realized with the wind in his hair puppies at his feet that long mouthwatering muscular build was tucked snug and sexy into denim and cotton her reaction to it to him completely unprecedented was to grab hold and tear in with fingers and teeth she wanted to taste and take she wanted to be taken she wanted with legs less than steady she descended the short flight of steps to the yard the puppies dashed up to her yipping and leaping even as she crouched to welcome them she kept her eyes on byron what did you plant along the fence wisteria itll take a little while to establish he looked over to the fence line but itll be worth the wait there was always some growing on a trellis outside my bedroom back in georgia its a scent that stays with you youve already done a terrific job with the place its gorgeous out here must take a lot of time to add all these touches when you find what youre looking for you take care of it he crossed to her we can take a walk down to the beach after dinner if you like he stroked a hand over her hair much as he had done to the dogs fur then he stepped back catch this he snapped his fingers twice sit butts wiggling frantically both dogs sat he had them offer their paws and after some confusion lie down though their bodies quivered with suppressed excitement very impressive kate commented does everyone do what you tell them its just a matter of asking often enough in the right way he pulled two dog biscuits out of his back pocket and bribery usually works the dogs took the treats and raced away to feast ive got a nice red bordeaux breathing why dont i get it and you can tell me about this interesting day of yours she lifted a hand laid it on his chest felt the heat the rhythm theres something i think i want to say to you all right lets go inside he thought it was best to get into the brightly lit kitchen away from the sumptuous sunset and seductive night air but she kept her hand on his chest and stepped closer it must have been their color byron thought that made her eyes glow so erotically through the twilight shadows i was going to avoid men like you on a personal level she began it was to be a kind of principle a rule of thumb im very fond of rules and principles he arched a brow and generalities yes and generalities because they usually have some basis in fact or they wouldnt have gotten to be generalities id decided after a couple of unfortunate experiences that when something or someone looked too good it was probably bad for me you may be bad for me byron have you been working on this theory long actually i have but it may need some further adjustments in any case i didnt like you when i first met you now theres a surprise she smiled and disconcerted him by moving closer i didnt like you because i started wanting you the first minute that was uncomfortable for me you see i prefer wanting things that are tangible and that can be acquired through time planning and effort i dont like being uncomfortable or wanting someone i dont understand who is in all probability bad for me and who doesnt fit my requirements you have requirements too he didnt care for the sensation of being annoyed and aroused at the same time absolutely one of the main requirements is a lack of demand i dont think youre an undemanding man and thats undoubtedly going to be my biggest mistake one of the other things i really really hate to do is make mistakes but im working on being more tolerant of myself is that something else youre practicing like doing nothing exactly i see well now that weve established that this fledgling relationship with me is practice for your personal tolerance ill start dinner she laughed and put her other hand on his chest i irritate you i dont know why i find that so funny it doesnt surprise me katherine you have an abrasive contrary nature and like nothing better than stirring things up youre right absolutely right its terrifying how easily you understand me and the more patient you are the more compelled i am to poke at you we are so completely wrong for each other byron whos arguing he curled his fingers around her wrists intent on pushing her hands aside take me to bed she said simply and slid her hands through his loosened grip to his shoulders now chapter twelve he wasnt easily shocked but her simple demand rocked him back as efficiently as a short left jab hed been sure she was ending what had barely begun between them hed been prepared to be coldly furious but to school himself into not giving a damn because it was undoubtedly unwise to touch her he kept his arms at his sides you want me to take you to bed now because its a mistake because youve theorized that im bad for you and because were completely wrong for each other yes and because i want to see you naked he managed a laugh and would have stepped back but she locked her hands at the back of his neck i think i need a drink he muttered byron dont make me get rough with you she moved in her body bumping his her arms tightening ive been working out sort of i think i could take you if i had to telling himself to be amused he pinched her biceps gently the tiny muscle gave like putty yeah youre a regular amazon honey you want me she nipped her way up his throat if you dont ill have to kill you the little blood left in his head shot straight to his loins i think my lifes safe kate her hands raced busily to the snap of his jeans dontchrist and tugged at his zipper hell he muttered and gave in to the animal long enough to savage her mouth with his she made a sound in her throat like a cat purring over prey hold on he grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back just hold on one damn minute he panted out a breath then another you know the trouble with flings no whats the trouble with them im trying to remember he wanted to rub his hands over his face but he didnt dare release her okay ive got it however momentarily satisfying they are you end up dissatisfied thats not the way its going to be here this isnt going to be a fling youre going to have to accept that what was wrong with him she wondered men werent supposed to complicate sex fine well call it something else there are strings kate his hands still on her shoulders he began slowly backing her toward the house he could already see her naked and gleaming trust honesty affection once i touch you no one touches you but me theyre not exactly lined up around the block waiting to get their hands on me her feet bumped into the steps automatically she stepped up back again he was looking at her in that way that made her both nervous and eager as if he were looking beyond to what no one else had seen even herself i dont sleep around neither do i i consider intimacy a serious business and ill have intimacy from you kate in bed and out thats bottom line look her throat was burning dry her hormones bouncing this isnt a business contract no he backed her easily through the kitchen its a personal one thats much more involved much more important you put the deal on the table he swept her into his arms im defining the terms imaybe i have terms of my own better put them out here then this deals about to close we need to keep this simple not an option at the top of the stairs he turned left carried her through a doorway and into a room washed with the last vivid light of the western sky were healthy unattached adults she began talking fast now this is a mutual physical relationship theres more to sex than the physical he smiled as he laid her on the bed i guess ill have to show you he kissed her a long slow lazy meeting of lips that lingered until every nerve in her body was vibrating like the strings of a plucked harp eager for more she dragged him closer so that all the heat swirling through her seemed to center on their mouths he could have taken her in one greedy gulp knowing it he eased back honey where i come from we pace ourselves he linked his fingers with hers so that she couldnt tear down his defenses with those narrow nervous hands now relax he lowered his head to trail nibbling kisses along her jawline and enjoy down her throat weve got all the time in the world she thought he would kill her with patience rip her to shreds with gentleness his lips were soft smooth deliciously devastatingly slow as they cruised over her face each time they met hers he took the kiss just a degree deeper just a whisper warmer her muscles went from hot wires to soft wax the change aroused him mercilessly the sound of her breathing low and deep and slow the thrill when a breath ended on a moan a sigh her quivering impatience slipped into mindless pliancy when he unbuttoned her shirt revealing the simple white camisole beneath she did nothing more than murmur her pleasure fascinated by the simplicity of her form he traced his fingertips over the soft cotton then up over softer flesh the most subtle of curves he mused as her breath began to quicken again at his feathering touch linking fingers again he nuzzled the cotton aside flicked his tongue over her nipple she arched in response biting back a groan so small he thought so firm so sensitive he swept his tongue under the cotton moistening her other breast and felt her quake beneath him so he suckled slowly gently darkly pleased with the way she writhed under him with the quick helpless whimpers that sounded in her throat as he increased pressure and speed when he felt as if he might die if he didnt plunge into her when her hips were pistoning as if she would explode if he didnt fill her he drew back and slipped out of bed what what dazed desperate she sat up the lights going he said quietly i cant see you i want to see you there was the abrasive scratch of a match striking the flare of light that softened as flame was touched to the wick of a candle then a second a third and the room was suddenly rich and romantic with wavering light she pressed a hand to her breast shocked to realize that the hot quivering nerves inside belonged to her what was he doing to her she wanted to ask but was afraid of the answer then he tugged the tshirt over his head tossed it aside she let out a breath of relief nowit would be now and all these twisting sensations would smooth out into the understandable he stepped out of his shoes she was only mildly surprised when he slipped hers off as well slid his hand up her leg to just under the hem of her ruckedup skirt would you take your top off all but hypnotized she blinked at him what oh slowly he said laying a hand on hers before she could yank it free no rush she did as he asked because her limbs were so heavy his gaze took a lazy journey from her face down her torso and back again before he took the thin cotton from her set it aside his eyes stayed on hers as he eased her back you keep looking at me she murmured her skin trembled when he slid his hands further under her skirt when he curled his fingers around the waistband of her panty hose and began to draw them down i dont know what you expect neither do i i thought wed find out together he lowered his head and pressed his lips to her inner thigh now i know why you always walk as if you were ten minutes late for a fiveminute appointment its all this leg all this long leg byron she was burning up good god couldnt he feel it i cant take this but she would he thought and unhooked her skirt i havent even started yet he slipped the skirt off and quivered himself at the sight of that slim angular body in his bed resting a bent knee on the bed he cupped her she bowed back pressing desperately against him his eyes darkened dangerously as he watched her face the play of sensations and light the helpless trembling of lashes and lips then the utter surrender to self and to him when the orgasm rippled through her wanting more as wildly as she he closed his mouth over her breast and built her relentlessly toward peak again i cant nearly terrified at what hed pulled out of her of what he seemed to create inside her she dragged at his hair im not sure you can he gasped out the words before his mouth fused with hers heat was pouring out of her all but pumping out of her pores hed never known a woman to be so responsive and so resistant at once the need the drive to show her he was the one the only one who could bring that response and break that resistance made him hold off that final pleasure for the tortured maze of sensations between it seemed he owned her body she had no control and had lost the will to find any his hands his lips were everywhere and each time she thought he would rush to finish it he would cause her to erupt again then move patiently on she was painfully aware of her body and his the melding and the contrasts the race of pulses candlelight flickered over his face those sleek slick muscles making it all almost too beautiful to bear the taste of him was potent like some dark slowacting drug that had already seeped into her blood to addict her he braced himself over her waiting for her eyes to open and focus on his i didnt want you he said in a voice strained to the edge of control then i wanted nothing else understand that for gods sake byron now now he echoed and plunged into her but not just now the warm red haze over her mind cooled slowly she became aware of the world outside of her own body the candlelight continued to flicker against her closed lids in soft surreal patterns the night wind had risen causing the curtains at the windows to whisper she could hear the music again the low throb of bass from the stereo downstairs the answering wail of a tenor sax the smell of hot pooling wax and sweat and sex she had the taste of him in her mouth and the good solid feel of him beneath her hed rolled her over so that she lay sprawled across him concerned she supposed that he would crush her always the gentleman just how did she play this she wondered how did she handle the aftermath of such wild spectacular sex initiating it was one thing participating was clearly and fabulously another but she felt certain that these first few moments of the after would set the precedent for how they would go on i can actually hear your mind clicking back in gear he murmured there was a hint of amusement in his voice as he smoothed down her messy cap of hair its fascinating i dont know that ive ever been quite so attracted to a womans brain before when she started to shift he ran his hands down her back gave her butt a friendly squeeze no dont move yet your heads ahead of me she took a chance raised her head to look at him those gorgeous green eyes of his were at halfmast the mouth that had so recently sent her system into overdrive was softened with a faint smile he was she decided the perfect picture of the fully satisfied male animal is this going to be awkward she wondered aloud doesnt have to be it seems to me that weve been heading here since the first minute we met whether we knew it or not which poses the next question ah that tidy practical ordered mind he thought which is what direction do we take from here well have to talk about that he rolled her over and before she could speak again took her mouth in a long deep mindhazing kiss but first the practicalities he scooped her off the bed into his arms her system gave a fresh jerk it was so odd being carried this way experiencing the arousing vulnerability of being physically outmatched im not sure i like the way you do this let me know when you make up your mind meanwhile i vote for a shower and dinner im starving no it wasnt going to be awkward she concluded in fact it was amazingly pleasant to be wearing one of his faded tshirts listening to bob segers sandpaper vocals grinding out rock byron had trusted her to put a salad together while he grilled the steaks she was finding the process enjoyablethe colors and textures of the vegetables hed set out for her the summergarden scent of them she couldnt remember being quite so aware of food before she liked to eat kate thought but taste had always been the main stimulus now she decided there was more to it than that there was the feel of the food the way different ingredients played off each other harmonized or clashed the moist feathery layers of an artichoke heart the firm snap of a carrot the subtle bite of cucumber the delicacy of salad greens she set down the chefs knife and blinked what the hell was she doing romanticizing a salad good god carefully she poured herself half a glass of the wine hed set on the counter to breathe though she hadnt had any recent flareups she was still leery of alcohol she sipped the wine gingerly she could see him through the glass doors talking to the dogs as he turned the steaks flame and smoke billowed they were cooking together she thought she was wearing his shirt dogs were begging for scraps and music was playing it was all so quietly domestic terrifying honey byron slid open the doors you want to pour me a glass of that these steaks are about done sure easy girl she warned herself this was just a nice pleasant evening between two consenting adults nothing to get jittery over thanks byron took the glass she brought to him swirled the wine before drinking you want to eat out here its a nice night okay and more romantic she thought as they carried out the dinnerware why shouldnt she enjoy a little starlight and wine with the man whod just become her lover there was nothing wrong with that youve got that line between your eyebrows he commented sampling and approving her mixed salad the one you get when youre trying to calculate your bottom line i was calculating how much of this steak i can eat without exploding eyes on her plate she cut another bite its wonderful while i find it surprisingly satisfying to feed you the food isnt whats bouncing around in your mind like a pinball he started to ask her to look at him then took the more direct route he laid a hand on her bare thigh and watched her gaze shoot to his why dont i make it easy for you i want you to stay with me tonight she picked up her wineglass fiddled with the stem i dont have any clothes so well get up early give you enough time to swing by your place and change before work he reached out ran a fingertip down her throat such a long slim throat i want to make love with you again i want to sleep with you is that simple enough because it should have been she nodded ill stay but i dont want any complaints when the alarm goes off at six he only smiled it was a rare day for him not to be up already and jogging along the beach by six whatever you say now theres more i said there were strings i meant it that was what shed been trying to keep neatly locked in the back of her mind wanting to choose her words with care she continued to eat im not involved with anyone she began yes you are youre involved with me a quick chill of warning ran down her spine i meant im not involved with anyone else i dont intend to see anyone else while were involved however it may seem by the way i came here tonight sex isnt casual for me nothings casual for you he topped off his wine then hers but sex is the easy part it doesnt take a lot of thought instinct kicks in the body takes over his gaze rested on her face her eyes were wary he noted like those of a doe that had unexpectedly come across a stag in the woods or a hunter i have feelings for you her heart bumped she used knife and fork to cut meat as if the precise size and shape of it were paramount i think weve established that not just desires katherine feelings id planned on sorting them out before we found ourselves at this stage but he shrugged ate let her absorb the words i like maps her already baffled brain clicked over into complete confusion maps points of interest routes from one place to the next i like plotting them out one of the reasons im interested in hotels is because theyre like a world selfcontained full of movement and places and people as he spoke he cut the bone from what was left of his meal then did the same with kates he gave each of the wideeyed dogs a feast hotels are never really stationary just the building is but inside there are births deaths politics passions celebrations and tragedies like any world it runs more or less a certain way along a certain route but the detours the surprises the problems are always there you explore them enjoy them solve them i fucking love it she pondered as he sat back lit one of his cigars she had no earthly idea how they had shifted from a discussion on their relationship to his work but it was fine with her relaxed again she picked up her wine thats why youre so good at your job my aunt and uncle consider you the best and theyre very picky we generally do our best with something we enjoy he watched her through a haze of smoke i enjoy you her smile spread slowly as she edged toward him well then youre a detour he murmured taking her hand before it could become too busy bringing it to his lips when i map out the particular world im moving in i always anticipate a few detours im a detour she was insulted enough to tug her hand free thats flattering it was meant to be he grinned at her while im on this intriguing and very attractive alternate route i dont intend to worry how long it will take to navigate it and im along for the ride is that it id prefer saying were in this together where we end up depends on both of us but i know this i want you with me i havent completely figured out why but i cant get past the wanting part when i look at you its enough no one had ever made her feel more desired hed used no soft alluring words composed no odes to her eyes and yet she felt vital and alive and very much wanted im not sure whether im confused or seduced but it seems to be enough for me too good most of the tension hed been holding in seeped away as he brought her hand to his lips again now that youre relaxed why dont you tell me about this fascinating day of yours my day absolutely blank she stared at him then her eyes cleared went bright oh jesus my day id completely forgotten i cant tell you how gratifying that is he laid a hand on her thigh again slid it slowly up if youd like to forget about it for a while longer no as she pushed his hand firmly away she chuckled i was bursting to talk about it and then i started thinking about getting you into bed and it slipped down a couple of notches on the priority list how about i let you get me in bed again and we talk later nope she scooted out of reach ive already had you pal the encore can wait that sound you hear is my ego deflating he sat back with his cigar his wine gestured with the glass okay kid spill it she wondered how it would feel to simply say it aloud in march i found out that my father had embezzled funds from the ad agency he worked for before he was killed she let out a breath pressed a hand to her stomach god it was he thought the piece hed been sure was missing falling into place in march byron repeated studying her face you hadnt known about it before no nothing i keep expecting people to be shocked why arent you shocked people make mistakes and his voice softened when he calculated just how much shed suffered cut you off at the knees didnt it i didnt cope very well i thought i was i thought i could bury it just push it in didnt work you didnt talk to anyone i couldnt margo found out she was pregnant and laura shes handling so much and i was ashamed thats what it comes down to i couldnt face it and had made herself ill he thought with worry and stress and guilt then you got hit at bittle it didnt seem that it could really be happening some sort of cosmic joke it paralyzed me byron ive never been so afraid of anything or felt so helpless ignoring it seemed the only solution it would go away somehow just go away id just keep myself busy with other things not think about it not react and it would get better some snap he murmured some collapse and some dig their trenches and i pulled the covers over my head well thats done in a halftoast to herself she lifted her glass i talked to my aunt and uncle instead of making it better that made it worse i hurt them i was trying to explain why i was grateful to her and uncle tommy and i said things wrong or i was wrong and it came out badly she was so angry with me i dont remember her ever being that angry with me she loves you kate youll square this with her shes already forgiven me or mostly but it made me realize i had to face it all of it i went to bittle today now youre digging the trenches she let out a shaky breath at his response its past time i did now are you going to beat yourself up because you werent iron woman because you needed time to pull your resources together the corner of her mouth twitched shed been tempted to do just that apparently he knew her very very well no im going to concentrate on dealing with now you didnt have to go to bittle alone she looked down at the hand that had covered hers what made him offer support so easily she wondered and what was making her count so heavily on the offer no i did have to go alone to prove to myself and everyone at bittle that i could i used to play baseball in school i was a good clutch hitter two out a run behind put kate in the box id concentrate on the feel of the bat in my hands because my stomach would be churning and my knees shaking if i concentrated on the feel of the ash solid in my hands and kept my eyes dead on the eyes of the pitcher id still be terrified but nobody would know it trust you to turn a game into life or death baseball is life or death especially in the bottom of the ninth she smiled a little thats how i felt when i walked into bittle two out bottom of the ninth and theyd already winged two strikes past me while i stood there with the bat on my shoulder so you figured if you were going to go down youd go down swinging yeah now you get it honey i was a starting pitcher all the way through college went allstate i ate clutch hitters like you for breakfast when she laughed some of his worry eased she took a moment to sip her wine study the starstrewn sky it felt good it felt right even being scared felt right because i was doing something about it i demanded a partners meeting and there i was back in the conference room just like the day they fired me only this time i fired back she took a deep breath before launching into a playbyplay of what had happened inside the conference room he listened admiring the way her voice strengthened her eyes hardened perhaps her vulnerability pulled at him but this confident determined woman was no less appealing and youre prepared to deal with the fallout if they press formal charges im prepared to fight and to face all the fallout and im prepared to do some serious thinking about who set me up because somebody did either because they were focused on me or because i was convenient but someone used me to cheat the firm and the clients and theyre not going to get away with it i can help you he held up a hand before she could object ive got a feel for people and ive spent my entire adult life dealing with the intrigues and petty pilfering of a large organization youre the expert with figures im better with personalities motivations he could see her turning it over in her mind weighing the possibilities he smiled lets use baseball again youre the batter im the pitcher you swing away i finesse you dont even know any of the people involved he would make it his business to he thought grimly but he kept his voice mild so youll tell me about them youre practical enough to admit theres an advantage to a fresh viewpoint i suppose it wouldnt hurt thanks we can start working on the bios tomorrow i can see why you were wired youve had quite a day it took some doing to bring myself down after the business at bittle then i knew i had to face aunt susie i took a breather at the cliffs and she jumped up from her chair jesus i forgot i cant believe i actually forgot god what did i do with it foolishly she patted her hips then remembered she was wearing nothing but an oversized tshirt my pocket ill be right back stay here she streaked inside like a bullet leaving byron shaking his head after her the woman was a mass of contradictions he decided as he rose to clear the table it was no use reminding himself that he preferred the quiet soothing and sophisticated type the laura type he supposed wellmannered wellread wellbred yet hed never felt this bright hot need with laura or with anyone for that matter instead it was kate this bumpy and often inconvenient detour who continually fascinated him just how would his complicated and turbulent kate react if he told her he was beginning to believe he was falling in love with her hah triumphant she bolted back into the kitchen prepared to bask in his astonishment she smiled smugly as he stared at her eyes dark and intense i found it she was flushed and rumpled her short hair stood in spikes those long slim legs pale gold beneath the hem of his shirt she had no figure to speak of was more bone than curve the little mascara shed bothered with was smudged under her eyes her nose was crooked had he noticed that before the nose was just slightly off center and her mouth was certainly too wide for that narrow face youre not beautiful he said in a quiet statement that made her brow knit why do you look beautiful when youre not how much of that wine did you drink de witt your face is wrong as if to prove it to himself he came around the counter for a closer look its like whoever put it together used a couple of spare parts from someone elses this is all very fascinating she said impatiently but at first glance your body looks like it belongs to a teenage boy all arms and legs thank you very much mr universe have you finished your unsolicited critique of my looks almost his lips curved a little as he skimmed a hand along her jaw i love the way you look i cant figure out why but i love the way you look the way you move he slipped his arms around her drew her in the way you smell this is a novel way to seduce me the way you taste he continued and skimmed his lips up her throat and its surprisingly effective she managed between shivers but i really wanted you to look at this he plucked her up set her down on the counter then slid his hand around to cup her bare bottom im going to make love with you here he closed his teeth over the nipple that strained against the thin cotton is that all right with you yes good her head fell back wherever satisfied with that he rubbed his lips over hers what do you want me to see nothing just this he caught the coin that slipped through her fingers and puzzled over it spanish a doubloon i suppose isnt this margos no mine i found it she drew in a long shuddering breath let it out god how do you do that its like turning off a switch in my head i found it she repeated struggling to separate her sense from her senses today on the cliffs it was just lying there seraphinas dowry youve heard the legend sure intrigued he turned the coin over in his hand the starcrossed lovers the young spanish girl left behind in monterey when the boy she loves goes off to fight the americans she hears hes been killed and in despair she jumps off the cliffs he lifted his gaze from the gold to her eyes the cliffs its said across from templeton house she had a dowry kate added right a chest filled with her bride gift bestowed by a loving indulgent father one variation says she hid it to protect it from the invaders until her lover returned another says she took it into the sea with her well kate picked the coin out of his palm i go with the first havent you and laura and margo been combing those cliffs for months so margo found a coin last year now ive found one at this rate youll be rich beyond your wildest dreams about the middle of the next millennium you believe in legends what of it ready to pout she shifted seraphina existed theres documentation and no he kissed her gently dont spoil it its nice to know you can just believe its even nicer to know you want me to believe she studied his face well do you he took the coin from her and set it down where it gleamed like a promise beside them of course he said simply chapter thirteen storms blew in pelting the coast with driving rain sweeping it with raging winds relief that the dangerously dry season might be averted with the unrelenting wet warred with worry over flooding and mudslides kate tried not to take the nasty weather personally but there was no doubt that it prevented her from intensifying the treasure hunts even as the rains abated the cliffs were too wet for safety so they would wait there was certainly enough to occupy her pretenses summer season was in full swing tourists crammed cannery row jammed the wharf queued up for a trip through the aquarium arcades clattered with the sounds of games and jingling tokens and families strolled the sidewalks licking ice cream from sugar cones the busy carnival atmosphere out in the streets meant business some came to feed the gulls and watch the boats some came to gaze upon the street that steinbeck had immortalized some came to bask in the eternal spring that monterey offered or take the sweeping drive along the coast many many were lured by margos clever display windows to come in and browse and those who browsed often bought i see dollar signs in your eyes again laura murmured were up ten percent from this period last year kate turned from her desk and looked at laura by my calculations margo should be able to pay off all of her debts by the end of the next quarter when the holiday shopping season hits were actually going to be in the black eyes narrowed laura came farther into the room i thought we were already in the black not technically as she spoke she continued to crunch figures we take a minimum percentage in lieu of salary we have our pool for resupplying then theres operating expenses she worked onehanded as she reached for her cup of teaand tried to pretend it was coffee initially the bulk of our stock was margos property and she took the lions share of those profits in order to square with her creditors were gradually moving into new stock which is acquired by kate just skip all the details are we operating at a loss we have been but ive been taking money every month of course you have you have to live we have to live kate amended quickly seeing the guilt cloud lauras eyes seeing that it would be necessary to explain and reassure she set the cup down resisted the keyboard this is how it works laura we take what we needwhat were entitled to and plow the rest back into the business each of us has personal expenses in addition to the shop overhead once those are seen to we reinvest the profit if there is any and if there isnt were in the red and that means that means reality theres nothing unusual in operating at a loss in a new business kate bit back a sigh and wondered why she hadnt begun the discussion a different way forget all the ledgers for a minute what im telling you is good news were going to end this calendar year not just eking out a minimal living and paying off old debts were going to make a profit a real profit thats rare in a business thats barely into its second year by my projections well have a net gain in the mid five figures so were okay laura said cautiously yeah were okay smiling kate ran her fingers over the keys of her computer as if they were adored children if the charity auction goes as well as last year well be cooking thats what i came in to talk to you about laura hesitated frowned at the figures on the screen were really all right if you cant trust your accountant who can you trust right she had to believe it well then you wont have any problem cutting a few checks youve come to the right place humming kate took the invoices from laura and then choked what the hell are these refreshments laura offered a bright hopeful smile entertainment oh and advertising all auctionrelated christ were paying this for mindnumbing chamber music from a bunch of nerds why cant we just plug in a cd i told margo kate its a matter of image and this trio isnt a bunch of nerds theyre very talented she patted kates shoulder well aware why margo had suggested that she be the one to pass along the bills its union scale just like the waitpeople grumbling kate flipped open the checkbook margo has to do everything in an ornate and showy fashion thats why we love her just think how the cash registers going to sing the week after the auction all those rich materialistic customers with large disposable incomes youre trying to sweettalk me is it working say large disposable incomes again large disposable incomes okay i feel better really good laura winced held her breath about the fashion show weve set up for december you agree thats still a good idea its a great idea a wellexecuted special event will more than pay for itself and it has the potential of generating new clientele exactly my thought okay heres my preliminary budget she kept her eyes squeezed shut as she dropped the figures in kates lap she heard the yelp and when she opened her eyes she saw kate plucking at the back of her shirt what are you doing im trying to pull out the knife you just stuck in my back jesus christ laura weve got the clothes youve tapped your committees for the models why do you need all this money decorations advertising refreshments its all listed its negotiable she said backing out consider it a wish list gotta get back on the floor making noises in her throat kate scowled at the door the trouble was she decided both of her partners were too used to being rich to fully appreciate that they no longer were or that pretenses wasnt she corrected margo had married for love but shed married a templeton and templeton meant money laura was a templeton and despite being hosed by her exhusband she would always have access to millions she just wouldnt take it it was up to good old practical kate she decided to keep things on an even keel when the door opened again she didnt bother to turn around dont hassle me laura i swear ill cut this wish list of yours down until you wont be able to serve anything but popsicles and club soda kate lauras voice was quiet enough that kate whipped around in her chair whats wrong what she broke off at the sight of the man standing beside laura fiftyish she judged with a hairline beyond what could legitimately be called receding he had the beginnings of jowls and bland brown eyes his suit was neat and inexpensive somewhere along the line hed punched extra holes in his brown leather belt to accommodate his paunch but it was his shoes that tipped her off she couldnt have said why those shiny black shoes with the doubleknotted laces shouted cop kate this is detective kusack he wants to talk to you she wasnt certain how she managed to get to her feet when shed stopped feeling her legs but she was facing him surprised somehow that their eyes were on a level am i under arrest no maam i have a few questions regarding an incident at bittle and associates he had a voice like gravel bouncing on sandpaper it reminded her foolishly of bob segers gritty rock and roll i think id like to call my lawyer margos already calling josh laura moved to her side thats your option ms powell kusack poked out his bottom lip as he considered her maybe it would be best all round if he met us at the precinct if youll come along with me ill try not to take up too much of your time i can see youre busy its all right kate put a hand on lauras arm before laura could step forward its all right dont worry ill call you im coming with you no with icy fingers kate picked up her purse ill call you as soon as i can she was taken to an interview room designed to intimidate intellectually she knew that the plain walls the scarred center table and uncomfortable chairs the wide mirror that was obviously twoway glass were all part of a setup to aid the police in getting information from suspects no matter how kates practical side ordered her not to be affected her skin crawled because she was the suspect she had josh beside her looking particularly lawyerly in a tailored gray suit and muted striped tie kusack folded his hands on the table big hands kate noted distractedly adorned with a single thin gold wedding band he was a nailbiter she thought staring with dull fascination at his ragged painfully short fingernails for the space of several heartbeats there was nothing but humming silence like the hushed anticipation just before the curtain rose on the first act of a major play a bubble of hysterical laughter nearly fizzed out of her throat at the image act one scene one and she had the starring role can i get you something ms powell kusack watched her muscles jerk in reaction to his voice as her gaze flew from his hands to his face coffee a coke no nothing detective kusack my client is here at your request in the spirit of cooperation his cultured voice chilly and hard josh gave kates tense hand a comforting squeeze under the table no one wants this matter cleared up more ms powell is willing to make a statement i appreciate that mr templeton ms powell id like it if youd answer a few questions so i can get this all straight in my mind he gave her a kindly avuncular smile that made her insides quiver im going to read you your rights now thats just procedure just the way we have to do things he recited the words that anyone who had ever watched an episode of a police drama from kojak to nypd blue knew by rote she stared at the tape recorder silently documenting every word every inflection you understand these rights ms powell she shifted her eyes stared into his the curtain was up she thought damned if she was going to blow it yes i understand you worked for the accounting firm of bittle and associates from he flipped pages in a small dogeared notebook read off dates yes they hired me straight out of graduate school harvard right you got to have a lot of smarts to get into harvard i see you graduated as a baker scholar too i worked for it bet you did he said easily what kind of stuff did you do at bittle tax preparation financial and estate planning investment advice i might work in tandem with a clients broker to build or enhance a portfolio josh lifted a finger i want it on record that during my clients employment at this firm she increased business by bringing in accounts her record there was not only unblemished it was superior uhhuh how do you go about bringing in accounts ms powell contacts networking recommendations from current accounts he took her through the daytoday business of her work the questions slowly paced quietly asked until she began to relax he scratched his head shaking it me i cant make a damn bit of sense out of all those forms uncle sam wants us to fill out used to sit down with them every year all spread out on the kitchen table with a bottle of jack to ease the pain he grinned winningly the wife finally had enough of that now i take everything up to h r block in april and dump it on them that makes you very typical detective kusack theyre always changing the rules arent they he smiled again somebody like you would have to understand rules and how to get around them when josh objected to the tone of the question kate shook her head no i can respond to that i understand the rules detective kusack its my job to recognize whats black and white and where the shades of gray are a good accountant uses the system to circumvent the system when possible its kind of a game isnt it yes in a way but the game has rules too i wouldnt have lasted a month at a firm with bittles structure and reputation if i hadnt played by those rules an accountant who doctors tax forms or cheats the irs endangers herself and her client i wasnt raised to cheat you were raised right here in monterey werent you you were the ward of thomas and susan templeton my parents were killed when i was eight i your father had a bit of a financial problem before his death kusack commented and watched kates face go sheetwhite charges brought and never resolved concerning my clients father twenty years ago have no bearing here josh stated just background counselor and an interesting coincidence i wasnt aware of my fathers problems until recently kate managed how had he found out so quickly she wondered why had he looked as i said both my parents were killed when i was a child i grew up in templeton house in the big sur area she took a quiet breath the templetons didnt consider or treat me as a ward but as a daughter you know id have figured theyd have taken you into the templeton organization a woman with your skills and theyve got all those hotels the factories i didnt choose to join the templeton organization now why was that because i didnt want to take anything else from them i wanted to go out on my own they respected my decision and the door remained open josh put in anytime kate wanted to walk through detective i dont see what this line of questioning has to do with the matter at hand just laying a foundation despite the recorder he continued to make little notations in his tattered notebook ms powell what was your salary at bittle at the time of your termination a base of fiftytwofive plus bonus fiftytwo thousand nodding he flipped through his book as if checking facts thats quite a comedown for someone who had the run of a place like templeton house i earned it and it was enough for my needs she felt a line of cold sweat drip down her back i know how to make money from money and in an average year i would add twenty thousand to that base in bonuses last year you opened a business with my sisters with margo and laura templeton kate qualified its risky starting a business those bland eyes stayed on hers and expensive i can give you all the statistics all the figures you like to gamble ms powell no i dont not in the standard sense of vegas or the track the odds always favor the house but i appreciate an intelligent and cautious investment risk and i consider pretenses to be just that some businesses need to be fed a lot something like this shop of yours keeping stock all that overhead my books are clean you can kate josh put a hand on her arm in warning no furious now she shook it off hes implying that i would take the easy way because my father did that i embezzled from bittle to keep pretenses afloat and im not having it weve worked too hard to make the shop run especially margo im not having it josh hes not going to say that the shops involved she seared kusack with one hot glare you pick up the books at the shop anytime you go over them line by line i appreciate the offer ms powell kusack said mildly he opened a folder slid papers out do you recognize these forms of course thats the i completed for sid sun and that other one is the altered duplicate thats your signature yes on both copies and no i cant explain it and these printouts for computergenerated withdrawals from bittles escrow accounts its my name my code who had access to your office computer everyone and to your security code no one but me as far as i know you gave it to no one no you kept it in your head of course kusack kept his eyes on hers as he leaned forward must be some trick keeping all kinds of numbers in your head im good at it most people keep numbers in their heads social security pin numbers telephone numbers dates me i have to write everything down otherwise i mix it all up i guess you dont worry about that i dont kate josh interrupted again met her impatient glance with a quiet look where do you record the numbers in my head she said wearily i dont forget i havent had to look up the security code in years lips pursed kusack examined his ragged nails where would you look it up if you had to in my filofax but her voice trailed off as the impact hit home in my filofax she repeated i have everything in it she grabbed her purse fumbled through it and took out the thick leatherbound book for backup she said opening the book backups the first rule here she located the page nearly laughed my life in numbers kusack scratched his chin you keep that with you i just said its my life thats literally true its always in my bag where do you keep your bagsay during office hours in my office and youd carry it around with you i know my wife never takes two steps without her pocketbook only if i was leaving the building josh she clutched his hand only if i was leaving the building anybody in the firm could have taken the code christ anybody at all she squeezed her eyes tight i should have thought of it before i just wasnt thinking at all thats still your signature on the forms ms powell kusack reminded her its a forgery she snapped and rose to her feet you listen to me do you think id risk everything i worked for everything i was given for a lousy seventyfive k if money was what was important to me i could have picked up the phone called my aunt and uncle called josh and they would have given me twice that without a single question im not a thief and if i were i sure as hell would cover my tracks better than this what idiot would use her own code her own name leave such a pathetically obvious paper trail you know ms powellkusack folded his hands on the table againi asked myself that same question ill tell you what my take is the person had to be one of three things stupid desperate or very very smart im very smart that you are ms powell kusack said with a slow nod that you are youre smart enough to know that seventyfive large isnt peanuts smart enough to be able to hide it where it couldnt easily be found detective my client denies any knowledge of the money in question the evidence is not just circumstantial but highly questionable we both know you cant make a case with this and youve taken up enough of our time i appreciate your cooperation kusack tidied the papers and put them back in his file ms powell he continued as josh led her to the door one more thing howd you break your nose excuse me your nose he said with an easy smile howd you break it baffled she lifted a hand and rubbed it felt the familiar angle bottom of the ninth stretching a double into a threebagger in a bad imitation of pete rose i cracked it against the fielders knee his teeth flashed safe or out safe he watched her go then flipped the file open again and studied the signatures on the forms stupid desperate or very very smart he thought chapter fourteen he doesnt believe me reaction set in the minute the door closed behind her all the anger and righteousness jittered away into fear im not so sure of that josh murmured and navigated her out of the interviewing area he could feel her body vibrate through the hand he held to her back but what matters is they dont have a case there isnt enough to take to the da and kusack knows it it does matter she pressed a hand to her churning stomach not the ulcer this time she hoped but that was little comfort when the alternative diagnosis was shame and fear it matters what he thinks what bittle thinks what everyone thinks however much i dont want it to it matters listen to me he turned her in the corridor to face him kept his hands on her shoulders you did fine in there better than fine it might not have been the exact route i would have recommended as your attorney but it was effective the records in your filofax open up a whole new area of investigation now consider who led you to that you did when he shook his head she drew her brows together because josh expected it she ordered herself to think clearly he did kusack did he wanted me to tell him i had the code written down somewhere somewhere where it could be accessed joshs hands gentled on her shoulders now i want you to put this aside i mean it kate he continued even as she opened her mouth to protest let kusack do his job let me do mine you have people behind you thats something i dont want you to forget again im scared she pressed her lips together wanting her voice to be level even in the admission the only time i wasnt scared was when he made me mad now im scared all over again why did he bring up my father josh how did he know about it what reason would he have for looking that far into my background i dont know im going to find out they have to know at bittle despair was a stone sinking in her gut if kusack knows so do the partners maybe they knew about it before and thats why kate stop but what if they never find out who did it if they dont find out then im always going to i said stop we will find out thats a promisenot from your lawyer but from your big brother he drew her close kissed the top of her head then spotted byron striding down the hall he recognized barely controlled fury when he saw it and decided it was just what kate needed to take her mind off the interview by good timing youll run kate home wont you she spun around confused and embarrassed what are you doing here laura tracked me down he shot a look at josh that clearly stated they would talk later and began to usher kate down the hall lets get out of here i need to go back to the shop margos alone margo can handle herself he towed her down the steps past the desk and outside where the sun was blinding bright are you all right yeah a little turned around inside but okay hed driven his vette the sleek streamlined twoseater in musclecar black settling inside a thirtyyearold car only made the entire day all the more surreal you didnt have to come all the way down here obviously despising the impotency he gunned the engine viciously youd have called if youd wanted my help now youre stuck with it there wasnt anything you could do she began and winced at the molten look he shot her before he cruised out of the parking lot they didnt charge me with anything well its our lucky day isnt it he wanted to drive he wanted to drive fast to dissipate some of the bubbling anger before it boiled over and burned them both to cancel any possibility of conversation he flicked up the volume on the car stereo and eric claptons angry guitar licks scorched the air perfect kate thought and shut her eyes mean music a muscle car and southernfried temper she told herself the migraine brewing and the highly possible visit by her old pal mr ulcer were enough to worry about she found her sunglasses in her purse and put them on before dryswallowing medication through the tinted lenses the light seemed calmer kinder the wind whipped cooling her hot cheeks she had only to lay her head back raise her face to see the sky byron said nothing but sent the car slashing up highway like a bright black sword cleaving through sea and rock it tore through a lowlying cloud burst out of the thin vapor and roared back into the flash of sun hed been battling feelings of impotence and hot fury since lauras call the police took kate in for questioning we dont know what theyre going to do a detective came to the shop and he took her the jingle of fear in lauras usually calm voice had set off a violent chain reaction in him the fear had been fueled by hurt kate hadnt called him hed imagined her aloneit hadnt mattered that laura had assured him josh was with her hed envisioned her alone frightened at the mercy of accusations his overworked imagination had pictured her handcuffed and led off in chains and there was nothing he could do but wait now she was sitting beside him her eyes shielded by dark glasses that made her skin all the more pale in contrast her hands were clasped in her lap deceptively still until you noted the knuckles were white and she had told him there was no need for him he didnt question the impulse but swung to the side of the road at the templeton house cliffs where she had once wept on his shoulder she opened her eyes it didnt surprise her in the least that he had stopped there there at a spot of both peace and drama before she could reach for the door handle he was leaning across her to jerk open the door himself an old habit she decided with all that temper swirling around in him the gesture couldnt be considered courtly in silence they walked to the cliffs why didnt you call me he hadnt meant to ask that first but it popped out of his mouth i didnt think of it he whirled on her so quickly so unexpectedly that she stumbled back a step crushed a scattering of tiny white wildflowers underfoot no you wouldnt just where the hell am i on that agenda of yours katherine i dont know what you mean i didnt think of it because because you dont need anyone but kate he shot back because you dont want to need anyone who might upset that profitandloss ledger in your head i wouldnt have been of any practical use so why bother thats not true how could she deal with an argument now she wondered how could she handle that brilliant fury in his eyes she had a terrible urge to simply press her hands to her ears squeeze her eyes shut so that she could neither see nor hear so she could just be alone in the dark i dont understand why youre so angry with me but i just dont have the energy to fight with you now he gripped her arm before she could turn away good then you can just listen try to imagine what it was like to be told by someone else that the police had taken you in to visualize what might be happening to you what you were going through and to be powerless to change it thats just it there wasnt anything you could do i could have been there he shouted over the wind that raked through his hair like wild fingers i could have been there for you you could have known there was someone who cared there for you but you didnt even think of it damn it byron i couldnt think at all she jerked away walked along the cliff path even a few steps would distance her from the upheaval of emotion the avalanche the flood of it before she broke into pieces it was like being shut down or frozen up i was too scared to think it wasnt personal i take it very personally we have a relationship kate he waited while she slowly turned around watching him through eyes guarded by dark glasses with some effort he drew in his temper and spoke with measured calm i thought i made it clear what that entails for me if you cant accept the basic terms of a relationship with me then were wasting our time she hadnt thought anything could squeeze past the pain in her head the ache in her stomach the sizzle of shame in her blood but she hadnt counted on despair somehow despair always made room for itself her eyes burned as she looked at him standing in the sun and wind well you dumping me certainly puts a cap on the day she started past him with some idea of running up to templeton house getting inside and shutting everything else out goddamn it he spun her around crushing his mouth to hers in a kiss that tasted of bitter frustration how can you be so hardheaded he shook her then kissed her again until she wondered why her overtaxed brain didnt simply implode cant you see anything unless its in a straight line im tired she hated resented the shakiness of her voice im humiliated im scared just leave me alone id like nothing better than to be able to leave you alone just walk away and chalk it up to a bad bet he pulled off her sunglasses stuck them in his pocket hed wanted to see her eyes and now he recognized swirling in them the same anger and hurt that twisted in him do you think i need the turmoil and complications youve brought into my life do you actually think id tolerate all that because were good in bed you dont have to tolerate it she fisted her hands on his chest you dont have to tolerate any of it damn right i dont but i am tolerating it because i think im in love with you shed have been less surprised if hed simply hauled her up and tossed her over the cliff in an attempt to keep her reeling head in place she pressed a hand to her temple hard to come up with a response his voice was as sharp and smooth as a newly oiled sword thats not surprising emotions dont add up in neat columns do they i dont know what im supposed to say to you this isnt fair its not about fair and at the moment i dont like the situation any more than you do youre a far cry from the girl of my dreams katherine that had her eyes clearing now i know what to say go to hell unimaginative he decided now get this into that com puterchip brain of yours he pulled her up onto her toes until their eyes were level i dont like to make mistakes any more than you do so im going to take the time to figure out exactly how i feel about you if i decide youre what i want then youre what ill have her eyes narrowed glinting with dangerous lights how incredibly romantic his lips curved in quick and genuine humor ill give you romance kate and plenty of it you can take your warped concept of romance and he cut her off with a soft quiet kiss i was worried about you he murmured i was afraid for you and you hurt me because you didnt turn to me i didnt mean to she snapped back before her bones could melt youre twisting this around youre trying to confuse me surrendering to pain she shut her eyes oh god my head aches i know i can see it as a parent might soothe a child he touched his lips to her left temple then her right lets sit down he eased her down onto a rock then stood behind her to massage the tense muscles of her neck and shoulders i want to take care of you kate i dont want to be taken care of i know over her head he watched the sea gleam as the sun burned through a cloud and streamed down she couldnt help that he supposed any more than he could help his own need to protect and defend well have to find an area of compromise there you matter to me i know you matter to me too but thats a nice place to stop he told her im asking you to think of me and to accept that you can turn to me for the little thingsand for the big ones can you handle that much i can try she wanted to believe it was the medication finally kicking in that was making the pain slide away but a part of her the part shed long considered foolish thought it was the sea and the cliffs and him byron i didnt mean to hurt you i hate hurting people i care about its the worst thing for me i know he pressed his thumbs to the base of her neck searching out stubborn knots of tension and smiled when she leaned back against him when i saw you in the police station i was embarrassed i know that too well its nice to be so transparent i know where to look in you it seems to be some kind of innate skill its one of the reasons i think i may be in love with you he felt the tension leap back into her muscles relax he suggested we may both learn to live with it my life is to put it mildly in upheaval she stared straight ahead to the horizon the sky always met the sea she mused no matter how distant but people didnt always couldnt always find that joining point i also know my own limitations she continued im not ready for that kind of leap im not sure i am myself but if i take it im pulling you with me he came around the rock to sit beside her im very good at handling complications kate ill handle you when she opened her mouth he pressed his fingers to it no you dont youll tense up again youre just going to say you wont be handled then ill have to say something about how if you let someone take part of the control now and again you wouldnt have so many headaches then wed just go around until one of us gets pissed off again she frowned at him i dont like the way you fight it always drove my sisters crazy suellen used to say i used logic like a left jab youve got a sister named suellen he raised an eyebrow from gone with the wind my mother chose all our names from literature got a problem with that no she plucked at a speck of lint on her skirt it just sounds so southern he chuckled wondering if she realized she made the south sound like another planet honey we are southern suellen charlotte as in bronte meg from little women and byron as in lord exactly you dont have the poetic pallor or the clubfoot but you do sort of have the dreamy good looks flattery he kissed her lightly in response i guess youre feeling better i guess i am so he draped an arm over her shoulders how was your day with a weak laugh she turned her face nuzzled it against the curve of his neck it sucked it really really sucked want to talk about it maybe it wasnt really so hard to lean against a strong shoulder she decided if she just concentrated i should call laura i told her i would josh will tell her youre with me she wont worry shell worry whether i call or not laura worries about everyone kate let the silence soothe a moment then began with kusacks appearance at the shop byron didnt interrupt but listened assessed and considered i dont think he believed me the way he kept watching me with this kind of cat patience you know when he mentioned my father my brain just froze up i knew i should have been prepared for it right from the start of this i knew that would be the worst and i should have been prepared but i wasnt it hurt you byron murmured more than any of the rest yes she reached back gripped his hand baffled and relieved that he would understand so easily it hurt that this stranger this cop should damage the man im trying to remember the one who used to spin ridiculous dreams for me who im trying to believe only wanted the best for me and i cant defend him byron because what he did is against everything i believe in that doesnt mean you didnt love your father and arent entitled to remember the best parts of him im working on that she murmured the problem is i have to stay focused on whats happening now its harder than i imagined when kusack brought out the forms i couldnt explain why they both had my signature but josh seemed to think it went well especially that business with the security code electronic thievery rolled in right along with the microchip you said the siphoning off started about a year and a half ago whos had access to your computer during that time period dozens of people isnt that why its all so hopeless she thought theres not a big turnover at bittle its a good firm so who needs money whos smart and who would point the finger at you who doesnt need money she countered irritated because her mind was refusing to travel a logical path bittle hires smart and i dont know anyone in the firm who has it in for me personally maybe it wasnt personal so much as convenient a cautious amount of money he murmured like a testor a way to offset small annoying debts and the timing kate havent you considered the timing i cant follow you why now why you is it just a coincidence that you should find out about your father at essentially the same time this skimming was noticed what else could it be maybe someone else found out and used it i didnt tell anyone what did you do the day you found out what did you do i sat there at my desk reeling i didnt want to believe it so i checked he would have banked on it how i accessed the library back in new hampshire ordered faxes of newspaper articles contacted the lawyer who handled the details i hired a detective he considered every one of those steps generated data phone records computer records paper trail and noted the data in your filofax well yes the names and phone numbers but and the transmissions to and from new hampshire were on your computer i she began to see began to feel ill all over again yes the records of faxes sent and received if someone wanted to look but still theyd have to have my password and which is noted in your filofax he finished who would be the last person questioned coming out of your office if you werent mere any one of the partners i suppose one of the executive assistants she shrugged unsurprised to find that her shoulders were tightening up again hell any of the other accountants on that floor no one would think twice about seeing an associate breeze out of another associates office then well concentrate on those the third bittle you talked about who is it marty marty wouldnt embezzle from his own company thats ludicrous well see meanwhile how do you think hed react if you asked him to get you copies of the forms in question i dont know why dont we find out an hour later kate hung up the phone in byrons kitchen i should have known hed come through hell make copies as soon as hes able to and bring them to you at the hotel she worked up a smile its like a little intrigue im surprised he didnt ask for passwords hes actually enjoying it our man on the inside i should have thought of this angle right from the beginning now i can add feeling stupid to the rest of it emotions tend to cloud logic he told her otherwise i might have hit on it earlier myself well she wasnt sure she was ready to deal with that line of thought just now anyway marty told me that they decided to turn it over to the police after my showdown the other day his fathers not happy about it but the vote carried do you regret facing up to them no but theres going to be gossip now plenty of it trying to keep it light she smiled at him how do you feel about having an alleged embezzler of dubious lineage for a lover i think that requires a test he gathered her close skimming his hands up her back and into her hair in the way shed come to anticipate her mouth lifted to his opened for his i guess this means youre not going back to work this afternoon good guess his mouth stayed busy as he circled her out of the kitchen where are we going havent i already mentioned all this floor you have around here he chuckled against her throat i havent shown you my new sofa oh she let him ease her back on the generous cushions its very nice she murmured as his weight pressed her deeper into them long his fingers parted her blouse exposing her as she arched to his touch soft we so rarely make it to the bedroom he lowered his head nipped lightly at her breasts i wanted something accommodating on the main level very considerate of you she gasped when his mouth closed over her sucked her in it was so easy to let the heat take her to spin her mind away to follow the demands of her own body for pleasure for sensation for tastes and textures she tugged his tie loose when his mouth sought hers again loosened the buttons that prevented flesh from meeting flesh but he wouldnt let her hurry and her impatience drained away until she was steeped and savoring strong broad shoulders hair glorious gold at the tips the subtle creases in his cheeks that long rippled torso she luxuriated in the feel of those smooth hands gliding over her lingering here pressing there then skillfully bringing her to a long shimmering orgasm that poured through her system like warmed wine he thought it stunning to watch her the flickers of pleasure and tension and release that played over her face arousal had blood rising to her cheeks caused her eyes to darken and glow like rich aged brandy the body beneath his arched and flowed quivered and grew erotically damp the taste of soap and salt between her breasts enchanted him the feel of those narrow restless hands enjoying his own flesh delighted him darkly the need to be in her to join body to body and bury himself deep was overpowering he filled her shuddering when those exotically female muscles clutched around him yet it wasnt enough he pulled her up until her arms were wrapped around his neck her legs around his waist with his mouth he swallowed each of the moans that trembled from her throat then raced his lips over that long white column where a pulse beat like fury she panted out his name blinded by the single primal urge to reach the summit her hips pumped jackhammer quick as the craving grew maddening the pleasure unbearable she was willing to beg if only the words would come but instead she sank her teeth into his shoulder it flashed through her like an overstoked furnace hot and violent stunned and helpless she clung then felt the magic pulse between them as he poured himself into her the phone awakened her an hour later disoriented kate fumbled for the receiver before she remembered she wasnt home yes hello oh im sorry i must have the wrong number im calling byron de witts residence dazed kate stared around the room the antique oak chest of drawers the warm green walls and white curtains the clever watercolor seascapes a thriving ornamental lemon tree in a glazed pot in front of the window and the lulling ceaseless sound of the sea byrons bedroom ah she sat up rubbing a hand over her face cool ivory sheets slipped down to her waist this is mr de witts residence oh i didnt realize hed gotten a housekeeper already i expect hes at work i was just going to leave a message on the machine for him tell him lottie called wont you honey he can reach me anytime this evening hes got the number bye now before kate was fully awake she was staring at the receiver and listening to the rude buzz of a dial tone housekeeper lottie hes got the number well fuck she slammed down the phone and scrambled up the scent of him was still on her skin and he was getting calls from some bimbo named lottie typical she decided and looked around for her clothes which were she recalled downstairs where hed left them when he carried her up to bed ordered her to take a nap and shed been so softened by lovemaking that she meekly obeyed hadnt she told herself from the start that men like him were all the same the betterlooking they were the more charming they were the bigger scum they were men who looked like byron had women crawling all over them every day of the week and hed said he thought he loved her what a crock energized with righteous fury she marched downstairs and snatched up her clothes scum swine slime ignoring her hose she struggled into skirt and blouse fumbling with her buttons as he came through the deck door with the dogs at his heels thought youd still be sleeping she eyed him narrowly i bet you did i took the dogs for a run on the beach we should go down later the storms brought some nice shells in he walked into the kitchen as he spoke swaggering like a gunslinger she followed want a beer he twisted the cap off one guzzled as he lowered the bottle he caught the glint of steel in her eyes problem problem no no problem at all before she could stop herself shed bunched up her fist and plowed it into his belly it was like hitting rock be sure when you see lottie you tell her im not your goddamn housekeeper he rubbed his belly more in surprise than discomfort huh oh brilliant you always have such a sharp riposte de witt how dare you how dare you say the things you said to me do the things you did and have some some tramp named lottie on the side it wasnt quite clear but he thought he was starting to catch up lottie called he ventured she made the same sound in her throat that hed heard once or twice before as much for her sake as his own he held up a hand and backed off youre going to hurt yourself if you hit me again her gaze shifted lingered on the kitchen block filled with blackhandled knives he didnt believe it not for an instant but he stepped between her and the sharp implements now im going to guess that the phone woke you up and it was lottie and lottie by the way is not a tramp i say she is and either way youre still a lying twotiming scum how long did you expect to get away with telling her i was your housekeeper and just what were you going to tell me she was he studied his beer for a moment tried to keep the gleam out of his eyes when they met hers my sister oh very original im out of here not so fast it wasnt much of a challenge to grab her onearmed around the waist and haul her to a chair she was kicking swinging but he managed it easily lottie he said as he shoved her in place again is my sister you dont have a sister named lottie she fired back you idiot you told me your sisters names just a few hours ago suellen meg and charlotte he finished and didnt bother to conceal the smugness lottie shes a pediatrician married three kids and she has just the kind of warped sense of humor that might make her appreciate having my lover call her a tramp he watched the embarrassed blush stain kates cheek want that beer now no voice strained pride forfeited she got to her feet i apologize i dont normally jump to conclusions its been a difficult and emotional day uhhuh damn him i was asleep when she called and she never gave me a chance to say anything thats lottie and i just assumed i was asleep she said furious disoriented i was jealous he finished and backed her up against the refrigerator thats okay i like itto a point i dont like it to any point im sorry i hit you youre going to have to work on those arms if you want to have any impact he put a hand under her chin to lift it you wouldnt have gone for the knives would you of course not she slanted her gaze toward them shrugged probably not he let his hand drop took another swig of beer honey you terrify me im sorry really theres no excuse for behaving that way it was kneejerk she pressed her hands together confession always hurt i was involved with someone a couple of years ago i dont get involved easily and he wasnt what you could term the faithful type did you love him no but i trusted him he nodded set the beer aside and trust is more fragile than love he cupped her face in his hands you can trust me kate he pressed his lips to her brow then eased back with a grin on his face i would never risk having you slice off any important appendages with a chefs knife feeling both soothed and foolish she settled into his arms i would never have used it her lips curved against his probably chapter fifteen this is so incredibly dumb naked kate fidgeted and blew the bangs out of her eyes i feel like an idiot leave your hair alone margo ordered i worked too hard on it to have you screw it up and stop gnawing on your lip i hate wearing lipstick why wont you let me see my face kate craned her neck but margo had draped the mirror in the wardrobe room i look like a clown dont i you made me look like a clown actually its more like a twentydollar hooker but its such a nice look for you hold still damn it so i can get you into this thing suffering mightily kate lifted her arms as margo hooked her into what seemed to be some instrument of medieval torture why are you doing this to me margo i cut the check for your dippy string trio didnt i i went along with the truffleseven though theyre snuffed out by pigs and hideously expensive her face set like a general leading troops into battle margo adjusted the bustier you agreed to follow my guidance for your image tonight the annual reception and charity auction is pretenses most important event now stop bitching stop playing with my tits oh but i love them so there margo stepped back then nodded in satisfaction i didnt have much to work with but keep it up miss d cup kate grumbled then looked down and goggled jesus where did they come from amazing isnt it in the right harness those puppies just rise i have breasts stunned kate patted the swell rising above black satin and lace and cleavage its all a matter of proper positioning and making the most of what we have even when its next to nothing shut up grinning kate slicked her hands down her torso look ma im a girl you aint seen nothing yet put this on margo tossed her a thin swatch of stretchy lace kate studied the garter belt tugged it snorted youre kidding im not putting it on for you margo patted the bulge under her sparkling silver tunic at seven months and counting bending over isnt as easy as it used to be i feel like im in dress rehearsal for a porn flick but after a struggle kate snapped the garter belt into place its a little hard to breathe hose margo ordered youd better sit down to put them on with her hands on her hips margo supervised the production not so fast youll snag those arent your industrialstrength panty hose brows beetled kate flicked up a glance do you have to watch me yes wheres laura margo wondered and began to pace she should be here and if the musicians dont show up in the next ten minutes they wont have time to set up before the guests start to arrive everythingll be fine stalling kate smoothed her hose up her legs you know margo i really do think it would be best if i kept sort of a low profile tonight with this cloud over my head it makes things awkward chicken kates head shot up i am not a chicken im a scandal and last year i was the scandal margo shrugged her shoulders maybe we can work something out so that laura can fill the role next year its not funny nobody understands that better than i do margo laid a hand on kates flushed cheek nobody understands how scared you are right now better than i do i guess not comforted kate turned her face to margos palm its just that its dragging on for so long i keep expecting that kusack character to show up and cart me off in chains its not enough that they cant prove i did it if i cant prove i didnt im not going to say youll get through it thats not enough either but no one who knows you believes it and didnt you say byron had some sort of angle to work on he didnt really explain she moved her shoulder tugged at the elastic strap on the lacy belt just mumbled the equivalent of me not worrying my pretty head over it i really hate that men like to play white knight kate it doesnt hurt to let them do that now and again its been weeks since marty got the copies to us ive gone over them all line by line but she trailed off well weve all been pretty busy and i havent been jolted out of sleep by the sound of bullhorns telling me theyve got me surrounded dont worry when that happens we wont let them take you alive if they raid the shop tonight well have byron help you escape in one of his macho cars if he makes it at all he had to fly down to la this morning i thought i told you hell be back in time he couldnt say for sure and kate refused to pout over it it doesnt matter youre crazy about him i am not we have a very mature mutually satisfying relationship distracted she tugged on the strap again how do these silly things work god let me huffing margo knelt down and demonstrated how to hook the hose i beg your pardon laura paused at the doorway stuck her tongue in her cheek i seem to be de trop perhaps theres something you two would like to share with me another comedienne kate looked down at the top of margos head and giggled christ now heres a scandal pregnant former sex symbol and suspected embezzler celebrate their alternative lifestyle could i just go get my camera laura asked done margo proclaimed then held up a hand stop snickering laura and help me up sorry as she hauled margo to her feet lauras gaze fell on kate her friend was sitting in an elegant queen anne chair wearing a black bustier with matching lacy garter belt and sheer black stockings why kate you look so different i have tits she stated and rose margo gave them to me what are friends for you might want to finish dressing unless thats your outfit for this evening the musicians pulled up behind me terrific laura its the offtheshoulder floorlength bronze margo gestured vaguely as she started into the main showroom ill be back why does she think i need to be dressed ive been dressing myself for several years now let her fuss laura took down the gown margo had cho sen it helps keep her from being nervous about tonight and laura pursed her lips as she studied the dress shes got a hell of an eye this is going to look great on you i hate all this sighing lustily kate stepped into the gown i mean its okay for her she loves it and youyoud look elegant in tinfoil id never be able to wear what youve got on what is that anyway ancient laura said dismissing her smartly tailored coppertoned evening suit im getting one last wear out of it before i put it into stock there all hooked in stand back let me see i dont look stupid do i my arms arent bad now i mean my biceps are sort of happening ive been working on the delts too bony shoulders arent very attractive you look beautiful i dont really care but i dont like looking stupid okay were right on schedule margo announced as she hurried back in with one hand she supported her belly and tried to ignore the fact that the baby seemed determined to settle directly on her bladder she tilted her head took a long narrowedeyed study of her creation and nodded good really good now a few finishing touches oh listen oh mommy do i have to wear that exquisite jeweled collar margo whined as she lifted it from the box oh please not those gorgeous earrings too kate rolled her eyes as margo decorated her can you imagine what shes going to do to that kid the minute it pops out shes going to have it swaddled in armani and accessorized ungrateful brat margo took a purse atomizer out of her pocket and spritzed before kate could evade you know i hate that why else would i do it turn around anddrum roll please with a flourish margo tugged the draping off the mirror holy shit her mouth agape kate stared at the reflection there was enough of kate to recognize she thought dazed but where had those exotic eyes come from and that unquestionably erotic mouth the figure an actual figure draped in shimmering bronze that made all that exposed skin seem polished she cleared her throat turned turned again i look good she managed a grilled cheese sandwich looks good margo corrected baby you look dangerous i kind of do kate grinned and watched that sirens mouth move smugly damn i hope byron gets here wait till he gets a load of me he was doing his best to get there the trip to la had been inconvenient but necessary under normal circumstances he would have arranged to make a full swing of it spotchecking the hotels and resorts in santa barbara san diego san francisco it was important he knew for the staff at every templeton hotel to feel that personal connection with the home base josh handled the factories the vineyards and orchards the plants and continued to spotcheck the international branches but california was byrons responsibility he never took responsibility lightly and there were still ruffled feathers to be smoothed from peter ridgeways reign which by all accounts had been as cold as it had been efficient he knew what was expected of himthe personal touch that templeton was founded and thrived on the memory for names and faces and details even as he jetted back byron dictated a raft of memos to his assistant fired off countless faxes and completed one final meeting via air phone now he was home and late but hed anticipated that with the finesse of long habit he quickly fastened the studs on his tuxedo shirt maybe he should call kate at the shop and tell her he was on his way a glance at his watch told him the reception was into its second hour shed be busy would she miss him he wanted her to he wanted to imagine her looking toward the door whenever it opened and hoping he wanted her to be thinking of him wishing he were there so they could share some comment or observation about the other guests the way couples always did he looked forward to seeing that speculation in her eyes when she studied him that look of hers that so clearly said what are you doing here de witt whats going on between us and why she would continually march along looking for the practical answer the rational one and he would cruise on the emotional it made he decided as he adjusted his black tie for a good mix he was willing to wait for her to come to the same conclusion at least for a little while she needed to resolve this crisis put the whole ugly business behind her he intended to help her and he could wait for that before looking toward the future when the phone beside the bed rang he considered letting the machine take it family or work he supposed and either of those could do without him for a couple of hours then again suellen was expecting her first grandchild and hell he snapped up the phone de witt he listened questioned verified and with a grim smile on his face hung up it appeared he had a stop to make before the party kusack was still at his desk it was his wifes bridge night and her turn to host the evening he preferred the sloppy meatball sandwich and lukewarm cream soda at his desk to the tiny lady treats being served at chez kusack he definitely preferred the smell of stale coffee the headachy ringing of phones and the incessant bickering and complaining of his colleagues to the cloying perfumes the giggles and gossip of the ladies bridge club there was always paperwork to see to though it would have earned him sneers to admit it he enjoyed paperwork and plowed through it like a st bernard through a blizzard slow and steady he liked the tangibility of it even the foolish convoluted policespeak so necessary to any official report hed made the adjustment to computers more smoothly than many cops his age to kusack a keyboard was a keyboard and he had used what he called the bible method of typingseek and ye shall findall of his professional life it never failed him he was tapping on keys grinning to himself as the letters popped onto his screen when a man in a tuxedo interrupted him detective kusack yeah kusack sat back skimmed his cops eyes over the suit no rental job he deduced tailormade and very pricey it aint prom night and youre too old anyhow what can i do for you im byron de witt im here regarding katherine powell kusack grunted picked up his can of soda i thought her lawyers name was templeton im not her lawyer im her friend uhhuh well friend i cant discuss ms powells business with anybody who walks in here no matter how nice they dress kate didnt mention how gracious you were may i make yourself at home kusack said sourly he wanted the monotony of his paperwork not chitchat with prince charming underpaid public servants are always at your disposal it wont take long i have new evidence that i believe weighs in ms powells favor are you interested kusack or shall i wait until you finish your dinner kusack ran his tongue around his teeth and eyed the second half of his meatball sub information is always welcome mr de witt and im here to serve at least until the bridge club clears out what is it you think you have i obtained copies of the documents in question did you kusacks bland eyes narrowed did you really and how did you do that without breaking any laws detective once the copies were in my possession i did what it seems to me in my muddled civilian capacity should have been done at the outset i sent them to a handwriting expert leaning back kusack picked up what remained of his dinner used his free hand to motion byron to continue i just received my experts report via phone i had him fax it to me byron took the sheet out of his inside pocket unfolded it and laid it on kusacks desk fitzgerald kusack said with his mouth full good man considered tops in his field so josh had said byron thought hes been used for over a decade by both prosecutors and defense attorneys mostly for the defenserich defense said kusack he caught the whiff of templeton influence costs a goddamn fortune and has a very full schedule byron thought hence the delay in the report whatever his fee detective his reputation is unimpeachable if you care to read his report youll see dont have to i know what it says it was small of him kusack supposed but it gave him a little lift to tweak a man who didnt appear to have an ounce of extra fat on his body and who could wear a monkey suit and not look like a fool byron folded his hands patience was and always had been his best weapon then youve been in contact with mr fitzgerald on this matter nope kusack dug out a napkin wiped his mouth got our own handwriting analysts got their final take in a couple weeks ago politely he stifled a belch the signatures on the altered forms are an exact match too exact he added before byron could snarl nobody writes their name the exact and precise same way every time all the doctored forms have the same precise signature stroke for stroke loop for loop copies likely tracings of ms powells signature on the one if you know that why are you sitting here this is hell for her yeah i figured that trouble is i gotta cross all my ts dot all my is thats the way things work around here weve got a few lines of inquiry going here that may be detective but ms powell has a right to know the status of your investigation as it happens mr de witt im finishing up my report on the progress of this investigation right now ill see mr bittle first thing in the morning and continue my investigation you certainly dont believe kate copied her own signature you know i believe shes smart enough to have done something just that clever he balled up the napkin and twopointed it into an overflowing wastebasket but i dont think shes stupid enough or greedy enough to have risked her job and her freedom for a piddly seventyfive large he rolled his shoulders which had grown stiff after hours at his desk i dont believe shed have risked it for any amount of money then you believe shes innocent i know shes innocent kusack sighed a little and adjusted his girth look de witt ive been doing this job a long time i know how to look into peoples backgrounds their habits their weaknesses my take is that ms powells weakness if you want to call it that was making a big splash at bittle now why is she going to jeopardize something she wants that much for a little playingaround money she doesnt gamble she doesnt do drugs doesnt sleep with the boss if she needs flash shes got the templeton pool to play in but she doesnt she puts in sixtyhour weeks at bittle and builds up her client list that tells me shes hardworking and ambitious you might have indicated to her that you believed her its not my job to soothe anxious souls and ive got my reasons for keeping her on the hot seat hard evidence is what makes or breaks a case in the real world and gathering hard evidence takes time now i appreciate you coming by with this he handed byron the experts report if it helps you can tell ms powell that the department has no plans to charge her with anything thats not enough byron said as he rose its a start ive got seventyfive thousand to track down mr de witt then well finish it it seemed he would have to be satisfied with that byron slipped the report back in his pocket then eyed kusack you never believed she was guilty i go into an investigation with an open mind maybe she did it maybe she didnt after i took her statement i knew she didnt its the nose byron smiled curiously she didnt smell guilty laughing kusack stood stretched theres that you could say ive got a nose for guilt i meant her nose im sorry byron shook his head youve lost me anybody who dives headfirst into third and busts their nose to stretch a double has guts and style somebody who wants to win that bad doesnt steal stealings too easy and this kind of stealings too ordinary sliding into third byron murmured grinning foolishly so thats how she did it i never asked her because kusack was grinning back byron offered a hand thanks for your time detective the crowd was thinning out by the time byron arrived at pretenses three hours late he thought with a wince the auction was obviously over and only those lingering over their drinks or conversations were left the fragrance of night jasmine blooming on the veranda mixed with the scents of perfume and wine he spotted margo first flirting with her husband even as he hurried toward her he was scanning for kate margo im sorry im so late you should be she touched pouty lips to his you completely missed the bidding now youll have to come in next week and buy something very very expensive its the least i can do still you look successful when you bother to look at me she thought smothering a grin at the way he kept searching the room we raised just over fifteen thousand for wednesdays child nothing makes me happier than raising money to help handicapped children josh wrapped his arms around her from the back placed their joint hands protectively over her belly it rippled under them thrillingly shes trying not to look too gleeful over the number of requests to hold merchandise its a charity event she said primly then laughed and boy are we going to clean up next week in fact kates in the office logging in all the holds ill go let her know im here actually i he broke off torn josh was her lawyer after all no i have to tell her first dont go anywhere he started across the room just as kate swung through the office door there you are she beamed at him i thought you must have gotten stuck in la you didnt have to she stopped because he was staring at her as if hed had a lobotomy on the trip home what is it he managed to close his mouth get his lungs working again okay who are you and what have you done with katherine powell boy a guy doesnt see you for a few hours andoh her face lit up and she tried a sophisticated turn i forgot margo did it what do you think he turned first to margo god bless you he said fervently then took kates hand what do i think i think my heart stopped he kissed her fingers then wanting more her mouth wow a little surprised by the dizzying depth of the kiss she took a cautious step back look what a little goop on the face and a pushup bra gets you his gaze shifted down is that whats under there youre not going to believe whats under here how long is it going to take for me to find out amused by his reaction she toyed with his tie well big guy if you play your cards right we can damn he grabbed her hands its amazing how a sexy woman can shut a mans mind down i have news for you fine if youd rather discuss current events than my underwear dont distract me ive just come from seeing detective kusack its why im so late you went to see him the excited flush drained out of her cheeks he called you in im sorry byron theres no reason for you to be involved no he gave her a little shake be quiet i went to see him because i finally got the report ive been waiting for i had the documents marty bittle gave me sent to a handwriting expert that josh recommended handwriting expert but you never told me josh never said anything before her eyes could heat he hurried on we wanted to wait until we had some results and now we do they were forgeries kate copies of your signature copies her hands began to tremble in his he can prove it hes one of the most respected people in his field in the country but we didnt need him kusack had already verified the signatures he knows theyre forgeries he doesnt consider you a suspect kate apparently he never really did he believed me he got his experts report shortly before i got mine hes going to take the information and his progress report to bittle in the morning icant take it in thats all right he pressed his lips to her brow take your time you believed me she said shakily from the first day on the cliffs you didnt even know me but you believed me yes i did he kissed her again and smiled it must be that nose whose nose ill explain later come on we have to fill josh in okay byron she squeezed his arm you went to see kusack before you came here was that what youd call a white knight sort of thing sounds like a trick question he thought it could be construed in that manner i thought so listen i wouldnt want you to make it a habit but thanks grateful and touched she pressed her lips to his thank you very much youre welcome because he didnt want her eyes swimming but laughing he traced a fingertip over her beautifully bared shoulder does that mean i get to see your underwear chapter sixteen kate had a longstanding concept of what sunday mornings were for they were for sleep throughout college she had used them for extra study time or to finish up papers and projects but once she entered the real world she designated that time for indulgence byron had a different agenda youve got to resist both ways he told her mentally isolate the muscle youre working on right here he pressed his fingers to her triceps as she lifted and lowered the fivepound weight over her head behind her back dont flop your arm he ordered youre pulling it up and pushing it down through mud mud right she tried to envision a pool of thick oozing mud instead of a nice soft bed with cool sheets and why am i doing this because its good for you good for me she muttered and watched herself in the mirror she had thought she would feel ridiculous in the little sports bra and snug bike pants but it wasnt really so bad besides she got to look at him too a wellbuilt man in a tank top and sweat shorts wasnt hard on the eyes at all now stretch dont forget the stretch go to the set of concentration curls remember yeah yeah yeah she sat on the bench frowned at the weight she lifted and lowered and tried to imagine her biceps growing goodbye onehundredandtwopound weakling she thought hello buff and when were finished here youre going to make french toast right that was the deal ive got me a personal trainer and a chef she flashed him a smile pretty cool youre a lucky woman katherine other arm now concentrate he moved her through flys and dead lifts hammer lifts and extensions though hed completed his sunday routine before hauling her out of bed theyd both worked up a nice sweat by the time he proclaimed her finished so im going to be buff huh he grinned rubbing her shoulders massaging his way down her arms sure you are kid well put you in one of those little bikinis oil you up and shoot you into competition in your dreams not my dreams he said sincerely believe me ive discovered this latent desire for skinny women in fact its starting to stir right now is that so she didnt object when his hands moved around her back and down to cup her bottom im afraid it is hmm his fingers roamed clutched this reminds me tomorrow we work on the lower body i hate those squats thats because you dont have my vantage point his gaze shifted to the mirror behind her and he watched his hands take possession watched her move against him saw her shiver when he lowered his mouth to that wonderful curve of neck and shoulder it was almost ridiculous the way he wanted her the way the need would rise up time after time again and again like breathing he thought nibbling his way up to her ear like life i think we should finish off your morning routine with a little aerobics she managed a sound between a groan and a sigh not the nordictrack byron im begging you i had something else in mind his busy mouth skimmed over her cheek i think youll like it oh she got the idea when his hand moved up to palm her breast you did say that for overall training aerobics is essential just put yourself in my hands i was hoping youd say that she gave so easily he thought so eagerly the way her mouth moved on his the mating of tongues the press of bodies all of his old fantasies about the woman of his dreams had faded and shifted and reemerged as her only her an image of her flickered into his mind the way shed looked the night before in that slim shoulderbaring dress all that smooth skin those surprising curves that wide wet mouth and beneath the dress had been a wanton fantasy of black lace the sight of her had been staggering and so unexpected so impractical for his practical kate it was a side of her he had loved exploring knowing she had been exploring it as well had been brutally erotic she was just as appealing to him now in damp workout gear that he could hastily peel off both of them were naked to the waist when they tumbled to the mat she laughed rolling with him as they tugged at those last barriers it was wonderful wasnt it to feel so unbound so completely liberated shed stopped questioning how it was he knew just where just how to touch her as if hed always known and his body was so strong so hard it was like making love with a dream rolling on top of him she poured the sheer joy of it into a kiss yes touch me she thought and taste here and here let me again always again she thought as her heart pounded and her blood swam over and over moment to moment he could fill her with so many clashing sensations the wave of heat the chill of anticipation a shiver of greed the warmth of giving she wanted to hold him forever to steep herself in him lose herself and so she took him inside here trembling to a gasp at that bright instant of joining she arched back savoring tormenting herself with the power groaning at the texture of his hands that slicked up her to torture her aching breasts she held them there her tensed fingers gripping as she began to move it staggered him the look of her the dark cap of hair framed her glowing face breath heaved and hitched through her parted lips that long swans neck was bowed back the does eyes closed sunlight poured in over her so bright so full they might have been outdoors in some verdant meadow he could see her there a hotblooded titania lusty and sleek he wanted her to feed herself feed herself to satiation but she increased her rhythm driving him with her her moans and cries swarmed into his blood until they were thrust for desperate thrust he exploded beneath her into her with one long glorying sigh she slid down and crushed her mouth to his she sang in the shower this was unusual even when she was alone kate was well aware that she did not have a voice like a bell as they lathered and soaped he joined in for a miserably offkey if heartfelt version of proud mary ike and tina had nothing on us she decided as she toweled her hair not a thing except maybe talent byron wrapped a towel around his hips rubbed his face and prepared to shave youre the first woman ive showered with who sings as badly as i do she straightened watched him lather up oh really just how many women might that be the mind boggles he grinned at her enjoying the laser gleam in her eyes and a true gentleman never keeps score she watched him swipe the razor through lather leaving a smooth clean path it occurred to her shed never actually watched a man shave before unless she included josh and a brother didnt count but she refused to be distracted by the interesting male ritual instead she smiled sweetly and looked over his shoulder into the foggy mirror why dont you let me do that for you darling he lifted an eyebrow do i look stupid enough to put a sharp instrument in your hands he rinsed the blade i dont think so coward you betcha she snorted nipped his shoulder with her teeth then headed toward the bedroom to dress kate he waited until shed turned aimed that smug look in his direction theres only one woman now he watched her quick almost shy smile spread before she slipped out the door thoughtfully byron stroked off lather and stubble the room was full of mist and heat and their mixed scents shed hung her towel neatly and efficiently to dry the little jar she used to moisturize her face sat on the counter shed forgotten to use it she hadnt forgotten to put her workout clothes in the hamper or to replace the cap on the toothpaste no she would never overlook any practical detail it was the extras she forgot particularly when they applied to herself she wouldnt let herself browse through a shop dreaming and buy something foolish for herself she wouldnt forget to turn off the lights or to give a faucet an extra twist to prevent a drip her bills would always be paid on time but stopping to eat lunch would slip her mind when it was crowded with other details she didnt have a clue that she needed him byron smiled as he lowered his head to rinse off the excess lather nor did she know what hed just discovered he no longer thought he might be falling in love with her he knew that she with all her contrasts and complexities her strengths and weaknesses was the only woman he would ever love he dried his face slapped on aftershave and decided this might be the perfect time to tell her he stepped into the bedroom she was standing beside the bed in black leggings and an old yankees sweatshirt see this she demanded shaking a mangled rawhide bone at him yes i do it was in my shoe how my shoe escaped the same treatment im not sure she tossed the bone to byron then scooped her hands through her hair to check for dryness it was nip that i am sure of tuck has much better manners last week it was that fish head he found on the beach he has to be disciplined byron hes very unruly now kate is that any way to talk about our child she sighed put her hands on her hips and waited ill talk to him but im sure if you considered the psychology of it youd agree that he puts things in your shoe as a token of his great affection and that includes the time he peed in it well im sure that was just a mistake he rubbed a hand over his mouth too wise to let the grin show and it was outside you took them off to walk on the beach and youre not buying it i dont think youd find it so amusing if he was using your shoes for his depository as if on cue there came the sound of frantic barking of growing canine bodies thudding ill deal with them kate stated youre too soft yeah and who bought them collars with their names on them he muttered what nothing retreating byron opened his drawer for underwear ill be down in a minute to make french toast she reminded him and rushed down to quiet the dogs okay guys kill the racket keep it up and theres not going to be any walk on the beach and nobodys going to play sock with either of you they rushed up and bumped against her two alarmingly growing masses of fur and feet even as she started to ruffle them they raced toward the front door and set up a fresh din you know you go out the back way she began then the idiotic door chimes sounded it seemed byron had decided they were whimsical and had kept them oh ridiculously pleased she beamed at the dogs pretty cool guys you were sounding the alarm listen if its anybody selling anything i want you to do this look lookbare your teeth she demonstrated but they only thumped each other with their wagging tails and offered canine grins well work on it she decided and opened the door her bright mood plummeted mr bittle automatically she grabbed collars to prevent the dogs from leaping joyfully on the new humans detective im sorry to disturb you on sunday kate bittle eyed the dogs warily detective kusack indicated that he intended to speak with you today and i asked to come along your lawyer said i would find you here kusack put in youre free to call him of course if you want him here i thoughti was told i was no longer a suspect im here to apologize bittle kept his solemn eyes on hers may we come in yes of course nip tuck no jumping nice dogs kusack held out a beefy hand and it was duly sniffed and licked got me an old heinz hound shes getting up in years now please sit down ill just put them out that task gave her time to compose herself when the dogs were racing maniacally over the yard she turned back would you like some coffee theres no need for you to trouble bittle began but kusack leaned back in the ancient recliner and said if youre making it anyway ill make it byron volunteered as he came down the stairs oh byron relief rippled through her you know detective kusack detective mr de witt and this is lawrence bittle of bittle and associates byron said coolly how do you do ill say ive done better bittle accepted the formal handshake tommys mentioned you we had an early round of golf this morning ill put the coffee on he sent a look to kusack that said as clearly as words that anything of import would wait until he came back nice place here kusack said casually kate stood where she was twisting her fingers together its coming along byron takes his time he just settled on it a couple of months ago hes ah having some things sent out from atlanta thats where hes from atlanta stop babbling kate she ordered herself couldnt and hes looking for things out here furniture and things hell of a spot kusack settled into the recliner thinking it was a chair that knew how to welcome a man house just down the road has a putting green right on the front lawn he shook his head guy can walk right out his front door and sink a few used to drive the kids down here they got a kick out of the seals yes theyre wonderful gnawing her lip she glanced toward the kitchen sometimes you can hear them barking detective kusack are you here to question me ive got some questions he sniffed the air nothing like the smell of coffee brewing is there even the poison down at the station house smells like heaven before you taste it why dont you sit down ms powell ill tell you again you can lawyer yourself up but youre not going to need mr templeton for what we have to talk about all right but shed reserve judgment on calling josh she was not going to be lulled by small talk and paternal smiles what do you want mr de witt snowed you the report from his handwriting expert yes last night she sat on the arm of the couch it was the best she could do it said the signatures were copies someone duplicated my signature on the altered forms used my signature my clients my reputation she rose again when byron came in with a tray im sorry she said quickly for the trouble here dont be ridiculous he slid easily into the wellmannered host how do you take your coffee mr bittle just cream thank you detective the way it comes out of the pot he sampled the brew byron offered him now were talking coffee i was about to go over the progress of the investigation with ms powell im explaining that our conclusions jibe with those of your independent expert at this point indications are that she was set up to take the heat if the discrepancies were discovered were looking into other areas you mean other people kate said struggling not to clatter her cup in her saucer im saying my investigation is moving along id like to ask you if you have any idea who would focus on you as a scapegoat there are a lot of accounts in the firm only those under your hand were touched if someone did this to damage me i dont have a clue maybe you were just convenient the charges against your father made you prime maybe gave someone an idea no one knew i only found out myself shortly before the suspension interesting and how did you find out absently she rubbed a finger over her temple as she explained you have words with anybody a tiff a personality clash maybe i didnt have a fight with anyone not everyone at the firm is a close friend and confidant but we work well together no grudge matches petty grievances nothing out of the ordinary she set her coffee aside nearly untasted nancy in billing and i squared off over a misplaced invoice during the april crunch tempers are high then i think i snapped at bill feinstein for taking half my computer paper instead of going into stock himself she smiled a little he stuck three cases of it in my office to get back at me for that ms newman doesnt like me but she doesnt like anyone but mr bittle senior bittle stared into his coffee ms newman is efficient and a bit territorial he winced as kusack busily made notes shes worked for me for twenty years i didnt mean she would do something like this horrified kate sprang up i didnt mean that at all i wouldnt accuse anyone you might as well say amanda devin did it she guards her lone female partner status like a hawk watching for vultures oror mike lloyd in the mail room because he cant afford to go to college full time or stu cominsky because i wouldnt go out with him roger thornhill because i did lloyd and cominsky and thornhill kusack muttered as he wrote and kate stopped her pacing you write whatever you want to write in that little book of yours but im not going to go around casting blame she lifted her chin set it i know how it feels ms powell watching her kusack tapped his stubby pencil against his knee this is a police investigation youre involved every member of your former firm is going to be considered its a long process with your cooperation it can be shortened i dont know anything she said stubbornly i dont know anyone who needed money that badly or who would choose to implicate me in a crime i do know ive already paid all i intend to pay for something i didnt do if you want to ruin someone elses life detective youll have to do it without me i appreciate your position ms powell youre insulted and i cant blame you you do your job do whats expected of you and go the extra mile you see what youve been aiming for swing just into reach then you get kicked in the teeth thats a nice and very accurate summary if i knew who did the kicking id be the first to tell you but im not going to put someone whose only crime was to irritate me into the position ive been in think about it he suggested youve got a good brain once you set your mind to figuring it out i have a hunch youll come up with something the detective rose and bittle followed his lead saying before we go kate id like another moment of your time in private if theres no objection all right i she glanced at byron perhaps youd like to see the view detective byron gestured then led the way to the deck doors did i hear you say you had a dog old sadie ugly as homemade sin but sweet as they come his voice faded away as byron closed the doors an apology isnt enough bittle began without preamble is far from enough im trying to be fair and understand the position you were in mr bittle its difficult you watched me grow up you know my family you should have known me youre quite right he looked very old very old and very tired ive damaged my friendship with your uncle a friendship that is very important to me uncle tommy doesnt hold grudges no but i hurt one of his children and that isnt easy for either of us to forget i can tell you for what its worth that none of us initially believed you would do anything criminal we needed an explanation and your reaction to the questions was well damning understandable now under the circumstances but then you didnt know about my father then did you no we learned about it later there was a copy of a newspaper article in your office oh as simple as that she thought and as stupid she must have missed one when shed stuffed them into her briefcase i see that made it all look worse it clouded the issue i should tell you that when detective kusack contacted me i was immensely relieved and not terribly surprised i could never reconcile the woman i knew with one who would cheat but you reconciled it enough to suspend me she said and heard the brittleness of her own voice yes however much i regretted it and however much i regret it now i had no choice i have called each of the partners and relayed this new information were meeting in an hour to discuss it and to discuss the fact that we have an embezzler in our employ he paused a moment gathering his thoughts youre very young it would be difficult for you to understand the dreams of a lifetime and the way they change at my age you have to be very careful very selective about dreams you begin to become aware that each one may be your last the firm has been mine for most of my life ive nurtured it sweated over it brought my children into it he smiled a little an accounting firm doesnt seem like something anyone would dream over i understand she wanted to touch his arm but couldnt i thought you might its reputation is my reputation having it damaged in this way makes me realize how fragile even such a prosaic dream can be she couldnt help but bend its a good firm mr bittle you made something solid there the people who work for you work for you because you treat them well because you make them part of the whole that isnt really prosaic id like you to consider coming back i realize that you may feel uncomfortable doing so until after this matter is fully resolved however bittle and associates would be very fortunate to have you back on board as a full partner when she didnt speak he took a step toward her kate i dont know whether this will make matters worse or better between us but i want you to know that this offer had already been discussed and voted on prior to this this nightmare you were unanimously approved she had to ease herself back down on the arm of the chair you were going to make me a partner marty nominated you i hope youre aware that you always had his complete trust and support amanda seconded your nomination ah i believe that was why she was so harsh when she believed you had taken the money from escrow youd earned the offer kate i hope once youve had time to think it over youll accept it it was difficult to deal with despair and elation at once not long before she would have leapt at such an offer seized it hugged it to her she opened her mouth certain that acceptance would pop out i do need some time she heard her own words with a kind of vague surprise i have to think it through of course you do please before you consider going elsewhere give us a chance to negotiate yes i will she held out a hand just as byron and the detective returned thank you for coming to see me she was still dazed when she led bittle and detective kusak out said her goodbyes in silence she walked back into the house with byron stood staring at nothing well he prompted he offered me a partnership she said each word slowly unsure whether she was savoring them or weighing them not just to make up for all this theyd already voted on it before everything got screwed up hes willing to negotiate my terms byron angled his head why arent you smiling huh she blinked stared at him then burst into laughter a partnership she threw her arms around his neck and let him swing her byron i cant tell you what this means to me im too dazzled to tell myself its likeits like being cut from the minors then being signed to bat cleanup for the yankees the braves he corrected home team loyal to the last congratulations i think we should have mimosas with that french toast lets she kissed him hard and go light on the oj a dollop for color he assured her as they walked into the kitchen arm in arm he released her to get champagne out of the refrigerator well arent you going to pick up the phone she opened the glassfronted cabinet that held his wine glasses the phone to call your family uhuh this is too big for the phone as soon as we eat she grinned foolishly at the pop of the corkim going to templeton house this requires the personal touch its the perfect way to send aunt susie and uncle tommy back to france the minute hed finished pouring she lifted her glass heres to the irs he hissed through his teeth do we have to okay what the hell heres to me she drank twirled once then drank again youll come with me wont you well get mrs williamson to make one of her incredible dinners well take the dogs too we canwhat are you looking at you i like seeing you happy get that french toast going and youll see me ecstatic im starving give the master room please he took out eggs and milk why dont we swing by your apartment and pick up a few more of your things we can extend our celebration by having you stay another night okay she was too high to think of objecting though it broke her unspoken rule of staying more than two nights running ill get it she said when the phone rang you keep cooking and use lots of cinnamon hello laura hi i was just thinking about you grinning she swung over to nip at byrons ear as he whisked we were going to come over later and invite ourselves to dinner i have some news that iwhat she fell into silence and the hand shed lifted to mess with byrons hair dropped back to her side when at theyes oh god oh god okay well be right there were on our way its margo she said fumbling to disconnect the portable phone josh took her to the hospital the baby i dont know i just dont know its too early for the baby she had pain and some bleeding oh god byron come on he clasped the hand that reached for his lets go chapter seventeen she was grateful that it was byron behind the wheel no matter how she ordered herself to be calm she knew her hands would have trembled flashes of margo ran through her head there were images of them as children sitting on the cliffs tossing flowers out to the sea and seraphina margo parading around the bedroom in her first bra smug and curvy while kate and laura looked on in flatchested envy margo curling kates hair for the junior prom then slipping a condom into kates bagjust in case margo on her first visit home after running off to hollywood to become a star so polished and beautiful margo in paris after shed nagged kate to come over and see the world as it was meant to be margo at templeton housealways back to templeton house in despair after her world had crumbled in fury when one of her friends was hurt the determination and glassy bravado as shed fought to rebuild her life as a bride walking down the aisle to josh so outrageously lovely in miles of white satin and french lace weeping as she rushed into the shop to announce she didnt have the flu but was pregnant weeping again when she felt the baby quicken and cooing over the tiny clothes her mother was already sewing showing off her bulging belly beaming when it rippled with a kick margo always so passionate so impulsive and so thrilled with the idea of having a baby the baby kate squeezed her eyes tight oh god the baby she doesnt want to know if its a girl or a boy kate murmured she said they want to be surprised they have names picked out suzanna if its a girl for aunt susie and annie and john thomas if its a boy for margos father and uncle tommy oh byron what if dont think about what ifs just hold on he took his hand off the gearshift long enough to squeeze hers im trying just as she tried to block the shudder when he pulled into the parking lot in front of the tall white building lets hurry she was quaking when they reached the door byron pulled her back studied her face i can go and find out whats going on you dont have to go in yes i do i can handle it i know you can he linked his fingers with hers margo was in the maternity wing as she hurried down the corridor kate blocked out the sounds and smells of hospital at least this wing had familiar and good memories lauras babies the rush and thrill of being a part of those births soothed away the worst edge of panic urged kate to remember what it was like to watch life fight its way into existence and to tell herself that this place was one of birth not death the first face she saw was lauras ive been watching for you laura wrapped her arms around kate in relief everybodys here in the waiting room josh is with margo whats going on is she all right the baby everythings all right as far as we know laura led her toward the waiting area and struggled to maintain the pretense of calm apparently she went into premature labor and she was hemorrhaging oh my god theyve stopped the bleeding theyve stopped it laura took a slow breath to steady herself but her eyes mirrored her inner fears annie was just in to see her she says margos holding her own theyre trying to stabilize her stop the labor its too early isnt it shes only in her seventh month kate stepped into the waiting area saw worried faces and ruthlessly smothered her own fears annie kate caught both the womans hands in hers shell be all right you know how strong and stubborn she is she looked so small in the bed in there anns voice broke like a little girl shes too pale they should do something for her shes too pale annie we need coffee susan slid an arm around her shoulders why dont you help me get some after stroking a hand down kates arm she led annie away susie will take care of her thomas murmured he often thought there was too little for a man to do at such a time and too much for him to imagine now sit down katie girl youre too pale yourself i want to see her the walls were closing in already thick with the scent of fear that meant hospital to her uncle tommy youll make them let me see her of course i will he kissed her cheek then shook his head at his daughter no you stay here ill check on the girls while im at it though you should know theyll be fine down in day care theyre worried ali especially she adores margo ill tend to them im leaving all my women in your hands byron ill take care of them sit down he murmured and nudged both of them to a couch ill help your mother and ann with the coffee he saw their hands link before he turned away can you tell me what happened kate asked josh called from his car phone he didnt want to take time to call an ambulance he was trying to sound calm but i could tell he was panicked he said shed been feeling tired and a little achy after last night when they got up this morning she wasnt feeling well complained of back pain shes been working too hard all that prep for the auction we should have postponed it this year i should have pulled more weight kate thought everything was fine at her last checkup laura put in rubbing her brow but you may be right she said she was going to take a shower then she started shouting for him she was bleeding and having contractions by the time we got here theyd admitted her i havent seen her yet theyll let us see her damn right they will laura took the coffee byron offered remembering to thank him the waitings hell he sat beside kate it always is my sister meg had a bad time with her first thirtyhour labor which translates to the rest of your life when youre pacing just talk he ordered himself just talk and give them something else to focus on abigail was a hefty nine pounds and meg swore shed never have another went on to have two more it was so easy for me laura murmured nine hours for ali only five for kayla they just sort of slid out selective memory kate corrected i distinctly remember you breaking all the bones in my hand while we were in the birthing room that was ali and with kayla you she sprang to her feet when a nurse stopped in the doorway she stepped over the coffee table prepped for battle we want to see margo templeton now so ive been informed the nurse said dryly mrs templeton would like to see you youll have to keep it short this way please she led the way down a wide corridor kate blocked out the hospital sound of crepesoled shoes slapping on linoleum there were so many doors she thought white doors all closed so many people inside them beds with curtains around them machines beeped and hissed inside tubes and needles doctors with sad tired eyes who came to tell you your parents had died gone away left you alone kate laura soothed the hand that gripped hers im okay she ordered herself to stay in the now and relaxed her grip dont worry the nurse opened the door and there was the room it was designed to be comforting cheerful a room to welcome new life a rocking chair warm ivory walls with dark trim thriving plants and the quiet strains of a chopin sonata were all pieces of the serene whole but the machine was there beeping and the rolling stool that doctors used and the bed with its guarded sides and stiff white sheets margo lay in it glassily pale her glorious hair pulled back a few loose tendrils curled damply around her face the bag hanging from the iv stand beside the bed dripped clear liquid down a tube and into her she had one hand pressed protectively to her belly the other in joshs there you are margos lips curved as she gave her husbands hand a reassuring squeeze take a break josh go ahead she rubbed their joined hands over her cheek this is girl talk he hesitated obviously torn between doing what she wanted and being more than a step away from her ill be right outside he lowered his head to kiss her and his hand brushed over the bulge of her belly dont forget your breathing ive been breathing for years ive almost got it down pat now go on out and pace like an expectant father well make her behave laura assured him she sat on the edge of the bed and patted his thigh ill be right outside he repeated and waited until he was in the hall to rub unsteady hands over his face hes scared margo murmured you hardly ever see josh scared but its going to be all right of course it is laura agreed and glanced at the fetal monitor that beeped away the babys heartbeats no i mean it im not messing this up my timings off thats all she looked at kate i guess this is the first time in my life ive been early for anything oh i dont know striving for the same light tone kate eased down on the side of the bed opposite from laura you developed early margo snorted true oh here comes one she said in a shaky voice and began to breathe slowly through the contraction instinctively kate took her hand and breathed through it with her theyre very mild margo managed theres something in there thats supposed to be slowing them down she flicked a glance toward the iv theyd hoped to stop them altogether but it looks like the kid wants out seven weeks too early oh god she squeezed her eyes shut fear circled back no matter how hard she focused on willing it away i should have taken more naps i should have stayed off my feet more i stop that kate snapped this is no time to feel sorry for yourself actually labors the perfect time for selfpity remembering her own laura stroked margos belly to bring comfort but not for blame youve taken good care of yourself and the baby milked it for all it was worth kate arched a brow how many times did i have to run up and down the stairs at the shop because you were pregnant and i wasnt she wanted to weep promised herself a nice long crying jag later and those cravings in the afternoons so i had to go over to fishermans wharf and get you frozen strawberry yogurt with chocolate sauce do you think i bought that you bought the yogurt margo pointed out actually i wouldnt mind having some now forget it you can chew your chipped ice im going to do this right margo took a deep breath i know the doctors worried josh is worried and mum but im going to do this right you know i can of course you can laura murmured this hospital has one of the best birthing wings in the country they take marvelous care of preemies i was on the committee that helped raise funds for new equipment remember who can remember all the committees you were on kate commented youll do fine margo nobody focuses on what they want and how to get it better than you i want this baby i thought i could will the labor away but well apparently the kid takes after me already its going to be today her lips trembled again its so small and tough kate added yeah margo managed a genuine smile tough the doctors still hoping they can stop the labor but its not going to happen i know its today you understand she asked laura absolutely and hes being snotty about delivery just josh i wanted you to be there both of you i just had this image of a big noisy bawdy event well have one after kate leaned down to kiss her cheek thats a promise okay okay margo closed her eyes and dealt with the next contraction shes strong laura said to kate as they walked back down the corridor i know but i dont like to see her scared if the drip doesnt stop labor shell be too busy to be scared much longer all we can do is wait wait they did as one hour passed into two restless kate paced the room walked out to badger the nurses drank too much coffee eat byron ordered and handed her a sandwich what is it any time a sandwich comes out of a vending machine you dont ask what it is you just eat it okay she took a bite thought it might have something to do with chicken salad its taking so long barely three hours he corrected miracles take time i guess considering it necessary fuel she took another bite of the sandwich we should be in there with her it would be better if we were with her its hard to wait harder for some he combed his fingers through her hair we could take a walk outside get you out of here for a while no im okay she damn well would be its easier concentrating on margo than thinking about where i am phobias are so human dumb she decided it was a horrible night in my life the worst ill ever have to go through i imagine but it was twenty years ago it was yesterday if she let her mind drift anyway i handled the hospital both times laura had kids maybe that was easier because i was in on it and labor really keeps you busy but this is the same thing i want to be here linking his fingers with hers he tugged her into the moment you pulling for a boy or a girl i hadnt thought of it howhow big does a baby have to be to have a good shot itll be beautiful he said sliding over her question think of the gene pool its coming from a lot of times you think a baby could get lucky and get the best features of his parents you know his mothers eyes his fathers chin whatever this one strikes gold anywhere he turns going to end up being spoiled rotten are you kidding you should see the nursery margo and josh put together id like to live there she laughed and barely noticed hed handed her tea rather than coffee they bought this incredible antique cradle and this oldfashioned english pram they found in bath we were going to have the baby shower next week at templeton house all that loot she trailed off youll have to make it an afterthebirth shower what did you get its silly she turned the cup around and around in her hands trying not to cry or scream or simply bolt up and break into the birthing room margos got this thing for italian designers especially armani they have this junior line its ridiculous you bought the baby an armani he burst out laughing roaring all the harder when she flushed its a joke she insisted just a joke but she found herself smiling i guess the first time the kid spits up on it the jokes on me youre incredibly sweet he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her incredibly its only money comforted she leaned her head against his shoulder and watched her family laura had come back from checking on the girls and was sitting with ann her aunt and uncle were standing at the window uncle tommys arm was around her aunts shoulders there was a television bolted to the wall the sunday news on cnn rolled by reporting on a world that had nothing to do with the room where people waited others came and went bringing with them frissons of worry anticipation excitement she heard the hollow echoes of the pa system the brisk efficient footsteps of nurses and occasional laughter she saw a young man leading his enormously pregnant wife down the hall rubbing her back with intense concentration as she took slow measured steps laura always liked to walk during labor kate murmured hmm margo and i would take turns walking with her rubbing her back breathing with her what about her husband right kate made a derisive sound eyed laura to make certain she was out of earshot he didnt have time for the lamaze route didnt consider it necessary i was her coach for both girls with margo pinchhitting i thought margo was living in europe during those years yeah but she came back for the births kayla was a few days early and margo was on assignment the plan had been for her to spend the last week with laura at templeton house but when she called from the plane laura had just gone into labor margo ended up coming to the hospital straight from the airport we were with her she said fiercely right there with her and ridgeway breezed in after everyone was all cleaned up and tidy made what im sure he considered a manful attempt to conceal his disappointment that the babies didnt have penises then gave laura some elaborate gift and left creep ive never met him byron mused i cant say id formed a favorable opinion of him from reports normally i prefer to form my own opinion on a firsthand basis he was silent for a moment but i think i can make an exception in this case and just despise him good call shes well rid of him as soon as she stops feeling guilty for being glad shes rid of him shell be fine oh god why is it taking so long i cant stand it she sprang to her feet theyve got to tell us something we cant just sit here a nurse in green scrubs stepped into the doorway then perhaps youd all like to take a little walk margo ann choked out as she got to her feet mrs templeton is doing just fine and mr templeton is floating somewhere in the vicinity of cloud nine as for baby templeton i think youd like to see for yourselves come with me please the baby ann reached out found susans hand shes had the baby do you think its all right do you think its healthy lets go see come on grandma susan murmured as she walked ann out im scared trembling as she followed kate gripped byrons hand the nurse was smiling wasnt she she wouldnt have been smiling if something was really wrong you can tell by their eyes you can tell if you look in their eyes she said margo was fine didnt she say margo was fine thats exactly what she said theyll let you see for yourself soon and look at this they approached a glass door behind it josh stood the grin on his face breaking records in his arms was a small bundle with a golden sprinkle of hair topped with a bright blue bow its a boy thomass voice broke as he pressed a hand to the glass look at our grandson susie five pounds josh mouthed gingerly tilting his son for his family to view five full pounds ten fingers ten toes five full pounds he lowered his head to touch his lips to the babys cheek hes so tiny with her eyes swimming kate wrapped her arms around laura hes so beautiful john thomas templeton laura let her own tears fall welcome home they cooed at him objecting noisily when a nurse came to take him away when josh came through the door they fell on him as villagers might fall on a conquering hero five pounds he said again burrowing his face in his mothers hair did you hear that hes five pounds even they said that was really good he has all the right working parts theyre going to check him out some more because he didnt cook enough but he looked done to me byron put in have a cigar daddy jesus josh stared at the cigar byron handed him daddy oh im supposed to be passing out the cigars handling details is part of my job description grandma byron handed one to ann who delighted everyone by popping it into her mouth margo josh laura took his hand how is she amazing shes the most amazing woman he came out wailing did i tell you laughing he lifted laura off her feet kissed her he couldnt seem to get the words out fast enough just howling and the minute he did margo started to laugh she was exhausted and we were both scared bloodless then he just slid out baffled he clasped his hands together and stared at them its the most incredible thing you cant imagine well you can but you had to be there hes crying and margos laughing and the doctors says well it looks like theres nothing wrong with his pipes nothing wrong with his pipes josh repeated his voice hitching nothing wrong with him of course not thomas closed josh in a bear hug hes a templeton not that were not glad to see you kate brushed the hair back from joshs face but when are they going to let us in to see margo i dont know in a minute i guess she had the nurse get her purse his grin broke out fresh she wanted to fix her makeup typical kate turned and threw her arms around byron thats just typical chapter eighteen the week following the appearance of j t templeton was hectic and complicated lauras schedule didnt allow for more than a few hours at the shop with margo involved with her new son kate was left to deal with the results of a successful reception early delivery had thrown their vague plans for interviewing and hiring a parttime clerk out the window kate was on her own she opened the shop every day learned to control her impulses to hurry browsers along though she would never understand the appeal of dawdling in a store she told herself to appreciate that others enjoyed it she studied the inventory lists and tried to recognize the more esoteric items in pretenses stock but why anyone would feel the need to own a designer pillbox with pearl inlay remained beyond her simple honesty was sometimes taken for a credit sometimes an insult for every woman who appreciated being told an outfit didnt suit her there were two who bristled at the information she persevered by remembering that for at least one hour every day she could close herself in the back office and be alone blissfully alone with her ledgers they didnt talk back the customer is always right kate muttered to herself the customer is always righteven when the customer is an asshole she marched out of the wardrobe room where one particular customer had just informed her that the donna karan was mislabeled it couldnt possibly be a size ten as it was too snug at the hips too snug at the hips my butt the old bat couldnt get one thigh in a size ten if she greased it with motor oil miss oh miss another customer snapped her fingers like a diner signaling a particularly slow waitress to bring more wine kate gritted her teeth into a smile yes maam can i help you i want to see this bracelet the victorian slide no no i said the victorian slide not the gold cuff sorry kate tried again following the direction of the womans pointing finger its charming isnt it fussy and foolish would you like to try it on how much is it theres a tag right on it isnt there still smiling kate turned the tag around read off the price and what are those stones oh shit shed studied hadnt she i believe theres garnet and carnelian and what was that yellow one topaz amber citrine citrine she hazarded because it sounded more victorian to her as the customer studied the bracelet kate scanned the shop just her luck she thought it was packed and laura was gone for the day she had three hours to go and in three hours she judged that what was left of her mind would resemble a mass of cold rice the sound of the door jangling made her want to whimper when she saw who breezed in she wanted to scream candy litchfield her longstanding enemy candy litchfield whose bouncy stride and perky looks tumbling red hair and perfect nose hid the heart of a spider and shed brought pals kate noted as her heart sank perfectly groomed cannyeyed society matrons in italian shoes i never find anything i like in here candy announced in her bright and farreaching voice but millicent told me shed noticed a perfume atomizer that might fit in with my collection of course they overprice everything she strolled through envy packed solidly in ill will can i show you something else kate said to the customer who was now studying candy as carefully as the bracelet no she hesitated but avarice won over and she took out her credit card would you gift wrap it please its for my daughters birthday of course she boxed and wrapped rang up and bagged all the while keeping a weather eye on candys progress two customers left without a purchase but kate refused to give candys viciously criticizing tongue credit for it feeling like gary cooper at the end of high noon she stepped out from behind the counter to face them alone what do you want candy im browsing in a public retail facility she smiled thinly and exuded a notsosubtle whiff of opium i believe youre supposed to offer me a glass of rather inferior champagne isnt that store policy help yourself i was told by a friend there was a perfume bottle that i might like to have candy cast an eye over the displays her gaze latched on to a gorgeous design in the shape of a womans body beautifully fashioned in frosted rose glass she would have revealed her own age before she would have shown a flicker of interest i cant imagine what she was thinking of she drawled she probably mistook your taste kate smiled that is she mistook you for having any hows the pool boy these days candy who had a reputation for enjoying very young men in between husbands bristled how does it feel to be a shop clerk i heard you were fired stealing clients funds kate how ordinary someone must have pruned your grapevine prematurely candy cane youre way behind am i she filled a glass to the rim with champagne am i really everyone knows that with the templeton influence behind you all your petty crimes will be brushed aside like your fathers were her smile sharpened when she saw that shaft strike home but then only fools would have you handling their accounts now she sipped delicately where theres smoke after all youre so lucky to have rich friends wholl throw you crumbs but then you always were always wanted to be a templeton didnt you kate said sweetly but josh never looked twice in your direction we used to laugh about it margo and laura and i why dont you finish your champagne and go diddle your pool boy candy youre really wasting your time here candys skin darkened but she kept her voice even her approach had been to divide and conquer shed never been able to score any real points when kate had margo or laura around but alone and this time she had more ammunition ive heard youre seeing quite a bit of byron de witt and that hes seeing quite a bit of you im so flattered youve taken an interest in my sex life candy ill let you know when we release the video a smart ambitious man like byron would be very aware of the advantages of developing a relationship with the templeton ward imagine how high up he can climb using you as a springboard kates face went blank pleasing candy enormously candy sipped more wine her eyes alive with malice as she studied kate over the rim the malice blurred into shock as kate threw back her head and laughed god you really are an idiot weak with laughter kate took a few steps to the side so she could support herself against the counter to think we just thought you were a mean little snake all this time youve just been stupid do you actually believe a man like byron needs to use anybody because her ribs were beginning to ache she took several deep breaths something in candys eyes tipped her off oh i get it i get it he didnt look twice at you either did he you bitch candy hissed she slammed down her glass before stalking over to kate you couldnt get a man on your own if you danced naked in front of a marine band everyone knows why hes sleeping with you everyone can think what they want ill just enjoy it peter says hes an ambitious corporate shill now kates interest peaked peter does does he the templetons booted peter out because laura whined about the divorce they were so concerned with protecting their darling daughter they ignored the fact that peter is an excellent hotelier all the years he worked for them helped build the templeton chain into what it is today oh please peter never built anything but his own ego hell use his talents to open his own hotel soon with templeton money kate commented thinking about laura and the girls how ironic laura wanted the divorce peter was entitled to financial compensation youd know all about making a profit out of marriage terminations kate decided candys visit wasnt such a pain in the butt after allnot when it brought along such interesting news going to use some of your alimony to invest in ridgeways hotel my accountant who isnt a thief considers it a smart investment her lips curved again i believe ill enjoy being in the hotel business well youve spent a lot of time in them on the hourly plan how droll you are hold on to that sense of humor kate youll need it candys smile was still there but her teeth were set byron de witt will make use of you until he achieves the position he wants then he wont need you anymore then i guess id better enjoy the ride she angled her head so youve set your sights on peter ridgeway thats just fascinating weve run into each other in palm springs a number of times and have discovered many mutual interests she smoothed her hair be sure to tell laura hes looking extremely well extremely ill do that kate said as candy headed for the door and ill give byron your best no on second thought ill give him mine she snickered turning when the customer nearest the counter cleared her throat the womans eyes darted from the door to kate bright and wary as a birds ah show me these evening bags if you dont mind sure kate beamed at her for some reason candys visit had brightened her mood id love to have you shopped with us before yes actually i have kate took three ridiculously fussy jeweled bags from the shelf we value your business arent these just fabulous and then she said how lucky i was to have rich friends throwing me crumbs kate sniffed a homebaked chocolate chip cookie into her mouth so thanks since i suppose youre one of my rich friends what an ass from her position on the patio chaise margo stretched up her arms she hit me with the business about my father margo lowered her arms again slowly im sorry damn it kate i knew id get smacked with it sooner or later i just hate that it was her of all people i hate more that she could see shed jabbed me i wish it didnt matter margo everything about the people we love matters im sorry i wasnt there her eyes narrowed in thought im really overdue for a manicure i think candys day for the salon is wednesday wont it be fun to bump into her well able to picture the event and the outcome kate chuckled give yourself a couple weeks to get back in shape champ then you can take her on i knew id feel better if i came here to wallow remember that the next time youve got something eating away at your insides never going to let me forget that are you kate muttered i said i was wrong not to tell you and laura i was stupid after youve said it at regular intervals for the next year or two well forget all about it i have such understanding friends christ these are criminal kate mumbled through another cookie it must be great having annie here baking and fussing it really is i never would have believed we could live under the same roof again even for the short term it was awfully sweet of laura to insist that mum stay here for a couple of weeks speaking of laura kate had made a point of dropping by margos after work knowing that laura would be too busy for an earlyevening visit candy mentioned peter so it was the way she mentioned him first she was on me and byron excuse me margo indulged in a cookie herself in what way well she said how hes a corporate shill and hes using me to earn points with the templetons you know like he brings me to orgasm and they give him another promotion thats pathetic she narrowed her eyes at kates face you didnt buy that no she shook her head quickly no i might have if it had been anyone other than byron it was a pretty clever chain to pull but hes just not made that way i laughed at her good for you what does that have to do with peter apparently thats where she got the idea at least partially it sounds to me as if theyve gotten close jesus what a frightening thought she shuddered dramatically two creeps in a pod she wanted to make sure i mentioned it to laura i dont know if i should let it alone margo said immediately laura doesnt need that if she hears it she hears it besides with candys track record its probably already fizzled i was leaning that way kate toyed with the rest of her cappuccino studied the view its so beautiful here i never really told you what a terrific job youve done putting the place together making it like home it is home it was straight off margo smiled i owe that to you youre the one who told me about the place it seemed right for youyou and josh do you think you can tell sometimes if a place is where you want to be i know it it was templeton house for me i was too young to remember anything before we came there but it was home always my flat in milan when margo broke off kate shifted uncomfortably im sorry didnt mean to stir up old memories its all right i loved that flat everything about it i was home there too it was right for me at the time she shrugged her shoulders if things had stayed as they were it would be right for me still but they didnt i didnt then there was the shop she smiled and sat up straighter remember how i was so dazzled by that big empty building while you and laura rolled your eyes and wondered if you should cart me off it smelled of stale marijuana and spiderwebs and i loved it i knew i could make something there and i did her eyes glowed as she looked out to the cliffs maybe childbirth has made me philosophical but its not hard for me to say i needed to make something there and i wouldnt have without you and laura let me be sappy for a minute she ordered when kate grimaced im entitled ive started to think that things move in a circle if you let them were together on this through varying circumstances but were together we always have been it matters yes it matters kate rose wandered to the edge of the patio where the ground spread green and bloomed with colorful blossoms the autumn sky was still brilliantly blue ranging out to the rocking sea and beyond this was a home she thought not hers though she felt at home here as she did at templeton house it worried her that shed fallen in love with the bent cyprus the blooming vines and wood and glass of a house on seventeen mile that wasnt her own it was always templeton house for me she said putting an image of the towers and stone over the image of multilevel decks and wide windows the view from my bedroom the way it smelled after the floors were polished i never felt that way about my apartment in town it was just a convenient place to stay are you going to keep it puzzled kate turned back of course why wouldnt i i thought since you were staying at byrons im not staying there kate said quickly not living there i just sleep over sometimes thats entirely different if you want it to be margo tilted her head what worries you about him kate nothing exactly blowing out a breath she came back and sat i was going to ask youfiguring youd be the expert on such matters margo waited tapped her fingers on the arms of the chaise well okay im working up to it she braced looked margo dead in the eye so that she could detect any flicker can you become addicted to sex damn straight you can margo said without a single flicker if you do it right the comers of her lips turned up id bet byron does it very right rake in your winnings kate said dryly and youre complaining no not complaining im asking ive just never look its not like i havent had sex before i just never had such an appetite for it as i seem to now with him she rolled her own eyes chuckled at herself christ margo five minutes with him and i want to bite him and since the taste suits you whats the problem because i wondered if you could get too dependent on certain aspects on great sex yeah all right on really great sex then people change and move on sometimes they do she thought of herself and of josh smiled sometimes they dont sometimes they do kate repeated candy got me thinking oh please damn it kate you said you didnt buy that shit she was spewing about him using me absolutely not it just made me think about our relationship if it is a relationship we dont have anything in common really but well sex with a long sigh margo leaned back helped herself to another cookie what do you do when youre not busy pounding each other into puddles of passion very funny we do stuff such as i dont know listen to music you like the same music sure who doesnt like rock and roll sometimes we watch movies hes got this incredible collection of old black and whites oh you mean the old movies you like hmm she shrugged we walk on the beach or he whips me through a workout hes tough about that more than pleased she flexed her biceps ive got definition hmm i guess you never talk though sure we talk about work family food hes got this thing about nutrition always serious huh no i mean we have a good time we laugh a lot and we play with the dogs or he works on one of his cars and i watch you knowstuff let me see if i have this straight you like the same music the same kind of movies which translates into being entertained together you enjoy walking on the beach pumping iron share an affection for a pair of mongrel dogs margo shook her head i can see the problem other than sex you might as well be a couple of strangers dump him now kate before it gets ugly i should have known youd make a joke out of it youre the joke listen to yourself youve got a terrific man a wonderful satisfying relationship that includes great sex and mutual interests and youre sitting there looking for hitches well if you find them before they happen you can work around them it isnt an audit kate its a love affair relax and enjoy it i am mostly nearly she shrugged again ive just got a lot on my mind and she thought it might be time to bring up the fact that shed been offered a partnership at bittle theres some ah adjustments coming up she began but was interrupted as ann came out carrying the baby the little man woke up hungry ive changed him ann said cooing as she carried him toward margos open arms yes i did changed him and put on one of his fancy suits theres a lad theres a darling oh isnt he gorgeous margo cuddled him and smelling mother j t sent up a call for dinner hes more beautiful every time i look at him just like a man cant wait for a woman to open her blouse there you are sweetie he settled happily at her breast his small fists kneading his newborn blue eyes intent on hers hes gained four ounces she told kate at the rate hes going hell be ready for heavyweight status in another week charmed kate shifted to the edge of the chaise to stroke his downy head he has your eyes and joshs ears god he smells so good she drew in the powdery milky scent of baby and decided to talk business another time i get to hold him when youre done youll stay for dinner miss kate ann put her hands behind her back to end her struggle not to adjust the way margo was holding the precious boy mr josh has a late meeting at the hotel and youll keep us company then you can hold our baby as long as you want well kate traced a fingertip over the curve of j ts cheek since youve twisted my arm the bay suite of templetoh monterey was elegantly appointed blacklacquered tables held huge porcelain urns filled with exotic blooms a curved settee in icy blue brocade was sprinkled with pillows that picked up the tones of a floorspanning oriental rug the drapes on both sets of wide glass doors were open to invite in the glorious bleeding colors as the sun slowly sank into the sea the table in the dining area was conference size graced with highbacked ornately carved chairs with tapestried seats dinner was served on bonewhite china accented with a fume blanc from the templeton vineyards the meeting might have been held at templeton house but both thomas and susan considered that to be lauras home this as pleasant as it was was business if theres a weakness in the beverly hills location its in room service byron glanced at the notes beside his plate the complaints run to the usualthe amount of time for delivery mixup in orders the kitchen runs well as a whole your chef there is temperamental susan suggested with a smile actually i was going to say frightening i know he scared me maybe it was being ordered out by a very large man with a thick brooklyn accent and a cleaver but there was a moment did you leave thomas wanted to know i reasoned with him from a safe distance and told him quite sincerely that he made the best coquilles st jacques it had ever been my privilege to taste that goes a long way with max josh commented as i recall the line chefs there work like machines they appear to theyre terrified of him grinning byron sampled his tarragon chicken the problem doesnt seem to be in the preparation but in the servers naturally there are certain hours when both the kitchen and the servers are backed up but the room service staff has become undeniably lax suggestions id recommend transferring helen pringle to the beverly hills location if shes agreeable in a managerial position shes experienced and efficient wed miss her here of course but i believe she would eliminate the problem in la and shed certainly be my first choice for a promotion josh thomas turned to his son for verification agreed she has an excellent record as an assistant manager make her the offer susan picked up her wine with the appropriate increase in salary and benefits fine i think that closes beverly hills byron skimmed down his notes san francisco had been dealt with and tabled san diego required a personal spot check but posed no immediate need for discussion ah there is a little matter here at the flagship byron scratched his cheek maintenance would like new vending machines thomas raised a brow as he finished off his salmon maintenance came to you about vending machines there was a problem with the plumbing on the sixth floor sabotage by a toddler who decided to drown his power rangers in the toilet hell of a mess i went down to soothe the parents and ended up sending them down to the pool while he helped the mechanic stem the flood but that was beside the point i supervised the disgorging so to speak and the matter of vending machines came up they want their junk food back it seems candy bars and chips were ditched a couple of years ago and replaced with apples and fatfree cookies believe me i got an earful about corporate interference in personal choice that would be ridgeway josh decided susan made a dismissive sound but held a napkin to her lips to disguise her grin she had an image of byron elegant in a suit and polished shoes wading through water and listening to a mechanics gripes about snacks recommendation keep them happy byron shrugged let them eat milky ways agreed thomas said and is that the biggest staff problem here at templeton monterey just the usual hitches nothing that isnt typical daytoday there was the dead woman in josh grimaced i hate when that happens heart attack died in her sleep she was eightyfive led a full life gave the maid a hell of a start how long did it take you to calm her down susan asked after we caught her she went screaming down the hall about an hour thomas topped off the wine lifted his glass its a relief for susie and me to know that california is in good hands some people believe that running a hotel means sitting up in the fancy office and pushing paperand peoplearound now tommy susan patted his arm peters no longer our problem we can hate him for strictly personal reasons now she beamed at byron but i agree well go back to france at the end of the week knowing things here are well looked after she tilted her head professionally and personally i appreciate that our kates looking very happy thomas began very healthy and fit are you making plans uhoh here it comes with a grin josh leaned back shook his head sorry by im just going to sit here and watch you twist in the wind its a reasonable question thomas insisted i know what the mans prospects are obviously i want to know what his intentions are tommy susan said patiently kates a grown woman shes my girl his face clouded as he pushed his plate aside i let laura rush off her own way and look what that got her im not going to hurt her byron said he wasnt as offended as some might have expected by the probing after all hed been raised in the old school where family interest and interference went hand in hand shes very important to me important thomas tossed back a good nights sleep is important susan sighed eat your dessert thomas you know how you love tiramisu working for templeton doesnt require you to answer personal questions byron just ignore him im not asking as his employer im asking as kates father then ill answer you in that spirit byron agreed shes become a major part of my life and my intentions are to marry her since he hadnt fully understood that himself until this moment byron fell silent and frowned into his glass well then pleased thomas slapped his palm on the table itll be news to her byron muttered then let out a breath id appreciate it if youd let me deal with your kate in my own way i havent quite worked it out ill have him out of your way in a few days susan assured byron six thousand miles thomas forked up creamy cake but ill be back he warned and shot byron a wide grin he was a detail man after all byron reminded himself when he let himself into his house he knew how to handle sensitive problems surely he could handle something as basic as a proposal of marriage to the woman he loved she wouldnt want anything flowery he decided kate wouldnt go for the downononeknee routine thank god shed prefer the direct the simple it was all in the approach he concluded and tugged off his tie he wouldnt put it as a question phrasing something as will you opened up too much leeway for the answer to be no better to make it a statement being certain to keep it short of a demand because it was kate after all and it would be wise because it was kate to have at the ready a list of rational reasons why it would be sensible he only wished he could think of a single one hed pulled off his shoes before he realized something was wrong it took him another minute to pinpoint it it was the quiet the dogs always set up a greeting din when he pulled into the drive but there was no barking when he raced to the deck door wrenched it open in panic he saw that there were no dogs he called whistled hurried down the steps to check the fence that kept them safely in the backyard his frantic mind whirled with the possibility of dognappers newspaper articles about stolen pets sold for experiments the first happy bark weakened his knees theyd gotten through the safety gate he thought as he strode toward the beach steps that was all somehow theyd gotten through and gone for a run on their own hed have to give them a good talkingto they topped the stairs at a run tails waving flags of devoted joy they leapt on him licking and wriggling with the trembling delight they displayed whether hed been gone for hours or had simply run to the store for milk youre grounded he informed them both of you havent i told you to stay in the yard well you can just forget gnawing on those ham bones i got from the hotel kitchen no dont try to make up he said laughing when they held up paws for shaking you guys are in the doghousefor real well thatll teach them kate climbed the last step and stood smiling at him in the moonlight but i have to take the heat on this one i asked them to escort me down to the beach and being wellbred gentlemen they could hardly refuse i was worried about them he managed he couldnt seem to stop staring at her she was standing there windblown slightly breathless from the climb just there as if hed wished it im sorry we should have left you a note i didnt expect to see you tonight i know feeling awkward now as she always did after following an impulse she tucked her hands in her pockets i went by margos after i closed the shop had dinner and played with the baby hes gained four ounces i know josh told me he has pictures about six dozen i got to see videos i loved it anyway i started to head back to my apartment her apartment she thought dull empty meaningless and i ended up here instead i hope you dont mind do i mind he wrapped his arms around her slowly drew her close against him gradually for three humming heartbeats his eyes stayed on hers his mouth brushed hers retreated brushed again shifted angles then his lips covered hers heated hers parted hers soft and deep and welcoming the kiss shimmered through her her hands stayed in her pockets too limp to move the muscles in her thighs went lax her knees weak when he drew away she could have sworn she saw stars dazzling her own eyes well she began but he was kissing her again in that same drugging devastating delicious way it was as if they had forever to simply be there caught in soft sea breezes and quiet passion she gulped in air when his mouth lifted his eyes were so close so clear she could see herself trapped in them it jolted her back a step made her fumble for a casual smile id have to say at a guess you dont mind i want you here he took her hands brought her palms one at a time to his lips and watched her i want you he could see that she was struggling to recover to plant her feet back on the ground he didnt intend to let her come inside he murmured drawing her with him ill show you chapter nineteen days later she was still there byrons idea of a break from weight training was a threemile jog on the beach it was difficult for a woman whose idea of a morning start had always been two very hot very strong cups of coffee to adjust to the concept of running at dawn kate told herself it was the experience that mattered and more important the waffles hed promised her if she stuck it out so you like she puffed huffed and tried to concentrate on her pace really enjoy this its addictive byron assured her he was going at a snails pace to bring her along gradually and admiring the way her legs looked in baggy shorts youll see no way only sinful stuff is addictive coffee cigarettes chocolate sex good stuff never becomes addictive sex is good stuff its good but sinfulsinful in a good way she watched the dogs race into the surf and shake themselves so that little bullets of water flew and sparkled in the strengthening sun she supposed there was something to be said for dawn after all the light was achingly beautiful and the smells so fresh so renewed they seemed unreal the air was just cool enough to be bracing she had to admit her muscles felt loose oiled in a way as if her body was becoming a welltuned machine it made her feel foolish to realize shed accepted feeling unwell for so long simply because shed found it too much trouble to change where did you run in atlanta no beaches there weve got parks indoor tracks when the weathers bad do you miss it bits and pieces magnolia trees the sound of slow voices my family ive never lived anywhere but here never wanted to i liked going to school back east seeing snow frost on the windows the way the leaves look in new england in october but i always wanted to be here she saw the beach steps in the distance her aching calves all but applauded margos lived lots of places and lauras done much more traveling than i have someplace youd like to see no not really well bora bora bora bora i did this report on it in high school you know a geography report it seemed so cool one of those places i told myself id go when i took a real vacation just a hangoutanddonothing vacation oh thank goodness she breathed and sank to the sand in front of the beach steps i made it and youre going to cramp up if you dont keep moving unsympathetically he hauled her to her feet just walk youve got to cool down why havent you gone to bora bora she walked for three paces then bent over at the waist and breathed come on byron real people dont just go to bora bora its one of those daydreams do you think jogging can dislocate internal organs no i was pretty sure i could hear my ovaries rattling he paled a bit please he handed her the bottle of water hed screwed into the sand at the base of the stairs he whistled for the dogs before starting up the steps with her normally id just be getting up now stumbling into the kitchen where my timed coffee machine would be finishing up its last few drips leave the house at eight twentyfive hit the office at eight fortyfive have the coffee machine there brewing away and be at my desk with the first cup by eight fiftyfive eat the first roll of antacids by nine fiftyfive it wasnt quite that bad she fell silent as they crossed from steps to lawn toward the house the dogs winged through the gate streaking toward their bowls in anticipation of breakfast i havent had a chance to tell margo and laura about going back to bittle byron hefted the twentyfivepound bag of dog food out of the pantry havent had a chance all righthavent found the right way she shifted as the nuggets clattered into plastic i feel like im letting them down i know thats not right i know they wont feel that way theyd understand this is right for me byron replaced the bag signaling the dogs to chow down is it of course it is she brushed back her hair what a thing to say its what i studied for worked for its what ive always wanted all right then he gave her a friendly pat on the rump and headed in what do you mean by that all right then she rushed in behind him scowling its a partnership with all the bells and whistles ive earned it absolutely as a matter of habit he started upstairs toward the shower kate followed at his heels well i have that whole business about the altered documents is just about cleared up in any case im clear the rest is detective kusacks problem and the firms problem ill have more control over whats done after im a partner are you worried about it about what he tugged off his shortsleeved sweatshirt flung it toward the hamper about clearing up the escrow discrepancies of course i am why havent you pursued it well i she broke off as he flicked on the shower and stepped inside ive been busy theres not a hell of a lot i could do in any case and with margo being pregnant and the auction and laura tossing me all these details about this holiday fashion show she wants i havent had time okay he said agreeably that doesnt mean it doesnt matter disgusted she stripped and joined him under the spray it just means ive had other priorities it all came to a head a couple of weeks ago the forgeries the offer the baby it didnt seem fair to tell margo and laura id have to cut back at the shop just when margo had to cut back herself and until i do and im back at bittle i dont see what i can do about finding out who tried to screw me and the firm but once im there you can bet your ass im going to find out who set me up that makes sense of course it makes sense irritated for no reason she could name she stuck her head under the spray just like it makes sense for me to accept the offer its the most practical course youre right its definitely the most practical pretenses is an investment bittle is your career thats right instead of being soothed by his agreement she bristled so what are we arguing about i dont have a clue he gave her an absent kiss on the shoulder and stepped out to dry off ill get breakfast going he announced and chuckled his way down the stairs she was he thought as easy to see through as a chainlink fence kate worked with laura shoulder to shoulder throughout the morning she told herself the minute they had a real break in traffic she would sit laura down and explain about her plans she would of course continue to take care of the books a few evenings a week the occasional sundaythat would be enough for her to run pretenses finances naturally she would be very busy as a partner at bittle but she would also be in a position to delegate a great deal of the grunt work that she had been accustomed to handling herself she would have more leeway more freedom and of course more clout her schedule would be crammed but she was used to that working at the shop had certainly kept her busy but it had also given her large chunks of free time that werent necessary she told herself she would be glad to have her hours prioritized again that was her way and she would be thrilled not to have to chitchat with strangers not to be asked to give fashion opinions or have a say in giftgiving decisions what a relief it would be to settle back at her computer and not have to speak to a soul for hours on end my sisters going to be thrilled with that a customer said as kate carefully removed the tag from a coral cashmere tunic i hope she is oh she will be this is her favorite shop and mine too the woman beamed at the varied selections shed placed on the counter i dont know how i managed before you opened up look at the wonderful dent ive made in my christmas shopping getting an early start kate commented and blinked her self back into focus id say everyones going to be happy my mother would never buy herself something as frivolous as this the woman trailed a finger over the delicate lines of a crystal pegasus thats what gifts are for and where else but here could i find an antique pocket watch for my father cashmere for my sister sapphire studs for my daughter a crystal flying horse for my mother and a pair of navy suede ferragamo pumps for me only at pretenses kate said her own spirits lifted by the womans exuberant good nature the customer laughed and stepped back you have the most wonderful place here if you could giftbox everything but the shoes i think ill take one more turn around in case i missed something i have to have take your time smiling to herself kate began to box the selections she caught herself humming as she settled the pocket watch in a bed of cotton well what was wrong with humming there was nothing wrong with enjoying your work even though it wasnt your chosen field being temporary it was like playing at a job she glanced up as laura came down the winding stairs from the second floor chatting with a customer i know margo picked this up on a buying trip to london last year mrs quint oh call me patsy please i shop here so often i feel like were old friends and this is just what i was looking for she gloated over the cherry slanttop writing box laura set on the counter but then i always find what im looking for here thats why im here so often she laughed at herself then caught sight of the crystal horse oh how wonderful how charming someone beat me to it i did the first customer straightened from her survey of jeweled compacts and smiled hes beautiful isnt he gorgeous tell me you have something else like him she begged laura i think we have a winged dragonbaccarat that we havent shelved yet kate in inventory priced but not tagged in the storeroom ill find it as soon as im done here no ill find it i hope if you dont mind waiting a minute not at all you know even my husband likes to shop here patsy confided to kate when laura slipped into the back no small accomplishment that since getting him to stop for a can of peas is a major feat of course i think he likes to come in and look at the pretty girls were here to serve kate affixed a gold seal to the tissue shed wrapped over the cashmere this compact here the first customer tapped on the glass the heartshaped one i think my sisterinlaw would love it just let me get it out for you while the two customers chatted about the compact kate boxed the horse a fresh discussion broke out when laura brought out the dragon when the door opened everyone sighed oh what a gorgeous baby patsy pressed her hands together under her chin why hes an absolute angel he is isnt he margo shifted the baby carrier to show off her son hes seventeen days old business ground to a halt as it was necessary to admire his fingers his nose to comment on how bright and alert his eyes were by the time kate brought the cradle out of the back room and john thomas was settled in it the women had bonded over the baby you should have called me if you wanted to get out for a little while laura scolded id have picked you up mum dropped me off she had some marketing she wanted to do i think her plan is to stock my kitchen so that if were locked in for a year well have provisions margo settled in a chair with the cradle at her side god ive missed this place so hows business the pair who just left kate began pouring tea on their way to lunch yes they became fast friends about fifteen minutes ago over mythical glass animals it was kind of fun to watch this is the first time the shops been empty since we opened this morning laura added were getting a lot of those people who always have their holiday shopping done by thanksgiving and to think how i used to hate them margo sighed i checked with my doctor he says if i keep it to mostly sitting behind the counter i can start coming in a few hours a day starting next week theres no need to rush kate objected were handling it i dont like you handling it without me i can bring j t with me babies mist shoppers brains i thought you were going to interview nannies we are pouting a little margo bent over her son adjusted his blanket soon she doesnt want to share laura murmured i know how it feels when ali was born i she broke off as a trio of fresh customers came in ill take them kate volunteered you two indulge yourself in mommy talk for the next twenty minutes she showed one customer every diamond earring in stock while the second poked through the bricabrac and the third cooed over a napping jt she helped serve tea saved a frantic husband with a lastminute anniversary gift and rehung the castoffs left in the wardrobe room shaking her head at the way some people treated silk she stepped out again new customers were browsing amid a hum of female voices someone had switched on an art deco lamp to test the effect and smooth golden light shimmered in the corner margo was laughing with a customer laura was stretching on her toes to reach a box for a purchase and the baby slept it was a wonderful place she thought suddenly it was a magical little treasure chest filled with the sublime and the foolish crafted she realized by thethree of them from desperation from practicality and most of all from friendship how odd that she had ever considered it a business to be measured in profit and loss overhead and expenditure and odder still that she hadnt realized until this moment how happy she was to be a part of something so risky so ridiculous so entertaining she walked to laura i have an appointment id forgotten about she said quickly can you handle things here until i get back it should only take an hour or so sure but i wont be long she grabbed her purse from behind the counter before laura could ask any questions see you later she called out and bolted wheres she going margo demanded i dont know just out for a little while concerned laura stared through the glass after kate i hope shes all right she wasnt sure that she was it was a test kate told herself going back to bittle gauging her feelings her reaction would be a test the lobby was familiar even comforting with its quiet colors and nononsense furniture chrome and leather efficient and easily cleaned made up the small sitting area where stacks of money time and newsweek were handy for the clients perusal the main receptionist offered kate a quick and slightly embarrassed smile she took the steps as was her habit and passed through the first floor no nonsense here either she mused clerks and computer operators went about their business busy as bees and just as focused on the task at hand one of the mailroom clerks pushed his cart along passing out the afternoon deliveries someones fax was clicking on the second floor the hum of business continued account executives plowed through the daily routine in their own offices the phones were active reminding her that it was after all the middle of the last quarter of the year clients were beginning to call for advice on how to squeeze in more deductions how to defer income until the next tax year how much they might need to contribute to their keoghs or iras of course she thought twice as many would wait until the last week of december and call in a panic it kept accounting interesting she stopped at her old office no one had claimed it she mused her computer and phone sat on the desk but otherwise it was bare the fax machine was silent but she could remember the way it had beeped and clicked along the blinds were closed on the window behind the desk shed often left them that way herself she realized working in artificial light never taking notice of the view the shelf was a handy stretch away from the desk and would have held her research books tax manuals supplies no tchotchkes she thought no distractions and she decided with an inner sigh no style just another bee in the hive good god she was boring kate she turned shaking off the moment of selfpity hello roger what are you doing taking a good look in the mirror she gestured toward her empty office no ones using it no his smile was a little weak as he glanced in theres talk about hiring a new associate theres a lot of talk he added looking back at her face is there she said coolly and im just surprised to see you here that cops been around a lot that doesnt worry me roger i didnt do anything to be worried about no of course you didnt i never believed it i know you too well he glanced over his shoulder the movement jerky and ripe with nerves bittle senior called a full staff meeting last week made the announcement that youd been cleared of any implication now everybodys looking at everybody else wondering thats not surprising is it curious she studied his face still only one person should be worrying as well as wondering dont you think roger the finger pointed at you he said who knows who it might point to next i think detective kusack knows how to do his job then theres the fbi what do you mean the fbi tampering with tax forms is a federal offense nobody tampered with the forms filed with the irs nobody fucked with the government just with me and a few clients you bastard his head snapped back as if shed slapped him what the hell are you talking about youre sweating you know i dont believe ive ever seen you sweat before not in bed not when you told me one of my top accounts was transferring to you but youre sweating now when she started to pass him he grabbed her arm dont be ridiculous are you actually accusing me of doctoring files you son of a bitch you knew where i kept all my records you knew just how to pull it off and point the finger at me you found out about my father too didnt you fury was pouring through her hot blood and you had the nerve to come on to me again after what youd done i couldnt figure out why you were suddenly interested in me again just another way to cover your ass you dont know what youre talking about yeah he was sweating she noted scared scared as a fucking rabbit caught in oncoming headlights she hoped to god he suffered take your hand off me roger and do it now he only tightened his grip leaned closer no way you can prove any of this if you try to put this off on me youre going to look like a fool i dumped you i got that account because im better im more innovative i work harder you got that account because you slept with a lonely vulnerable woman like you never slept with a client he said in a furious undertone no i never did and you took the money because you were greedy because it was easy and youd found a way to set me up im warning you kate if you go to bittle and try to put me on the hot seat ill what she tossed back her eyes alight with eager challenge exactly what is there a problem here newman glided down the hall in her eerily silent way her mouth was pursed as usual in disapproval kate sent her a feral smile i dont believe there is she jerked her arm out of his loosened grip is there roger i believe mr bittles expecting me ms newman i called in on the car phone hell see you now your phones ringing mr thornhill if youll come with me ms powell newman glanced over her shoulder once measuring roger as he stood grimfaced in the hall then looked down when kate rubbed her aching arm are you all right im fine she drew in a breath as newman opened the door to bittles office thank you kate bittle rose from behind his desk held out a hand in welcome im very glad you called he closed both hands around hers very glad thank you for seeing me please sit what can we get you nothing im fine ms newman inform the partners that kate is here no please thats not necessary id like to speak just with you as you wish thatll be all ms newman he took the chair beside kate rather than the one behind his desk i wish i could tell you about the progress on the investigation but detective kusack asks more questions than he answers im not here about that she thought of roger no she wouldnt point the finger not yet she would let him stew and sweat and she would find a way to prove what hed done then shed watch him fry i came about your offer good pleased he sat back folded his hands were very anxious to have you back were all agreed that the partners could use some fresh young blood its too easy for a firm such as this to become stodgy it isnt stodgy mr bittle this is a good firm ive just started to realize how much i benefited from my years here without any idea of what she was going to say she too folded her hands in her lap first i want to say that ive thought about what happened a great deal and come to the conclusion that under the circumstances you did what you had to do what i would have done in your position i appreciate that kate very much appreciate it my mistake was in not facing it and maybe im starting to give myself a break about that too i cant always handle things by myself i dont always have all the answers she let out a little breath that was a tough one to admit mr bittle i had one goal when i got my mba that was to work my way up in this firm to a partnership working for you was one of the best experiences of my life i knew that if i made it here if i met your standards and became a partner it meant i was the best it was very important to me to be the best this firm has never had an associate with a finer work ethic while i realize the timing of our offer might worry you ill assure you again that our regret for your involvement in this police matter has nothing whatever to do with the terms of partnership i know that it means a great deal to me to know that she opened her mouth acceptance hovering on her tongue then shook her head im sorry mr bittle i cant come back here kate he reached out to take her hand again believe me when i say i understand your discomfort i expect that youd be reluctant to accept until this matter is completely cleared up were certainly willing to give you time its not a matter of time or maybe it is ive had time to readjust reevaluate for the past few months ive deviated from the path i set for myself when i was still in high school i like it mr bittle no ones more surprised than i am that im happy running a secondhand shop on cannery row but i am and im not willing to give it up he sat back tapping his fingertips together as he did when he faced a knotty problem let me talk to you a moment as an old friend someone whos known you most of your life of course youre goaloriented kate youve put all your time and effort into achieving success in your chosen field a field i might add that youre eminently suited for now perhaps youve needed a break we all do from time to time he spread his fingers tapped them together again but to lose sight of that goal to settle in a position youre not only overqualified for but unsuited for is a waste of time and talent any adequate bookkeeper could handle the daily finances of a shop and a highschool girl can ring up sales youre right delighted to hear it all put into logical unemotional terms she smiled at him youre completely right mr bittle well then kate if youd like a few more days to sort out your thoughts no ive got them sorted ive told myself basically the same thing youve just said to me what im doing makes absolutely no sense its illogical irrational and emotional its probably a mistake too but i have to make it you see its our shop margos and lauras and mine its our dream chapter twenty she copped a bottle of champagne from the shop then decided to go one better and attempt to cook a meal she had a tacit agreement with byron that he would cook and she would wash up as he was lightyears ahead of her in culinary skills but since this was to be a celebration of a new stage of her life she wanted to give it a shot shed always considered cooking a kind of mathematical skill she could handle the formulas like calculus calculate the answer but she didnt particularly enjoy the process wrapped in a bib apron her sleeves rolled up past the elbows she lined up her ingredients like elements in a physics lab first the antipasto she decided and warily eyed the mushrooms shed washed it couldnt be easy to stuff them with cheese but the recipe claimed it could be done she removed the stems and chopped them fine as directed following the steps she cooked them with the green onions and garlic and found herself smiling at the scent by the time shed finished with the bread crumbs and cheese and spices she was enthralled with herself it wasnt long before she was happily smearing the stuffing mixture into the caps then popping them into the oven there were cucumbers to marinate peppers to slice tomatoes to deal with oh rightand the olives she fought with the lid on a jar of plump black olives cursing it as the oven timer beeped out came the mushrooms she was in control she told herself as she sucked on the thumb shed brushed against the hot baking dish it was just a matter of efficiency what the hell came next she sliced cheese struggled over the perfect consistency for the basil and olive oil she wanted for the bread she intended to serve an emergency call to mrs williamson the cook at templeton house calmed her down enough that she could arrange the antipasto meticulously on a platter where the hell was byron she wondered and nibbled her nails over the recipe for pasta con pesto coarsely chopped basil leaves she read what the devil did coarsely chopped mean exactly and why the hell did you have to grate parmesan when anybody with half a brain could buy a nice can of it in the market and where was she going to find pine nuts she found them in a labeled canister in his cupboard she should have known he would have them the man had everything that had to do with eating preparing to eat and serving eats the carefully measured ingredients went into the blender deciding that a little prayer couldnt hurt she closed one eye sent it up and hit the switch everything whirled satisfactorily smug now kate put water on to boil for the pasta and set the table excuse me byron said from the kitchen doorway i seem to have walked into the wrong house very funny the dogs who had been keeping her company and keeping an eye out for scraps dashed to greet him since hed followed his nose and his curiosity straight into the kitchen he still had his briefcase with him he set it aside now to pet the dogs and grin foolishly at kate you dont cook dont doesnt mean cant anxious for feedback she took a mushroom off the platter and popped it into his mouth well its good good she arched a brow just good surprisingly good he ventured youre wearing an apron of course im wearing an apron im not getting splatters all over me you look so domestic he slid his hands over her shoulders kissed her hello i like it dont get used to it this is pretty much a oneshot deal she went to the refrigerator to take out the champagne i remember when josh went through this phase and wanted to marry donna reed donna reed after opening the door to let the dogs streak out byron settled on a stool well she did look pretty hot in those aprons now that i think about it he got over it and decided hed rather go for miss february with a quick efficient twist she popped the cork of course he always wanted margo anyway donna and miss d cup were just distractions she took flutes out of the cabinet and turned back with a wicked grin now if i have the line right i say and how was your day dear it was good this is better he took the glass shed filled for him toasted her whats the occasion im glad you realize there has to be one for me to go through this mess she blew out a breath as she looked around the kitchen no matter that shed tried to be careful there was a hell of a cleanup in store why do you do it you know cook i enjoy it youre a sick man byron your waters boiling donna oh right she picked up the clear canister of pasta frowned at it you take this stuff out of the box and put it in here okay for aesthetics i guess but how am i supposed to know how much is ten ounces estimate i know that goes against the grain for you but we all have to live dangerously now and again he watched her worry over it started to tell her she was putting in too much then shrugged it was her dinner after all in any case he found himself easily distracted by the way the neat bow of the apron strings accented her tidy little butt just how would it look if she was naked under that sturdy white apron at his laugh she glanced around what nothing he drank more wine just an unexpected and slightly embarrassing fantasy it passed mostly why dont you tell me what happened to set you off on this domestic campaign ill tell you i wasshit i forgot the bread her brow furrowed as she slid the pan into the oven adjusted the heat and timer theres no way you can hold a conversation and deal with all the details of a meal in progress why dont you put on some music light the candles do that kind of stuff while i finish this all right he rose started out turned back katherine about that little fantasy amused at himself he shook his head maybe well try it later too preoccupied to pay attention she waved him away and got back to business she thought shed managed very well when they were settled at the table scents wafting candles flickering and otis redding crooning on the stereo i could handle doing this she decided after shed sampled and approved the pasta about once a year its fabulous really and very much appreciated its quite a feeling coming home to a pretty woman and a homecooked meal i had some excess energy she broke bread offered him half i thought about just dragging you up to the bedroom when you walked in then i figured that could wait until after dinner anyway i was hungry my appetites definitely improved in the last few months so has your stress level he commented youve stopped popping aspirin and antacids like candy it was true she admitted she had and she certainly felt better than she remembered feeling in years well ive done something today that is going to either keep me on that same route or send me back to the pharmacy she took a hard look at the bubbles in her wine swallowed some i turned down the partnership did you he laid a hand over hers toyed with her fingers are you okay with that i think so out of curiosity she said you dont sound very surprised i didnt know i was going to turn it down until i was sitting in mr bittles office maybe your head didnt know it but your gut did or your heart youve wrapped yourself up in pretenses kate its yours why would you give it up to be a part of something someone else had built because its what ive always wanted always aimed for a bit unsure of him she shrugged her shoulders it turned out it was enough just to know i was good enough its a little scary changing directions this way its not that radical a change he corrected youre partners in a business in charge of accounts my degree all that education you dont really believe thats wasted do you its part of who you are kate youre just using it in a different way i just couldnt go back to that office to thatlife she decided it all seemed so rigid margo was in the shop today with the baby people were fussing over him and margo was sitting there with the cradle beside her and laura had to look for this winged dragon and i boxed a pocket watch and put away shoes embarrassed she trailed off im babbling i never babble its all right i get the drift youre having fun working there being part of it youre enjoying the surprises of something you helped create i never liked surprises i always wanted to know the when where and how so i could be prepared you make mistakes if you arent prepared and i hate making mistakes are you doing something that feels right to you it looks that way well then he lifted his glass touched it to hers go for it wait until i tell margo and laura the idea of it made her laugh margo was gone when i got back and laura had to run pick up the girls so i didnt have the chance of course were going to have to make some changes its ridiculous not to have a regular posted schedule of our work hours and the pricing system needs to be completely overhauled the new software ive just installed will completely streamline our she caught herself and found him grinning at her you cant change overnight you shouldnt change at all thats the kind of thing they need you for play to your strengths kid which apparently include italian cooking this pesto is terrific really she sampled more herself it is kind of good well maybe i could throw something together on special occasions you wont get an argument from me thoughtfully he twirled pasta on his fork speaking of special occasions now that youre going to continue to be selfemployed you should be able to flex your schedule a bit for a variety of reasons im not going to be able to get back to atlanta for christmas so im making plans to take a few days for the trip over thanksgiving thats nice she refused to acknowledge the thud of dis appointment im sure your family will be happy to have you even for a few days id like you to come with me what her fork paused halfway to her mouth id like you to come to atlanta with me for thanksgiving and meet my family ii cant i cant just fly across the country like that theres not enough time to you have the best part of a month to arrange your schedule atlantas not bora bora kate its georgia i know where atlanta is she said testily look besides the time factor thanksgivings a family holiday you dont just bring someone and dump them on your family on thanksgiving youre not someone he said quietly oh it was panic in her eyes all right he could read it perfectly though it irritated him he determined to follow through its traditional where i come from to invite the woman whos important to you to meet your family to have them meet her particularly if its the woman youre in love with and want to marry she jerked back as if scalded nearly knocking over the chair as she sprang to her feet wait a minute hold it whoa where did that come from i cook one stupid meal and you get delusions of grandeur i love you kate i want to marry you it would mean a great deal to me if youd spend a few days with my family im sure margo and laura would be willing to adjust the work schedule to accommodate a short trip over the holiday it took several tries before the sounds coming out of her mouth could be fashioned into words how can you sit there like that and calmly talk about scheduling in the same breath as marriage have you gone insane i thought youd appreciate the practicality not sure who was irritating him more himself or kate he topped off his wine well i dont so just stop it i dont know where you got this brainstorm about marriage but i wouldnt call it a brainstorm he said contemplating his glass ive given it quite a bit of thought oh have you have you really temper began to bubble beneath panic preferring it kate let it spew thats how you work isnt it thats how byron de witt works in his quiet thoughtful patient way i see it all now she fumed storming around the center island i cant believe i didnt see it all along how clever you are byron how canny how fucking devious youve just been reeling me in havent you taking over step by little step youre going to need to explain that for me what have i taken over exactly me and dont think i cant see it all perfectly now first it was sex its hard to think rationally when youre nothing more than one big throbbing gland he might have laughed but instead carefully chose an olive as i recall the sex was as much your idea as mine more actually in the beginning dont try to confuse the issue she spat out slamming her hands on the counter far be it from me to confuse the issue with facts keep going then it was the letsgetkatehealthy campaign hospitals damn doctors medicine i suppose it would be confusing the issue again to point out that you had an ulcer i was handling it i could have gotten myself to the doctor just fine on my own then youre cooking and feeding me all this healthy stuff youve got to have a decent breakfast kate you really should cut back on the coffee a little and before i know it im eating regular meals and exercising byron ran his tongue around his teeth stared down at his plate im so ashamed setting this diabolical trap for you its unforgivable dont you get glib with me buster you bought puppies you tuned up my car he rubbed his hands over his face before he rose now i got the dogs and fixed your car in order to blind you to my evil plot kate youre making a fool of yourself i am not i know perfectly well when im making a fool of myself and im not you set everything up in clever little stages until im practically living here honey he said with a mix of affection and exasperation you are living here see she threw up her hands im living with you without even realizing it im cooking meals for gods sake ive never cooked for a man in my entire life havent you touched he moved forward reached for her dont you do that still blazing she retreated behind the island youve got a hell of a nerve confusing things like this i told you you werent my type that it wasnt going to work his patience straining he rocked back on his heels the hell with types it has been working and youre perfectly aware of just how well it works with us i love you and if you werent so damn pigheaded youd admit that you love me dont you assume my feelings de witt fine then im in love with you deal with it i dont have to deal with it you have to deal with it and as far as your halfassed proposal of marriage i didnt propose marriage he said coolly i told you i want you to marry me i didnt ask you just what are you afraid of kate that im a replay of that jerk thornhill who used you until something more appetizing came along she went cold just how do you know about roger youve been poking around in my business havent you and why am i not surprised it was no use biting his tongue now better he thought to play it out when someone is as important to me as you are her business is important to me her welfare is important to me so i made it my business to find out you mentioned his name to kusack ive kept in touch with kusack youve kept in touch with kusack she repeated you know it was roger who set me up he nodded and apparently so do you i just figured it out this afternoon but at a guess id say youve known a bit longer and didnt find it necessary to mention it to me the trail led back to him a personal clash between the two of you access to your office he made phone calls to new hampshire around the time you were told about your father how do you know about the phone calls joshs investigator accessed the information joshs investigator she repeated so josh knows too but still no one thought it necessary to pass any of this handy information along to me it wasnt passed to you because youd have stormed right up into thornhills face and blasted him the way byron admitted hed wanted to take thornhills face apart with his fists we didnt want him tipped off before the investigation is complete you didnt want she shot back too bad because ive already blasted him and ruined your neat plans you had no right to work around me to take over my life i have every right to do whatever i can to protect you and to help you and thats what ive done thats what im going to continue to do whether i like it or not essentially im not roger thornhill im not and ive never used you for anything no youre not a user byron do you know what you are youre a handler thats what you do you handle people its what makes you so good at your jobthat patience that charm that skill at easing people onto your side of an issue without them ever really seeing theyve been maneuvered well heres a flash for you i will not be handled i sure as hell wont be maneuvered into marriage just a damn minute he shifted to block her path before she could storm out when he closed his fingers around her arm she yelped afraid that hed misjudged his strength in temper he jerked back holding her arm much more gently but the bruises he saw on her arm were already formed the haze that smothered his brain was dark and ugly what the hell is this he demanded her heart thudded hard into her throat as his eyes snapped to hers let go of me who put these marks on you her chin angled in defense the fury hardening his eyes was as lethal as the slice of a wellhoned sword ive seen your white knight routine already byron im not interested in a reprise who touched you he said spacing each word carefully someone else who couldnt take no for an answer she snapped she regretted the words bitterly before they were fully formed but it was too late his eyes went carefully blank smoothly he stepped out of her path youre mistaken his voice was cool and calm and deliberate i can take no for an answer and since that seems to be the case we dont seem to have anything left to discuss ill apologize for that she felt the heat of shame burning her cheeks it was uncalled for but i dont appreciate your interference in my business or your assumption that id just fall into your plans understood hurt was a rusty ball of heat in his gut as i said that seems to end it its clear you were right from the beginning we want different things and this isnt going to work he walked over to the table more to distance himself from her than because he wanted the wine he picked up and drank you can get your things now or at your convenience i she stared at him stunned that he could close the door between them so neatly i donti cantim going she managed and fled he listened for the slam of the door then sat as carefully as an old man he put his head back closed his eyes it was a wonder he thought that she could assume he was such a brilliant strategist when a blind man on a galloping horse could see just how badly hed bungled it she went home of course where else did you go when you were wounded the scene she burst in on in the parlor was so cheerful so familial so much what she had just been offered and refused that she wanted to scream josh sat in the wing chair near the fire the pretty lights from the flickering flames playing over him and his sleeping son laura her younger daughter at her feet poured coffee into pretty china cups margo snuggled on the end of the couch with ali so they could pore over a fashion magazine together kate laura glanced up with a welcoming smile youre just in time for coffee i bribed josh to bring the baby over with one of mrs williamsons honeyglazed hams he might have left a few scraps margo added if youre hungry i only had seconds you had seconds twice uncle josh kayla pointed out and got up as she had every few minutes to peek at the baby stool pigeon he tweaked her nose aunt kates mad ali straightened up on the couch in anticipation youre mad at somebody arent you aunt kate your face is red so it is margo drawled when she took a closer look and i think i hear her teeth grinding out kate pointed a finger at josh you and i were going to go round later but right now go away and take your testosterone with you i never go anywhere without it he said easily and im comfortable right here i dont want to see a man if i do see a man in the next sixty seconds ill have to kill him with my bare hands he sniffed feigning insult but he rose im taking jt into the library for port and cigars were going to talk about sports and power tools can i come uncle josh of course he gave kayla his free hand im no sexist bedtime in thirty minutes kayla laura called out ali why dont you go keep uncle josh company until bedtime i want to stay here she poked out her bottom lip and folded her arms over her chest i dont have to leave just because aunt kates going to shout and swear im not a baby let her stay kate made a grand sweeping gesture with her arms she cant learn too early what men are really like yes she can laura corrected allison go into the library with your uncle or go upstairs and have your bath i always have to do what you say i hate it ali stormed out stomping up the stairs to sulk alone well that was pleasant laura murmured and wondered yet again what had happened to her sweet compliant ali what cheerful note would you like to add to that kate men are pigs she grabbed a cup of coffee and downed it like whiskey chapter twentyone and your point is margo said after a long moment what do we need them for anyway what possible purpose do they have other than procreation and with advances in technology well be taking care of that in a lab soon very pleasant laura decided and poured another cup perhaps we dont need them for sex but i still depend on them for largeinsect disposal speak for yourself margo put it id rather kill spiders than give up sex what crime did byron commit kate or do we get to guess the sneak the conniving son of a bitch i cant believe i was idiot enough to fall into a relationship with a man like that you never really know a person do you never really know whats behind their beady little eyes kate what did he do whatever it is im sure its not as bad as you think as kate tore off her coat lauras gaze settled on the bruises she was on her feet in a blink dear god kate did he hit you what oh she dismissed the bruises with a wave of the hand no of course he didnt hit me i got this bumping into something warped at bittle byron wouldnt hit a woman its too direct an approach for someone like him well what for christs sake did he do margo demanded ill tell you what he did ill tell you what he did she repeated as she stormed around the room he asked me to marry him when this was met with silence she whirled did you hear what i said he asked me to marry him laura considered and he has what a closet full of the heads of his former wives you are not listening to me you are not getting it struggling for calm kate breathed deep pushed at her hair okay he cooks pushes vitamins on me gets me working out he gets my juices all stirred up so im ready to fall onto any handy surface and have incredible sex he goes to see kusack hes been working with josh behind my back tries to get all the worry out of my life he sees to it that i have a closet so that i can just start leaving my clothes over there of course hes bought that house she continued pacing and those damn dogs that anyone with half a heart would fall for my car hasnt run better since the day i drove it off the lot and regularly so you hardly notice he brings flowers home not flowers margo pressed a hand to her breast good god the man is a fiend he must be stopped just shut up margo i know youre not on my side youre never on my side certain of lauras loyalty kate dropped down on her knees in front of her clutched her hands he asked me to go with him to atlanta over thanksgiving and meet his parents he says he loves me and wants me to marry him darling all sympathy laura pressed kates hands i can see that youve been through an ordeal tonight obviously the man is deranged im sure josh can arrange to have him committed stunned kate yanked her hands away you have to be on my side she insisted you want me to feel sorry for you the flash of anger in lauras eyes had kate blinking noyes ino i just want you to understand ill tell you what i understand you have a man who loves you a good considerate thoughtful man whos willing to share the burdens of living as well as the pleasures with you who wants you who cares enough to make an effort to make you happy to make your life run a little more smoothly one who wants you in bed and out one who cares enough to want you to meet his family because he loves them and wants to show you off to them and thats not good enough for you no i didnt say that its just she got to her feet staggered by the heat i didnt plan thats your problem laurasmall delicateboned and furiousrose as well it has to be in tidy order in kates plan well lifes messy i know i meant riding on a fury and frustration she herself hadnt guessed at laura barreled over kates protest and if you dont think yours is adequate try mine try having nothing and her voice was bitter an empty marriage a man who wanted your name more than you and didnt even pretend otherwise after he had you try coming home every night knowing theres not going to be anyone there to hold you that all the problems that need fixing come to you that you have no one to lean on and having your daughter blame you for not being good enough to keep her father under the same roof she stalked over to stare at the crackling flames of the fire while her friends watched in silence try feeling unloved unwanted and crawling into bed every night wondering how youre going to make it work how you can possibly make it right again then come crying to me im sorry kate murmured laura im so sorry no exhausted and ashamed laura moved away from kates comforting hand and sat again no im sorry i dont know where that came from she leaned her head back against the cushion a moment her eyes shut as the last of the temper drained away yes i do maybe im jealous she opened her eyes again and managed a smile or maybe i just think youre stupid i should have moved back in here after peter left kate began i should have realized how much you were dealing with alone oh stop its not about me im just a little raw laura rubbed her aching temples that wasnt the first goround ali and i had today it makes me edgy i can move in now kate sat down beside laura not that youre not welcome laura told her but youre not moving in blocked that escape route margo murmured im not looking for escape kate struggled to get a grip on her tumbling emotions i could help with the girls share the expenses no this is my life laura grimaced such as it is you have your own if you dont love byron thats one thing you cant tailor your feelings to suit him are you kidding margo reached for the coffeepot shes been crosseyed over him for months so what emotions arent any guarantee when it comes to something as big as marriage they werent enough for laura kate sighed shrugged im sorry but they werent no they werent if you want guarantees send in your warranty card when you buy a toaster okay youre right but thats not the whole point cant you see he was playing me hes been handling me all through this relationship margo made a low feline sound being handled by a strong gorgeous man poor you you know very well what i mean youd never let josh push all the buttons make all the moves im telling you that byron has a way of undermining things so that im sliding along in the direction hes chosen before i realize it so change directions if you dont like the destination margo suggested he called me a detour once remembering kate scowled he said he liked taking long interesting detours i actually thought it was sort of charming why dont you go back and talk this out with him instead of arguing laura tilted her head well able to imagine the scene that had taken place in byrons kitchen hes probably feeling just as unhappy and frustrated as you are i cant kate shook her head he told me to pick up my things at my convenience ouch margo looked at kate with genuine sympathy now in that polite mannerly tone of his exactly its the worst besides i dont know what id say to him i dont know what i want at a loss she buried her face in her hands i keep thinking i know what i want then it shifts on me im tired its too hard to think rationally when im tired then talk to him tomorrow youll stay here tonight laura rose i have to put the girls to bed shes made me so ashamed kate murmured when she was alone with margo i know margo slid closer at least all she made me feel was like killing peter ridgeway if he ever shows his sorry face around here i didnt realize she was still so hurt so unhappy shell be all right margo patted kates knee well see to it im ah not going to go into another accounting firm of course youre not everybody seems to know what im going to do before i do kate griped bittle offered me a partnership congratulations i turned him down this afternoon my my margos milliondollar smile flashed havent we had a busy day and roger thornhill is the embezzler what margos cup clinked into its saucer that slimy weasel who twotimed you with your own client the very same it pleased kate to see that she could say something that got a rise out of margo it was the way he acted when i ran into him at bittle today hes smart enough to have figured out how to siphon funds and i was his main competition for the partner slot he gets a little playing money and screws me at the same time youve been to kusack with this no apparently byron the cop and your husband whom i will deal with shortly already knew and left you in the dark understanding perfectly margo pulled kate to her feet occasionally men have to be reminded that they are no longer hunting out of caves fighting dragons or blazing trails west while we huddle around the fire ill help you remind josh at nine fortyfive the next morning kate opened the till at pretenses she would run the shop alone that morning she took some pride in her competence laura was at her office at the hotel and margo remained on maternity leave she decided to relish these last few minutes before she unlocked the door turned the sign to open shed brought her own cds margo preferred classical kate preferred the classics the beatles the stones cream after putting the music on she went into the powder room filled the copper watering can she was going to enjoy the pleasant little duties of nurturing an elegant business she told herself she was not going to think about byron de witt he was in the penthouse suite by now probably in some meeting or on a conference call he might be glancing over an itinerary for a trip to san francisco didnt he say he had to fly up didnt matter she reminded herself and stepped out on the veranda to water the tubs of pansies and impatiens he could fly anywhere he wantedto the moon for that matter her interest in his affairs was over finished a closed book she had her life to worry about didnt she after all she was beginning a whole new phase a new career with a new goal to aim for she had dozens of ideas to improve and expand the shop floating around in her head once margo was back in gear they would have a meeting an efficiency meeting then there was the fashion show right around the corner the advertising had to be placed they needed to discuss other promotions for the holidays what they needed was a regular weekly brainstorming and progress meeting she would set it up fix it into the schedule you couldnt run a successful business without regular structured meetings you couldnt run a life without structure without specific plans and goals why the hell couldnt he see that she had specific plans and goals how could he have thrown marriage at her knocking down all of her carefully placed pins you didnt marry someone youd known barely a full year there were stages to a relationship careful cautious and sensible stages maybe just maybe after two years after youd worked out the kinks in the relationship after you fully understood each others faults and foibles and had learned to accept them or compromise on them you began to discuss the possibility of marriage you had to outline what you wanted out of marriage assign roles and duties who handled the marketing who paid the bills who took out the trash for gods sake marriage was a business a partnership a fullscale commitment sensible people didnt just jump into it without first finetuning the details and what about children it was obvious who had the childrenif there were going to be childrenbut what about assignment of responsibilities diapers and laundry feedings and doctors appointments if you didnt nail down the details of responsibilities you had nothing but chaosand a baby needing to be taken care of by a responsible adult a baby oh god what would it be like to have a baby she didnt know anything about having a baby think of all the books she would have to read all the mistakes she was bound to make there were so many things you had to have for a baby strollers and car seats and cribs and all those adorable little clothes she thought dreamily youre drowning those pansies ms powell she jerked back slopping water on her shoes she stared blankly at kusack while her mind whirled she had just all but named a baby she hadnt conceived with a man she didnt intend to conceive it with daydreaming his lips curved in that now familiar paternal fashion no i she wasnt a daydreamer she was a thinker a doer ive got a lot on my mind bet you do thought id catch you before you opened up do you mind if we go inside no of course not still fumbling she set the watering can down and opened the door its just me today my partners arearent here i wanted to talk to you alone i didnt mean to spook you ms powell no thats all right her speeding heart seemed to have settled back to a reasonable rate what can i do for you detective actually i just came by to catch you up on the progress of the investigation i figured after the trouble you went through you deserve to know how it panned out well that makes one of you she murmured your boyfriend nudged me toward roger thornhill hes not my boyfriend kate said quickly then set her teeth if youre referring to mr de witt i am he smiled a bit sheepishly and tugged on his ear i never know how to refer to these kinds of things anyway mr de witt nudged me toward thornhill fact is i was already looking in that direction you dont look shocked speechless by the news he commented i figured it out yesterday she shrugged her shoulders discovering it simply didnt matter any longer thought you would thornhills got a little gambling problem gamblings one of the best reasons to need quick money roger gambles that did shock her you mean he bets on horse races that sort of thing he bets on wall street ms powell and hes been losing steady for the past couple of years overplayed his hand so to speak and lost his ante then there was his personal relationship with you then add in the information about your father and the fact that he was the one who found the newspaper article in your office and passed it to bittle really she nodded i didnt know that a little too pat to my way of thinking connections usually arent coincidences in my line of work you had a little runin with him yesterday at bittle and how do you know about that ms newman shes got good eyes and ears and a sharp nose he grinned i asked her to report any unusual incident officewise shes another who didnt like the way thornhill smelled so to speak and she stood by you from the start excuse me kate tapped her ear as though her hearing had gone suddenly off newman stood by me first interview i had with her on this business she said if i was looking in your direction i was looking in the wrong one she said katherine powell wouldnt steal so much as a paper clip i see i always thought she disliked me i dont know whether she likes you or not but she respects you are you going to bring roger in for questioning then already have i had to move a little quicker after i learned youd had a faceoff with him so i paid him a little visit last night he was already packed and on his way to the airport youre kidding no maam had reservations for a flight to rio hes been living on the edge since you were cleared whatever you said to him at the office yesterday broke his nerve he lawyered himself pretty quick but we figure to cut a deal by the end of the day they call this sort of thing a victimless crime i guess thats a misnomer this time around i dont feel like a victim kate murmured i dont know what i feel well id feel right pissedif youll pardon my french but he shrugged his shoulders his careers in the toilet and hes going to be paying off fines and his lawyer for a long time to come and the federal government is going to have him as their guest for a while hell go to prison as her father would have gone to prison she thought for a mistake an error in judgment a moment of greed like i said were cutting a deal but i dont see him walking away without doing some time you know the way things work today you could sue him yourself defamation of character emotional pain and suffering all that your lawyer would tell you im not interested in suing roger im interested in turning the page i figured that he smiled at her again youre a nice woman ms powell its been a pleasure meeting you even under the circumstances she thought about it i suppose i have to say the same detective kusack even under the circumstances he stepped toward the door stopped its about opening time isnt it she glanced at her watch just about i wonder he tugged on his ear again my wifes got this birthday coming up tomorrow actually detective kusack she beamed at him youve come to the right place kate told herself she felt wonderful revived all of her troubles were behind her she was starting the next phase of her life there was no reason to be nervous about going to byrons it was the middle of the daylunchtime he wouldnt be home she would simply pick up her things as hed requested and thereby close that chapter cleanly she would not regret it was fun while it lasted nothing lasted forever all good things came to an end and if another cliche popped into her mind she would scream she pulled into his driveway the key she had meticulously removed from her own ring was in her pocket but when she reached in to pull it out she found herself holding seraphinas coin baffled she stared at it she would have sworn shed put that in the top drawer of her jewelry box she turned it in her hand the sun caught the edge and shot out dazzling light that was why her eyes watered she told herself it was the reflection off the gold and shed taken off her sunglasses it wasnt because she felt a sudden wrenching connection to that young girl standing on the cliff ready to throw her life away kate powell was not throwing her life away she told herself firmly she was facing it only the weak tossed away hope she had years of happiness left in her life years and she was not going to stand here and cry over some old coin and a misty legend this was reality she blinked back tears her reality and she knew exactly what she was doing she found the key replaced the coin in her pocket but it was harder than shed imagined to use the key knowing it would be the last time it was just a house she thought there was no reason for her to love it no reason to feel this aching sense of welcome when she opened the door there was no reason at all for her to walk to the glass doors and want to weep because the pups were napping in the sunshine and geraniums were blooming in gray stone pots wind chimes of copper and brass sang in the breeze from the sea shells that she had gathered with byron from the beach were arranged in a widemouthed glass bowl on the redwood table it was so perfect she realized so simply perfect that was why she wanted to weep when the dogs heads popped up in unison and they scrambled up to bark and race she realized she hadnt heard the car but they had they reacted just that way whenever they recognized the sound of byrons return home jolted with panic she turned around and faced the door as he came in im sorry she said immediately i didnt realize youd be home early i dont suppose you did but hed known thanks to lauras call that she would be there i came to get my things i i thought it best to come by when you were at work so it would be less awkward its awkward now he stepped toward her eyes narrowed youve been crying no not really it was her fingers slid into her pocket touched the coin it was something else entirely and then i guess it was the dogs they looked so sweet sleeping in the yard they were at the door now tails waving furiously ill miss them sit down no i really cant i want to get back to the shop and and i do want to apologize byron for shouting at you the way i did i really am sorry for that and id hate to think we couldnt at least be civil she closed her eyes on her own absurdity this is very awkward he wanted to touch her badly wanted to touch her but he knew his own limitations if he so much as brushed his hand over that short cap of hair he would want to touch more have to touch more until he was holding her against him and begging then lets try being civil if you wont sit well stand there are a few things id like to say he watched her open her eyes saw the wariness in them what the hell did she see when she looked at him he wondered why couldnt he tell im going to apologize as well i handled things badly last night and at the risk of getting kicked in the teeth again i admit that you werent that far off the mark in some of your lets call them observations about my character he walked to the doors jingling the change in his pocket the dogs still hopeful sat sentry on the other side of the glass i do plan things out we have that in common i admit i eased you into living here it seemed to me that it would help both of us get used to it because i wanted you here when he turned back to her she struggled for a reply but found none i wanted to take care of you you see vulnerability as a weakness i see it as a soft appealing side of a strong intelligent and resilient woman its in my nature to protect to fixor at least try to fixwhats wrong i cant change that for you i dont want you to change byron but i cant change either im always going to resist being guided along however well intentioned it might be and when i see someone i love stressed out to the point of illness taken advantage of hurt im going to do whatever it takes to turn it around and when i want something when i know its right im going to work toward making it happen i love you kate her heart swam into her eyes filled them i dont know how to handle this i dont know what to do i cant figure it out ive figured it out you know every once in a while it doesnt hurt to let someone else figure it out maybe i dont know but there were points in all of this i had to come to myself i didnt even realize some of them theyve arrested roger i know of course you do she tried to laugh then turned away when kusack came by and told me i wasnt sure how i felt at first relieved vindicatedbut there was more i thought of my father hed have gone to jail just as roger will go its the same crime the same punishment theyre both thieves kate no let me finish its taken me so long to get here my father made a mistake a criminal mistake as much as it hurts me to know that i also know that he never tried to shift the blame implicate anyone else he wasnt like roger he would have faced what hed done and he would have paid for it i realized today that that made all the difference i can live with that and forgive and remember what he was to me for the first eight years of my life he was my father and he loved me youre a beautiful woman katherine she shook her head brushed away tears i had to get that out it seems i can always pull out whats inside me and hand it to you it worries me how easy it is to do that you worry too much lets see if i can help there well try a simple logic test im thirtyfive years old ive never been married never been engaged never formally lived with a woman before why i dont know she dragged her hands through her hair fighting to use intellect over emotion as she turned back to him there could be a dozen reasons you resisted commitment you were too busy sampling southern delights you were too focused on your career it could have been any of those he agreed but ill tell you what it comes down to i dont like to make mistakes any more than you do im sure there are other women i could be happy with build a decent life with but that isnt enough i waited because i had this image this dream about the woman id share my life with youre not going to tell me i was that image because i know very well i wasnt she stared blankly at the handkerchief he offered what youre crying again when she snatched it away and mopped at her face he continued some of us are more flexible in our dreams and can even enjoy when they take a dif ferent shape look at me kate he said gently and drew her gaze to his ive been waiting for you thats not fair she pressed crossed hands to her swelling heart as she backed away its not fair to say things like that to me we said civil we didnt say anything about fair i dont want to feel this way i dont want to hurt this way why wont you just let me think think about this he did touch her now drawing her in until their faces were close i love you and kissed her i want to spend my life with you i want to take care of you and be taken care of im not the kind of woman people say those things to she thumped her hand on his chest why cant you see that hed have to make sure she got used to hearing those things coming from him his lips curved as he ran his hands up her back noi see it she jerked back out of reach i can actually see that look come into your eyes kate needs to be soothed and stroked and eased into it well its not going to work its just not going to work ive just got things sorted out she fumed stalking around the room ive got the shop isnt it enough of a shock to deal with that i love being there how am i supposed to suddenly adjust to all of this there arent any rules to being in love oh i figured that out all right tossing and turning all night because youd told me to pick up my things at my convenience she spun back and seared him with a look oh that was low yes it was he grinned at her now delighted with the image of her spending as miserable a night as he had im pleased to see it hit the mark you hurt me last night see thats just what happens when you get tangled up in love you hurt each other i didnt ask to be in love with you did i i didnt plan it and now i cant bear the idea of being without you of not sitting at the table in the morning watching you cook breakfast or listening to you tell me to concentrate when youve got me lifting those damn weights walking on the beach with you and those mangy dogs and i want a baby stunned he waited a beat now you see you see what youve done she sank onto the couch and buried her face in her hands listen to what im saying im a mess im insane im in love with you i know all that kate he sat beside her pulled her into his lap it suits me just fine what if it doesnt suit me i could really screw this up thats okay he kissed her cheek nuzzled her head on his shoulder im good at fixing things why dont we look at the big picture and work on the details as we go along she sighed closed her eyes and felt blissfully at home maybe youll be the one to screw it up then youll be there to put everything back in place i depend on you you those words the look in his eyes that showed he meant them were more powerful to her than any declaration of love i want you to i need to know you do and will but marriage is a practical logical step he finished and made her smile it is not and besides you never asked me i know he smiled back at her if i asked you theres a possibility you would say no im not going to let you say no youre just going to ease me into it until its a done deal thats the idea its pretty smart she murmured feeling the beat of his heart under her palm fast and not quite steady she realized maybe he was just as nervous as she was i guess since most of my stuffs here already anyway and i love you so much and ive gotten used to your cooking it isnt such a bad idea being married i mean to you so it looks like your idea worked thank god he pressed her hand to his lips i have been waiting for you kate all my life i know ive been waiting right back he tilted her head back and smiled into her eyes welcome home dream trilogy book finding the dream prologue california it was a long way for a man to travel not only the miles from san diego to the cliffs outside of monterey felipe thought but the years so many years once he had been young enough to walk confidently along the rocks to climb even to race defying the fates celebrating the rush of wind the crash of waves the dizzying heights the rocks had bloomed for him in spring once there had been flowers to pick for seraphina then and he could remember with the clear vision of age looking back to youth how she had laughed and clutched the tough little wildflowers to her breast as if they were precious roses plucked from a welltended bush his eyes were weak now and his limbs were frail but not his memory a strong vital memory in an old body was his penance whatever joy he had found in his life had been tainted always with the sound of seraphinas laughter with the trust in her dark eyes with her young uncompromising love in the more than forty years since he had lost her and the pan of himself that was innocence he had learned to accept his own failings he had been a coward running from battle rather than facing the horrors of war hiding among the dead rather than lifting a sword but he had been young and such things had to be forgiven in the young he had allowed his friends and family to believe him dead slain like a warrior even a hero it had been shame and pride that caused him to do so small things pride and shame life was made up of so many small blocks but he could never forget that it was that shame and that pride that cost seraphina her life weary he sat on a rock to listen to listen to the roar of water battling rock far below to listen to the piercing cry of gulls the rush of wind through winter grass and the air was chilled as he closed his eyes and opened his heart to listen for seraphina she would always be young a lovely darkeyed girl who had never had the chance to grow old as he was old now she hadnt waited but in despair and grief had thrown herself into the sea for love of him he thought now for reckless youth that hadnt lived long enough to know that nothing lasts forever believing him dead she had died hurling herself and her future onto the rocks he had mourned her god knew he had mourned her but he hadnt been able to follow her into the sea instead he had traveled south given up his name and his home and made new ones he had found love again not the sweet first blush of love that he had had with seraphina but something solid and strong built on those small blocks of trust and understanding and on needs both quiet and violent and he had done his best he had children and grandchildren he had a life with all the joys and sorrows that make a man he had survived to love a woman to raise a family to plant gardens he was content with what had grown from him but he had never forgotten the girl he had loved and killed he had never forgotten their dream of a future or the sweet innocent way she had given herself to him when they had loved in secret both of them so young so fresh they dreamed of the life they would have together the home they would build with her dowry the children they would make but war came and he left her to prove himself a man and proved himself a coward instead she had hidden her bride gift the symbol of hope that a young girl treasures to keep it out of american hands felipe had no doubt where she had hidden it he had understood his seraphina her logic her sentiment her strengths and weaknesses though it had meant that he was penniless when he left monterey he had not taken the gold and jewels seraphina had secreted now with the dreams of age that had turned his hair to silver that had dimmed his eyes and lived in his aching bones he prayed that it would be found one day by lovers or dreamers if god was just he would allow seraphina to choose whatever the church preached felipe refused to believe god would condemn a grieving child for the sin of suicide no she would be as he had left her more than forty years ago on these very cliffs forever young and beautiful and full of hope he knew he would not return to this place his time of penance was almost at an end he hoped when he saw his seraphina again she would smile at him and forgive a young mans foolish pride he rose bending in the wind leaning on his cane to keep his feet under him and left the cliffs to seraphina there was a storm brewing marching across the sea a summer storm full of power and light and wild wind in that eerie luminescent light laura templeton sat content on the rock summer storms were the best they would have to go in soon back to templeton house but for now she and her two closest friends would wait and watch she was sixteen a delicately built girl with quiet gray eyes and bright blond hair and as full of energy as any storm i wish we could get in the car and drive right into it margo sullivan laughed the wind was fitful and growing stronger right into it not with you behind the wheel kate powell sneered youve only had your license a week and you already have a rep as a lunatic youre just jealous because itll be months before you can drive because it was true kate shrugged her short black hair fluttered in the wind she took a deep gulp of air loving the way it thickened and churned at least im saving up for a car instead of cutting out pictures of ferraris and jaguars if youre going to dream margo said frowning at a minute chip in the coral polish on her nails dream big ill have a ferrari one day or a porsche or whatever i want her summerblue eyes narrowed with determination i wont settle for some secondhand junker like you would laura let them argue she could have defused the sniping but she understood it was simply part of the friendship and she didnt care about cars not that she didnt enjoy the spiffy little convertible her parents had given her for her sixteenth birthday but one car was the same as another to her she realized it was easier in her position she was the daughter of thomas and susan templeton of the templeton hotel empire her home loomed on the hill behind her stunning under the churning gray sky it was more than the stone and wood and glass that composed it more than the turrets and balconies and lush gardens more than the fleet of servants who kept it shining it was home but she had been raised to understand the responsibilities of privilege within her was a great love of beauty and symmetry and a kindness aligned with that was a need to live up to templeton standards to deserve all shed been given by birthright not only the wealth which even at sixteen she understood but also the love of her family her friends she knew margo always fretted at limitations though they had grown up together at templeton house as close as sisters margo was the daughter of the housekeeper kate had come to templeton house when her parents had been killed an eightyearold orphan she was cherished absorbed into the family as much a part of the templetons as laura and her older brother josh laura and margo and kate were as close as perhaps closer than sisters who shared blood but laura never forgot that the templeton responsibility was hers and one day she thought she would fall in love marry and have children she would carry on the templeton tradition the man who came for her who swept her up in his arms who made her belong to him would be everything shed ever wanted together they would build a life create a home carve out a future as polished and perfect as templeton house as she pictured it dreams budded in her heart delicate color bloomed on her cheeks while the wind tossed her blond curls around them lauras dreaming again margo commented her grin flashed transforming her striking face to stunning got seraphina on the brain again kate asked hmm no she hadnt been thinking of seraphina but she did now i wonder how often she came here dreaming of the life she wanted with felipe she died in a storm like the one thats coming i know she did margo lifted her face to the sky with lightning flashing the wind howling suicides drama enough by itself kate plucked a wildflower twirled the stubby stem between her fingers if it had been a perfect day with blue skies and sunshine the results would have been the same i wonder what it is to feel that lost laura murmured if we ever find her dowry we should build a shrine or something to remember her by im spending my share on clothes jewelry and travel margo stretched her arms up tucked them behind her head and itll be gone in a year less kate predicted im going to invest mine in blue chips boring predictable kate margo turned her head smiled at laura what about you what will you do when we find it and we will find it one day i dont know what would her mother do she wondered her father i dont know she repeated ill have to wait and see she looked back toward the sea where the curtain of rain was inching closer thats what seraphina didnt do she didnt wait and see and the sound of the rising wind was like a woman weeping lightning jagged a flashing pitchfork of brilliant white through the heavy sky the blasting boom of answering thunder shook the air laura threw back her head and smiled here it comes she thought the power the danger the glory she wanted it deep inside her most secret heart she wanted it all then came the squeal of brakes the angry pulse of gritty rock and roll and an impatient shout jesus christ are you all nuts joshua templeton leaned out of his car window scowling at the trio get the hell in the car its not raining yet laura stood she eyed josh first he was her senior by four years and at the moment he looked so much like their father at his crankiest that she wanted to laugh but shed seen who was in the car with him she wasnt certain how she knew that michael fury was as dangerous as any summer storm but she was sure of it it was more than ann sullivans mutterings about hoods and troublemakers though to be sure margos mother had definite opinions on this particular friend of joshs maybe it was because his dark hair was just a little too long and too wild or because of the little white scar just above his left eyebrow which josh said michael had gotten in a fight maybe it was his looks for they were dark and dangerous and just a little mean like a greedy angels she thought as her heart fluttered uncomfortably grinning all the way to hell but she thought it was his eyes so startlingly blue they were in that face so intense and direct and intrusive when he looked at her no she didnt like the way he looked at her get in the damn car impatience shimmered around josh in waves mom had a fit when she realized you were out here one of you gets hit by lightning itll be my ass and its such a cute one margo added always ready to flirt hoping to make josh jealous she opened the door on michaels side itll be a tight fit mind if i sit on your lap michael his gaze shifted from laura he grinned at margo a quick flash of teeth in a tanned hollowcheeked face make yourself at home sugar his voice was deep a little rough and he accepted the weight of a willing female with practiced ease i didnt know you were back michael kate slipped into the backseat where she thought sourly there was plenty of room for three on leave he flicked a glance at her then looked back at laura who still hesitated at the car door i ship out again in a couple days the merchant marine margo toyed with his hair it sounds so dangerous and exciting do you have a woman in every port im working on it as the first fat drops of rain splatted the windshield he raised a brow at laura want to sit on my lap too sugar dignity was something else shed learned at an early age not sparing him a reply laura got into the backseat with kate the minute the door was closed josh sent the car streaking across the road and up the hill toward home when her eyes met michaels in the rearview mirror laura deliberately looked away then back back toward the cliffs and her place of comfortable dreams chapter one on the day of her eighteenth birthday laura was in love she knew she was lucky to be so certain of her feelings and her future and the man who would share them both with her his name was peter ridgeway and he was everything she had ever dreamed of he was tall and handsome with golden good looks and a charming smile he was a man who understood beauty and music and the responsibilities of career since he had been promoted in the templeton organization and transferred to the california branch he had courted her in a fashion designed to win her romantic heart there had been roses delivered in glossy white boxes quiet dinners at restaurants with flickering candlelight endless conversations about art and literature and silent looks that said so much more than words they had taken walks in the garden in the moonlight long drives along the coast her fall into love had not taken long yet it had been a gentle tumble with no scrapes or bruises very much she thought like sliding slowly down a silklined tunnel into waiting arms perhaps at twentyseven he was a bit older than her parents might have liked and she a bit younger but he was so flawless so perfect laura couldnt see how the years could matter no boy of her own age had peter ridgeways polish his knowledge or his quiet patience and she was so much in love he had hinted at marriage gently she understood that this was to give her time to consider if only she knew how to let him know she had already considered already decided he was the man she would spend her life with but a man like peter laura thought needed to be the one to make the moves the decisions there was time she assured herself all the time in the world and tonight at the party to celebrate her eighteenth birthday he would be there she would dance with him and in the pale blue dress shed chosen because it matched his eyes she would feel like a princess more she would feel like a woman she dressed slowly wanting to savor every moment of preparation it was all going to be different now she thought her room had been the same when shed opened her eyes that morning the walls were still papered with those tiny pink rosebuds that had grown there for so many years the winter sunlight still tilted through her windows filtering through lacy curtains as it had done on so many other january mornings but everything was different because she was different she studied her room with a womans eyes now she appreciated the elegant lines of the mahogany bureau the glossy chippendale that had been her grandmothers she touched the pretty silver grooming set a birthday gift from margo studied the colorful frivolous perfume bottles shed begun to collect in adolescence there was the bed she had slept in dreamed in since childhood the high fourposter again chippendale with its fanciful canopy of breton lace the terrace doors that led to her balcony were open to invite the sounds and scents of evening inside the window seat where she could curl up and dream about the cliffs was cozy with pillows a fire burned sedately in the hearth of rosegrained marble atop the mantel were silverframed photos the delicate silver candlesticks with the slim white tapers she loved to burn at night and the dresden bud vase that held the single white rose peter had sent that morning there was the desk where she had studied all the way through high school where she would continue to study through what was left of her senior year odd she mused tracing a hand over it she didnt feel like a high school student she felt so much older than her contemporaries so much wiser so much more sure of where she was going this was the room of her childhood she thought of her youth and of her heart as templeton house was the home of her heart though she knew she would never love any place as much she was prepared even eager to build a new home with the man she loved at last she turned and looked at herself in the cheval glass and smiled shed been right about the dress she decided simple clean lines suited her small frame the scoop neckline the long tapered sleeves the straight column that skimmed down to flirt with her ankles the effect was classic dignified and perfect for a woman who met peter ridgeways standards she might have preferred that her hair be straight and flowing but since it insisted on curling frivolously shed swept it up it added maturity she thought she would never be bold and sexy like margo or casually intriguing like kate so she would settle for mature and dignified after all those were qualities that peter found appealing she so badly wanted to be perfect for him tonight especially tonight reverently she picked up the earrings that had been her parents birthday gift the diamonds and sapphires winked flirtatiously back at her she was smiling at them when her door burst open i am not putting that crap all over my face flushed and flustered kate continued her argument with margo as both of them strode inside you have enough on yours for both of us you said laura would be the judge margo reminded her then stopped with an experts eye she studied her friend you look fabulous dignified sex really are you sure the idea of being sexy was so thrilling laura turned back to the mirror all she saw was herself a small young woman with anxious gray eyes and hair that wouldnt quite stay in place absolutely every guy at the party is going to want you and be afraid to ask kate snorted and plopped onto lauras bed they wont be afraid to ask you pal youre a prime example of truth in advertising margo merely smirked and ran a hand over her hip the lipstickred dress dipped teasingly low at the bodice and clung to every generous curve if youve got it which you dont flaunt it which is why you need the blusher the eye shadow the mascara the oh christ she looks lovely margo always the peacemaker laura stepped between them she smiled at kate spread out on the bed her angular frame intriguing in thin white wool that covered her from throat to ankle like a wood nymph she laughed when kate groaned but you could use a little more color see triumphant margo whipped out her makeup bag sit up and let a master do her work i was counting on you complaining all the way kate suffered the indignity of margos brushes and tubes im only doing this because its your birthday and i appreciate it its going to be a clear night margo busily defined kates cheekbones the bands already setting up and the kitchens in chaos mums rushing around fussing with the floral arrangements as though its a royal reception i should go help laura began youre the guest of honor kate kept her eyes closed in selfdefense as margo dusted shadow on her lids aunt susie has everything under control including uncle tommy hes outside playing the sax laughing laura sat on the bed beside kate he always said his secret fantasy was to play tenor sax in some smoky club hed have played for a while margo said as she carefully smudged liner under kates big doe eyes then the templeton would have come out and hed have bought the club ladies josh loitered in the doorway a small florists box in his hands i dont mean to interrupt a female ritual but as everyones slightly insane im playing delivery boy the way he looked in his tux shot heat straight through margos loins she sent him a sultry look whats your usual tip never draw to an inside straight he struggled not to let his gaze dip to her cleavage and cursed every man who would be offered a glimpse of those milky white curves looks like more flowers for the birthday girl thanks laura rose to take the box and kissed him thats my tip you look wonderful he caught her hand grown up im starting to miss my annoying little sister ill do my best to annoy you as often as possible she opened the box sighed and forgot everything else from peter she murmured josh set his teeth it wouldnt be fair to say that she was already annoying him in her choice of men some guys think single roses are classy id rather have dozens margo stated and her eyes met joshs in perfect agreement and understanding its lovely laura murmured as she slipped it into the vase with its mate just like the one he sent this morning by nine templeton house was overflowing with people and sound groups of guests spilled out of brightly lit rooms onto heated terraces others wandered the gardens strolling down bricked paths to admire the blooms and the fountains all lit by the white ball of a winters moon and the charm of fairy lights margo had been right the night was clear a black sky stabbed by countless diamondbright stars under it templeton house stood awash in lights the music pulsed inviting couples to dance huge tables elegantly clad in white linen groaned under the weight of food prepared by a fleet of caterers waiters trained by templeton hotels standards wandered discreetly among the guests carrying silver trays filled with flutes of champagne and tiny delicacies for sampling half a dozen open bars were set up to serve mixed or soft drinks steam rose off the swimming pool in misty fingers while dozens of white water lilies floated on the surface on terraces under silky awnings over the lawns dozens of tables were draped in white linen centered with a trio of white tapers ringed by glossy gardenias indoors there were more waiters more food more music more flowers for those who wanted the warmth and relative quiet two uniformed maids upstairs stood ready to assist any lady who might wish to freshen up or fix a hem no reception ever held at any templeton hotel around the world was more carefully planned or executed than the celebration of laura templetons eighteenth birthday she would never forget that night the way the lights flashed and glowed the way the music seemed to fill the air mating with the scent of flowers she knew her duties and she chatted and danced with friends of her parents and with her contemporaries though she wanted only peter she mixed and mingled as was expected of her when she danced with her father she pressed her cheek against his its a wonderful party thank you he sighed realizing she smelled like a woman soft elegant part of me wishes you were still three years old bouncing on my knee thomas drew her back to smile at her he was a striking man his bronzed hair lightly touched with silver the eyes he had passed on to both of his children crinkled at the corners with life and laughter youve grown up on me laura i couldnt help it she smiled back at him no i suppose you couldnt now im standing here aware that a dozen young men are aiming arrows at my back hoping ill keel over so they can dance with you id rather dance with you than anyone but when peter glided by with susan templeton thomas saw his daughters eyes go soft and dreamy how could he have predicted he thought when he brought the man out to california that ridgeway would take his little girl away when the music ended thomas had to admire the smooth skill with which peter changed partners and circled away with laura you shouldnt look at the man as though youd like to flog him tommy susan murmured shes just a girl she knows what she wants shes always seemed to know she sighed herself apparently its peter ridgeway thomas looked into his wifes eyes they were wise always had been wise she might be small and delicateframed like her daughter and perhaps she gave the illusion of fragility but he knew just how strong she was what do you think of him hes competent she said slowly hes well bred well mannered god knows hes attractive her soft mouth hardened and i wish he was a thousand miles away from her thats a mother talking she admitted one whos afraid shes losing her little girl we could transfer him to europe he warmed to the idea no tokyo or sydney laughing she patted her husbands cheek the way laura looks at him shed follow him better to keep him close struggling to accept she shrugged her shoulders she could have fallen for one of joshs wilder friends or a gigolo a fortune hunter an excon he laughed himself laura never susan merely raised an eyebrow a man wouldnt understand she knew romantic natures like lauras most usually were drawn to the wild well tommy well just have to see where it goes and be there for her arent you going to dance with me margo slid into joshs arms fit there before he had a chance to agree or evade or would you rather just stand there brooding i wasnt brooding i was thinking youre worried about laura even as her fingers skimmed flirtatiously up the nape of his neck margo shot a concerned glance toward laura shes mad for him and bound and determined to marry him shes too young to be thinking of marriage shes been thinking of marriage since she was four margo muttered now shes found what she thinks is the man of her dreams no ones going to stop her i could kill him josh considered then we could hide the body she chuckled smiled into his eyes kate and i would be happy to help you toss his lifeless corpse off the cliffs but hell josh maybe hes right for her hes attentive intelligent apparently patient in certain hormonal areas dont start that joshs eyes went dark i dont want to think about it rest assured your little sister will walk down the aisle when the time comes in blushingbride white she blew out a breath wondering why any woman would consider marrying a man before she knew if he was her mate in bed they have a lot in common really and who are two jaded cynics like us to judge we love her josh said simply yeah we do but things change and before much longer were all going to be moving in our own directions youve already started she pointed out mister harvard law and kates chafing at the bit for college laura for marriage what are you chafing for duchess everything and then some her smile turned sultry she might have pushed the flirtation a bit farther but kate swung up and pried them apart sexual rituals later she muttered look theyre going off she scowled in lauras direction watching her walk away hand in hand with peter maybe we should go after them do something such as but understanding margo draped an arm over kates narrow shoulders whatever it wont make any difference im not going to stand around and watch then disgusted kate peered up at josh lets go sit in the south garden for a while josh can steal us some champagne youre under age he said primly right like youve never done it before she smiled winningly just a glass each to toast laura maybe itll bring her luck and what she wants one glass then margo frowned noting the way he scanned the crowd looking for cops no i thought michael might show after all mick kate angled her head i thought he was down in central america or somewhere playing soldier of fortune he is was josh corrected hes back at least for a while i was hoping hed take me up on the invitation then he shrugged hes not much for this kind of thing one glass he repeated tapping a finger on kates nose and you didnt get it from me of course not after tucking her arm through margos kate wandered toward the gaily lighted gardens we might as well drink to her if we cant stop her well drink to her margo agreed and well be there whatever happens so many stars laura breathed in the night as she and peter walked across the gently sloping lawn i cant imagine a more perfect evening much more perfect now that i have a moment alone with you flushing she smiled at him im sorry ive been so busy ive hardly had a moment to talk with you be alone with you you have duties i understand a templeton would never neglect her guests not ordinarily no but it is my birthday her hand felt so warm and sheltered in his she wished they could walk forever down to the cliffs so she could share that most intimate place with him i should have some leeway then lets take advantage of that he guided her toward the fanciful white shape of the gazebo from there the sounds of the party became muted background and the moonlight filtered through the latticelike lace scents from the flowers perfumed the air it was precisely the setting hed wanted oldfashioned and romantic like the woman he intended to have drawing her into his arms he kissed her she came so willingly he thought so innocently that lovely mouth parting for his those delicate arms winding around him it stirred him this youth combined with dignity eagerness flushed with innocence he could have her he knew he had the skill and the experience but he was a man who prided himself on control and he drew her gently back he wouldnt soil the perfection or rush into the physical he wanted his wife untouched even by himself i havent told you enough how lovely you look tonight thank you she treasured those warm liquid pulls of anticipation i wanted to for you he smiled and held her tenderly letting her head rest against his heart she was so perfect for him he thought young lovely well bred malleable through the slats he spotted margo flashy in her clinging red dress laughing bawdily at some joke even though his glands stirred his sensibilities were offended the housekeepers daughter every mans wet dream his gaze shifted to kate the prickly ward with more brains than style it amazed him that laura felt this childish attachment for those two but he was sure it would fade in time she was after all sensible with a dignity admirable in one so young once she fully understood her place in society and her place with him she could be gently weaned from inappropriate attachments he had no doubt she was in love with him she had so little experience in coyness or deception her parents might not completely approve but he was confident that their devotion to their daughter would sway them in his favor they would find no fault with him personally or professionally he was certain he did his job and did it well he would make a suitable soninlaw with laura beside him with the templeton name he would have everything he wanted everything he deserved the proper wife the unshakable position in society sons wealth and success we havent known each other long he began it feels like forever over her head he smiled she was so sweetly romantic only a few months laura and im nearly ten years older than you are she only pressed closer what does it matter i should give you more time god youre still in high school only for a few more months her heart beat wildly with anticipation as she lifted her head im not a child peter no youre not i know what i want ive always known he believed her and he also knew what he wanted had always known that too he mused they had in common still i told myself i would wait he brought her hands to his lips watched her eyes another year at least she knew this was what she had dreamed of had waited for i dont want you to wait she whispered i love you peter i love you laura too much to wait even another hour much less another year he eased her down onto the padded bench her hands trembled with all her heart she absorbed every aspect of the moment the sound of music in the distance that carried over the clear night air in quiet notes the scent of nightblooming jasmine and hints of the sea the way the shadows and lights played through the sheltering lattice he got down on one knee as shed known he would his face was so beautiful in the delicate dreamy light it broke her heart her eyes were swimming with tears when he took a small blackvelvet box from his pocket opened it the tears made the light that glinted off the diamond refract into rainbows will you marry me laura she knew what every woman felt at this one shining moment of her life and held out her hand yes chapter two twelve years later when a woman turned thirty laura supposed it was a time for reflection for taking stock for not only shuddering because middle age was certainly creeping closer and closer around that blind corner but for looking back over her accomplishments she was trying to but the fact was when she awoke that morning in january on her thirtieth birthday to gray skies and unrelenting rain the weather perfectly mirrored her mood she was thirty years old and divorced she had lost the lions share of her personal wealth through her own naiveté and was struggling mightily to fulfill her responsibilities to her family home raise two daughters alone hold down two parttime jobs neither of which she had prepared herself for and still be a templeton crowding the minus side was the failure to hold her marriage together the personal and somewhat embarrassing fact that she had slept with only one man in her life worry that her children were being penalized by her lack and fear that the house of cards she was rebuilding so carefully would tumble at the first brisk wind her life the unrelenting reality of it bore little resemblance to the one she had dreamed of was it any wonder she wanted to huddle in bed and pull the covers over her head instead she prepared to do what she always did get up face the day and try to somehow get through the complicated mess shed made out of her life there were people depending on her before she could toss the covers aside there was a soft knock at the door ann sullivan poked her head in first then smiled happy birthday miss laura the templetons longtime housekeeper stepped inside the room carrying a fully loaded breakfast tray accented with a vase of michaelmas daisies breakfast in bed scrambling to reorganize her schedule which had room for a quick cup of coffee at best laura sat back i feel like a queen it isnt every day a woman turns thirty lauras attempt at a smile wobbled tell me about it now dont you start that nonsense brisk and efficient ann settled the tray over lauras lap shed seen thirty herself and forty and lord help her shed just run smack into fifty and because she understood just how those decades affected a woman she brushed lauras sigh aside she had been fretting after this girl as well as her own and miss kate besides for more than twenty years she knew just how to handle them ann went to rekindle the fire in the hearth not only to chase away the january chill but to add light and cheer youre a beautiful young woman with the best of her life ahead of her and thirty years of it behind her ann methodically pushed the right buttons and nothing to show for it but two beautiful children a thriving business a lovely home and family and friends who adore you ouch laura thought im feeling sorry for myself she tried the smile again pathetic and typical thank you annie this is lovely drink some coffee as the fire caught crackling briskly ann poured the coffee herself then patted lauras hand you know what you need a day off a full day just for yourself to do exactly as you choose it was a fine fantasy and one that not so many years before she would have been able to indulge but now she had the girls to ready for school a morning in her office at templeton monterey and an afternoon at pretenses the shop she and margo and kate had started together then it was a quick dash to take the girls to their dance class time out to go over the bills and to pay them then there was homework to oversee as well as dealing with any and all of the myriad problems her daughters might have encountered during the day and she needed to carve out time to check on old joe the gardener she was worried about him but didnt want him to know it youre not listening miss laura at the faintly censorious tone laura pulled herself back im sorry the girls need to get up for school theyre up as a matter of fact pleased with her surprise ann walked to the door at the signal the room filled with people and noise mama the girls came first rushing in to jump on the bed and rattle plates on the tray at seven and ten they werent babies any longer but she cuddled them just the same kayla the younger was always ready for a hug but allison had been growing distant laura knew the extended embrace from her elder daughter was one of the best gifts she would receive that day annie said we could all come and start your birthday off right kayla bounced her smoky gray eyes bright with excitement and everybodys here so they are with an arm around each girl laura grinned at the crowd margo was already passing her threemonthold son to his grandmother so she could supervise as josh opened a bottle of champagne kate slipped away from her husband to help herself to one of the croissants on lauras tray so how does it feel champ kate asked with her mouth full the big threeoh it was feeling lousy until a minute ago mimosas she raised a brow at margo you betcha and no she said anticipating ali straight oj for you and your sister its a special occasion ali complained so youre going to drink your oj in a champagne flute with a flourish she passed juice to the girls for a toast she added then hooked an arm through her husbands right josh to laura templeton he began a woman of many talents which includes looking pretty great for a kid sister on the morning of her thirtieth birthday and if anyone brought a camera in here laura said pushing back her tumbled hair ill kill them i knew i forgot something kate shook her head then shrugged well lets get to the first gift byron byron de witt kates husband of six weeks and the executive director of templeton california stepped forward he touched his glass lightly to lauras and grinned ms templeton if i see you anywhere on hotel property before midnight tonight ill be forced to pull rank and fire you but i have two accounts i have to not today you dont consider your office closed somehow conventions and special events will have to limp along without you for twentyfour hours i appreciate the thought byron but all right he sighed if you insist on going over my head mr templeton enjoying himself josh joined ranks with byron as executive vice president templeton im ordering you to take the day off and if youve got some idea about going over my head ive already talked to mom and dad theyll be calling you later fine when she discovered she was getting ready to pout she shrugged instead itll give me a chance to nope reading laura well kate shook her head youre not setting foot in the shop today oh come on this is just silly i can lie in bed margo continued walk the cliffs read a book get a facial over the sheets she grabbed lauras foot waggled it pick up a sailor and remembering the girls she backtracked go for a sail mrs williamson is planning an elaborate birthday feast for you tonight to which we have all invited ourselves at that time if youve been a good girl youll get the rest of your presents i have something for you mama i have something and so does ali annie helped us pick them out you have to be good so you can open them tonight outnumbered laura took a contemplative sip of her mimosa all right ill be lazy and if i do something foolish itll be your fault all of you always willing to take the credit margo took j t back as he began to fuss hes wet she discovered and laughing handed him to his father and its your turn josh well be back at seven sharp oh and if you decide on that sailor ill want to hear every detail gotta go kate announced see you tonight they went out as quickly and as noisily as they had come in leaving laura alone with a bottle of champagne and a cooling breakfast she was so lucky she thought as she settled back against the pillows she had family and friends who loved her she had two beautiful daughters and a home she had always called her own then why she wondered as her eyes swam with sudden tears did she feel so useless the trouble with having free time laura decided was that it reminded her of the days when most of her free time had been eaten up by committees some she had joined because she enjoyed them the people the projects the causes others she knew shed involved herself with because of pressure from peter she had for too many years found it easier to bend than to stand and when she had rediscovered her backbone she had also discovered that the man she had married didnt love her or the children it had been the templeton name he had married he had never wanted the life she dreamed of sometime between alis birth and kaylas he dropped even the pretense of loving her still she stuck with it maintained the illusion of marriage and family and the pretense was all hers until the day she walked in on that most pathetic of clichés her husband in bed with another woman thinking of it now laura crossed the beautifully tended lawn strolled through the south gardens and into the grove beside the old stables the rain had subsided to a mist that merged with the swirl of fog crawling along the ground it was she thought like walking through a cool thin river she rarely walked here rarely had time yet she had always loved the play of sunlight or shadow through the trees the scent of the forest the rustling of small animals there had been times during her youth when she imagined it was a fairytale woods and she was the enchanted princess searching for the one true love who would rescue her from the spell cast upon her a harmless fantasy she thought now for a young girl but perhaps she had wanted that fairytale ending too badly believed in it too strongly as she had believed in peter he had crushed her quite literally he had crushed her heart with simple neglect with casual disinterest then he had scattered the pieces that were left with betrayal at last he had eradicated even the dust when he had taken not only her money but the childrens too for that she would never forgive or forget and that laura thought as she wandered a path under an arch of lazily dripping branches made her bitter she wanted to swallow the taste of that bitterness once and for all to get beyond it fully and move ahead perhaps she decided her thirtieth birthday was the time to really begin it made sense didnt it peter had proposed to her on her birthday twelve years before on a starry night she remembered raising her face to the misting rain shed been so sure then so positive that she knew what she wanted what she needed now was the time to reevaluate her marriage was over but her life wasnt in the past two years shed taken quite a few steps to prove that did she mind the work shed taken on to rebuild her life and her personal finances not the work itself she decided stepping over a fallen log and going deeper into the forest her position with templeton hotels was a responsibility a legacy that shed neglected too long she would damn well earn her keep and the shop she smiled to herself as her boots squished on the soggy path she loved pretenses loved working with margo and kate she enjoyed the customers the stock and the sense of accomplishment the three of them had built something there for themselves for each other how could she resent the hours and the effort that she put into raising her girls seeing that they had a happy healthy life they were her heart whatever it took to make up for the loss of the home she had somehow helped break she would try to do kayla she thought her little kayla so resilient so easy to please a loving happy child was kayla but allison poor ali had needed her fathers love so desperately the divorce was hardest on her and nothing laura did seemed to help her adjust she was doing better now laura thought better than she had been during those first months even the first year but she had pulled in and back and was only rarely spontaneous with her affections as she had been and wary of her mother laura thought with a sigh still blaming her mother for a father who had no interest in his daughters laura sat on a stump closed her eyes let the faint breeze that was the music of the forest surround her she would handle it she promised herself she would handle all of it the work the rush the worry the children no one was more surprised than she herself that she was handling it well but how she wondered how in gods name would she continue to handle the loneliness later she snipped deadheads out of the garden did some pruning hauled away the debris old joe simply couldnt keep up any longer and young joe his grandson couldnt afford more than a few hours a week in between his college courses to add his help since it would cut too much into her budget and old joes pride to hire an assistant laura had convinced joe that she wanted to take on some of the gardening tasks it was partially true she had always loved the gardens of templeton house the flowers the shrubs the vines as a child she had often dogged joe nagging him to teach her to show her and he would pull a pack of cherry life savers out of his pocket thumb one out for her and demonstrate the proper way to train a creeper to deal with aphids to prune a tea rose she had adored him his weathered face old even then his slow thoughtful voice his big patient hands he had come to work in the gardens of templeton house as a boy in her grandparents day after sixty years of service he had a right to his pension to spend his days tending his own garden to a life sitting in the sunshine and laura understood it would break his heart if she offered it so she picked up the slack under the guise of wanting a hobby when her schedule allowed and often when it didnt she would stand with joe and discuss perennials and bonemeal and mulch today as afternoon faded to dusk she took stock the gardens of templeton house looked as they should in winter quiet waiting the hardiest blooms splashes of defiant color her parents had given the house into her hands for tending and for cherishing laura did both she stepped out onto the skirt of the pool nodded in approval she maintained the pool herself it was after all her indulgence whatever the weather if she could squeeze in a few laps she did so shed taught her children to swim in that pool as her father had taught her the water sparkled a delicate blue thanks to some of her recent dickering with the pump and filter the mermaid lived beneath a mosaic fantasy of flowing red hair and glossy green tail her girls loved to dive down and touch that smiling serene face even as she had out of habit she checked the glass tables for smudges the cushions of the chairs and lounges for dampness or dust ann would have already done so but laura didnt turn toward the house until she was certain everything was perfect satisfied she walked down the stone path and chose the kitchen door scents assaulted her made her taste buds yearn mrs williamson ample of hip and bosom stood at the stove as she had done for all of lauras memory leg of lamb laura said and sighed apple chutney curried potatoes turning mrs williamson smiled smugly she was well into her seventies her hair was the hard glossy black of a bowling ball and approximately the same shape but her face was soft full of folds and wrinkles and as sweet as her own cream centers your nose is as good as ever miss laura or your memory is its what you always want for your birthday no one roasts a lamb like you mrs williamson because she knew the game laura wandered the spacious kitchen making her poking about obvious i dont see a cake maybe i forgot to bake one laura expressed the expected dismay oh mrs williamson and maybe i didnt she chuckled gestured with her wooden spoon now off you go i cant have you around pestering me while im cooking get yourself cleaned up youre carrying garden dirt yes maam at the kitchen door laura turned back it wouldnt be a black forest cake would it double chocolate just you wait and see scat laura waited until she was well down the hallway before she chuckled it would be a black forest cake mrs williamson might be a tad forgetful these days and her hearing wasnt what it had been but vital matters such as lauras traditional birthday meal would be remembered in every detail she hummed to herself as she climbed the stairs to bathe and change for dinner her mood had lifted but it plummeted quickly when she heard the sounds of a sibling argument in full swing because youre stupid thats why alis voice was shrill and bitter because you dont understand anything and i hate you i am not stupid there were tears trembling on the surface of kaylas retort and i hate you more well this is pleasant determined to lose neither her temper nor her perspective laura paused in the doorway of alls room the tableau seemed innocent enough in a girls pretty mintandwhite room dolls from around the world wearing their countries traditional dress ringed the shelves that flanked the wide window books ranging from sweet valley high to jane eyre filled a case a jewelry box with a twirling ballerina stood open on the dresser her daughters faced each other from either side of the canopy bed like mortal enemies over embattled soil i dont want her in my room her fists clenched ali whirled to face her mother this is my room and i dont want her in it i just came in to show her the picture i drew with trembling lips kayla held it out it was a clever crayon sketch of a firebreathing dragon and a young silverclad knight with a raised sword the natural youthful talent in it reminded laura that she needed to arrange for kayla to have drawing lessons its wonderful kayla she said it was ugly never ashamed of tears kayla let them fall she said it was ugly and stupid and that i had to knock before i came into her room ali dragons arent real and theyre ugly ali thrust her chin out challenging and she cant just come into my room if i dont want her youre entitled to your privacy laura said carefully but youre not entitled to be mean to your sister kayla laura crouched down brushed tears off her daughters cheeks its a wonderful picture we can frame it if you like tears dried up we can absolutely and we can hang it in your room unless youd let me hang it in mine the smile bloomed brilliantly you can have it id like that very much why dont you go back to your room and sign it for me just like a real artist and kayla laura rose kept a hand on kaylas shoulder if ali wants you to knock on her door then thats what youll do mutiny flared briefly then she has to knock on mine too thats fair go on now i want to talk to ali after sending her sister a smug look kayla sailed out she wouldnt leave when i told her to ali began shes always running in here whenever she wants and youre older laura said quietly trying to understand there are privileges that go along with that ali but there are also responsibilities i dont expect the two of you never to fight josh and i fought margo and kate and i fought but you hurt her i just wanted her to go away i wanted to be alone i dont care about her stupid picture of a stupid dragon theres more going on here laura thought studying her daughters miserable face than sibling sniping she sat on the edge of the bed so that her eyes were level with alis tell me whats wrong honey you always take her side laura bit back a sigh thats not true determined she took alis hand pulled her closer and thats not whats bothering you there was a war going on inside this little girl laura realized as she watched alis eyes swim with all her heart laura wanted to find the right way to make peace it doesnt matter it wont make any difference tears came closer to the surface you wont do anything about it it hurt but then this recent distrust from ali always hurt why dont you tell me then well see i cant do anything about it if i dont know what it is theyre going to have a fatherdaughter dinner at school the words burst out full of anger and pain theyre all going to bring their dads oh no peace here laura admitted and touched her daughters cheek im sorry ali thats hard uncle josh will go with you its not the same no its not the same i want it to be the same ali said in a furious whisper why cant you make it be the same i cant there was relief when ali went unresisting into her arms and there was grief why dont you make him come back why dont you do something to make him come back now there was guilt to layer on top of grief theres nothing i can do you dont want him to come back with her eyes bright and hot ali jerked back you told him to go away and you dont want him to come back this was a thin and shaky line to travel your father and i are divorced ali thats not going to change the fact that we cant and dont want to live together anymore doesnt have anything to do with you and kayla then why doesnt he ever come tears poured out again but they were hot now and angry other kids have parents that dont live together but their dads come and they go places together the line got shakier your fathers very busy and hes living in palm springs now lies laura thought pitiful lies im sure once hes more settled hell spend more time with you when did he ever he doesnt come because he doesnt want to see you ali turned away its because of you laura closed her eyes what good would it be to deny it to defend herself and leave her child vulnerable if it is ill do what i can to make it easier for him and for you on legs that werent quite steady laura rose there are things i cant change i cant fix and i cant stop you from blaming me for it fighting to control both grief and temper laura took a slow breath i dont want you to be unhappy ali i love you i love you and kayla more than anything in the world alis shoulders slumped will you ask him if he could come to the dinner its next month on a saturday yes ill ask shame eked through the anger and misery she didnt have to look at her mothers face to know she would see hurt im sorry mama so am i ill tell kayla im sorry too she draws really good and i i cant you have other talents gently laura turned ali around cupped her shoulders you dance so beautifully and you play the piano so much better than i did at your age better than i do now you never play anymore there were a lot of things she didnt do anymore how about a duet tonight well play kayla can sing she sounds like a bullfrog i know and when ali looked up they grinned at each other another crisis averted laura decided as she settled down with her family after dinner there was a cheery fire blazing in the hearth and rich creamy cake to be devoured the curtains in the parlor were opened to a starry night and the lights inside glowed warm birthday presents had been unwrapped opened and admired the baby was sleeping upstairs josh and byron were puffing on cigars and her daughters fences mended for the moment were at the piano kaylas booming frog of a voice competed with alis skillful playing then she went for the chanel bag margo was saying comfortably curled on the sofa as she talked shop it took her more than an hour and she just kept piling up stock three suits an evening gown your white dior laura four pairs of shoes count them four six blouses three sweaters two silk slacks and that was before she started on the jewelry it was a redletter day kate propped her bare feet on the louis xiv coffee table i had a hunch when the woman pulled up in a white stretch limo shed come up from la because a friend of hers had told her about pretenses kate sipped herbal tea hardly missing the punch of coffee im telling you she went on this woman was a pro she said shes buying a country home and shes going to come back and choose some of the furnishings and whatnots from the shop turns out shes the wife of some hotshot producer and shes going to tell all her friends about this clever little secondhand shop in monterey thats wonderful so wonderful laura could almost accept not being in on the kill its making me wonder if we shouldnt think about expanding sooner maybe in la rather than carmel hold it hotshot kate eyed margo narrowly were not talking seriously about another branch until weve been in business two full years then i run some figures do some projections always the accountant margo muttered you bet your ass so what did you do with your day off laura oh a little gardening a little bill paying closet cleaning moping is that jt with a mothers superhearing margo tuned in to the sounds whispering out of the baby monitor beside her id better check on him no let me laura rose quickly please you get to have him all the time i want to play sure but if hes margo trailed off glancing toward the two young girls at the piano i guess you know what to do i think i have a pretty good idea aware that margo might change her mind laura hurried out it was amazing and gratifying to see the way her impulsive glamorous friend had taken to motherhood even two short years before no one would have believed margo sullivan supermodel the rage of europe would be settled down in her hometown running a secondhand shop and raising a family margo certainly wouldnt have believed it herself laura mused but fate had dealt her a tough hand rather than fold and run shed stuck and with determination and flair had turned fate on its ear now she had josh and john thomas and a thriving business she had a home she loved laura hoped that somehow someday she could deal fate the same blow there he is laura cooed as she approached the antique crib that she and ann had hauled out of storage theres the darling oh what a handsome boy you are john thomas templeton truer words were never spoken hed had a rich gene pool to choose from and hed chosen well golden hair grew thick around a glorious little face round with babyhood it was with his mothers stunning blue eyes his fathers wellsculpted mouth his fretful whimpering stopped the moment she lifted him and the feeling one that perhaps only a woman understands soared through her here was baby beginnings beauty there sweetheart were you lonely she walked him as much to pleasure herself as to soothe shed wanted more children she knew it was selfish when she had two such beautiful daughters but oh shed wanted more children now she had a nephew to spoil and she intended to do so lavishly kate and byron would have children laura mused as she laid j t on the changing table there would be more babies to cuddle she changed him powdered him tickled him to make him giggle and kick his legs he grinned at her wrapped a fist around a curl and tugged laura went with the pull to nuzzle his neck bring back memories josh asked as he stepped inside the nursery does it ever when annie and i were putting this room together for his visits we wallowed in memories she lifted j t high over her head where he could gurgle in delight both my babies slept in that crib so did you and i he ran a hand over the curved rungs before moving to his son joshs fingers itched to hold him but he held back allowed laura to cuddle the baby everyone whos been there says it but i cant stop myself the years go so fast josh treasure every second of it you did he touched her hair you are and have been the most incredible mother ive admired you for that youre going to make me sloppy she murmured and buried her face in the sweet curve of jts neck i figure you and i had the best possible examples to follow weve been lucky laura to have people like mom and dad for parents dont i know it i know theyre in the middle of negotiating the construction of the new hotel on bimini but they called today just to wish me happy birthday and dad told the story of how he drove mom through the worst winter storm in the history of central california when she went into labor with you of course she lifted her head and grinned he loves telling that story rain floods mud slides lightning all but an appearance of the angel of doom and the seven plagues of egypt but i got her there josh quoted his father with fortyfive minutes to spare he stroked his sons hair not everybodys as lucky do you remember michael fury images of a dark dangerous man with hot eyes who could forget michael fury yes you used to hang around with him and look for girls and trouble he went into the merchant marines or something he went into a lot of things there were some problems at home an unpleasant divorce well two actually his mother got married for the third time when he was about twentyfive this one seems to have stuck anyway he came back to the area a few weeks ago oh really i didnt know you and michael never ran in the same circles josh said dryly the thing is he took over the old place where he grew up his mother and stepfather relocated in boca and he bought the property from them hes raising horses now horses hmm not terribly interested she began to walk the baby again josh would get to his point eventually she knew sometimes he was such a lawyer caging the meaning with words those storms we had a couple weeks ago oh bad ones she remembered almost as bad as the fateful night of laura templetons birth yeah more mud slides one of them destroyed michaels place oh im sorry she stopped walking and tuned in im really sorry was he hurt no he managed to get himself and his stock out but the house is a loss its going to take some time to rebuild if thats what he wants to do meanwhile hell need temporary lodgings for himself and his horses something he could rent you know for the short term and i was thinking the stables and the grooms apartment above them arent being used alarm came first josh just hear me out i know mom and dad were always a little well wary of him to say the least hes an old friend josh returned and a good one hes also handy no ones done any maintenance or repairs on that building in years not since he broke off cleared his throat not since i sold off the horses laura finished because peter didnt care for them or the amount of time i put in with them the point is the building should be looked after right now its just sitting there empty you could use the rent since you refuse to dip into templeton capital to run this place im not going over that ground again fine he recognized that set to her mouth and didnt bother the rent from a building youre not using would help you out right yes but he held up a hand he would cut through the logic and practicalities first you could use someone around here in the short term to do some heavy work to put the stables back in shape thats something you simply cant do yourself thats true but now josh thought for the clincher and i have an old friend whose home has been washed out from under him id consider it a personal favor low blow she muttered theyre always the most effective knowing hed scored he gave her hair a quick affectionate tug look it should work out for everyone but give it a couple of weeks if its not working ill find an alternative all right but if he starts having drunken poker parties or orgies well try to keep them discreet josh finished and grinned thanks he kissed her and took the baby hes a good man laura one you can count on in tight squeezes laura wrinkled her nose at his back as he carried j t out of the room i dont intend to count on michael fury particularly in a tight squeeze chapter three the last place michael fury had expected to take up residence however temporarily was on the great templeton estate oh hed visited there often enough in the past under the subtly watchful eyes of thomas and susan templeton and the not so subtly watchful eye of ann sullivan he was well aware that the templeton housekeeper had considered him a mongrel let loose among her purebreds and he assumed that shed been worried about his intentions toward her daughter she could have rested easy there as lip smackingly gorgeous as margo was and always had been she and michael had never been more than casual friends maybe hed kissed her a couple of times how was a redblooded man supposed to resist that mouth but that had been the beginning and end of it shed been for josh even that long ago and despite the shortsightedness of youth hed realized that michael fury didnt poach on a pal despite their different backgrounds they had been friends real friends michael didnt consider many people real friends he would and had gone to the wall for josh and he knew he could depend on the same still he would never have asked for the favor and would likely have refused it but for his horses he didnt want them boarded any longer than necessary in a public facility hed gotten sentimental over them and he wasnt ashamed of it in the last few years theyd been one of the few constants in his life hed tried a number of things hed drifted he liked to drift joining the merchant marine had been an escape hed reveled in it hed seen a lot of the world and he liked some of it it had been cars for a time he still had an affection for them liked to drive full out hed had some success on the race circuit in europe but it hadnt satisfied him in the long term in between the sea and the cars there had been a brief stint as a mercenary during which hed learned too much about killing and warring for profit and maybe hed been afraid he was too good at it afraid it would satisfy him too well it had fattened his wallet but scarred his heart hed been married once also only briefly and could claim no success from that experience either it was during his stuntman stage that he fell for horses hed learned that craft gained a reputation broken several bones he jumped out of buildings rioted in staged bar fights was shot off roofs set on fire and he tumbled off of countless horses michael fury knew how to take a fall but he wasnt able to roll when he fell in love with horses so he bought them and bred them and trained them he had put down a sick horse and labored through the birth of a foal though he knew the odds were long he thought hed found what hed been looking for it seemed like fate when his stepfather called telling michael that he and michaels mother were going to sell the property in the hills though he had no sentiment for it michael heard himself offering to buy it it was good horse country so hed come back and nature had delivered a hard backhanded slap in welcome he didnt give a good damn about the house but his horses he would have died saving them and hed come dangerously close as those acres of mud tumbled down there he was filthy exhausted alone looking at what had been his next start the oozing rubble of it there had been a time when he would have simply cut his losses and moved on but this time he was sticking now josh had offered him a hand and weighing his pride against his horses michael had accepted as he swung up the drive toward templeton house he hoped he wasnt gambling on the wrong roll of the dice hed always admired the place you couldnt help it so he stopped in the middle of the drive got out and took a long look he stood in the mild winter air a rangy man with an athletes disciplined body a brawlers ready stance he was dressed in black his most usual attire because it saved him from thinking when he reached for clothes the snug black jeans and sweater under a scarred leather bomber jacket gave him the look of a desperado he would have said it wasnt far from the truth his black hair danced in the breeze it was longer than practical sleek and thick by nature when he was working he often pulled it back in a stubby ponytail he hated the barber and would have suffered torments of hell going to what they called a stylist hed forgotten to shave hed meant to but he got involved with the horses the stubble only added to the dangerous appeal of a rawboned face his mouth was surprisingly soft many women could testify to its skill and generosity but whatever softness was there was often overlooked when the observer was pinned by hard eyes the color of ball lightning over them his brows were arched the left one marred by a faint white scar he had others on his body from car wrecks fights his stunt work hed learned to live with them just as he lived with the scars inside as he studied the glinting stone the spearing towers and glinting glass of templeton house he smiled christ what a place he thought a castle for modern royalty here comes michael fury he thought and what the hell are you going to do about it he chuckled to himself as he drove up the winding lane cutting through rolling lawns accented by stately old trees shrubs waiting to burst into bloom he didnt imagine that the reigning princess was too happy about his impending stay josh must have done some fast talking to persuade his proper society sister to open even the stables for the likes of michael fury theyd both get used to it he imagined it wasnt for long and he was sure they could manage to stay out of each others way just as they had in the past for laura carving out this hour in the middle of the day was problematic but necessary she had sent the maid jenny to do what she could about cleaning the grooms apartment above the stables god knew it was a mess of dust and debris and spiderwebs mice laura thought shuddering as she hauled up a bucket of soapy water she couldnt expect the girl to perform miracles and there just hadnt been enough time it hadnt been possible to ask anns help at the mere mention of michael furys name the housekeeper had sniffed and gone stonefaced so laura had decided the final work fell to her she wasnt about to welcome anyone into her home or a part thereof and not have it spic and span an extended lunch hour away from her duties at pretenses a quick change of clothes and now she thought a great deal of elbow grease the state of the bathroom in the apartment had shocked young jenny speechless small wonder with her hair pulled back her sleeves rolled up laura climbed into the tub and began to attack the worst of the grime when her guest tenant whatever the hell he was arrived the following day at least he wouldnt find scum on the tiles as far as the stables themselves went shed decided after one look that they fell into michael furys territory while she worked she rattled through her head for the rest of her days schedule she could get back to pretenses by three close out by sixthirty a quick dash to pick up the girls from piano lessons damn it shed forgotten to look into finding a good drawing instructor for kayla dinner at seventhirty a check to make certain both girls were prepared for whatever tests and assignments were coming up was it spelling for kayla tomorrow or math for ali was it both good god she hated going back to school fractions were killing her puffing a bit as her muscles sang she swiped soap and grit over her cheek she really did have to go over that report on the cosmeticians convention next month she could do that in bed once the girls were down and ali needed new ballet shoes they would see to that tomorrow well thats quite a sight michael stepped into the narrow doorway and was treated to the appealing view of a pretty female butt straining against faded denim a butt that he assumed belonged to some nubile templeton maid if this is among the amenities i should be paying a hell of a lot more rent yelping laura sprang up rapped her head on the shower nozzle and slopped filthy water over her feet it was a tossup as to who was more surprised michael hadnt realized until that moment that hed carried an image of laura in his head perfect perfectly lovely gold and rose and white like a glossy picture of a princess in a book of fairy tales but the woman facing him now eyes huge and darkly gray had wet dirt smeared on her cheeks her hair was a mess and her teaserving hands held a scrub brush he recovered first a man whod lived on the edge had to have quick reflexes and he grinned widely as he leaned on the doorjamb laura templeton that is you in there isnt it i wasnt we werent expecting you until tomorrow ah yes he thought the voice hadnt changed cool cultured quietly sexy i always like to get the lay of the land the front door was wide open i was airing the apartment well then its nice to see you again laura i dont know when ive had someone quite so attractive scrub out my john humiliated knowing her cheeks were hot she nodded as josh probably told you we havent been using the building i wasnt able to spare the staff to put things to rights so quickly it surprised him that she knew which end of a scrub brush was which you dont have to bother for me i can handle it myself now that he took a close look he could also see for himself that she was just as lovely underneath the grime as ever delicate features soft mouth the aristocratic hint of cheekbone and those dreamy stormcolored eyes had he forgotten how small she was five two maybe three and slim as a fairy with hair the color of gold in dim sunlight subtle again with the richness but not the flash she remembered he had often stared just as he was doing now saying nothing just looking looking until she wanted to squirm im sorry about your home hmm he lifted a brow the scarred one drawing her eyes to his oh it was just a house i can always build another i appreciate you providing a place for me and my horses when he offered a hand she took it automatically his was hard rough with calluses and held on to hers even when she tried to slip away his lips curved again you going to stay standing in the tub sugar no she cleared her throat allowed him to help her out ill show you around she began then her eyes went cool when he remained where he was ill show you around she repeated thanks he shifted enjoyed the waft of scent again subtle that she carried with her josh would have told you this was the grooms apartment her voice was clear again the polite hostess its selfsufficient i think full kitchen she gestured toward an alcove off the main room where jenny had dutifully cleaned the white stove the stainless steel sink the simple white countertops thats fine i dont do a lot of cooking josh mentioned that youd lost your furniture so we brought over a few things she waited hands folded at her waist as he wandered about the room the sofa had been in the attic and could have used recovering but it was a good solid duncan phyfe some templeton or guest in the past had scarred the sheridan coffee table with a careless cigarette but it was functional shed added lamps simple brass ones that she felt suited a masculine taste an easy chair other occasional tables even a vase of winter windflowers she was too much the innkeepers daughter not to have put thought and effort into her temporary inn youve gone to some trouble which surprised and humbled him i figured on roughing it for a few months its not exactly templeton paris she unbent enough to smile the bedrooms through there she gestured toward a short corridor its not terribly large but i went with instinct on the bed i know josh likes room to ah she trailed off when michael grinned room she finished so we stuffed a queen size in there we had the iron head and footboards in storage ive always liked them theres not much of a closet but i dont have much well then at a loss she wandered toward the front window the view she said and left it at that yeah he joined her intrigued by the way her head fit neatly below his chin he could see the cliffs the azure sea beyond the splits of rock islands and the fuming water that charged them you used to spend a lot of time out there i still do still looking for treasure of course what was the name of the girl who tossed herself off the cliff seraphina right seraphina a romantic little tale a sad one same thing josh used to laugh about you and margo and kate haunting those cliffs and looking for seraphinas lost dowry but i figured he secretly wanted to find it himself we look every sunday now margo and kate and i and my daughters that brought him up short hed forgotten for a moment that this small delicate woman had given birth to two children youve got kids of your own girls yes chin lifted she turned back daughters my daughters something here he mused and wondered which button hed pushed how old are they she hadnt expected him to ask even out of politeness and she softened all over again alis ten kaylas seven you got started early girls that age usually go for horses they can come by and see mine whenever they like more of the unexpected thats kind of you michael i dont want them to get in your way i like kids he said it so simply that she believed him then ill warn you theyre both eager to see them and i suppose youre eager to see the stables out of habit she glanced at her watch and winced got an appointment actually yes i do if you dont mind taking the rest of the tour on your own i really have to change to get her hair done he imagined or her nails or to make her fiftyminute hour with some society shrink sure i left the keys in the kitchen she continued juggling details there isnt a phone i didnt know if you wanted one theres a jack somewhere if you need anything you ill be fine he slipped a check out of his pocket and handed it to her rent oh she slipped it into her own pocket sorry that she couldnt welcome one of her brothers old friends as a guest but the rent would go a long way toward new ballet shoes and drawing lessons thank you welcome to templeton house michael she went to the door and down the steps he walked to the side window and watched her cross the rolling lawn toward templeton house and there i was laura muttered standing in the bathtub she sighed grateful for a lull in the customer flow in pretenses so that she could vent to her friends wearing rags holding a scrub brush stop laughing in a minute kate promised holding a hand to her aching stomach im perfecting the image in my mind first the elegant laura templeton caught fighting pesky bathtub ring ring hell its more like bathtub plague and maybe ill think its funny in a year or two but right now its mortifying he just stood there grinning at me mmm margo touched her tongue to her top lip and if memory serves michael fury had one hell of a grin is he as wickedly dangerously handsome as ever i didnt notice laura sniffed and gave her attention to rubbing a fingerprint off the glass display case liar margo leaned closer come on laura tell i suppose he looked a bit like a twentiethcentury version of heathcliff dark brooding potentially violent and rough around the edges her shoulders shrugged again if that sort of thing appeals to you it wouldnt make me look the other way margo decided josh said he was a mercenary for a while a mercenary shed forgotten that and remembering now nodded figures and i ran into him once in france when he was racing cars margo tilted her head as she brought the memory back we had an interesting evening together laura lifted a brow oh really interesting margo repeated and left it at that then it was stunt work in hollywood and now its horses i wonder if hell stick around this time i know josh hopes he does at least the situation has pushed me into getting the stables in shape wanting busy work laura moved to the shelves and began to tidy glassware ive neglected them too long in fact i may think about getting a horse myself once i can manage it the girls might like that so what kind of horses does he raise breed own whatever kate wondered i didnt ask i just showed him around the apartment gave him the keys i suppose hes competent josh seems to think so and if his rent check doesnt bounce ill assume hes reliable i cant imagine id want any more out of a tenant horses take a lot of time and work which meant laura thought she couldnt even consider having them again for at least a decade hell be busy i doubt well see much of him the door opened for a pair of customers recognizing them as regulars laura smiled stepped forward ill take them she murmured to her partners good to see you mrs myers mrs lomax what can i show you today as laura led the customers into the wardrobe room margo considered shes trying not to be interested hmm laura she had the look of a woman whos been intrigued by a man and is trying not to be after a moments thought margo smiled broadly good and why would that be good its time she had a little distraction in her life a little male distraction and do you ever think of any other kind of distraction kate amused margo patted her friends hand from a woman newly married to a certified hunk thats a very stupid question lauras never let herself cut loose when it comes to men i think michael fury might just be the perfect thirtieth birthday present hes a man margo not a pair of earrings oh but darling i think he might look wonderful on her so to speak and i dont suppose it occurs to you that they might not be interested in each other in a sexual way wait kate held up a hand i forgot who i was talking to dont be snide margo tapped her fingers on the counter youve got a man and a woman both unattached as far as we know both attractive josh has put them in close proximity though i doubt it was his intention hes created a very interesting situation when you put it like that concerned kate glanced toward the wardrobe room look i always liked mick but he was a wild child we could have a lamb and wolf situation here i certainly hope youre right every woman needs at least one close encounter with a wolf but they were talking about laura after all ill have to invite michael over for dinner check him out myself and i suppose well have to bow to your greater judgment and experience naturally the door jangled open again back to work partner in the wardrobe room laura was patiently showing their selection of cashmere sweaters if she had been aware of the direction her friends were taking she would have been both amused and appalled men in general simply werent of interest to her she didnt hate them her experience with peter hadnt turned her into a shrew made her frigid or narrowed her vision so that she considered men the enemy too many good men had touched her life for that she had her father as a prime example her brother was another and over the past months she had come to love byron de witt family was one thing intimate even casual relationships were another she didnt have the time inclination or energy for one in the two years since she had ended her marriage she had been struggling to rebuild her life on all levels her children her home her work for templeton and pretenses while her customers debated their selections she eased back to give them room musing on the events that had led to starting the shop it had been an impulse a step shed taken for margo as much as for herself margos career and finances had been in ruins when she returned to monterey from europe the idea of liquidating her possessions and creating an intriguing space in which to sell them had been a risk but it had paid off from the first moment not just in dollars laura thought as she wandered back into the main showroom in pride in confidence in friendship and fun when they bought the building it was an empty space dusty scarred smelly their vision their effort had turned it into the remarkable now the glass of the wide display window sparkled in the sunlight and teased passersby with clever hints of what was offered inside a sassy cocktail dress in emerald with the nostalgic touch of peacock feathers at the shoulder was draped over the elegant chair of a womans vanity colorful bottles stood on the glossy surface along with a jeweled collar one of the drawers was open so that glittery rhinestones and shimmering silks spilled out there was a lamp shaped like a swan a single crystal flute beside an empty bottle of champagne a mans cuff links and carelessly tossed formal black tie mingled with the womans trinkets a pair of red spike heels was artfully positioned to give the impression that their owner had just stepped out of them the little vignettes in the display were usually margos domain but laura had designed this one and was proud of it as she was of the shop as a whole throughout the spacious showroom was scattered the unique the fanciful the warm rose walls complemented glass shelves filled with treasures porcelain boxes silver services goldringed stemware a velvet settee the third theyd had to stock provided customers a chance to sit enjoy a cup of tea a glass of champagne gilded tightwinder stairs spiraled up toward the open balcony that ringed the room and led to the boudoir where negligees peignoirs and other night apparel were displayed in a gorgeous rosewood armoire everything was for sale from the rococo bed to the smallest silver trinket box and nothing was duplicated the shop had quite literally saved all three of them and though she wouldnt have thought it possible it had brought them even closer together as she hovered outside the wardrobe room she watched margo show a customer a sapphire bracelet from the display kate discussed the origins of an art nouveau lamp with another a new customer studied an opal snuff bottle while her companion perused the selection of evening bags mozart was playing on the stereo softly through the window laura caught glimpses of the busy traffic on cannery row cars chugged or streamed or jockeyed for position people strolled by on the sidewalk a man passed with a young boy giggling from his perch on daddys shoulders a couple arm in arm stopped to admire the display and moments later came inside ms templeton pulling herself back from her reverie laura turned to the wardrobe room yes mrs myers did you find something you like the woman smiled held out her choice i never leave pretenses disappointed the glow of pride was swift and satisfying laura accepted the cashmere were here to see that you never do chapter four pretty good digs right boy michael groomed max his pride and joy while the enormous buffcolored tennessee walker snorted in agreement the templeton horse palace was a far cry from the simple working stables that michael had built in the hills then watched collapse under walls of mud not that it had looked much like a palace when he stepped inside that first afternoon when he ran into laura then it bore more than a slight resemblance to some fairytale cottage long under a wicked spell deserted by all who had once inhabited it he had to grin at the thought and at the fact that everything about the templeton estate made him think of fairy tales with golden edges what he found in the stables was dust disuse and disrepair it had taken him the best part of a week to ready the building no easy task for one man and a single pair of hands but he wasnt willing to move his horses in until their temporary home had been cleaned and organized to his specifications on the other hand for that week hed had to endure the public stables the painfully high fee for boarding and the fact that his own lodgings were miles away from his stock but the results were well worth the investment of a few sixteenhour muscleaching days it was a good solid building with the stylish touches that the templetons were known for the loose boxes had plenty of space and light and air a more important feature to michael than the intricately laid brick flooring the decorative tiles around the mangers or the ornate ironwork above them with its center stylized t in polished brass though he did consider the fancy work a nice touch the layout was practical with the tack room at one end of the block the feed room at the other though he was baffled by the obvious neglect and disuse he put his back into it and dug in to correct the situation he hauled and hammered swept and scrubbed until every stall met his stringent standards for his babies he thought of them as such secretly hed had fresh hay and straw delivered that morning and had been grateful that the boy who delivered it had been willing to make a few extra dollars by helping michael store the bales now each stall was deeply bedded with wheat straw expensive and difficult to come by but these were his babies after all some tools and some ingenuity had put the automatic drinking bowls back in working order he oiled hinges on stall doors replaced hooks that had rusted away since hed lost all of his supplies in the mud he had to restock grain electrolytes vitamins medicines hed managed to salvage some tack some tools every piece had been cleaned and polished and what couldnt be saved had been or would shortly be replaced his fifteen horses were housed as royally as he could manage but as yet he hadnt done more than sleep in the upstairs apartment youve come up in the world max you might not know it but you are now a tenant of the templeton estate that is one big fucking deal pal take my word for it he slapped the horse affectionately on the flank and pulled a carrot out of the pouch tied at his waist ive already started designing your new place dont worry maybe well add a few of the fancier touches ourselves this time around but in the meantime you cant do much better than this max took the carrot politely and the dark eye he turned to michael was filled with patience wisdom and michael liked to think affection as well he stepped out of the stall latched the bottom half of the door with its foot bolt then moved down the block the floor might have been fancy enough for a garden party but it sloped perfectly his boot heels clicked in anticipation a chestnut head poked over the adjoining stall door looking for me baby this was his sweetheart as kind and gentle a mare as he had ever worked with hed bought her as a foal and now she was heavily pregnant and had been assigned to the foaling stall he called her darling hows it going today youre going to be happy here he stepped inside and ran his hands over her enormous sides like an expectant father he was filled with anticipation and concern she was small barely fourteen hands and he worried about how she would fare when her time came darling liked to have her belly rubbed and she blew appreciatively when michael obliged her so beautiful he cupped her face in his hands as a man might hold the face of a cherished woman youre the most beautiful thing ive ever owned pleased with the attention she blew again then lowered her head to nibble at his pouch chuckling he took out an apple she preferred them to carrots here you go darling youre eating for two he heard the voices young excited almost piping and stepped out of the stall mama said were not supposed to bother him were not going to bother him well just look come on kayla dont you want to see the horses yeah but what if hes in there what if he yells at us then well just run away but well get to see the horses first amused wondering if laura had painted him as an ogre or a recluse michael stepped out of the shadows of the stables and into the sunlight if hed been a poetic man he would have said hed encountered two angels they thought they were looking into the face of the devil himself he was all in black with shadows behind him the hard handsome face was unsmiling and dark with stubble his hair reached almost to his shoulders and he had a black bandanna tied around his forehead like a wild indian or a pirate he seemed big huge dangerous her heart jittering ali put a hand on kaylas shoulder both to protect her sister and to steady herself we live here she stammered we can be here he couldnt resist playing it out a little is that so well i live here and i dont look kindly on trespassers you wouldnt be horse thieves would you we have to hang horse thieves shocked appalled terrified ali could only shake her head vigorously but kayla stepped forward fascinated you have pretty eyes she said dimpling into a smile are you really a troublemaking hoodlum annie said so all ali could do was whisper her sisters name in mortification and fear ah he thought ann sullivan sowing his youthful reputation ahead of him i used to be i gave it up christ the kid was a picture he thought a heart melter your names kayla and you have your mothers eyes uhhuh and thats ali shes ten im seven and a half and i lost a tooth she grinned widely to show him the accomplishment cool have you looked for it she giggled no the tooth fairy has it she took it up into the sky to make a star out of it do you have all your teeth last time i checked youre mr fury mama says we have to call you that i like your name its like a storybook person a villain maybe she twinkled at him can we see your horses mr fury we wont steal them or hurt them or anything i think theyd like to see you he offered a hand which kayla took without hesitation come on ali he said casually i wont yell at you unless you deserve it biting her lip ali followed them into the stables oh she jolted back then giggled at herself when max stuck his huge head over the stall door hes so big hes so pretty she started to reach out then stuck her hand behind her back you can pet him michael told her the older girl was a little shy he decided and pretty as a picture in a book he doesnt bite unless you deserve it to demonstrate he hauled kayla up on his hip go ahead meet max hes a southern gentleman our uncle is a southern gentleman kayla announced but he doesnt look like max delighted she stroked the soft cheek smooth she murmured hello max hello not one to be outmatched by her kid sister ali stepped forward again and touched maxs other cheek does he let you ride him and everything yep max and i have fought wild indians together been wild indians together robbed stagecoaches jumped ravines looking down into two pairs of wide eyes he grinned max is a hollywood star really enchanted kayla touched one velvet ear giggling when it flicked under her fingers really ill show you his press clippings later come meet darling shes going to have a baby soon aunt margo just had one kayla chattered gaily as they made the new acquaintance his name is john thomas but we call him j t do horses have babies the same way people have them pretty much michael murmured and skirted the issue by distracting the girls with the mare they met jack the dignified gelding and lulu a frisky mare then zip the fastest horse so michael claimed in the west why do you have so many suspicion of the man couldnt hold out against delight with horses with shyness outmatched by curiosity ali dogged michaels every move and peppered him with questions i train them i buy them sell them sell them the very idea had kaylas lip poking out all but max and darling i wont sell them ever but the others will go to people wholl appreciate their talents and take good care of them they all have a destiny now jack here hes going to make someone a good saddle horse hell ride forever if you ask him and rash hell be a hell of a stunt pony when im finished with him you mean hell do tricks yeah michael grinned at kayla hes already got a few up his sleeve but max now max knows them all want a show really can we itll cost you how much kayla demanded i have money in my bank not money michael said as he led them back to max if you like the show you have to come back and work it off what kind of work ali wanted to know well talk about it come on max michael took a bridle and slipped it on youve got a couple of ladies to impress here at five max was a veteran performer he highstepped it outside pleased to have an audience michael led him to the small paddock beside the building you girls stay at the fence there this could get hairy take your bows max max gracefully bent his front legs and lowered himself when the girls erupted with applause michael could have sworn that max grinned up he ordered using voice and hand signals michael took max through his routine the big horse reared pawed the air let out a high whinny he pranced sidestepped danced circled then when michael swung up onto his bare back he repeated the routine with variations now heres his weve been walking in the desert for three days without water routine at the signal max drooped his head fell limply and he plodded along as though each step would be his last now look out rattlesnake max leapt back bunched up cowered god almighty the posse shot my horse right out from under me dead horse max for his finale max wheeled cantered to the left and dropped to the ground michael tumbled off rolled as he got to his feet he caught sight of laura racing in skinny little heels across the yard oh god are you all right how did it happen oh your horse though he started to speak michael found himself too involved in watching that nifty length of bare leg as she vaulted the fence in her neat little ladys suit max lay dead hardly flicking an eye when laura knelt at his head poor thing poor thing is it his leg whos your vet at the sight of the horse lying with his big head nestled in the lap of lauras pretty blue skirt michael tucked his tongue in his cheek looks like its curtains for old max dont say that laura snapped back he might have just bruised something but what if he hadnt she pushed back the hair that curled flirtatiously at her jaw girls go back to the house now but mama dont argue she couldnt bear the idea of either of them witnessing what might have to be done laura michael began why are you just standing there worry and temper warred in her eyes why arent you doing something the poor thing is suffering and youre just standing there dont you care about your own horse yes maam i do max cut on cue and to lauras astonishment the big horse rolled again then got to his feet it was a trick mama kayla laughed gaily at the shared joke while michael pulled laura up max does tricks he was playing dead like a dog does isnt he wonderful isnt he smart yes under a ragged cloak of dignity laura brushed off her skirt hes certainly talented sorry a wise man knew when to smother a grin michael rarely chose to be wise id have warned you if id seen you coming then you were off and running he scratched his cheek seemed a lot more worried about my horse than about me i could have broken my neck the horse was down laura said primly you werent but everything faded into admiration as max bent his head to her oh he is beautiful arent you gorgeous arent you clever max has been in tots of movies ali moved closer so has mr fury oh stunts michael explained he took a carrot out of his pouch handed it to laura give him that hes your slave for life who could resist as she offered the treat she spoke slowly didnt i tell you girls not to pester mr fury yes but he said we werent kayla smiled hopefully up at michael standing on the rail of the fence she lifted her arms confident because you werent he hauled her up fit her so naturally on his hip that laura frowned i like the company he said to laura so do the horses they get tired of looking at me all day the kids are welcome to come by anytime if theyre in my way ill tell them to kaylas delight and lauras momentary horror he plunked kayla onto maxs wide back its high look how high up i am im trying not to laura said her hand automatically going to the bridle hes a stunt horse not a saddle pony gentle as a lamb michael assured her then lifted ali over the fence and put her behind her sister hell carry the three of you if you want hes also strong as a bull no thank you her heart settled as she looked into maxs eyes they were indeed gentle im not exactly dressed for it so i noticed you look good ms templeton and you looked damned good climbing over the fence she looked back into michaels eyes gentle no indeed she thought but just as compelling i imagine i made quite a picture you dont know the half of it sugar she stepped back okay girls partys over you need to wash up for dinner ali started to complain stopped herself she didnt want to risk being told she couldnt come back can mr fury come to dinner oh discomfort and manners manners always won of course michael youre welcome to come and if hed ever received a cooler and less enthusiastic invitation he couldnt remember thanks but i have plans im heading over to joshs to meet his son well then she reached up lifted kayla then ali to the ground well get out of your way there were a couple of things i wanted to run by you if youve got a minute of course her feet were killing her all she wanted was to take off those damn heels and sit down girls tell annie ill be in shortly thank you mr fury her mothers daughter to the core ali offered a hand youre welcome thanks mr fury for showing us the horses and the tricks and everything i want to tell annie kayla started to race off but stopped at the fence mr fury yes maam she giggled at that then sobered can you teach dogs too if you had a puppy or somebody did could you teach him tricks like max i expect i could if he was a good dog she smiled again wistfully then hurried away behind her sister she wants a dog laura murmured i didnt know she never said she asked years ago but peter damn it i should have realized intrigued michael watched the varied emotions play over her face and the weightiest was guilt do you always beat yourself up this way i should have known shes my child i should have known she wanted a puppy suddenly tired she dragged her hands through her hair so get her one her chin set i will im sorry shaking off the guilt she looked back at michael what did you need oh i need a lot of things casually he draped an arm around maxs neck a hot meal a fast car the love of a good woman but what we both need is a couple of mousers excuse me you need some barn cats laura you got rodents oh god she shuddered once blew out a breath i should have realized that too we used to keep some when we had horses but peter she broke off shut her eyes no she was not traveling down that road again ill be making a trip to the pound it seems ill get a couple of cats youre going to get your kid a dog from the pound and why not no reason he led max toward the fence figured you for the purebred type thats all thats the way some people are about horses they want arabians thoroughbreds ive got me one of the prettiest fillies you could want in that stable shes smart as a whip and quick as a snake shes what youd call a mongrel though always liked mongrels myself i prefer character above lineage good for you in an absentminded movement he bent down plucked a struggling buttercup out of its patch of grass and handed it to her id say youve got both in those girls of yours theyre beauties heartbreakers the little ones already wrapped her fist around mine and she knows it you surprise me she stared down at the sunny yellow flower in her hand baffled despite fatigue and aching feet she followed him into the stables you dont strike me as a man whod take to children little girls mongrels are full of surprises i didnt mean i know you didnt he settled max in his stall latched the door the little ones got your eyes smoke and storms alis got your mouth soft and wanting to be stubborn he grinned then you breed good laura i suppose i should thank you though no ones ever put it quite that way before and i appreciate your entertaining them but i dont want you to feel obligated i dont i said i like them i meant it besides they owe me for the show me and max dont work for free i could use some help around here help mucking out hauling hay unless youve got a problem with your progeny shoveling manure shed shoved plenty herself in her day no itll be good for them automatically she lifted a hand to stroke maxs nose youve worked a minor miracle here she noted glancing down the spotless building ive got a strong back and plenty of ambition for making something out of this saddle horses trick ponies jumpers ive got a way with them if max is any example id say youve got a major way with them were you really a mercenary among other things including the troublemaking hoodlum mrs sullivan claims i am oh she rolled her eyes at max cleared her throat i expect annies remembering the boy who gave josh his first cigarette one of my lesser crimes i quit six months ago myself easier than worrying about setting fire to the hay or dying of lung cancer you gotta die of something she turned just as he reached up to slip the bridle off max their bodies bumped as much out of curiosity as to steady her he took her arms soft fragile as hed imagined and as he shifted just a little the gentle swell of her breasts pressed against him her eyes had whipped to his at first contact they stayed there as her heart hammered i always wondered what kind of handful youd be he smiled let his hands run up and down those pretty arms never had the opportunity to find out before of course you were too young for me back then youve caught up close enough now excuse me that was her voice calm and cool she was able to manage that though everything inside her was hot and unsteady youre not in my way easily he lifted a hand to toy with a curl that flirted with her cheek then youre in mine she didnt know how to handle men had never had to really but she was smart enough to know that now she needed a crash course im not interested in flirtations me either she borrowed a page from margos book made her eyes bored michael im sure scores of women would be flattered if i had the time i might be flattered myself but i dont have the time my children are waiting to have their dinner youve got that down he acknowledged lady of the manor you were born for it he stepped back if you find yourself with time on your hands you know where to find me give my best to josh and margo she said as she set out on watery legs for the house sure hey sugar bristling only a little at the term she looked back the mousers dont come bringing me some furry little kittens i want big hungry toms ill see what i can do im sure you will he murmured as she walked away christ what a package he said to max amused at himself michael rubbed the heel of his hand against his heart it had yet to settle down for him shes the type that makes a man feel like a big hungry torn and clumsy with it shaking his head michael headed upstairs to wash off the stable dirt so margos a mommy michael grinned at his hostess who failed to look the least bit maternal in a peachtoned jumpsuit that clung glamorously to every curve im a great mommy she kissed both his cheeks european fashion i love being a mommy drawing back she took a long look and wasnt disappointed whats it been michael six years seven longer i was trying to tear up the european circuit and you were taking the continent by storm those were the days she said lightly and tucking her arm through his led him inside great place he wasnt surprised by the elegance of the california spanish but he was by its coziness kate turned us on to it you remember kate powell sure they strolled out of the tiled foyer into a spacious room with a blazing fire and twin sofas in deep maroon hows she doing i heard shes married now still a newlywed youd like byron i think well have to have a party when youre settled introduce you around im not much of a partier these days a small one then what can i get you to drink she glided behind a deeply carved bar josh will be right down he had a meeting run over got a beer i think we can manage that from the small cold box under the bar she chose a bottle so its horses now it seems to be he watched her open the bottle pour beer smoothly into a pilsner on the third finger of her left hand diamonds and gold flashed her hair was more gold soft flowing waves of it and there were more diamonds at her ears still he saw that it was her eyes that shined the brightest you look good margo happy its nice to see you happy a little surprised she glanced up really you never seemed to be really quite there apparently you were right she set the glass on the bar and pried the silver wine saver off a bottle of champagne but ive gotten there a wife a mommy and a shopkeeper he lifted his glass in a toast whod have thought it and doing a marvelous job at all three after pouring herself a flute of champagne she toasted herself in turn youll have to come by pretenses michael were on cannery row ill come see your shop you come see my horses thats a deal im sorry about your house he shrugged his shoulders no big deal i didnt like it anyway i was more pissed off about the stables id barely gotten them finished when i lost them still its just wood and nails i can buy more it must have been horrible ive seen film of mud slides and the aftermath of some i cant imagine being in the middle of it you dont want to he still had moments when the image of driving rain thundering earth and wicked winds flashed into his mind and the panic that came with the flash that he wouldnt be quick enough strong enough smart enough to save what mattered to him anyway im working on the plans for rebuilding got a contractor lined up its mostly just time and money im sure youll be comfortable at templeton house until youve rebuilt its hard not to be i met lauras kids today beautiful kids the older ones reserving judgment on me but kayla he chuckled she just moves right in theyre wonderful girls lauras done a terrific job there she hasnt changed much more than you might think the divorce was hard on her terribly hard but shes got that strong templeton core you never met peter ridgeway did you nope trust me margo said and drank deeply hes a bastard sugar you hate him ill hate him too laughing she took his hand its good to have you back michael moving in on my wife already fury josh came in an owleyed baby on his hip my kid and ill fight you for her i think he could take me curious michael set his beer aside and walked over to study j t the baby studied him right back then reached out and grabbed a handful of michaels hair come here slugger even as margo opened her mouth dozens of maternal warnings on her tongue michael nipped j t neatly out of joshs arms and settled him on his own hip the natural move made margos eyes blink in surprise then narrow with speculation enjoying the stranger j t gurgled great job harvard michael gave j t a quick nuzzle congratulations thanks josh grinned at his wife i had a little help chapter five laura did bring home a fuzzy little kitten in fact she brought home two and a pair of lean sharpeyed toms and a bigfooted puppy with a spotted coat and an eager tongue the small zoo in her car caused her a bit of trouble but gave her a great deal of pleasure she drove home with cats meowing bitterly in their boxes kittens sleeping on the car mat and an adoring puppy sprawled in her lap wait until the girls get a load of you already in love she stroked the puppys head and i guess if they fight over you ill just have to go back and pick up a brother or sister for you laughing she turned into the drive at templeton house so foolish she realized not to have done this before old habits she mused peter hadnt wanted pets so there had been no pets but peter had been gone nearly two years and that was two years too long not to have made some simple adjustments after parking the car she glanced around at her menagerie and blew out a breath how the hell am i going to manage to get you all inside she had a leash for the pup which she attached to his brandnew collar she held out no hope that he would understand the purpose for a brief moment she considered laying on the horn until someone came out to give her a hand which she assumed would send her new petting zoo into a frenzy so shed deal with it herself you first she decided and opened the door the puppy cowered sniffed at the empty space on the other side of her lap then gathering his courage he jumped if she hadnt been laughing so hard she would have held on to the leash but the pup landed in a sprawl and looked so surprised that she roared with laughter and the leather slid out of her hands he was off and running oh damn it still laughing she sprang out of the car come back here you idiot instead he raced in circles then cut through old joes pampered bed of narcissus yapping joyously all the way oh thats going to be a problem she realized wincing she walked around the car to retrieve the sleepy kittens in the back the toms continued to complain at the top of their lungs all right all right give me a minute here inspired she tucked a kitten in each of her jacket pockets then hauled out the cat boxes you two are michaels problem following the excited barks she headed toward the stables the sight that greeted her when she stepped through the arbor of wisteria was worth every moment of annoyance in the far yard her daughters were kneeling on the ground embracing and being embraced by a wildly enthusiastic spotted mutt she took the picture in her mind slipped it into her heart look mama kayla was already shouting as laura started toward them come quick and look at the little puppy he must be lost he doesnt look lost to me he has a leash ali giggled a sound laura could never hear often enough as he scrambled into her lap maybe he ran away from home i dont think so he is home hes ours ali simply stared but we cant have pets with a smile laura adjusted her boxes he doesnt seem to agree with you do you mean it kayla rose the expression of stunned joy on her face carved itself into lauras heart do you mean he can be our puppy and we can keep him forever thats exactly what i mean mama in one leap kayla had her arms wrapped around her mothers waist she clung hard fierce mama thank you ill take such good care of him youll see i know you will honey she looked over at ali who remained still staring we all will he needs a good home and lots of love well give him that wont we ali inner conflict held her back her father had said pets were a nuisance messy they shed hair all over the rug but the puppy was sniffing at her leg wagging his tail and trying to jump into her arms well take good care of him she said solemnly she started to step forward stopped her mouth went lax in shock mama your pockets are moving oh with a laugh laura set her boxes down reached in and plucked out two furry balls one silken gray and the other sassy orange from her pockets what have we here kittens kayla squealed grabbed kittens we have kittens too look ali we have everything theyre so tiny gently cautiously ali took the mewling gray mama theyre so tiny theyre just babies just over six weeks old every bit as much in love as her daughters were laura stroked a fingertip down the sleepy gray they needed a home too its really all right half afraid to hope ali looked up into her mothers eyes its really all right for us to keep them all its really all right more tuning in to the sounds coming from the cardboard boxes kayla pounced no those arent ours those are barn cats for michael ill take them to him desperate to share her fabulous news with anyone who would listen kayla handed her kitten to ali and hefted both boxes by the straps grunting a little she headed toward the stables come on cats come on ill take you home do they have names hmm absently laura stroked her daughters hair then made herself look away from the comical picture of kayla bobbling along with two boxes full of impatient felines and a puppy racing around her legs in clumsy bigfooted circles they will have when we pick them out can i name one myself pick out the name all by myself for the little gray kitten ali lifted it to her cheek of course you can what name would you like is it a boy or a girl its i dont know laura realized i forgot to ask its probably on one of the papers i filled out with one arm around alis shoulders she walked after kayla the puppys a boy and both big cats are boys because thats what michael wanted because he likes boys better uhoh no honey i guess he figured tomcats would be meaner and he wanted mousers her eyes went huge hes going to let them eat mice baby im afraid thats what cats do ali pressed the little ball of fluff to her cheek mine wont kaylas voice was already echoing in high excited chirps accented by the yaps of the pup who had raced inside the stables with her when laura stepped in and her eyes adjusted to the dim light she saw michael and kayla crouched together on the brick floor taking stock of templeton houses new mutt looks like a good dog to me michael stated giving the pup an energetic scratch between the ears so you can teach him tricks right mr fury how to sit and play dead and shake i expect the pup sniffed curiously at one of the cat boxes and was rewarded with a spitting hiss yelping he streaked away and cringed behind lauras legs hes already learned something with a grin michael opened the first box dont mess with a cornered torn no honey michael took kaylas hand before she could reach in to pet the cat i doubt hes in a friendly mood at the moment dont like being cooped up there do you big guy lets get you and your pal out he opened the other box then drew kayla back well just let them get the lay of the land once theyve catted around some theyll settle in his eyes skimmed over laura lingered then moved on whatcha got there ali kittens alis hands and heart were full of them already mama brought us kittens too fuzzy little kitties as he walked to them he ran his tongue around his teeth cute mama said i could name the gray one myself then i get to name the orange one staking her claim kayla took the orange kitten out of alis hand and nuzzled it against her cheek dont i mama fair enough well have a naming marathon after dinner well just get out of mr furys way cant we show the kittens to max cant we sure you can michael winked at kayla hes a real softie when the girls raced off the pup at their heels michael shook his head what the hell have you done laura made my girls very happy she pushed back her hair and saved five lives in the bargain do you have a problem with kittens and puppies nope the cats had leaped out of their boxes and were slinking around growling softly michael reached over and stroked the nose of his sober gelding you ever do anything halfway ive been known to she unbent enough to smile i couldnt stop myself if youd seen the girls faces when i told them that silly little dog was theirs ill never forget it with the same absent affection hed shown the gelding michael stroked her cheek he didnt know if he was amused or annoyed when she jerked like a spring you need some training yourself excuse me you shy easy i appreciate you picking up the cats for me he said before she could think of a response no trouble the whole lot of them need to go to the vet shots neutering ouch in a kneejerk male reaction he winced yeah i guess thats the deal its the responsible choice and its required when you adopt from the shelter i have all the paperwork except i what well i didnt think to ask about the sex of the kittens i dont know if they told me it started to get complicated and confusing and i think ive heard that its difficult to tell with young kittens it took an effort but he kept his eyes solemn ive always heard you shake em if they dont rattle theyre female it took her a moment then she broke into easy appreciative laughter ill be sure to try it when the girls arent around there you are i dont suppose ive heard you laugh like that more than a half a dozen times since ive known you you were always being too dignified when i was around im sure youre mistaken sugar i dont make many mistakes when it comes to women no i dont imagine you would to give herself a moment to make her retreat yes damn it a dignified retreat she turned to the gelding this is a handsome horse hes smart quietnatured jack at his name the horse pricked his ears soberly he turned his head to michael how old are you jack in response the horse stomped a foot four times what do you think of the lady here jack rolled his eyes toward laura and let out a quiet and undeniably roguish whinny charmed laura laughed again how do you get him to do that jack he understands every word you say want to take the lady for a ride jack the response was a decisive nod see michael turned his own swift and undeniably roguish grin on laura want a ride lady i god she would love one love to feel a horse beneath her again let it have its head let herself lose hers id enjoy that but i dont have the time she offered michael a polite distant smile ill take a rain check cash it in whenever you like too used to thoroughbreds he assumed and shrugged hed take jack over some finicky purebred any day thank you id better get my motley crew inside that is if annie lets us inside shes a tough nut mrs sullivan shes family laura corrected but i should have warned her before i started a small zoo that small zoo is going to keep you up most of the night ill manage she managed but it wasnt a walk in the park the puppy whimpered and whined and despite kaylas lavish love was satisfied with nothing less than lauras bed she knew it was a mistake but she couldnt bring herself to banish him when he cuddled so hopefully against her side the kittens mewed fretted cried and eventually were comforted by each other and the hot water bottle that an already doting annie provided as a result laura was grittyeyed and foggybrained the next morning she fumbled at the keyboard in her office at the hotel cursed herself then focused on the file for an upcoming writers convention twelve hundred people checking in at approximately the same time certainly on the same day were going to present a challenge then there were the hospitality suites banquet and seminar rooms audio equipment pitchers of water requests for coffee services catering demands cartons of books were already arriving by the truckload she appreciated the spirit of the planned book signing for literacy as well as the headaches it was going to cause her and her staff composing a memo onehanded she picked up her ringing phone at the sound of the conference coordinators voice she straggled not to wince yes melissa its laura templeton how can i help you today and tomorrow and for the rest of my natural life she thought as the woman requested more additions more changes just a few more little adjustments naturally if the weathers inclement and were unable to hold your welcoming party at poolside well provide you with an alternate space the garden ballroom is lovely we often hold wedding receptions there its still available for that date she listened rubbed fingers against her temple no im not able to do that melissa but if we do book the ballroom well provide another alternate i realize were talking more than a thousand people well accommodate you she continued to listen made notes that somehow became mindless doodles yes im looking forward to seeing you again too ill be in touch taking one breath one moment to clear her mind again she got back to her memo laura she didnt groan but she wanted to byron did we have a meeting no he stepped in seemed to fill her small office with his size arent you taking lunch lunch it cant be noon no it cant he said mildly as she looked at her watch its half past noon the morning got away from me im due at the shop in an hour i have to finish this is there something urgent eyeing her he closed the door at his back take a break i really cant i need take a break he repeated thats an order to ensure that she obeyed it he sat down now ms templeton lets talk about delegating byron i do delegate its just that fitz is running ragged over the milhousedrury wedding reception and robyns swamped the pharmaceutical convention and a kid with chicken pox and and it all comes down to you he finished you look exhausted honey she pouted are you speaking as my brotherinlaw or as executive director both if youre not going to take care of yourself i am taking care of myself she smothered a smile byrons stand on health and fitness was well known i just didnt get much sleep last night i went to the pound yesterday he brightened as shed known he would hed adopted two dogs the year before yeah what did you get a puppy and two kittens the girls are in ecstasy and this morning i caught annie carrying the pup like he was a newborn baby and telling him that good dogs mustnt piddle on the bokhara rug start stocking up on newspaper well have to come over and check out your new additions come by tonight he raised an eyebrow before or after the country club dance the valentines day dance she shut her eyes i forgot no getting out of it laura youre a templeton youre expected i know i know there went the long indulgent bathandearlytobed night shed been fantasizing about ill be there i would have remembered if you hadnt kate and margo would have reminded you look why dont you let your partners handle the shop this afternoon go take a nap jt is having his checkup this afternoon i cant leave kate on her own were inundated with the valentines day sale which reminds me understanding she smiled its only the tenth byron you still have time to pick up that wellthoughtout loving gift and no matter what kate says dont buy her computer software flowers always work for me and no one had sent her flowers she thought in too long to remember when her mind drifted to a tiny yellow wildflower she pulled it back and called herself an idiot shes not getting that new calculator shes been hinting for either he rose do you want a lift to the club tonight so went the life of a single woman laura mused always tagging along with couples no thanks ill see you there im not the country club type josh as if someone had already forced him into a suit michael rolled his shoulders id consider it a favor scowling michael measured out grain i hate it when you do that and id be able to introduce you to a lot of potential horse owners i happen to know someone who has an impressive stud you did say you have a mare ready to breed yeah shes ready and he wanted the right sire for her so youll give me his name and ill talk to him i dont have to go to some lame dance and im the last person your sister wants taking her to some lame dance its not like a date so margo had said when shed drilled the request into his head its just that lauras feeling like a third wheel at these things i didnt realize it myself but margo pointed it out and josh thought as he watched michael divvy up grains had made him feel like a lower form of life then i realized how often laura either skips going to events or cuts out early it would be nice for her to have an escort thats all a woman like your sister ought to have a platoon of likely escorts lined up and waiting and all with the proper pedigree michael thought yeah well she doesnt seem interested in swimming with the sharks in the dating pool was he supposed to do something about that too josh wondered and nearly shuddered she knows you mick shed be comfortable with you and it would give you the chance to make some contacts everybodys happy im not happy when i have to wear a tie he glanced over his shoulder and grinned not like you harvard in your fancy italian suit get the hell out of my barn come on mick its just one night out of your fascinating and funfilled life well hit the game room play some billiards tell some lies there was that michael considered and the alternative was a sandwich and an evening hunkered over his drawings for his projected house i can still bury your ass at pool ill lend you a tie fuck you one of the cats streaked by pounced in a blur of black there was a short squeal christ thats disgusting thats life harvard michael moved back to deal with darlings meal measuring the additives necessary for her condition you really know what youre doing around here dont you apparently we all have our niche josh mused over how many niches michael had already found and rejected yet he had a feeling this one was different theyd known each other too long and too well for josh to miss the easy contentment in his friends moves a contentment he thought that had never quite been there before this is the one isnt it michael glanced over he didnt need to explain not to josh he only needed to say one word yeah if i know you you want to make something big out of it he yearned to in my own time josh took his waiting while michael fed the expectant mother checked her haynet babied her monterey riding academy the owners are friends of the family so theyll be at the club tonight kate was their accountant when she was with bittle and associates they do a lot of buying and selling so do their students ambition michael admitted was always a trap youre a slick son of a bitch harvard you always were josh merely grinned we all have our niche laura might not go for this little arrangement of yours i can handle laura josh said confidently and checked his watch ive got enough time to slip by the shop and do just that before my last meeting today the dance is at nine ill tell her youll pick her up at eightthirty wearing a tie if you dont make this worth my while pal ill have to kick your ass he brushed grain dust from his hands i wont enjoy it but ill have to do it understood satisfied with the outcome of his mission josh headed for the door ah you do know the way to the club dont you appreciating the sarcasm michael tilted his head maybe i will enjoy it after all she was furious livid and trapped theyd ganged up on her laura fumed as she yanked the pearl gray miska cocktail dress out of her closet josh and margo and kate cornering her at pretenses and all but presenting her with a fait accompli michael fury was escorting her to the country club dance the arrangement would suit everyone they wouldnt have to worry about her driving there and back alone or about her feeling awkward at an event designed for couples michael would gain an entree and make contacts in the horse world oh yeah it suited everyone just fine everyone but herself it was humiliating she thought as she jerked the zipper up a thirtyyearold woman being fixed up by her big brother worse now michael knew that she was the pathetic divorcee who couldnt get her own date as if she wanted one in the first place or the last place or any place at all for that matter which i dont she told the dog who had come into her room to watch her every move with adoring eyes i dont even want to go to the damn country club tonight im tired sympathetically he wiggled his butt as she stormed over to the closet for shoes and a beaded jacket she didnt need to hang on to a mans arm to feel complete she didnt need to hang on to anything anyone why couldnt she just crawl into bed and read a book she wondered eat popcorn and watch an old movie on tv until she fell asleep with the set still on why did she have to dress up go out in public and be laura templeton she stopped sighed because she was laura templeton that was something she couldnt forget laura templeton had responsibilities she had an image to maintain so she told herself as she picked up her lipstick and applied it skillfully she would maintain it she would get through the evening say the right things to the right people she would be as polite and friendly to michael as necessary and when the whole blasted thing was over she would fall facedown on her bed and forget it until the next time she checked her hair god she needed a trim and when was she going to fit that in she turned for her bag and watched in mild horror as the pup wet on her aubusson oh bongo he grinned up at her and sat in his own pee it was only a small rebellion but michael didnt wear a tie he figured that with laura templeton at his side they wouldnt boot him out for wearing a black turtleneck under his jacket he parked between the island of spring bulbs and the grand front entrance and if hed been wearing a tie he would have tugged at it nerves they amazed him disgusted him but no matter how much he wanted to deny it he felt like some pimplyfaced teenager on a first date ignoring the sky dusted with icy stars the sheen of silvering moonlight the scent of sea and flowers he walked to the door like a man taking his last mile in shackles how the hell had he let himself get talked into this hed never used the front door at templeton house as a boy if he came by for josh or came along with him he used the side or rear the entrance was so damned imposing grandly tall recessed and framed in tile the knocker was a huge brass affair in the shape of a stylized t over his head hung an antique carriage light it didnt make him feel welcome nor did ann sullivan when she opened the door to his knock she stood tightlipped in her starched black dress he noted first that the years sat lightly on her she was a lovely woman if you looked past the jaundiced eye margo had come by her looks naturally mr fury the faint hint of ireland in her voice might have been charming if it hadnt been so damning because for reasons he couldnt name hed always wanted her approval she put his back up his smile was insolent his voice matched it mrs sullivan its been a while it has she returned clearly telling him it hadnt been nearly long enough youre to come in he accepted the grudging invitation and stepped into the soaring foyer the ivory and peacockblue tiles were the same he noted as was the gorgeously ornate chandelier that sprinkled light the place was welcoming even if its doyenne wasnt it was full of cozy scents rich color warming light ill tell miss laura youre here but as she turned to do so laura came down the wide curving steps though michael would tell himself later that he was a fool his heart stopped the lights caught the fussy beads of her jacket and shot color beneath was a simple dress the color of moondust there were jewels at her ears sapphires and diamonds framing the face that her sweptback hair accented she looked so perfect so lovely with one ringless hand trailing along the glossy banister she might have stepped out of a painting im sorry to keep you waiting her voice was cool betraying none of her panic at the way those eyes of his bored into her or her fluster at having to mop up after the dog just got here he said equally cool then some of the absurdity struck him here he was michael fury holding out a hand for a princess i wasnt supposed to bring like a corsage or something was i she managed a small smile of her own its not the prom amen to that you be careful miss laura ann shot a warning look at michael and you drive responsibly boyo it isnt one of your races annie the dogs in with the girls but dont you worry she gestured toward the door thinking philosophically that the sooner they were gone the sooner shed have her girl back ill take care of him and them try to enjoy yourself and ill try to bring her back in one piece michael added for the hell of it as he opened the door see that you do ann muttered and began to worry the moment the door closed its nice of you to drive me to the club she would put things on the proper footing laura determined and keep them there you dont have to feel obliged to entertain me once were there hed been planning to say pretty much the same thing himself but he resented her saying it first he opened her door leaned on it who are you pissed off at laura me or the world in general im not angry with you or anyone gracefully she slipped into the passenger seat of his porsche im simply explaining matters so that we get through the evening comfortably and here you said you liked mongrels she blinked i dont know what you mean right he resisted barely slamming the door the evening he thought as he rounded the hood was off to a flying start chapter six it could have been worse michael supposed he could have been back in some central american jungle sweating bullets and dodging them he could have had his skull bashed in as he had once when a stunt gag went wrong instead he was standing in a room with people he didnt know and didnt care to know hed rather have had his skull bashed in he thought the room itself was overly cute with its glossy red hearts hanging from swatches of paper lace the flowers were nice he supposed he didnt have any objection to flowers but he thought they carried the obsessive red and white theme too far all of the pinkdraped tables were centered with a grouping of white tapers ringed by a halo of fluffy red and white carnations at least he thought they were carnations and the music he decided it represented the widest culture clash with its mild strings and discreet piano all played by middleaged men in white suits give him blues or honest rock any day but there was a spiffy view of the coastline through a wall of windows the drama of it the war of fretful waves against meanedged rocks provided an interesting contrast to the quiet undeniably stuffy group inside the polished overheated club the women had decked themselves out absolutely dripping bangles and beads and other jewelry he noted they wore layers of perfumes and silks and lace overdone in his estimation like the decor he preferred lauras simple and feminine choice it was class he supposed that set her apart simple class that came straight through the blood and bone he might have mentioned it to her but she had drifted away quickly making as he termed it her templeton rounds most of the men were in tuxes a little fact that josh had conveniently neglected to mention not that michael minded he wouldnt have worn one anyway if hed had one to wear still it gave him another bone to pick with his old friend if the slippery son of a bitch ever showed up on the bright side he had a cold beer in his hand the finger food spread out artistically on buffet tables looked delicate but it tasted fine hed already enjoyed a mild flirtation with a woman who mistook him for some hollywood young gun michael hadnt bothered to disabuse her he was considering wandering about maybe taking a turn outside in the fresh air or checking out one of the other rooms he might find that pool table and a few suckers to fleece then laura moved back to him im sorry there were a few people i needed to speak with in a gesture that was both absentminded and automatic she accepted a glass of champagne from a roving waiter murmured her thanks no problem but it was she thought her problem shed had some time to think about it i am sorry michael i was annoyed with josh for maneuvering me into this evening and i took it out on you when he didnt respond she drummed up a smile so what were you and kitty bennett talking about who oh the ditzy brunette with all the teeth laura choked on her champagne shed never heard the chair of the monterey arts council described just that way or quite that accurately yes she dug my last flick did she he decided to be friendly smiled not braveheart though i had a couple of nice stunts in it she thought i was the director of some art house film something about foot fetishes mmhmm and you discussed the metaphoric twists on our sexobsessed society along with the multiple layers of symbolism representing moral decay he started to feel better something like that she thinks im brilliant and underrated i think i might be getting a grant congratulations of course she really only wanted my body well an artist must make sacrifices ah theres byron and kate michael glanced over his brows rose in surprise as he saw the streamlined brunette in slinky black the gamine face all sloecolored eyes and the closecropped dark hair tipped him off though the girl he remembered had been skinny coltish a borderline nerd thats kate kate powell she works out now laura muttered shes gotten obsessive about it so dont get her started that her trainer michael muttered back measuring the broadshouldered longlimbed man beside her and husband hes also my boss byron she held out a hand as the couple maneuvered through the crowd toward them a quick kiss and she turned to kate margo was right as usual the karan suits you byron de witt michael fury nice to meet you kates been telling me stories and i didnt even need to exaggerate grinning she stepped forward and gave michael a quick friendly hug her arms might have been lean michael noted but they were tough enjoying her he drew her back katie powell looking good because shed always enjoyed him as well she wiggled her brows same goes mick can i get drinks for anyone byron asked in a voice that reminded michael of mint juleps and magnolia ill have what lauras having kate decided michael bass ale that ought to go down just fine byron decided i think ill join you excuse me a minute its the southern kate said watching him walk toward the bar with a proprietary and satisfied gleam in her eye hes just a gentleman it doesnt look like its just the dress that suits you michael commented its not kate turned back smiled warmly and unlike the dress which goes back into stock tomorrow hes all mine so how the hell are you michael fury and when do we get to see your horses it was so easy for kate laura thought as she listened to make the appropriate comments shed fallen right into casual conversation with michael didnt she feel any of those oh she hated to use the term vibes but it was the only word that came to her dark restless dangerous vibes it made her jittery to stand next to him to encounter a brush of his arm against hers to catch that gleam in his hot blue eyes it helped when josh and margo arrived there was more conversation and laughter byron fell into an easy discussion of horses with michael apparently byrons family owned several before the topic switched to cars another interest the men shared byron had arranged to take a look at michaels stock it wasnt difficult to ease away again and draw margo with her so margo began are you enjoying yourself you and michael are getting some speculative looks nothing could have been better designed to set laura off she could see it now perfectly and wondered how shed missed the master plan her temper hitched but she controlled it is that part of your little plot to give the country club set an eyeful of poor laura and her escort when the escort looks like michael margo waved an impatient hand oh lighten up laura its only one evening out of your life and why shouldnt you spend part of it with a goodlooking man god knows youve been hiding out long enough hiding out there was that hitch again is that what you call it dont regretting her choice of words margo put a hand on lauras arm i just meant that youve been so focused on work and responsibility you havent let yourself have much fun so have some ask him to dance take a walk whatever before he and byron bond like siamese twins over engine talk i dont want to dance or take a walk with michael laura said evenly now she felt pathetic the homely younger sister the neglected wallflower the pitiable exwife and im relieved that hes found something to salvage his evening hes been miserably bored then you havent been doing your job have you irritated herself margo inclined her head it wouldnt hurt you to be friendly to the man laura in fact it would be good for you and everyone in close proximity to you if you had a nice hot bout of sex with him and popped your own frustration cork lauras calm gray eyes turned to steel oh really i hadnt realized that those in close proximity were so affected by my lifestyle hey recognizing the signs of a battle in progress kate sidled up are we fighting lauras peeved because we made her come here with michael tonight i like mick kate chose an olive from her tiny plate and popped it into her mouth whats the problem im peeved laura returned emphasizing the word because margo apparently thinks i should jump into bed with him so that she and my other friends dont have to put up with my sexual frustration kate glanced around to where michael and byron and josh stood couldnt hurt she said with a shrug if i wasnt a happily married woman id consider it myself thats nice for you isnt it for both of you happily married women christ i hope i wasnt ever so smug training overcame temper just enough that she managed to walk away instead of stalking wrong buttons kate muttered we definitely pushed the wrong buttons its past time some of them were pushed but margo sighed before sipping her wine i dont mind making her angry but i didnt mean to make her unhappy i just hoped that shed enjoy herself let michael entertain her and eventually screw her brains out kate chuckled youre a considerate friend margo hell are we smug im afraid so a few minutes in the ladies lounge cooled laura off she sat on one of the dainty padded stools at the long mirrored counter and meticulously reapplied her lipstick was she frustrated was she becoming difficult to be around she didnt like to think so what she was was busy focused committed to her family and work what was so wrong with that then she sighed propped her elbows on the counter her head in the vee of her hands no it was she who had blown a simple evening out of proportion she admitted because she hadnt had a simple evening in too long and because she could admit privately she didnt know how to behave with a man especially one like michael fury shed been seventeen when she fell in love with peter eighteen when she married him her dating record beforehand had been brief and uncomplicated shed been married for ten years and had indulged in no flirtations much less affairs the men she knew were relatives or old family friends they were casual acquaintances the husbands of women she knew or business contacts she was thirty years old she thought miserably and she didnt know how to date even when it wasnt a bona fide date when the door to the lounge opened she straightened quickly and took out her comb hi laura judy her smile warmed judy prentice was a friend and a regular customer at pretenses its good to see you you look wonderful holding my own always ready for a chat or a quick gossip judy sat down beside her did you see maddie greene she had a boob job last month she simply couldnt be overly dignified with judy it was a little hard to miss her with those twin soldiers well watch yourself i made the polite comment when she brought it up i think i said something about them looking very perky she grinned when laura snorted next thing i knew shed dragged me in here and stripped to the waist to show them off up close my dear and much too personal oh god thanks for the warning i have to admit theyre beauties speaking of which judy set down her jeweled compact i didnt recognize that incredibly gorgeous specimen youre with tonight is he from around here hes an old friend judy rolled her eyes we should all have such old friends hes just moved back to the area a little thought leaked through your daughter takes riding lessons doesnt she judy shes horse crazy i went through the same stage but it seems to be sticking with mandy michael raises horses trains them hes working out of templeton house for the moment until he can rebuild his property was destroyed in those mud slides oh god werent they horrible another friend of mine watched her house slide down a cliff just going going gone heartbreaking judy dabbed perfume at her wrists why do we live in california i hear its the weather laura said dryly in any case you might want to contact michael if you decide to get mandy a mount of her own actually we are considering it her birthdays coming up and theres nothing shed like better than her own horse lips pursed in thought judy replaced her perfume thanks for the tip ill talk to my husband about it meanwhile good luck with your old friend laura left the lounge in better spirits the evening was wearing on she was getting through it the least she could do was make an effort to enjoy what was left of it cooled off she jumped a little muffled an oath must the man sneak up behind her im sorry you looked ready to chew steel when you marched off to the ladies room michael handed her a fresh glass of champagne maybe it was indigestion i ran into a friend in there you women have little summit meetings in the john dont you isnt that why you usually go inside in packs actually we play poker and smoke cigars but my point is this friend of mine has a daughter and shes very keen on riding theyre considering buying her a horse i gave judy your name i hope you dont mind hey anytime you want to toss business my way feel free i like your brotherinlaw it showed i expected the two of you to have a secret handshake by now is that a subtle way of telling me i was ignoring you no she said it too quickly and then tried to backtrack not at all im glad you and byron hit it off she spotted him on the dance floor with kate and her eyes warmed theyre so happy together theyve only been married a couple of months but with some people you can just tell that the way they look at each other isnt going to change your romantic sides showing she didnt take offense im allowed to have one then i guess i should ask you to dance she looked up at him what the hell she decided then i guess i should accept before he could take her hand he saw her smile fade and freeze her color drain to white the hand that had lifted to take his fell to her side whats the problem she only took a quiet shaky breath hello peter candy laura michael shifted his hand instinctively moving to the small of lauras back to support her this must be the ex he realized with the perky cateyed redhead clinging to his arm he supposed this would be lauras type tall and golden distinguished perfectly presented in a tailored tux diamonds winking discreetly at his cuffs i didnt realize you were in town laura managed she knew though conversations continued that attention was focusing on the little tableau when i spoke to you about allisons school supper you indicated youd be away my plans changed a bit but im still not able to attend he said it formally as if declining an invitation to a polo match its very important to her peter just a few hours and my plans are important to me his gaze flicked to michael lingered in speculation i dont believe i know your escort michael fury and michael didnt offer a hand of course i thought i recognized you candy litchfields voice bubbled up michael is an old friend of josh templetons darling you ran away to sea or something didnt you or something michael said sparing her a glance her type had always grated on him overly bright overly vicious i dont remember you the statement had been calculated to deflate and annoy he usually hit his mark she bristled a little then purred well after all we didnt run in the same circles did we your mother was a waitress wasnt she thats right at templeton resort and my father ran off with a redhead i dont think she was related to you i shouldnt think so after sneering down her nose she looked back at laura now dont nag peter laura weve been so incredibly pressed weve hardly had time to catch our breath since we got in this morning weve been in st thomas how lovely for you but the fact is that these pesky domestic details do require some communication if youd she trailed off as her gaze lighted on the ring candy was displaying on the hand she deliberately fluttered against peters chest the stone was as big as a hens egg sitting atop a platinum tiffany setting satisfied that shed finally shifted lauras attention where she wanted it candy giggled oh dear youve found us out peter and i want to make the announcement quietly but im sure i can trust you to be discreet and miserable she hoped shed detested laura for more years than she cared to count and now she savored her moment of triumph every muscle in her stomach twisted as laura looked into peters eyes oh they were amused coolly amused congratulations im sure youll be very happy together i have no doubt of it candace was perfect for him he thought perfect for this new stage of his life just as laura had been perfect for another stage were planning a small ceremony in may in palm springs not too small candy pouted prettily but her eyes were gleaming as they stayed locked on lauras face mays such a lovely month for a wedding dont you think something charming and alfresco would be nice but not too small or informal after all a bride needs to show off a bit and youd know all about that lauras hands were threatening to tremble it couldnt be permitted are you planning on telling the girls about your marriage peter or is that up to me ill leave that to you im sure theyll be delighted candy purred as she slid a glass off the tray of a nearby waiter mine are little charles is very fond of peter and adrianna is thrilled with the prospect of a wedding how nice for you laura said stiffly but then charles and adrianna must be used to your weddings by now dont be snide laura peters voice was cool and mild it never suited you youll have to excuse us now we need to mingle steady michael murmured as they slipped away that bitch how am i going to tolerate that bitch being stepmother to my babies how am i going to stand it it surprised him that that would be her first thought then he realized it shouldnt have theyre bright girls laura and she doesnt strike me as the maternal type i cant stay here before she could dash he took a firm hold on her arm the way he drew her to him made it seem as if they were sharing secrets you run out now its going to look like retreat thats not what you want i cant stay here there was panic swirling inside her along with a bubbling brew of fury how could he do this how could he do this to them odd he thought that she couldnt see that both peter and candy had done it to her very deliberately and very well if im any judge everybody in this room is wondering just how laura templeton is going to handle this little meeting with her ex and his kewpie doll i think we should have that dance he was right of course he was exactly pathetically right however hurt however shocked there was still pride she wouldnt allow candy to snicker over her retreat okay she walked with him to the dance floor as if she wanted nothing more than a quiet turn the music was soft some moody number from the forties it was designed to be romantic she thought instead it rang in her ears like a battle cry shes not going to get her pinching little ringers on my babies laura said between her teeth i dont imagine shed get past you to pinch anyone if that was her goal it wouldnt hurt if you looked at me he slipped his arms around her found they fit well discovered her steps matched his smoothly maybe even smiled they only came here to slap at me neither one of them gave a single thought to the children shes a mother herself michael how can she not care about the children too much in love with herself stop worrying about it she isnt going to make time in her social calendar to play stepmama smile he murmured touching a hand lightly to her cheek you can make everybody believe youre only thinking about me and what were going to do when we leave here thatll burn their ass he was right again and she made her lips curve im sorry you got caught in the cross fire hell its just a flesh wound he was rewarded by a quick honest laugh youre nicer than i remembered michael and im a mess you look pretty neat and tidy to me you always did weve got them wondering now he bent his head so that his cheek brushed hers his mouth close to her ear just who is that guy laura templetons wrapped around how long has this been going on she was beginning to wonder the same thing herself not everyones that interested in my business his breath blew warm against her ear come on sugar you fascinate them cool composed laura its been poor laura for a little too long now her voice was tight again poor laura whose husband cheated on her with his secretary poor laura wholl have to hold her head up now that her ex is marrying her former cochair of the garden club jesus you played with that irritating little redhead he shook his head im disappointed in you tell you what now that theyre wondering why dont we give them something to talk about over brunch tomorrow his mouth slid around grazed her cheek before she could jolt from the shock of that it was fixed warmly on hers the kiss was long and slow her head reeled once and the hand on his shoulder flexed open and dug in he eased back barely an inch so that the only thing she could see was his eyes lets try that again he said softly i think youll get the hang of it she would have protested she wasnt the kind of woman who indulged in smoldering kisses in public or in smoldering kisses in private for that matter but his mouth was on hers again clever persuasive hot and she was swept along the rich male taste the firm knowing lips the confident exploration of tongue and rough scrape of teeth no one had kissed her like that before as if her mouth was the source of all pleasure something hummed in her throat that might have been shock but was more likely wonder as he had wondered what would she taste like feel like be like what he found was a banquet of contrasts heat filtered through cool armor shyness fluttering under composure she was trembling erotic little shivers that shot need straight to his loins and that reminded him that no matter how much he might enjoy the experiment they werent alone in a place where they could analyze the results that ought to do it he murmured it sure as hell convinced me she could do nothing but stare up at him somehow they were still dancing she knew her feet however disassociated they seemed from the rest of her were moving sugar struggling to keep it light when he would have been happier devouring her in a couple of quick bites he lifted her hand nipped at the knuckles you keep looking at me that way theyre going to have more to talk about than a couple of kisses she tore her gaze away stared determinedly over his shoulder you caught me off guard that makes two of us we can leave now if you want nobodys going to think its a retreat yes she kept her back stiff fighting to ignore the familiar and enticing way his hand continued to stroke it id like to go home she didnt speak again until they stood on the wide veranda of the entrance to the clubhouse one of the eager valets rushed off to fetch michaels car and they remained there sheltered with the lights and music behind them and the night moonswept and shadowed in front should i thank you jesus he rammed his hands into his pockets she was about as approachable now as polished marble did it seem like i was making a sacrifice ive given some thought to kissing you and if you want to step off that goddamn pedestal again for a minute youll admit you knew id given some thought to it im not trying to make you angry just a happy accident then laura he turned to her not completely sure of his next move then swore as the valet zipped his car up to the base of the stairs thats a beauty sir the boy said then beamed at the tip michael all but threw at him thank you sir drive safely calmer once he had the car racing away from the club michael took a breath look sugar you took a hard knock in there im sorry for it if you ask me that jerk you made the mistake of marrying isnt worth a minute of your time she wasnt asking him was she laura thought nastily im not concerned about me its the girls parents get divorced its a fact of life fathers take off and ignore their kids another fact thats very easy to say when you dont have children to concern you a shadow crossed his face no i dont have any children ive been one who lived through divorce and neglect though you get through it she shut her eyes shed forgotten that his father had left him and his mother im sorry but that doesnt make it right allison needs his attention and his disinterest hurts her what about you are you still in love with him no god no candys welcome to him shes just not welcome to my girls i dont see them giving her more than the patented templeton dismissal that small polite smile we dont do that oh sugar yes you do she shifted and aimed a steady glance at him do you know why you call womensugar michael that way when you roll off one in the middle of the night you dont have to remember annoying little details like her name his mouth twitched into something between a grimace and a smile close enough i guarantee ill remember yours laura if youre considering letting me roll off of you tonight she wasnt sure if she was shocked outraged or amused but she did know that most of the sting from peter had faded thats an incredibly flattering offer michael i dont know when ive had one quite so honest he suggested crude she finished im afraid ill have to decline up to you how about a walk on the cliffs instead on impulse he swung the car to the shoulder they speared magnetic moonkissed and entirely too romantic because she could envision herself walking them with him their hands clasped she shook her head im not wearing the right shoes for cliff walking then well just sit here a minute i dont think i have something to say to you nerves began to hum again she clasped her hands in her lap she was parked on a dark road in the moonlight something she hadnt done in too many years to count all right youre a beautiful desirable woman when her head snapped around and he saw her eyes wide and confused he nearly laughed i guess thats something you hear all the time it certainly wasnt which left her at a loss as to how to respond im flattered you think so i want you now there was panic fizzing up like champagne in a shaken bottle i dont what do you expect me to say to that god despite the shoes she wrenched open the door and stepped out into the night i didnt ask you to say anything im telling you he came up beside her and turned her to face him its probably a mistake but im telling you anyway i have memories of you i didnt realize how many until i saw you again and they just popped out of my head i used to think about you damned inconvenient and embarrassing to be thinking about you the way i was when you were the kid sister of my best friend josh would have kicked my ass for what i was thinking and id have had to let him im no good at this she moved back retreating quickly im no good at this sort of thing youll have to stop not till im finished i never stop until im finished keep backing up that way sugar laura he corrected himself as he grabbed her arm youre going to break an ankle i dont mind you being afraid of me id be surprised if you werent his grin flashed hell id be insulted just hold still a minute he held both of her hands at her sides and moved in im not going to hurt you he murmured as his mouth lowered this time it didnt hurt devastation came too quickly for pain he simply undid her with one soft lazy kiss then with another harder impatient until that reckless relentless mouth against hers chipped away at the wall of restraint and she knew that marriage hadnt prepared her for this kind of desire the kind that curled like raw ragged fists in the gut and twisted in angry frustration when she gave he wanted more he wanted her there atop the windy cliff with the moon spotlighting them and the violent thrust of the waves matching the way he imagined thrusting into her and he knew greed could be his undoing i want you to think about it he told her the horses taught me patience so ive got a small store where youre concerned it seems only fair to let you know that i want you it doesnt have anything to do with saving your face in front of the country club set or with making your idiot exhusband steam a little it has to do with you and me and its unlikely when its done that youll have to ask whether you should thank me i have children laughter he discovered could relieve even a great amount of tension christ almighty youve got great children laura but this is between you and me i let go of me and let me breathe will you she jerked away rubbing her hands through hair that the wind had tossed into curling confusion however shaken she was she felt the simplest way out was honesty i dont have any experience with affairs her voice was composed again but her hands continued to twist together i was married for ten years and i was faithful youve been divorced how long when she didnt respond he stared then he began to see what she was telling him thered only been one man which made her former husband even more of a fool in michaels opinion is that supposed to make me less attracted to you you know what it makes me laura it makes me want to toss you over my shoulder and find out if i still know how to pleasure a woman in a parked car he saw her glance toward his porsche and for a moment he was sure there was speculation in her eyes sugar id be willing to give it a shot when he stepped forward she risked a wrenched ankle and evaded him dont just dont she turned and stared out over the sea where waves slashed white against speared fingers of rocks it was a long fall she thought reckless jumps were always followed by long falls and she had never taken one i dont know how im going to react to this i dont know what im going to want to do about it think about it he suggested im going to be around for quite a while you want to neck in the car or do you want me to take you home now she smiled how could she help it another of those intriguing offers of yours ill take the ride home thanks your loss sugar chapter seven and then mrs hannah said that everyone whod finished all their assignments could have extra time on the computer i picked the art studio so i got to draw a picture and print it out and everything then she put it on the board because she said it was excellent while kayla chattered about her school day michael continued to water brush his mares mane kayla had fallen into the habit of visiting him and hed discovered that if a day passed without her poking her head into the stables he felt deprived her mother on the other hand was keeping her distance he hadnt seen her in three days since the night of the country club dance mamas going to get me drawing lessons and thatll be fun because i like to draw pictures i can draw you one if you want id like that he sent her a quick smile what would you draw for me a surprise she beamed at him big people didnt always really listen kayla knew mr fury always listened even when he was busy do you have time to teach bongo a trick i might michael tapped the dampened water brush in his palm as he studied the pup who was currently sprawled on the brick eyeing one of the cats ive got to put this lady through her paces first though got somebody coming by to look at her kaylas bottom lip poked out as she reached up to smooth the mares glossy flank to buy her maybe understanding he crouched down she needs a good home like bongo did youre a good home he didnt think this called for an explanation of business the profitandloss ledgers that often made him crosseyed so he kept it simple i cant keep them all honey what i do is take good care of them while theyre here and look for people wholl take care of them when theyre not and your moms the one who found these people you know mrs prentice shes nice kayla gnawed on her lip as she considered she did like mrs prentice she had a fun laugh her daughter rides horses mandys fourteen and has a boyfriend does she amused michael tousled kaylas hair if they like the lady here and she likes them shell be their horse do you think mandy would take good care of her i guess so lets take her out to the paddock you and me ill get her blanket ill get it while kayla raced off he made a final check of his lady she was a pretty chestnut hack her coat gleaming now from his meticulous work with brush and currycomb her eyes were clear intelligent her heart strong her hooves healthy and smartly presented with a coating of oil at fifteen hands she was a good size well lined a cooperative wellbehaved animal who would bring him a good profit on his investment he was he knew as he stroked her neck going to miss the hell out of her together he and kayla saddled the mare with kayla watching every move carefully she hoped that one day mr fury would let her hook the cinches but she didnt want to ask yet wheres ali today oh shes in her room she has to clean it and finish all her homework she cant come outside today because shes being punished what did she do she had another fight with mama with the dog at her heels kayla skipped along beside michael as he led the mare out shes mad because our dads marrying mrs litchfield and hes not going to go to the fatherdaughter supper at school she says its mamas fault how does she figure that i dont know kayla shrugged her shoulders shes silly uncle josh is going to the supper and hes more fun anyway our dad doesnt like us the careless tone caused michael to stop glance down doesnt he no but thats okay because she trailed off bit her lip its bad what is darling she looked behind her toward the house then back into michaels eyes i dont like him either im glad he went away and that hes not coming back but dont tell mama now there was alarm and beneath it a silvery rush of defense honey he crouched down taking her little shoulders carefully in his hands he didnt hurt you did he he didnt hit you or your sister even the thought of it churned in his gut like acid or your mom no she seemed so baffled by the idea michael relaxed again but he never listens and he never plays and he made mama cry so i dont like him but dont tell i wont michael made an x over his heart then touched the finger to her lips how anyone particularly a father could not adore this fascinating child was beyond him how about a ride her eyes went huge hopeful can i can i really well lets see he picked her up set her on the saddle we have to see if the lady likes girls right he said as he adjusted the stirrups this heres an english saddle because thats what mandy uses take a rein in each hand no like this sugar he said and adjusted her grip thats the way patiently he explained the proper way to guide the mare while kayla listened in solemneyed concentration now heels down good knees in back straight with a hand on the bridle he led the mare into a sedate walk hows it feel up there miss ridgeway she giggled bounced im riding the horse now draw back on the left rein easy now the way i showed you see how nice she turns shes a good girl he had work to do calls to make and he forgot all of it for the next twenty minutes he indulged himself teaching kayla the basics hopping up behind her once to take the mare into a quick circling canter that had the child shrieking with delight the day might have been overcast more rain threatening but here was sunshine when he plucked her off and her arms wound tight around his neck in a hug he felt for the first time in his life like a hero can i do it again sometime mr fury sure you can with easy affection and trust she wrapped her legs around his waist grinning at him when mama gets home shell be so surprised i rode the horse all by myself and steered her and everything you sure did and now we know she likes girls shell like mandy so shell be happy im going to tell annie right now how i rode the horse thanks mr fury she wiggled down and raced off the pup scrambling after michael watched her stroking the mares neck youve done it now fury he murmured gone and fallen in love with that pretty little blonde he looked into his mares eyes kissed her sighed not supposed to fall for what you cant keep two hours later he repeated the warning to himself the prentices had fallen for the mare at first sight had barely bothered to dicker over his asking price now he had a check in his pocket and the lady was no longer his with mixed feelings he approached templeton house hed made a sale and that was part of his business the mare he had no doubt was going to be pampered and adored for the rest of her life and it was a sure bet that the prentices would spread the word that michael fury had good stock for sale he had laura to thank for it and he intended to do so the duty call would give him the opportunity to see her again to gauge how she reacted to him out of habit and a little fear instilled by the thought of encountering ann sullivan he wiped his feet outside the kitchen door his knock was answered by a harried call to come in when he did fear turned to pleasure mrs williamson was exactly as he remembered broad back to the room big capable hands stirring something wonderful on the huge sixburner stove the bowl of black hair atop her head wouldnt have stirred in an earthquake the room smelled of spices and flowers and the mouthwatering aroma of whatever she had in the oven got any cookies around this place she turned wooden spoon in one hand her wide face creased into a huge welcoming smile shed always had a soft spot for lost boys and bad ones well if it isnt michael fury himself i wondered when youd come knocking on my door ready to marry me now i might just be she sent him a saucy wink youve grown up handsome enough because with her hed always felt at home he crossed the room took one of her big hands in his and brought it to his lips name the time and place oh youre a one from anyone else the sound that bubbled out would have been called a giggle sit down there boy and tell me all about your adventures as she always had always would when one of her children came to visit she took cookies out of the bin arranged them on a plate selling horses now are we yes maam just did he patted his pocket while she poured his coffee thats fine then and you havent found a woman to suit you in all your travels ive been holding out for you he bit into a cookie rolled his eyes dramatically nobody bakes like you mrs williamson why should i settle for less than the best she laughed again and gave him a vigorous slap on the back that nearly sent him headfirst into his coffee oh youre a bad one michael so they always said you still do those apple pies the ones that bring tears of joy to a mans eyes if you behave yourself i might just send you one over she went back to her stove and her stirring our little kaylas been spending a lot of time down at the stables lately im going to marry her if you keep turning me down shes an angel isnt she she let loose a windy sigh allison too darling girl sweet as you please and bright as buttons on a new suit miss lauras done a fine job there and by herself too he never paid any mind to them when you want information michael mused as he took another cookie go to the source mrs williamson was a fount of inside information he isnt very popular around here i take it she sniffed loudly and why should he be id like to know fussy stiffnecked too good to say how do you do never gave a minute of his valuable time to those beautiful girls either and fooling around with his secretary and god knows who else on the side she pressed a hand to her heart as it swelled with outrage i shouldnt speak of it not my place but he knew shed speak of it plenty with a little prompting so ridgeway wouldnt make father of the year hah he wouldnt make father of the minute and as for husband well he treated our miss laura more like an accessory than a wife prissy about the staff too with his highfalutin ideas michael ran his tongue around his teeth laura stayed married to him for a long time she takes her promises and her duties seriously that girl was raised right near to broke her heart when she filed for divorce not that it wasnt the proper thing to do or that any of us regretted it for a blink good riddance i say and i said so straight out to mrs sullivan now hes going to be marrying that redheaded cat well they deserve each other i say to emphasize her sentiments she rapped her spoon on the edge of the pan letting the sound ring i bet ridgeway never got any cookies in your kitchen hah as if hed have lowered himself to come inside the room master of the house my eye my hearing may not be what it was but i hear what i need to hear so dont think i didnt know he tried to make miss laura pension me off so he could hire himself some fancy frenchman to cook his meals but she wouldnt do it her face softened as she turned back our miss laura knows about loyalty and about whats right shes a templeton and so are her girls whatever their name might be legal she stopped narrowed her eyes there youve done it got me blabbing and havent told me a thing you havent changed there michael fury nothing much to tell she still brewed the best coffee in central california he thought as he sipped and the templeton kitchen despite its grandeur and shine was still one of the coziest spots on earth been there done that now im back she could just imagine where hed been and what hed done still she saw in him what shed always seen a dark broodyeyed boy brimming with potential back where you belong you ask me been out gallivanting long enough seems like he agreed and took another cookie going to make your mark this time around are you thats the plan you come on down to the stables while im here mrs williamson he grinned wickedly ill give you a ride she threw back her head exploding with laughter just as the door swung open ann sullivan stepped inside the instant she spotted michael lounging at the table with cookies and coffee her mouth tightened i see youre entertaining mrs williamson the boy just dropped in to visit theyd worked together too long for mrs williamson to miss the icy disapproval or to pay any heed to it coffee mrs sullivan no thank you miss laura is in the solarium and would like some the door burst open behind her and kayla rushed in mama said to hi instantly distracted she ran toward michael jumped in his lap did you come to see us i came to talk mrs williamson out of some cookies and i needed to see your mom for a minute shes in the solarium you can go see her i drew your picture do you want to see you bet i do he kissed the tip of her nose grinned what is it a surprise eager she scrambled down im going to go get it im going to tell ali you came dont go away ann stood where she was as kayla bolted out if shed been blind she would have been able to recognize the easy affection between man and girl a considering look came into her eye she was far from ready to soften but she would consider you can go on to the solarium if you remember the way she said stiffly ill bring the coffee fine thanks he rose equally stiff until he turned to mrs williamson thanks for the cookies and that offer still holds get on with you he got on he remembered the way to the solarium the fact was he realized he remembered everything about templeton house walking down the polished hallway glancing into elegant rooms was like stepping back in time his time his youth this was a constant he thought the soaring ceilings and ornate moldings the carefully selected and lovingly tended furnishings the sweep of the stairway in the main hall the bowl of flowers set just so on a credenza candlesticks with their tapers burned down to varying heights in the parlor he noticed the quiet fire sizzling the hearth was lapis he remembered josh had told him that had explained to him about the deep blue stone there was a large crystal compote on the piano a floorspanning faded rug over the waxed wood flowers everywhere he observed fresh and dewy from garden or greenhouse not just hothouse roses but simple daisies sunny tulips their scents were subtle an elemental part of the air he knew the templetons had entertained with lavish parties in this house he had even been permitted to attend a few people as glamorous as gods had wandered through the rooms under the arching doorways spilled out onto flowerdecked terraces the house he had grown up in could fit into a single wing of this one with room to spare but it hadnt been the space that awed him or not as much not nearly as much as the beauty of it the way it stood looking out over cliffs and hills and banks of flowers the way the tower speared up into the sky and the windows gleamed with light day or night and the rooms inside streaming into other rooms with an openness a welcoming that hed never been able to analyze of permanence a statement that hed always understood said family mattered at least to the templetons despite its grandeur templeton house was a home and that he had never had shaking himself he moved through the short breezeway that led to the solarium there would be lush greenery there flowers in profusion padded chairs and lounges glass tables colorful mats the rain that had just started to mist would patter on the glass walls and you would see the fog rise over the cliffs it was exactly as he remembered the glass walls swirled with fog and rain lending the room a magical kind of intimacy a single lamp was lit casting a soft gold light music something with weeping violins that he didnt recognize spilled like tears from hidden speakers and there was laura curled on the pastel cushions of a highbacked wicker lounge sleeping perhaps it was the atmosphere the light the fog the music the flowers that made him feel as though he were stepping into a spellbound bower he was rarely a fanciful man but the sight of her sleeping there made him think of enchanted princesses castles and the magic of a kiss he bent over her brushed the hair from her cheek and laid his lips on hers she woke slowly as an enchanted princess should her lashes fluttered a faint flush rose to her cheeks the sound that sighed through her lips to his was soft lovely doesnt seem like a hundred years he murmured her eyes stayed on his heavy clouded unfocused michael now either we live happily ever after or i turn into a frog i can never keep the stories straight she lifted a hand to his face real she thought she wasnt dreaming as reality began to seep in her color deepened and she hastened to sit up i fell asleep i figured that one out and there were shadows under her eyes he hated knowing that worry over her daughter gave her restless nights long day yes concern for allison had given her some bad moments at three am but so had the man who was studying her now then there had been her convention duties at the hotel a glitch in a shipment at the shop and a headachy session of sentence diagramming in the homework division im sorry the words slid down her throat as his mouth cruised over hers again you made me think of fairy tales when i walked in here beauty sleeping thats sleeping beauty i know his lips curved i didnt have a close acquaintance with fairy tales but i think i caught the disney version somewhere lets see if ive got it right when he would have kissed her again she sprang to her feet im awake too awake she thought as her heart hummed in her throat too alive too needy i guess thats the best we can do for the moment i was in the kitchen charming mrs williamson out of her cookies i actually came by to see you but im weak no one can hold fast against her cookies well aware that she must look rumpled she tried to smooth her hair dont i like it mussed you never seem to be mussed you ought to catch me after convincing the girls it really is bedtime now but she made herself stop fussing kayla said that judy prentice was coming by this evening she did with her husband and her daughter who by the way is quite a horsewoman they bought a good mare i think theyll work out well together pleased for him she said oh thats wonderful michael congratulations he plucked a creamy white hibiscus from the bush beside the lounge and handed it to her i came by to thank you absurdly touched violently nervous she stared at the blossom i didnt do anything but mention your name but youre welcome judy knows a lot of the horse set im sure shell pass your name along im counting on it id like to take you to dinner she shifted away a full inch what im flush he said patting his pocket and i owe you no you dont it was just id like to take you to dinner laura id like to take you period but i think well have to do this along more conventional lines youve been avoiding me no i havent really or hardly at all ive been busy he imagined her social calendar was full enough committees ladies luncheons the jobs shed taken to fill her time i wouldnt imagine a templeton would scare off so easy it was exactly the right switch to pull it isnt a matter of scaring off i have a great deal to do then take another rain check you let me know when you can squeeze me in when he started to rise she touched his hand i dont mean to sound ungracious you he smiled thinly never i wasnt expecting you to move on you he suggested last time i checked i still had blood in my veins if youre not interested just say so i can probably take a no i dont know what i am but its not disinterested she resisted barely tracing the hibiscus along her cheek and i dont think im prepared to deal with that gleam you just got in your eye in fact i know im not im going to change the subject she drew a deep breath willing to accept the embarrassment of having him grin at her kayla told me youve been teaching her to ride is there a problem with that i guess i should have asked you no she dragged her hand through her hair again no theres no problem im very grateful that youd take the time and trouble i dont want her pestering you michael she doesnt pester me in fact im thinking about giving it ten or fifteen years and asking her to marry me her smile came fast and warm shes so easy to fall for shes so open and loving shes full of you mr fury this and mr fury that shes certain youre going to turn bongo into some sort of dog genius ill have to work on that thats what i wanted to discuss with you id like to compensate you for your time with kayla i stop he said it quietly the steel of temper a sharp edge beneath im not a servant i didnt mean that horrified that shed insulted him she rose again i only meant that if youre going to be taking so much of your time to its my time and ill use it as i please i dont want your damn money im not for hire as a friend for your kids or as a temporary father substitute or whatever the hell you have in mind now she went pale very pale of course not im sorry christ dont give me that wounded look you make me feel as though i kicked a puppy frustrated he jammed his hands in his pockets compensate him for christs sake the way you compensate a waiter for good service he should have expected it just leave it alone he spun away to stare out at the swirling fog keeping her face blank ann stepped inside with the coffee tray not by a flicker of the eye did she reveal shed heard a great deal of that last exchange your coffee miss laura the girls are on their way down if they hadnt been ann might have smothered conscience and eavesdropped a bit longer oh thank you annie she put a smile on her face kept it there as her children came in i believe kayla has something for you michael kayla held the picture behind her back as she approached if you like it you can hang it on your wall well lets see he took the heavy drawing paper from her stared damn kaylas face dropped comically automatically laura put a hand on her shoulder to comfort you dont like it kaylas head drooped i shouldnt have drawn it so fast but i wanted to do it while i remembered everything no its great when he looked up from the drawing his smile was huge i was surprised just like you said id be it looks just like the lady kayla just exactly like her really with her tongue caught between her teeth kayla peeked over to critique her own work usually i draw things i see in books or that are right there but i thought if you had to sell her you could have a picture so youd always remember her its beautiful and nothing like the childish drawing hed expected shed captured the mares springy gait in the movement the proud head he supposed a trained eye could find room for improvement things like perspective and range that he knew nothing of all he knew was that he was impressed and touched its my first original templeton if anyone noticed he hadnt used her legal name there was no comment kayla merely preened and slipped a hand into his ill draw you more if you want id like that a lot he scooted her onto his knee and looked at allison the older girl stared down at her feet obviously miserable you finish cleaning your room blondie her head came up and so did her color she eyed her sister and her sisters big mouth with disdain yes sir good i figured once you were off the breadandwater routine you might want to catch up with kayla here on the riding lessons her mouth fell open before she remembered her manners id like to learn to ride though it cost her she turned to her mother may i i think that would be a wonderful idea i may have to brush up myself before the two of you get ahead of me she laid a hand on alis shoulder the stiffness faded reluctantly but it faded thank you michael well see what we can do to meld our schedules mines flexible after a quick bounce he set kayla on her feet and rose but right now ive got to get back your coffee laura began ill take a rain check his smile spread slowly you know about redeeming rain checks dont you laura yes how did a mother handle sexual flutters with her two daughters looking on laura didnt have a clue thank you for coming by my pleasure ill see you out ali said with great dignity to his credit michael nodded gravely thank you ill go too mr fury do you think you can teach bongo to shake uncle byrons dogs can shake alone laura sat again as her daughters bright voice echoed away experimentally she pressed a hand to her stomach yes it was churning and to her heart yes it was pounding how did a woman with absolutely no point of reference go about redeeming a rain check for an affair she had absolutely no clue about that either chapter eight the sun tore away the clouds and fog and the chill of coastal winter while reports of a midwest ice storm hit the news monterey enjoyed soft blue skies and a breeze that held teasing hints of spring on the cliffs the wind was rougher whipped in from the sea and tasting as laura always thought of adventure and romance the winter grass rustled and the waves roared fuming water like froth from a bottle of champagne once a young girl had died there through her own will an old man had grieved there through his own memories and somewhere gold hidden for more than a century waited to be found laura enjoyed the company and the leisure as much as the search nearly every sunday she and her friends and her daughters came here with the shadow of templeton house behind them to look for seraphinas dowry we could buy a horse when we find it couldnt we kayla looked up from her enthusiastic scraping with a garden spade from mr fury i know how to take care of a horse now he showed us you have to feed them and water them and brush them and clean out their feet hooves ali put in feeling superior you pick out their hooves and you have to exercise them too and muck out their stalls have you been mucking out ali ali shrugged her shoulders hoping the new earrings in her pierced ears showed off to their best advantage mr fury says its part of the job you dont just get on and ride you have to take care of them yes you do the fatherdaughter supper was behind them and ali had survived it laura touched alis hair when i was a girl and we had horses i mucked out my share of stalls i never minded couldnt we have some shed tried not to ask ali wasnt quite willing to forgive her mother for letting her father go away and marry some other woman mr furys going to build his own stables and house when he goes away hell take the horses well talk about it you say that when you mean no ali rose from her crouch i say that laura returned praying for patience when i mean well talk about it right now mr furys renting the stables and there isnt really time for another horse hed sell us one of his if you wanted if you really wanted ali turned her back and went over to where margo and kate ran the metal detector shes still mad because hes getting married soon kayla said hmm you know mama hes marrying mrs litchfield ill talk to her again though she could think of nothing left to say on the matter are you mad baby no i dont care if he marries her i dont know why he wants to when she has that mean smile and when she laughs it hurts my ears with an effort laura muffled a laugh of her own leave it to kayla she thought to sum up candy in such accurate terms people get married because they love each other or so shed once believed laura mused as she looked out to sea so shed once dreamed are you going to be in love with someone and get married i dont know dreams change laura reminded herself you cant plan these things i heard mrs williamson tell annie that mrs litchfield planned to catch dad in her trap and how he deserved it ah she cleared her throat she just meant that they were going to be happy together i guess kayla thought no such thing but was wise enough to let it pass im going to get some lemonade from the thermos do you want some that would be nice laura rose as well and wandered over to her friends im not skimming damn it blowing hair out of her face margo continued to run the detector im doing it the way i always do halfassed kate rolled her eyes as ali giggled sorry shes been hanging around the gym too much margo told ali picking up bad language along with locker room sweat youve got too much jewelry on kate complained youre going to send the thing into convulsions bitch and moan margo winced herself sorry ali here why dont you wear my bracelet a while can i thrilled ali watched her glamorous aunt transfer the heavy gold links then held up her arm watching the sun bounce off them its so beautiful it glitters whats the point in wearing it if it doesnt glitter she winked and flicked a finger at alis earlobe those are pretty mama got them for me i got an a on my science report she glanced toward her mother and her smile bloomed hesitantly she said i worked hard and deserved a reward you did and you did laura confirmed would you mind helping kayla get lemonade i think were all dry all right she took a step stopped would you like a sandwich it was an apology laura realized and though she wasnt hungry she smiled that would be terrific why dont you and kayla spread out the blanket and well take a break for lunch laura murmured as her daughter picked her way around rocks shes trying its hard for her to accept if i had the prospect of candy cane as my stepmother id find it more than hard kate muttered margo merely lifted one elegant shoulder candys too much in love with candy to give them the time of day and the girls are smart enough not to give her any more than that back i suppose it would be easier if they liked her a little then laura sighed and gave in and its probably selfish of me to be glad they dont but im glad they dont anyone want to take bets on how long the peter and candy show runs my take is a little dizzy kate sat down abruptly on a rock there it goes again are you all right kate had a history of ulcers and now laura leapt to her side is it a flareup no kate took easy breaths waiting for the world to settle yes there was the sky nicely blue and back in its proper place you know what i think im pregnant pregnant with a thud margo set the detector aside and crouched in front of kate how late are you have you taken a test late enough kate closed her eyes tried to analyze what she was feeling i bought one of those instant things at the drugstore i havent used it because im afraid itll say im not youre using it first thing tomorrow margo ordered and she cupped kates face in her hand to take a long look morning sickness not really a little queasy when i first get up but it passes she shifted her eyes the two of you stop looking at me with those smug knowing grins not a chance laura sat beside her what does byron say i havent mentioned it in case im wrong i dont want to be wrong she said shakily i know weve only been married a few months and we have all the time in the world but i dont want to be wrong another sure sign laura declared unstable and heightened emotions then she heard a voice slow deep and male and admitted that pregnancy wasnt the only cause of unstable and heightened emotions lust was definitely right up there in the running with her hand still on kates shoulder she got to her feet is this club for women only depends margo went to automatic purr on the man want to help us look for treasure michael you all would be pretty ticked if i got lucky and found it first shot after all the time youve put in he has a point kate reached up to pat lauras hand signaling that she was fine now anyway men just dont get seraphinas dowry do they mick seems to me if shed had one shed have been better off doing something with it instead of burying it somewhere and taking a header off a cliff see her point made kate rose im going to check out lunch rumor is mrs williamson made potato salad ill give you a hand enjoying the tension that had leapt into the air margo decided to let it hum she sent michael a quick wink before following kate id gone upstairs to make some calls michael began before laura could retreat looked out the window and saw five pretty girls scattered over the cliffs it was hard to think about going back to work without getting a closer look we try to spend a few hours out here every sunday so far weve found two coins or rather margo found one and kate found one the girls and i are batting zero is it important to you finding gold the hunts important and the mood she shifted her gaze to the sea the possibilities i imagine her there that young girl standing on the edge of the cliff thinking she had nothing left to live for theres always something to live for yes there is she did retreat the few bare steps the rocks allowed when he lifted a hand to her face i should help with lunch youre welcome to have some if you like i wanted to talk to you about the girls if you have a minute oh the wariness in her eyes became concern if theyre getting in your way laura he said patiently do you really think youre the only one who can appreciate their company no of course not annoyed with herself logic hampered by rampaging emotions she dropped her hands to her sides what is it ive been giving them a few pointers in the saddle kayla he glanced back grinning as he watched the little blond head bob shes a pistol shed be doing bareback jumps if i let her please laura shuddered my heart kid wants to gallop full out in the worst way wants everything full out you gotta admire that but she listens she learns im crazy about her laura blinked against surprise and sunlight she shes full of mr fury and his horses every time she comes back from the stables determined to relax she sat on the rock and barely jolted when he joined her shes starting to lose interest in her dance lessons i dont want to mess with your plans no smiling now laura shook her head she only wanted them because ali had them thats kayla always determined to keep up there were tiny blue flowers fighting out of a crack in the rock toward the sun in an absentminded move michael plucked one and offered it did you get her that drawing instructor surprise again flitted into her eyes how odd that he should remember those little family details as a matter of fact i did find someone she glanced down at the bloom in her hand wishing she could take those habitual offer of flowers as casually as he did shell start next week kids got real talent me the only way i can draw is with a ruler about ali shes going through a difficult time shes not as flexible as kayla or as resilient shes so easily bruised shell come around he took her hand playing with her fingers the riding lessons i dont know how far you want me to push it with a sigh laura studied her older girl sitting so ladylike on the ground beside margo if she isnt cooperating theres no reason for you to push anything laura shes a natural excuse me the kid sits a horse like shes been doing it all her life shes got this kind of baffling grace and she listens to me as if what im saying is etched in stone its scary if you want to pursue this for her you might want to look for someone with more experience in teaching than i have staggered laura stared at him she never says anything kayla comes back talking a mile a minute and ali just shrugs and says it was fine kaylas a bullet alis a song shell sing when shes ready how could he know her children so well she wondered how could he see inside and understand their hearts so well so quickly she trusts you laura said slowly trust isnt easy for ali these days if you dont mind id like you to stick with it she needs something so badly right now and i dont seem to have whatever it is annoyed he cupped a hand under her chin and turned her face to his youre wrong you have exactly what it is shes only blaming you because she knows youll take it youll be there he dropped his hand resisted getting up to pace he wasnt a damn shrink but anyone with eyes could see the woman needed something i went through a period when i blamed my mother for a lot of things but i never said it to her because i didnt know if shed take it i didnt know if shed be there perhaps that was how he saw she mused how he understood maybe its easier for you to understand her i never had anyone let me down my mother and father were are as steady as this rock never faltered never wavered never failed and she had done all of those laura thought faltered wavered failed it wasnt a simple matter to regain balance after youd been rocked then again he said watching her face maybe she blames you because you blame you get a grip laura youve never been married she shot back yeah i was six months he lifted a brow as he rose and i didnt fuck it up alone ill keep working with the kids he continued when she said nothing but ive got a condition hed been married her mind swung there back tried to keep up all right what is it stop hiding in the house come down and see what theyre doing amused at both of them he took the flower from her tucked it in her hair im not going to jump you in front of your children i havent been hiding and i never assumed your behavior in front of them would be inappropriate christ its fascinating to watch you click into that ladyofthemanor mode i dont know whether to pull my forelock or jump you after all cool as snowmelt she inclined her head id prefer you do neither now that weve spoken i certainly will come down and check on the girls progress i appreciate your bringing me up to date yes maam ms templeton sarcasm suits you michael he grabbed her arm before she could stride past him so do you he said it softly his face close to hers by christ so do you you want to be careful playing princess to peasant with me laura puts my back up makes me want to prove something you dont have anything to prove to me now let go of my arm when im finished he preferred her like this the challenge of her encased in ice the wounded woman made him feel weak and clumsy and eager to soothe let me remind you who youre dealing with in case youve forgotten he continued i like to break rules and if someone puts up a barrier i like to step over it just for the hell of it when im pushed i push back harder and meaner she didnt doubt it any of it the man who faced her now looked capable of anything sins crimes atrocities when she had time to think she would analyze what warped part of her was attracted to just that facet of him for now escape would have to substitute for valor i appreciate the reminder dont let me keep you from your work you wont in a rapid shift of mood that left her baffled he brought her clenched fist to his lips watching her he pried it open pressed his mouth to the palm dont forget sugar youre still holding that rain check he strolled off pausing long enough at the picnic blanket to steal a sandwich and make the girls giggle when there was enough distance and she was sure the heat had died from her cheeks she went over to join her family mr fury kissed your hand mama kayla announced just like in the movies he was just being funny laura took a glass of lemonade to ease her dry throat he was telling me how well both of you are doing with the riding lessons though her stomach was still jumping she casually chose a slice of apple i think hes enjoying them as much as you are theyre all right though she pretended disinterest ali studied her mother from under her lashes the hand kiss hadnt looked at all funny to her and her mother had a flower in her hair michael seems to think both of you are doing more than just all right you ought to get back into riding yourself laura delighted with the progress margo nibbled on a cube of cheese no that palm buss hadnt looked funny it had looked perfect ill think about it because she wanted to watch michael climb the hill back to templeton house she looked deliberately west out to sea she couldnt sleep being bonetired didnt seem to make any difference laura wanted to believe that it was because the night was so clear so full of stars that it would be a shame to waste it but she knew it was the dreams that kept her from bed she had begun to dream of him and the content the detail of the content both shocked and amazed her she could with concentration control her thoughts during the day but how could she control what snuck into her dreams they were so sexual erotic was too tame too formal a word for what went on in her head during sleep she should have been able to accept them laugh at them even share them with her friends but she could do none of those things quite simply she mused as she wandered the silent garden because she had done none of those things that her subconscious created that rough sweaty elemental sex was a far cry from the dreams of her girlhood except for those few scattered and shocking dreams shed had about michael as a girl those had been hormonal aberrations laura assured herself not wishes and they were best forgotten in any case most of her dreams had been soft lovely when shed imagined love in all its forms to be tender and sweet thered been no ripping of fabric no bruising hands or frantic cries of release in her innocent fantasies and none she thought with a grimace in the reality of her marriage peter had never torn her clothes dragged her to the ground driven her to screams he had long ago been tender almost sweet then he had been disinterested she would take the blame for that for being too inhibited too naive too rigid perhaps to inspire in him unthinking lust it was easier to accept and perhaps to start to forgive his faithlessness now that she understood those darker needs now that those darker needs had been awakened in her but dreaming of wild sex and acting on such dreams were still two different matters she slipped her hands into the pockets of her jacket breathed in the night and hoped to cool her thoughts before bed she would not go to michael whether it was cowardice or wisdom she would not go to him he was beyond her scope she decided as she walked through the arbor and studied the dark stables with the swirl of fog at their base he was both too dangerous and too unpredictable for a woman with her responsibilities and despite the years he had been joshs friend she didnt know him certainly didnt understand him couldnt risk him so she would be what she had been raised to be a strong woman who understood and met her obligations she would fill her life with what she had been so fortunate to be given children home family friends work she needed nothing else not even in dreams she saw the lights flash on in the apartment above the stables like a voyeur caught spying she slipped back into the shadows did he dream too she wondered of her did those dreams make him restless and achy and confused even as she wondered she saw him come bursting out of the door hair flying his boots echoed hard on the steps as he raced down them and into the stables she stood where she was a moment longer unsure but something was wrong a man like michael fury didnt run in a panic for nothing he was a tenant of templeton house she reminded herself and she was a templeton selfpreservation could never hold out against duty laura ran across the lawn with the moonlight chasing her there were lights on inside the stable now laura shielded her eyes against the glare but she didnt see him she hesitated again wondering if she should leave then she heard his voice the words low and unintelligible but the concern in them was clear she walked down the wide brick aisle and looked into the open foaling stall he was kneeling beside a horse his hair falling forward like a black wing to curtain his face his dark tshirt was rumpled and revealed arms toughly muscled and the faint shine of a thin scar above his left elbow she saw his hands wide tanned gently stroking the bulge of the mares heaving sides she had a moment to think that no woman on the brink of childbirth could ever want for more loving comfort then she was inside kneeling with him shes going to foal there sweetheart instinctively she went to the mares head its all right always in the middle of the night michael blew his hair out of his eyes i heard her upstairs guess ive been listening for her have you called the vet shouldnt need him last time he checked her out he said it should go smooth in an impatient move he tugged a bandanna out of his back pocket what are you doing here i was in the garden its all right baby she murmured shifting the mares head onto her lap i saw your lights go on and then you ran down here i was afraid something was wrong shell be fine but it was darlings first and he was as nervous as an expectant daddy pacing a waiting room go on to bed this sort of thing isnt usually complicated but its plenty messy she lifted both brows and the amusement in the eyes under them was clear and bright really i wouldnt know anything about that as ive only been through childbirth twice myself and when the stork arrived he was very neat and polite her attention shot back to the mare as a new contraction began all right now all right well get through this honey he doesnt know anything does he she murmured as the mare rolled painfilled eyes toward lauras hes just a man let him try it yeah let him try it once then well see what he has to say guess ive been told torn between worry and laughter michael rubbed his chin should i go outside and pace boil water buy cigars you could go make some coffee this could take a while i can handle this laura ive done it before you dont have to stay im staying she said simply and id like some coffee okay when he rose she noted that hed taken the time to zip his jeans but not to button them with twelve hundred pounds of horse in labor between them it was no time to have her mouth watering she looked back a little blindly at the mare i take mine black please ill be right back he paused at the stall door thanks i can use the help and the company shes special i know her lips softened into a smile as she looked up at him i can see that dont worry papa youll be handing out cigars by morning oh michael whats her name darling embarrassment didnt suit him but he shrugged shes darling yes she is laura continued to smile as his boot heels clicked on the bricks and so she murmured much to my surprise are you chapter nine it wasnt precisely the way hed imagined spending the night with her when he allowed himself to think of it and he allowed himself often the circumstances were quite different yet here they were sweaty exhausted and united she had more stamina than hed given her credit for theyd been at it nearly four hours the mare rising to pace lying down again sweating as she moved from the first to the second stage of her labor laura hadnt wilted and while the coffee was beginning to jangle his nerves laura was calm as a lake why dont you take a walk she suggested she sat comfortably on the hay her arms circling her knees her gaze on the mothertobe im fine his brow creased as he wiped down the mare since hed tied his hair back laura could see his eyes perfectly youre a wreck fury okay okay he knew it he didnt care to have it pointed out to him though his eyes darkened moodily when they shifted to laura ive done this dozens of times not with her you havent shes holding up better than you are hell with it he decided and eased back a moment to stretch his back ill never understand why something this basic takes so damn long how do you stand it a woman in this position doesnt have much choice laura said dryly and you just focus everything on whats happening to your body inside your body nothing else exists wars famines earthquakes hell theyre nothing compared to this guess not he struggled to relax to remind himself that nature generally knew what she was doing first time i went through a foaling i thought of my mother figured i should have cut her more slack id rather have my tongue pulled out than go through this actually its more like having your bottom lip pulled out and over your head until it reaches the nape of your neck she laughed as he went white thanks for the visual it would do him good to talk she decided and until the mares water broke they had time your mother moved to florida didnt she yeah her and frank thats the guy she married about ten years ago you like him its hard not to like frank he just goes with the flow and manages to turn the current in his direction without making waves theyre good for each other up to him her taste in men sucked the divorce was hard on you no it was hard on her idly he picked up a shaft of hay spun it through his fingers then to lauras amusement he handed it to her as he had the flowers i dont suppose its ever easy divorce i dont see why something doesnt work it doesnt work my father cheated on her from the getgo never troubled to hide it she just wouldnt let go never could figure that either theres nothing mysterious about wanting to hold a marriage together there is when its a sham he wouldnt come home a couple nights running then hed show up shed rant and throw things and hed just shrug and plop down in front of the tv then one day he didnt come back at all ever we never saw him again michael im sorry i didnt realize though her hands continued to soothe the mare her attention was on him didnt matter to me or not much he shrugged but she was miserable and pissed and that made it hard to be around her i didnt spend much time at home for a couple of years hung out with josh drove mrs sullivan crazy thinking i was going to corrupt him she remembered him remembered well now that she allowed herself to those brooding dangerous eyes and her reaction to them my parents always liked you they were cool it was an eyeopener watching them you what went on in templeton house whole different world for a cliff rat like me and the world he was describing was different for her your mother married again she hooked up with lado when i was about sixteen i hated the son of a bitch i always figured she picked him because he was the opposite of the old man he was sloppy and mean and jealous gave her lots of attention michael muttered and his eyes were dark with memory lots of it he used to knock her around god he hit her she always denied it id come home and shed have a black eye or a split lip and make up some lame excuse about tripping or walking into a door i let it go you were just a child no i wasnt his eyes stormy now latched onto hers i was never a child by the time i was sixteen id already seen and done more than you will in your lifetime sugar it suited me fine did it she kept her eyes level or did it keep you from feeling helpless he nodded maybe both but the fact is mrs sullivan always had the right idea i was a bad companion and if josh hadnt been who and what he was we both would have ended up in juvie or worse fact is hes the reason i didnt im sure hed appreciate the testimony but id think you had something to do with that yourself for the first time in months he had a strong nagging urge for tobacco even patted his pocket before remembering that that part of his life was over you know why i took the hitch with the merchant marine no well ill tell you one night i came home been drinking a little me and josh and a couple of others down at the cliffs we were eighteen and stupid and id copped a sixpack from lado so i walked into the house feeling a nice comfy buzz and there he was that big fat bastard using his fists on my mother because she hadnt kept his supper warm or some such shit i wasnt going to let him get away with it figured it was my job to look out for her so i took him on absently he brushed a finger over the scar above his eye lauras glance flickered at the movement then held steady he outweighed me but i was young and fast and id already had my share of dirty fights i beat the hell out of him and i kept beating the hell out of him even when he was down and bleeding and unconscious and i couldnt feel my own hands pounding into his face id have killed him laura thats a fact id have beat him until he was dead and i wouldnt have looked back she couldnt envision it wasnt equipped to but she thought she could understand it you were protecting your mother started out that way but then i just wanted him dead i wanted to make him dead that was inside me i would have finished him if she hadnt stopped me and while i was kneeling over him while she was holding a hand to her face where it was bleeding and bruised she told me to get out michael she told me i had no right to interfere she said a lot of things along those lines so i got out and left her with him she didnt mean it how could a mother any mother turn on her own child it was impossible to absorb she was upset and afraid and hurt she did mean it laura at that moment she meant every word later she changed her mind she got rid of him and pulled herself together she got together with frank but by then i was gone and ive never really been back do you know where i went that night i left home no i went to templeton house i dont know why it was just there mrs williamson was in the kitchen she fussed over me cleaned me up she talked to me and she listened to me she fed me cookies on a long breath he rubbed his hands over his face he hadnt realized so much of that night was still inside him she probably saved my life i dont know what i would have done if she hadnt been there she told me i had to make something out of myself not that i had a choice or that here were my options just boy youve got to make something out of yourself shes always had a soft spot for you michael and he deserved one she thought now he deserved comfort and care and understanding poor lost boy she was the first woman i ever loved he plucked up another shaft of hay and to kill the urge for a cigarette chewed the tip if hed had a glimmer of lauras description of him he wouldnt have been amused hed have been appalled maybe the last woman he added she told me to go over to the stables and she went up and got josh he and i sat in this place and talked all night all fucking night every time i talked about doing something crazy hed steer me back with that cool lawyer logic of his the next day i signed up i stayed here in the stables until i shipped out here you stayed here josh never said anything about it maybe he understood client confidentiality even then he always understood friendship mrs williamson brought me food she and josh were the only ones i ever wrote to while i was gone she was the one who sent me word that my mother had kicked lado out i guess mrs williamson went to see her i never asked he shook it off grinned you know her cookies were my claim to fame on ship once a month this box would come full of them once i was losing my shirt in a poker game and anted up her what do you call them snickerdoodles walked away flush shed like hearing that taking the chance she reached over the mares neck and touched his hand anyone mrs williamson takes under her wing deserves it she recognizes fools and she doesnt suffer them youre a good man michael he studied her saw his advantage in her eyes i could let you think that and get you into bed quicker then he smiled im not a good man laura but im an honest one i told you what ive only told two other people in my life because i figure you ought to know what youre getting into ive already decided for a variety of reasons that im not getting into anything youll change your mind he shifted winked cockily they all do and the horses water broke in a gush that soaked the bedding zero hour he snapped nerves jangled keep to her head laura jolted back the fatigue the almost dreamlike state shed drifted into while he was talking now burst into an adrenaline rush the first flood of fluid didnt alarm her it was a natural process just as the mares plaintive whinnies were part of the whole a process she had shared in and one though the mares eyes rolled in fear and pain that laura knew she longed to experience again laura buckled down to the task at hand following michaels terse orders without question and issuing some of her own here it comes hold steady darling almost over he knelt in blood and birth fluid laboring as hard as his mare and those long thin forelegs appeared ive got to give her a hand here turn it some where was the damn head you got her yes ive got her sweat dripped into her eyes do it shes exhausted its coming he got a grip on the slippery gleaming limbs and reached inside the birth canal to rotate and ease there lying along the forelegs was the head come on darling just a little more just a little more oh god now there were tears mixed with the sweat on lauras face as the foal slid out there he is once the foals shoulders were clear michael cleaned the membrane away from the nose the foal was wet still attached by the umbilical cord though michael wanted to pull it clear see for himself he waited with laura as the foal struggled free of the birth sac and the cord broke as nature intended for a while there was no sound in the stall but the mares steadying breathing and her first soft delighted whinny as she understood she had a child hes beautiful laura murmured just beautiful she grinning michael swiped at the sweat on his face we got ourselves a girl here laura a beautiful girl god bless you darling look what you did she looked and with a mothers instinct climbed to her feet and began to clean her baby its lovely every time laura murmured easing back so as not to interfere with the bonding youre not disappointed she asked michael no stud shes got four legs and a tail doesnt she and her mothers coloring apparently youre not she laughed delighted with the look of stunned joy on his face and held out a formal hand congratulations papa the hell with that riding high he yanked her into his lap and crushed his mouth to hers instantly breathless and dizzy and weak they were covered with sweat and blood punchy from a night without sleep the hay beneath them was filthy the air thick and ripe and they were locked together like hope and glory hed meant it only to share with her that heady exuberance to thank her in his way for being a part of the moment but he sank into her into the need into the heat into those silky limbs that clung as though she were suspended over a cliff and he was her only salvation he was murmuring something a jumble of the wild and reckless thoughts that jammed into his head his hand streaked up her hip closed possessively over her breast she bucked arched moaned steady he used the same patient soothing tone he had with the laboring mare but his teeth nipped at her jaw scraped over the rampaging pulse in her throat and made the quiet order impossible i cant cant breathe cant think cant let go michael dazed she pressed her face against his throat i cant he could he thought as the ache spread viciously he could and more but hed chosen his time and place poorly shed stood by him through the night he reminded himself taking advantage of her now as he was only proved that even an honest man could lack integrity i wasnt angling for a roll in the hay he kept it light whatever it cost him relax careful to keep his hands gentle he shifted her look our little girls growing up already the hands laura clenched in her lap slowly loosened as she watched the foal struggle to her feet after a few comical spills she gained them have you laura wiped her palms hard on the knees of her slacks to ease the tingling have you chosen a name for her no he tortured himself a little by sniffing her hair why dont you shes yours michael the three of us brought her into the world together what do you want to call her she leaned back against him and smiled the foal had already learned how to suckle i had a mare when i was a girl her name was lulu lulu he chuckled and buried his face in her hair her eyes closed as he nuzzled and her heart tilted i rode her over the hills and into dreams lulu it is he got to his feet pulled laura to hers youre pale he brushed a thumb over her cheek almost expecting it to pass through like a mist the closer it got toward morning the more fragile you looked and the more i wanted to touch you im not going to be able to give you what you want you havent got a clue what i want if you did you wouldnt have let me within a mile of templeton house but since both of us are too tired for me to explain it now youd better go get some sleep ill help you clean up no i can handle it im not that tired laura and youre too damn tempting go away all right then she stepped out of the stall and looked back he stretched a long lean male wearing black with snug jeans unbuttoned at the waist everything that was female in her stirred and yearned michael yeah his eyes were heavy she noted exhausted but they still focused on her in a way that made her blood tingle no ones ever wanted me the way you seem to i dont know how i feel or what to do about that those exhausted eyes went hot thats not the kind of statement designed to make me want you less quick as a snake and deadly he reached out and snagged her by the shirt front his free hand circled her throat squeezed lightly as his mouth came down hard on hers when he let her go she stumbled back her eyes clouded with arousal and panic go away laura he repeated youre not safe here she walked blindly out of the stables into the white flash of morning her bones felt bruised her mind battered lifting an unsteady hand she brushed her fingertips over her swollen mouth felt him there tasted him there even as she walked toward templeton house she looked back over her shoulder and wondered if she wanted to be safe after all she always had been hadnt she and her life hadnt been a rousing success so far then again she had the unsettling feeling that she was thinking with her glands not with her head god knew thats what she felt like now one enormous pulsating gland that was a new experience and she wasnt sure if she wanted to explore it further before she could decide she stepped into the kitchen and all hell broke loose miss laura my god ann leapt at her while laura goggled in shock she was embraced fiercely yanked back patted down and shoved into a chair at the kitchen table what did he do to you that monster that spawn of the devil where are you hurt my baby eyes wild ann smoothed lauras tousled hair patted her pale cheeks i knew thered be trouble with the likes of him around but never did i imagine ill kill him kill him with my bare hands see if i dont what who shes in shock mrs williamson the poor lamb fetch the brandy now mrs sullivan calm yourself calm myself calm myself would you look at what hes done to our miss laura after wiping her hands on her apron the cook bustled over from the stove what happened darling i was just ill tell you what happened ann interrupted the light of vengeance swordbright in her eyes that man happened thats what anyone can see she tried to fight him off oh hell pay he will when i get through with michael fury there wont be anything left to scrape off the bottom of a shoe michael maybe it was fatigue laura thought hazily hadnt she just left michael what did he do her lips in a thin grim line ann sat took lauras hands in hers now dont be ashamed and dont worry none of it was your fault all right laura said slowly what wasnt my fault sweetheart obviously the poor girl was trying to block out the horror of it ann thought lets get your clothes off and see how bad things are im praying thats his blood on your clothes blood laura glanced down looked at the mess of her cotton shirt and slacks oh lord and it began to come clear oh lord she said again and let out a long wild laugh the brandy mrs williamson fetch the brandy no no no fighting for control laura grabbed ann before the housekeeper could spring up to exact revenge its not my blood annie or michaels either the foal she hiccupped managed to get a grip on herself i helped michael birth a foal last night well then satisfied mrs williamson went back to her cooking a foal suspicion still gleamed in anns eyes you were down at the stables birthing a foal yes a filly a beauty she sighed and was tempted to lay her head on the table and drift off every drop of adrenaline had drained leaving only floaty exhaustion its a messy job annie i suppose michael and i both look like weve been in some sort of bar fight oh shaken and mortified ann rose ill get you some coffee then ive had about all the coffee my system can take for the next couple of years she sobered then took anns hands again annie im surprised at you michael wouldnt hurt me ive told her the boys got gold in him mrs williamson put in but will she listen i know a rogue when i see one this rogue laura said quietly spent the night worrying over a horse hes taking his own time to teach my children to ride hes kind to them and attentive and from what ive seen of the stables and his stock he works harder than two men ann remembered the way little kayla had run to him and his easy response but she set her jaw she knew what she knew a leopard doesnt change his spots i say maybe not but a man can remake himself if hes given the chance however you feel about him he is for the moment part of templeton house dragging herself to her feet laura rubbed her hands over her gritty eyes now i need a shower and a little when she dropped her hands her gaze fell on the clock over the stove oh my god seventhirty how can it be seventhirty ive got a nine oclock meeting the girls are they up dont you worry about the girls ann told her ill see that theyre dressed and taken to school this morning you just cancel that meeting miss laura and go to bed cant its important ill make sure theyre getting dressed and grab a quick shower i can drop them at school on my way to work see that they have their breakfast please annie and yours missy but laura was already at a dash just coffee thanks i dont have time taken on too much mrs williamson clucked as she whipped up batter for waffles keeps this up shes going to drop flat on her face before much longer you mark my words and she wouldnt mind it if a certain young rogue caught her when she did she wouldnt mind it one little bit shouldnt have been up all night worrying over someone elses business mrs sullivan youre a fine woman but youre as stubborn as six mules when it conies to certain matters and while you mark my words ill wager a months pay youll be eating your own soon enough well see about that wont we miffed ann poured coffee for laura and prepared to take it upstairs that boy is trouble if he is mrs williamson said placidly its the kind of trouble a smart girl dreams of having wish id had more of that sort of trouble in my life as ann sailed out streaming dignity behind her mrs williamson hummed a bright tune it wasnt that she didnt believe thered been a foal born in the night it was simply that ann sullivan preferred to see with her own eyes she marched to the stables grudgingly carrying the basket of muffins mrs williamson had pressed on her if she had her way michael fury wouldnt be eating from the templeton house kitchen for long she looked up at the apartment first frowning a bit as she noticed the fresh paint on the trim just trying to ingratiate himself that was all she thought making himself handy and agreeable until he could wreak havoc well he could pull the wool over everyones eyes but hers she strode into the stables something she had avoided doing since michaels arrival surprise came first the place was tidy as a drawing room and smelled not at all unpleasant of hay and horses she jolted when max poked his head out and bumped her shoulder in greeting lord save us youre big as a house but his mild eyes made her smile and checking over her shoulder first to make certain she was unobserved she stroked his silky nose what a pretty boy you are are you the one who does all the tricks the girls are forever talking about hes one of them when michael stepped out of the foaling stall down the block ann dropped her hand and cursed herself for not looking around more carefully want to try him out thank you no stiff as a lance she moved forward mrs williamson sent you some muffins yeah he took the basket chose one steam poured out when he bit in he could have whimpered in gratitude the woman is a goddess he said with his mouth full i dont think youre playing red riding hood delivering goodies to the wolf mrs sullivan a lot you know about fairy tales she was waylaid by the wolf an innocent girl on her way to her grandmothers i stand corrected because she put his back up every bit as much as he put up hers he went back into the stall to finish medicating the lactating mare and her foal thats a finelooking horse she is they are had a long night didnt you darling the stall didnt look like the site of a long messy birth the straw was clean as a whistle and both mother and child were well groomed since it had been only an hour since laura had stumbled into the kitchen it seemed the boy hadnt been wasting his time youve had one as well mr fury from what im told im surprised youre not snoring in your bed i hope to be as soon as i finish up here the horses need to be fed and watered first because he knew it would annoy her he grinned over his shoulder want to give me a hand i have my own duties to see to youll keep your own house and he was apparently keeping it well she admitted tidy habits earned anns respect but apparently you had no problem imposing on miss laura and keeping her up through the night satisfied that mother and child were settled he moved out skirted around anns rigid form and began to deal with the feed no i didnt the girl needs her sleep well shes getting it now shes on her way to monterey the scoop paused grain dribbled as he turned back to her thats ridiculous she was up all night she had an appointment this morning she was exhausted i know it she was surprised that he did and that he seemed so annoyed stupid he thrust the scoop back into the grain bin she could get her hair or her nails done later get her hair done her nails disgusted ann slapped her hands on her hips if thats what you think miss laura is about youre stupid and ive never thought otherwise shes gone to work you baboon at the hotel and this afternoon shes going to work at the shop then if shes able to stand after you kept her up all night with your horse shell tend her children then shell she owns the damn hotel he shot back and the damn shop and i imagine both could stand if she took a lousy day off she takes her obligations seriously and shes got children to raise doesnt she tuition to pay for clothes and food to buy bills to pay templetons dont work for paychecks laura templeton does do you think shed live off her family do you think that even after that heartless bastard took all her money shed go crying to her parents what are you talking about took all her money as if you didnt know now she sneered as if all of big sur and monterey and down to carmel dont know that that man all but emptied all their bank accounts and the stocks and bonds and properties before the divorce ridgeway his eyes flashed dark sharp swords tilted for battle why isnt he dead ann sucked in a breath on this at least she could agree even with a rogue but she had said more than shed intended it isnt my place to gossip with a stablehand im not a stablehand and youve never let your place stop you when it comes to me why did they let ridgeway get away with it josh could have stopped it the templetons could have crucified him its miss lauras business and her choice ann folded her hands and closed her lips it doesnt add up he took the grain to max who was waiting patiently shes got to have family money to wade in shes got that house and servants nobody lives like that and worries about pennies ann made a derisive sound miss lauras financial business is none of yours michael fury but if youve been thinking to soften her into letting loose of some of her money in your direction youll have to look elsewhere she recognized black fury in a man when she saw it and also the rigid control that prevented it from spewing out shed expected the first but never the second so warned he said and went back to feeding his horses she started to speak again had that been hurt beneath the boiling temper no she refused to believe it of a man like him still she bit her lip wondering how her words would taste if she was wrong and did indeed have to eat them ill leave you to your business when she left he continued to measure grain precisely then the scoop flew out of his hands smashed against the stable wall with enough force to snap its handle off in the stalls several of the horses stirred nervously max stopped eating long enough to look out and study his master fuck me michael murmured and rubbed his hands over his face ive got enough to do goddamn woman should be in bed he picked up the scoop threw it again then went to find a new one chapter ten by two in the afternoon laura had entered a new phase of exhaustion it was almost pleasant the way she seemed to float just an inch or so off the ground and the way the air around her seemed rather soft and fluid shed handled her meeting with the conference chair for the writers convention had briefed her staff one last time for the influx of guests that would be arriving over the following two days and had checked and rechecked the details with the banquet manager maintenance and shipping catering room service and housekeeping at one shed fueled herself with coffee and a candy bar and headed out to pretenses the one bright spot in the day had been kates semihysterical call just as laura was racing out of the shower that morning its pink it turned pink im pregnant byron put me down did you hear laura im going to have a baby shed heard and theyd laughed together wept a little now kate was wandering in a dream state around the shop how about guinevere if its a girl kate wondered byrons family has this tradition of choosing names from literature guinevere was a weakmoraled round heel margo commented she boffed her husbands best friend but if thats the kind of thing you want ive always liked ariel laura put in from the tempest ariel de witt kate took a notebook out of her pocket and jotted it down names were a serious matter she thought and had to be considered from all angles had to sound right look right feel right hmmm this one definitely had potential not bad she pocketed her reading glasses as she looked at laura lauras nodding off again im not caught she jerked her lolling head up struggled to focus what the hell had they been talking about names she said quickly as though it was a pop quiz girl names for the baby out of literature hester juliet delilah and your prize for the correct answer is a complete home entertainment center kate arched a brow would you like to move on to round two and try for the trip to honolulu very funny laura resisted rubbing at her eyes like a cranky child i rather like juliet well put it before our distinguished panel of judges laura take five before you fall on your face and if anyone knows the consequences of overextending herself margo put in its our pregnant pal with the dopey look in her eyes why dont you go in the back and catch a quick nap as she studied laura margo polished glassware spending the night with michaels bound to sap a womans energy laura winced and looked around to see if there were any customers within hearing distance i told you we were birthing a foal not tearing up the sheets which only proves youve got your priorities skewed kate i think that customers ready for a little push margo nodded toward a man contemplating snuffboxes hes got his eye on you she added when kate walked away the customer michael laura michael if you dont have yours right back on him you need to visit your optometrist i dont have time for all right maybe ive looked margo set down a waterford water glass and turned away progress she thought at long last and are you ready for a little push laura blew out a breath he wants to he wants me surprise surprise no i mean he said it just like that how do you respond to something like that there are a variety of ways lets see i believe ive tried them all margo tapped a finger on her cheek which of margos ploys would you prefer im not looking for a ploy because her knees kept disappearing on her laura sat down on the stool behind the counter margo ive slept with one man in my life i was married to him for ten years i dont have any ploys or ways or answers no ploys maybe and good for you but every woman has ways and i think you have answers try this question are you attracted to him yes but the answer is yes margo interrupted and kept one eye on a pair of customers contemplating the jewelry in the display along the side wall you are a responsible unattached adult female who is attracted to an attractive unattached adult male that works fine if youre a rabbit it can work fine for people too laura there arent any guarantees you certainly know that yes you could be hurt you could also be happy or you could just get your oil checked snorting laura shook her head sex has always been easier for you than me i wont argue that but im not particularly proud of it i didnt mean i know you didnt ive slept with more than one man some of them were married to someone else sometimes it meant something sometimes it didnt she could shrug it off now without regret or recriminations because she understood that everything shed ever done had carried her toward where she was now josh is the only one who really mattered because you love each other laura said quietly were not talking about love between michael and me its just plain lust and whats wrong with that i can usually figure out whats wrong with it until he puts his hands on me or kisses me as far as margo could see that was an excellent sign and then then i just want and ive never wanted like that everythings too hot too fast she shifted uneasily even thinking about it stirred something inside her its not comfortable hallelujah with a chuckle margo leaned closer surprise yourself laura go down to the stables some night and jump him right thats just what i planned really margo i could use some sensible advice here sensibles for retirement plans miss one of the customers signaled could i see this pin please of course taking up the keys margo moved away oh dont you adore art deco thats a fabulous piece i found it at an estate sale in los angeles they said it once belonged to marlene dietrich laura scanned the shop stifled a yawn they were busy she noted but not overwhelmed maybe she could sneak in a quick catnap she slid off the stool wandered toward a customer to ask if she needed help prayed the answer would be no and then the door opened peter she stopped in her tracks i called your office at the hotel they indicated i would find you here yes this is one of my regular afternoons at pretenses interesting he hadnt been in before had purposely stifled his curiosity about his exwifes little venture into shopkeeping now that he was here he took a slow measuring study candys description of the shop as a jumble of secondhand junk hadnt been quite accurate then again understanding his fiancées feelings toward laura and her partners he hadnt expected it to be still neither had he expected to find the place charming peopled with welltodo clientele as well as the tourist trade he hadnt expected to be intrigued by the displays and more than a little envious of the merchandise well she recognized the appraisal what do you think its different isnt it certainly a change of pace for you he looked at her again still cool and lovely he mused odd hed never have believed laura or either of her friends had the brains the wherewithal or the imagination to create something so appealing so successful its not a change of pace any longer she refused to allow the way he studied her and hers to upset her it is the pace i suppose youre enjoying the distraction its a business peter not a distraction why should she expect him to understand pretenses hed never understood his wife perhaps she thought he would deal much more comfortably with the new wife hed chosen i doubt you came in to pick up a gift for candy she doesnt care for our stock as a rule no i came to speak with you he looked around again noted the twisting staircase the open balcony then he spotted margo watching him with a cold look of calculated dislike he certainly didnt have to tolerate silent abuse from the daughter of a servant do you have an office a private office we can use we use most of our space for merchandise there was an office of course but she wasnt willing to speak with him in the shop it was hers it was not to be soiled with personal problems why dont we take a walk outside margo ill be back shortly if thats what you want margo smiled thinly at peter be sure to give our best to your fiancée peter kate and i were just saying how delighted we are youve found your match im sure candace will find your sentiments entertaining laura merely shook her head at margo to forestall another pithier comment i wont be long she opened the door herself waited for peter to step through onto the veranda he didnt care for cannery row or what he considered its carnival atmosphere it was crowded noisy inconvenient this is hardly private laura she smiled at the people strolling on the sidewalk the busy families the snarled traffic nothings so private as a crowd without asking him what he preferred she moved to the curb to wait for a break in traffic we find the location quite a plus we lure in a lot of browsers who come to the wharf or wander down after a tour of the aquarium idly brushing her hair back as the breeze teased it she started across the street wanting to be closer to the sea and of course its pleasant being able to take a break now and again and come out to watch the water feed the gulls youll hardly keep a business afloat by daydreaming over the sea were managing she leaned on an iron rail skimmed her glance over waves and boats gulls fluttered and sent a young girl into excited laughter when they landed one by one on her knee as she sat with a bag of crackers what do you want peter to discuss allison and kayla all right she turned to him leaned back allison is doing very well in school her grades are exceptional im sure youd approve kaylas having a little trouble with math but were working on it thats hardly what i excuse me im not finished she knew he wasnt interested but she was revved ali played clara in the nutcracker production put on by her ballet class last december she was beautiful and she cried afterward because her father hadnt come as hed told her he would i explained that i had a conflict yes you did kayla played one of the mice and she didnt care particularly whether you were there or not i believe ali will continue the dance lessons and should be en pointe in another year kaylas losing interest but her drawing is improving every day theyre also taking riding lessons now from michael fury hes very impressed with both of them kayla had the sniffles a few weeks ago but they didnt slow her down for long oh and ive gotten them a puppy and two kittens he waited a beat are you done theres quite a bit more actually theyre active growing children but that should cover the high points for now i came here hoping to have a calm and civilized discussion not to be treated to one of your diatribes laura that wasnt even close to a diatribe peter but i can oblige you he shifted irritated when someone bumped his shoulder candy and i are to be married in just over eight weeks in palm springs allison and kayla should attend is this a demand or an invitation people will expect the children to be there candy is making arrangements for her children to attend her au pair will bring them down the day before the ceremony allison and kayla can travel with them how civilized she thought and how cold you want them delivered by candys au pair and returned the same way i suppose its sensible and its convenient and it wont infringe on your time at all she held up a hand before he could speak im sorry im tired and apparently shorttempered im sure the girls would appreciate being included if youd call tonight i have plans i hardly see the necessity of running through the details again she turned away looked once more out to sea she could and would bury her own resentments and try once again to give her daughter what she needed peter ali is very hurt very confused and very afraid you so rarely come to see them or call she feels abandoned weve been over this before laura and he considered himself infinitely patient for listening to it all again you wanted the divorce now its done settled theres been adequate time for her to adjust i have my own life to think about and do you ever think of the children he sighed checked his rolex he could spare ten minutes more and no longer you always expected more than i found manageable in that area theyre not an area theyre children she whirled around stopped herself from spewing out all the resentment the bitterness and simply looked at his face so handsome she thought so cool so composed so perfect you dont love them do you peter you never did simply because i refuse to dote on them to spoil them as youve chosen to do doesnt mean i dont understand my responsibilities thats not what i asked surprised at herself she laid a hand on his arm peter its just the two of us here weve neither of us anything to lose at this point so lets be honest lets put this in its place so that we can stop going over the same ground again and again and accomplishing nothing its you who insists on going over the same ground he reminded her all right i keep going over it arguments were useless and she admitted just too tiring i want to understand i need to its no longer a matter of what you did or didnt feel for me or i for you theyre children our children help me understand why you dont want them for a moment he stared down at the hand on his arm delicate hed always found that delicacy appealing the fact that there was steel under it had been both disconcerting and disappointing and perhaps if they cleared up this matter she would stop her constant requests that he flex his schedule to meet her expectations im not father material laura i dont consider that a flaw simply a fact all right though her heart ached she nodded ill accept that but peter you are a father your definition of that term and mine are essentially different my responsibilities are met he said stiffly you receive the child support payments every month and they were banked she thought into the college funds that he had emptied before the divorce is that it a financial burden an obligation thats all there is for you im not a doting parent and never have been i thought once that i would do better with sons that i wanted them he spread his elegant hands the simple truth is that it doesnt matter now we didnt have sons and i dont want more children candys are well tended polite and dont require my attention i dont believe allison and kayla require it either theyre being raised well and comfortably in a good home like poodles she thought as pity stirred the answer is you dont love them i dont feel the connection youd like me to he angled his head to look down at her lets both be honest laura theyre more templeton than ridgeway more yours than mine thats always been true it didnt have to be she murmured theyre so beautiful miracles im so sorry you cant take what they would give you and i would say that all of us are better off the way things stand i was angry initially when you insisted on divorce angry that it cost me the position i had earned at templeton but over the past few months ive come to see that it was inevitable i enjoy the challenge of running my own hotel and frankly candace is more the kind of woman who suits my needs and my nature then i hope youre happy really she shuddered out a breath do you really want the girls at the wedding peter or is it for form if they choose not to attend its a simple matter to make the proper excuses all right ill talk to them leave it up to them ill expect to hear from you by the end of the week if were done i have an appointment shortly he glanced back across the street with the air somewhat cleared between them he chose to be magnanimous your shop is very impressive laura i hope its successful for you thank you peter she said when he turned to leave her people milled around them but they didnt matter she remembered a magical night with moonglow drifting through the gazebo and the scent of flowers and the promise of a dream did you ever love me i have to know i also have my life to think about he looked at her standing with the sea at her back the sun glinting off her hair her skin pale and fragile until the words were out of his mouth hed had no plans to tell her the truth no no i didnt love you but i wanted you a heart could break again she realized as she nodded and turned back to the sea it could break again and again and again the minute she walked back into the shop kate pounced upstairs what dizzy with fatigue and grief laura let herself be hauled up the winding steps upstairs and into bed but were open the boudoir is closed for the rest of the day in the boudoir kate pushed her onto the slippery satin quilt on the big bed and knelt to pry off her shoes you get in turn it off i dont want you thinking about anything anything especially whatever that creep said to upset you odd laura mused her vision was all gray at the edges like a screen narrowing he never loved them kate he told me he never loved my babies he never loved me dont think about it in sympathy kates eyes began to swim dont worry go to sleep i feel so sorry for him so sorry for all of us im so tired i know i know honey lie down fussy as a mother hen over a sick chick she smoothed the covers over her friend sleep she sat on the side of the bed took lauras hand i used to dream about the way things would be so perfect so lovely shh kate murmured even as lauras voice trailed off dream about something else find a new dream is she out margo said from the doorway yeah kate sniffled and wiped her cheek and thought of the child inside her of the man shed loved and married who already cherished it and her i hate peter fucking ridgeway stand in line margo stepped in to lay a hand on kates shoulder when she walked back in she looked so broken i could kill him for putting that look in her eyes stand in line kate echoed shell be all right well make sure of it lauras mind was still fuzzy with fatigue when she returned home she thought briefly about a long steaming bath cool smooth sheets and oblivion but she needed her children and needed them badly she found them as shed expected to at the stables bongo greeted her first racing forward with his tongue lolling out in a grin he skidded to a halt at her feet promptly sat his rump down and lifted a paw whats this charmed she crouched down to shake trick dog michaels been playing with you what else can you do huh can you lie down he flopped down into the prone position instantly looking up for approval and the expected biscuit can you roll over play dead were still working on that michael strolled over and to bongos relief offered him a biscuit youve always got to pay for the show he said to laura the girls must be thrilled theyre teaching him the rollover hes making progress but his eyes were on lauras and the shadows under them you just getting back um i came down to see the girls and to get a look at the foal hows she doing shes doing great which is more than i can say for you the frustration and annoyance hed pent up all day spewed out in rough words are you crazy going to work a full day on no sleep you might have nodded off behind the wheel and killed yourself on highway i had meetings thats bullshit laura just bullshit whats going on around here whats this crap about you letting ridgeway walk with your money and you holding down two jobs to pay the bills be quiet she glanced anxiously over his shoulder relieved that the girls werent in sight or earshot i dont know who youve been talking to but its none of their business or yours i dont want the girls hearing any of this its my business when you lose a nights sleep helping me out then come out here looking as though i could knock you over with a careless breath he yanked her to her feet i figured you were out playing all day at the shop diddling at an office and getting your hair done well you were wrong werent you and it isnt your concern one way or the other now where are the girls he vibrated with impotence with the rage of not being able to help or hinder with a shrug he turned on his heel in the paddock alone visions of calamities raced through her head even as she dashed toward the stables when she saw them in the paddock fear turned to shock her daughters were happily riding in circles on a pair of patient quarter horses i havent got them jumping through flaming hoops yet or doing flips michael said dryly the woman he thought was an open book thats next week arent they great annoyance with him vanished as she gripped his arm and watched alis trotting she posts so well already i told you she was a natural kayla he called out heels down her little boots adjusted immediately and like the pup she looked over for approval mama look mama i can ride you sure can thrilled laura moved to the fence hooked one foot on the bottom rung you both look fabulous her head high ali trotted over and drew her mount to a polite stop this is tess shes three mr fury says shes a very good jumper and that hell teach me shes beautiful ali you look beautiful on her thats why i want her i can buy her with my own money i can take it out of my savings her eyes tilted down in challenge its my money had been laura thought wearily peter had taken it along with the college fund and she hadnt nearly begun to replace the loss a horse is a very big responsibility ali its not just the buying its the keeping we have the stables shed thought about this dreamed about this for days i can feed her and pay for the hay with my allowance please mama now a headache brewed nastily in the fog of fatigue ali i cant think about this right now lets wait and then ill ask my father ali jerked her chin up even as her lips trembled ill call him and ask him you can certainly call him but he doesnt have anything to do with this you had a horse when you were a girl you had anything you wanted but you always tell me to wait you never understand when somethings important you never understand fine all right im not going to fight with you now because she was going to break could already feel the first fissures forming laura turned and walked away get off the horse ali when her stormy eyes came to his michael reached over for the bridle dismount now i havent finished my lesson yeah you have now youre going to get another one the minute she hit the ground he wrapped the reins around the fence rail then plucked the girl up and sat her beside them so his gaze was level with hers do you think you have the right to talk to your mother that way she doesnt listen no you dont listen and you dont see but i listened and you want to know what i heard he jerked her chin up when it drooped i heard a spoiled ungrateful brat sassing her mother her teary eyes went wide with shock im not a brat you just gave a damned good imitation you think you can snap your fingers and get whatever you want or have a tantrum if it doesnt happen or doesnt happen quick enough to suit you its my money ali said hotly she doesnt have any right to wrong shes got all the rights your mother just came home from working her butt off so that you can have a nice home and food on the table so you can have your lessons and your fancy school ive always lived here she doesnt have to work she just goes away every day open your eyes something he admitted he should have done himself youre old enough and smart enough to see what shes going through tears began to leak now she divorced him she made him go away i guess she did that just to make you miserable you dont understand nobody understands bull i understand just fine which is why im not tanning your hide you cant spank me he leaned closer wanna bet the very idea was so shocking so unbelievable that she closed her mouth tight good choice he said and nodded this horse isnt for sale to you but mr fury and youre not welcome in the stables until youve apologized to your mother if i ever see you sass her again you will get your hide tanned he lifted her off the fence and set her down on her feet again ali fisted her hands at her sides you cant make me do anything youre just a tenant whos bigger placidly he stepped over the fence to tend the waiting horse and right now ms ridgeway youre standing on my property i hate you it came out on a choked sob but was nonetheless passionate i hate everyone she streaked away while michael stroked the mare yeah i know how that feels too you yelled at her wincing he looked over to see kayla still astride her eyes huge and fascinated hed forgotten he had an audience nobody ever yells at her mama has a couple of times but she always says shes sorry after im not sorry she deserved it would you really spank her gray eyes glittered would you spank me if i was bad there was such a poignant wistfulness to the question that michael gave up he plucked her out of the saddle held her hard id whale the tar out of you he gave her bottom a light pat you wouldnt sit down for a week she squeezed harder i love you mr fury hell what had he done i love you too which was he realized with some amusement the first time hed said those words to a female in all of his life i was pretty hard on her he murmured as the picture of alis unhappy face swam into his mind and guilt seeped into his heart i know where shell go she always goes there when shes mad he should leave bad enough alone he told himself he should stay out of it he should shit lets go see chapter eleven with anger and shame snapping at her heart ali raced over the lawn through the arbor of wisteria nobody understood her nobody cared those thoughts drummed a miserable beat in her head as she whipped down the stone path through banks of hibiscus and nightblooming jasmine she didnt care either she didnt care about anything or anyone nothing could make her care she burst through arching yews into a sundappled alcove with marble benches and a central fountain shaped like spearing calla lilies her headlong rush halted with a skid of her boots on brick and with shock it was her spot where she came when she needed to be alone to think to plan to sulk she hadnt known her mother came here too the cliffs were her mothers special place yet her mother was here sitting on a marble bench weeping shed never seen her mother cry not like this not with her hands covering her face her shoulders heaving not such violent helpless hopeless tears staggered she stared watching the woman she had always believed invincible sobbing as though the well of grief would never run dry because of me ali thought as her own breath hitched because of me mama lauras head shot up she sprang off the bench fought for control lost breaking she sank down again too tired too bruised too shattered to fight i dont know what to do anymore i just dont know what to do i cant take anymore panic shame emotions she didnt understand spurted so high so fast that ali was across the bricks and wrapped around her mother before shed thought to move im sorry mama im sorry im sorry under the arch kayla gripped michaels hand mamas crying mamas crying so hard i know it destroyed him to see it to hear it to know there was nothing he could do to stop it itll be all right baby he lifted kayla up let her press her face into his shoulder they just need to get it out thats all lets leave them alone i dont want her to cry kayla sniffled against him as he carried her away neither do i but sometimes it helps she leaned back sure that he would hold her do you ever cry sometimes i do stupid man things instead say bad words break things does it make you feel better mostly can we go break something now he grinned at her lord what a character sure lets go find something good to break but i get to say all the bad words in the alcove laura held her daughter close rocked her comforting as always brought comfort its all right ali its all right dont hate me i could never hate you no matter what she tilted her daughters tearstreaked face up her baby she thought swamped with love and guilt and sorrow her firstborn her treasure i love you allison i love you so much and nothing could ever change that you stopped loving daddy lauras heart shuddered again why did it have to be so hard yes i did but thats different ali i know its hard to understand but its so very different i know why he went away ali struggled to steady her jaw she had made her mother cry and nothing she knew nothing she had ever done could be worse it was my fault no with firm hands laura cupped alis face no it was not your fault it was he didnt like me i tried to be good i wanted to be i wanted him to stay and to love us but he didnt want me so he went away why hadnt she seen this laura wondered why hadnt the family counselor why hadnt anyone seen it ali thats not true people get divorced its sad and its sorry but it happens your father and i got divorced because of him and because of me you know i dont lie to you ali yes you do stunned laura jerked back ali you dont lie exactly but you make excuses and thats the same she bit her lip terrified that her mother would cry again but she had to say it you always made excuses for him youd say he wanted to come to the recital but he had an important meeting he wanted to go with us to the movies or the zoo or anyplace but he had work but it wasnt true he didnt want to go he didnt want to go with me oh dear god how could protecting your child cause so much damage it wasnt because of you not because of you ali or because of kayla i promise you thats not true he doesnt love me how could she answer what was right praying that whatever words she chose would be best she stroked alis tumbled hair it might be hard for you to understand this but some people arent cut out to be parents maybe theyd like to be or they want to be but they just cant your father never meant to hurt you or kayla ali shook her head slowly he doesnt love me she said it quietly or kayla or you if he doesnt love you in the way you wish he did it isnt your fault its nothing you did nothing you are or arent its not his fault either because youre making excuses again laura drew back shut her eyes all right allison no excuses are you sorry you had me lauras eyes flashed open what sorry oh allison this part at least was easy as breathing do you know when i was a girl hardly older than you i used to dream that i would fall in love one day and get married id have a home and beautiful children to fill it id watch them grow her lips curved now as she stroked the hair away from her daughters damp cheeks not all of that dream worked out the way i thought it would but the best part did the best part of the dream and the best part of my life is you and its kayla nothing in the world could be truer than that ali knuckled a tear from her cheek i didnt mean those things i said i know i said them because i knew you would never go away no matter what youd never go away thats right smiling laura flicked a finger down alis cheek youre stuck with me i felt bad and i wanted it to be your fault she had to swallow before she could speak again did he go to bed with another woman just when you thought it was safe laura thought with a jolt where did you hear a thing like that at school the flush rose up into alis cheeks but she kept her eyes steady some of the older girls talked about it thats nothing you or the older girls should be talking about alis mouth firmed he did she nodded and leaving a small lovely part of her childhood on the bench rose that was wrong he hurt you and you made him go away there were a lot of reasons i asked for a divorce ali tread carefully laura warned herself even as her heart was breaking to see that tooadult look in her babys eyes none of them is appropriate for you or your friends to discuss im talking to you mama ali said so simply that laura had no response it wasnt my fault she continued it wasnt your fault either it was his fault no it wasnt your fault but two people make a marriage ali and two people break it no ali thought studying her mother not always did you go to bed with another man no of course not laura stopped herself appalled that she was discussing her sex life with a tenyearold allison that question is completely inappropriate cheating is inappropriate too weary again laura rubbed her brow youre too young to judge ali does that mean its all right to cheat sometimes trapped trapped by the unbending logic and admirable values of a tenyearold girl all right no its not he took our money too didnt he oh good god laura rose gossip isnt attractive and its irrelevant she understood now ali thought understood the titters from other girls the murmured conversations of adults and all the pitying glances thats why you had to go to work money is not an issue here she refused to let it be i went to work because i wanted to i opened the shop because i wanted to templeton hotels has always been part of my life so have margo and kate working is sometimes hard and its sometimes tiring but it makes me feel good and im good at it she took a breath struggled for the right angle you know how youre tired after a long rehearsal for a recital but you love it and when youve done well when you know youve done well you feel strong and happy thats not an excuse no lauras lips curved again its not an excuse fact is im seriously considering asking my boss at the hotel for a raise im damned good granddad would give you one templetons dont pull rank can i come with you to the hotel one day and watch you work i like going to the shop but ive never gone to your other office id like that she stepped forward brushed a hand over alis hair its never too soon to start training the next generation in the templeton organization settled again ah rested her head on her mothers breast i love you mama it had been laura thought much too long since shed heard those words there were birds singing in the garden she realized and the little fountain was playing musically the air was soft and her child was in her arms everything would be all right i love you ali i wont sass you anymore or be a brat or say things to make you cry of course you will laura thought settling herself youre growing up and ill try not to make excuses smiling ali lifted her head but im still not going to like mrs litchfield and im never ever going to call her mama oh i think i can live with that eyes gleaming wickedly laura bent down woman to woman ill tell you something just between you and me i dont like her either she traced her finger over alis lips when they bowed up are we better now uhhuh mama everyone said our home was broken but they were wrong its not broken at all laura tucked her daughter under her arm and looked across the gardens to templeton house no its not were not were just fine ali it wasnt an easy thing for a young girl with a great deal of pride to take the first step though it had troubled her and kept her awake a long time during the night ali hadnt told her mother what michael had said to her or how it had made her feel she wasnt sure what her mother would have done or said but she did know when youd done something wrong you were supposed to fix it shed gotten up early and dressed for school then slipped out the side door to avoid any questions old joe was here this morning humming to his azaleas ali cautiously skirted that section of the garden and made her way toward the stables she had her speech all worked out and she was very proud of it she thought it was mature dignified and clever she was certain that mr fury would nod wisely impressed after she was done she stopped for a moment to watch the horses hed let out into the paddock he would be cleaning the stalls then she tried not to pout as she watched tess and thought about what it was like to ride her and brush her and feed her apples her mother might have evaded the subject of money but ali knew with her new wisdom that buying and keeping a horse would strain the budget besides she didnt intend to ask mr fury for anything he had yelled at her scolded her threatened to spank her that was simply not permitted and all the pitying glances thats why you had to go to work money is not an issue here she refused to let it be i went to work because i wanted to i opened the shop because i wanted to templeton hotels has always been part of my life so have margo and kate working is sometimes hard and its sometimes tiring but it makes me feel good and im good at it she took a breath struggled for the right angle you know how youre tired after a long rehearsal for

and keeping a horse would strain the budget besides she didnt intend to ask mr fury for anything he had yelled at her scolded her threatened to spank her that was simply not permitted head high she walked into the stables all the smells shed begun to love were there hay and grain and horse and leather she remembered the way hed shown her to saddlesoap the tack how to curry a horse how he had put her in the saddle for the first time and praised her she bit her lip none of that mattered hed insulted her she heard the sounds of the shovel and she walked to the end of the row where michael was filling a wheelbarrow with soiled straw and manure excuse me mr fury her voice had a royal ring that she would have been surprised to know closely echoed her mothers he looked behind him took in the slight young girl in the tidy blue dress and trendy italian sneakers youre out early thoughtful he leaned on his shovel no school today i dont have to leave for a little while she glanced at her watch folded her hands the gestures were so like lauras he had to fight back a smile something you want to say yes sir i want to apologize for being rude and for causing a family scene in front of you little miss dignity he thought your chins trembling apology accepted he said simply and bent to his work he was supposed to apologize now it was after all the proper way to close a misunderstanding when he didnt her brows drew together i think you were also rude i dont he dumped the last load propped up his shovel then gripped the handles of the wheelbarrow better move aside youll get your dress dirty you raised your voice you called me names he cocked his head and your point is youre supposed to say youre sorry he released the handles brushed his hands over his jeans im not sorry you deserved it im not a brat all her dignity crumbled as did her face i didnt mean the things i said i didnt mean to make her cry she understands she doesnt hate me i know she understands she loves you a kid who has a mother like that in her corners got everything pushing it aways pretty stupid ill never do it again i know better now i know lots of things better now she knuckled a tear away you can spank me if you want and i wont tell i dont want you to hate me michael crouched down gave her a long steady look come here trembling terrified at her images of humiliation and pain she stepped forward when he grabbed her she muffled a cry of alarm then was dazzled to find herself being hugged youre a standup gal blondie he smelled of the horses i am swallowing prides hell i know you did a good job full of wonder she held on tight it was like granddad or uncle josh or uncle byron but different just a little different youre not mad at me anymore no you mad at me she shook her head and let the words tumble out i want to ride the horses please i want to come back and help you and feed them and brush them i told mama i was sorry and i wont sass her anymore dont make me stay away how am i supposed to get things done around here without you and tess has already been missing you she sniffed eased back has she really maybe youve got time to say hi to her before you take off for school but you want to get rid of these he took out a bandanna ali experiencing the thrill of having her tears dried by a man for the first time fell headlong in love will you still give me riding lessons and teach me how to jump im counting on it he held out a hand friends yes sir michael my friends call me michael hed never been inside templeton monterey though michael had grown up just up the coast it wasnt so odd hed never had a need for a hotel in the area and if he had templeton would have been beyond his touch hed been to the resort after all his mother had worked there so he knew what to expect then again he mused as he passed the uniformed doorman you usually got more than you expected from templeton the lobby was enormous sprawling with conversation and waiting areas tucked away behind potted palms and greenery to offer the cozy and the private the bar long and wide with generous chairs and gleaming tables was up a short flight of stairs and separated by a trio of brass rails those who wanted a little lift could enjoy their cocktail and watch the people come and go there were plenty of them michael noted they were six deep at checkin flooding the long mahogany counter while clerks hustled to assign rooms two waitresses worked the waiting crowd and passed out glasses of fizzing water the noise was huge wherever they stood sat or wandered they talked primarily women he observed some of them dressed for business others drooping from travel and all he thought studying the heaped luggage carts with enough suitcases for a sixmonth stay as he maneuvered out of the way two women streaked toward each other over the shining tile and met with squeals and embraces several others were eyeing him not that he particularly minded being ogled but being so completely outnumbered he chose discretion as the better part of valor and contemplated retreat then he saw her and there might not have been another woman in the room she carried a clipboard tucked atop a fat file her hair was pinned up smoothed somehow into a neat professional twist she wore a simple black suit that even one with a fashionimpaired eye could see was painfully expensive for his own pleasure he let his gaze wander down to her legs and gave thanks to whatever sadist had convinced women to wear those skinny high heels though she was deep in conversation with the conference chair and frantically sorting out details in her head laura felt a flush of heat a tingle at her back she shifted struggled to ignore it and at last glanced over her shoulder in the midst of all those women many of whom where rolling their eyes behind his back he stood with his thumbs tucked in the front pocket of his jeans smiling at her ms templeton laura hmm oh yes melissa im going to check on that right away the conference chair was as busy as harried as laura she was also as human and she felt a quick tug as she looked across the room my my grinning she blew out a breath you sure do grow them fine in monterey apparently if youll excuse me a minute tucking her clipboard under her arm she hurried toward michael welcome to bedlam did you come by to see byron i had no idea corporate executives were so sexy he lifted a hand flicked it over a glittering heart pin on her lapel cute all the staff are wearing them its a romance writers convention no kidding intrigued he surveyed the crowd met several pairs of equally intrigued female eyes these women write those books with all that steam romance novels are an enormous industry that accounts for more than forty percent of the paperback market and provides enjoyment and entertainment for millions while focusing on love commitment and hope she reached around to rub the back of her neck dont get me started used to read because i liked a story now ive become an advocate byrons in the penthouse the elevators i didnt come to see byron though i might swing by i came to see you oh she turned her wrist to glance at her watch im awfully pressed just now is it important i went by your shop first quite a place it had impressed him as the hotel impressed him with its style and charm you had a crowd there too yes were doing well she tried to imagine him taking a turn around pretenses not quite the bull in the china shop she decided more like the wolf among the lambs did anything catch your eye the dress in the front window had its points his eyes slid down her would have had more with a woman in it i dont know much about doodads and glitters kate fasttalked me into some blue horse ah the aquamarine mare its lovely he jerked a shoulder i dont know what the hell im supposed to do with it or how she managed to con me out of three bills for that little statue laura laughed shes good but im sorry you had to run around looking for me and now ive i like looking at you he eased forward michael she backed up bumped into a shamelessly eavesdropping guest i really have to get into my office fine ill go with you no its this way she began when he took her arm i really dont have time i do im meeting another breeder in a couple hours he saw the glass door with executive offices printed on it is it always so noisy around here no checkin for a convention livens things up considerably it wasnt much more sedate behind the desk phones were ringing boxes were stacked people whizzed by laura turned into a small office with a central desk piled with tidy stacks of paper the fax machine was humming away spitting out an enormous stream christ how do you work in here feeling immediately hemmed in he rolled his shoulders how do you breathe in here its more than adequate and the limited space demands efficiency she tore off the fax and skimmed it as she picked up her phone sit down if you like im sorry i have to finish this after punching in numbers she cradled the phone between her neck and shoulder to keep her hands free karen yes ive got it right here it looks fine they need to set up their registration desk an hour earlier yes i know but theyve had to readjust their estimate on walkins yes i know marks handling that but he doesnt answer his page no i dont think hes gone over the wall chuckling she set the fax aside and picked up a memo uhhuh thats on my list dont worry if you could just my life for you no ill buy the bottle when its over thanks i want to hell ive got another call coming through ill check with you later michael took his seat rested his ankle on his knee and watched her work who would have thought it he mused the cool pampered princess up to her elbows in details swinging from phone to computer and back like a veteran soldier flanking the enemy depending on the topic her voice was warm chilly brisk or persuasive and she never missed a beat actually her heart missed quite a few every time she looked over and saw him sitting there black denim and worn boots and dark windblown hair eyes that watched everything michael you dont before she could finish even begin to nudge him along a skinny man with a quick smile poked his head in the door sorry laura mark ive been paging you for an hour i know i was trapped i swear it im on my way to deal with conference registration setup but theres a small crisis in the gold ballroom they want you of course they do she rose michael i need to see what this is about lets go dont you have something to do he made her nervous matching her pace as she strode back into the lobby im having fun watching you a guys entitled to an hour off now and again as they climbed a flight of wide carpeted steps he looked around curiously ive never been in here before hell of a place i didnt realize i wish i could show you around but she shrugged her shoulders you can take a tour on your own but i wouldnt recommend using the elevators weve got about eight hundred checking in today and theyll be jammed jammed into an elevator with women who write romance he shook his head i can think of worse things the secondfloor meetingroom level was as spacious as the lobby as elegantly appointed and nearly as crowded enormous chandeliers were brilliantly lit shooting light onto brass and silver dripping it on pots of flowering begonias in snowy white and blood red along one wall heavy drapes were open to a spectacular view of the bay laura marched toward a bank of six doors topped with an ornate brass plate identifying the gold ballroom you have to admire the templetons what they know how to build a hotel because she appreciated the statement she stopped for a moment it is wonderful isnt it its one of my favorites though i cant think of any that dont have some special aspect the one in rome rising above the spanish steps there are views from the windows that break your heart templeton new york has this lovely courtyard you never expect to find something that quiet in the middle of manhattan you take a step off madison avenue and the world changes there are fairy lights in the trees a little fountain and in london she trailed off shook her head thats something else you shouldnt get me started on i always figured youd take it for granted misconceptions he murmured as they walked toward the ballroom again theres a lot more i dont know about you than i do templetons dont take anything for granted and because she didnt she stepped inside the ballroom prepared for anything it was chaos half the tables for the evenings mass literacy signing were set up half were still stacked and waiting mountains of boxes lined the walls even the thought of what it would take to unpack them and distribute the books to the right spot made her eyes cross that at least was not her job laura it was melissa again her wireframed glasses sliding down her nose as she all but leapt across the carpet and into lauras arms im so glad youre here we still havent been able to locate shipments for six authors and an entire shipment from one of the publishers is lost somewhere in the bowels of the hotel ill put a trace on them dont worry yes but and ill go down to shipping and receiving myself her smile was meant to be reassuring and not weary if necessary ill brave the bowels personally and find the books i cant tell you what that means to me you have no idea what its like to have to tell an author she doesnt have any books to sign it doesnt matter if it was flood pestilence or armageddon shes going to jump you then well see that theyre here even if we have to send someone out to raid the bookstores melissa blew the hair out of her eyes ive worked four nationals and six regional conferences youre the best ive ever worked with and im not saying that just because my life is in your hands relieved she shifted her gaze to michael smiled winningly hello im melissa manning when im not insane michael are you a

briefcase which you can have would you like me to sign it for you thatd be great just give me a minute that was very sweet laura murmured when melissa dashed off for her briefcase i like to read and i might learn something he shifted slid a hand down her arm until it linked with his how about dinner tonight maybe a drive maybe some wild unbridled sex as usual an interesting offer it was humiliating to have to clear her throat but she had no choice im working here tonight now thats insane amused melissa strolled back and handed michael her book youre a stronger woman than i laura choosing work over hot unbridled sex michael grinned im going to like your book i hope you will count on it excuse me a minute he tugged laura into his arms lowered his head and kissed her until every ounce of blood in her head drained to her feet and tingled he let her go and nipped lightly at her chin youre still holding the rain check sugar nice to meet you melissa yeah staring after him melissa rubbed a hand over her heart i believe in quality descriptive and wellcrafted writing she began and all i can think of to say now is wow she blew out a breath wow yeah laura made an effort to find the top of her head it had to be spinning somewhere close by i um its okay take a minute im going to book on those checks for you right away melissa tucked her tongue in her cheek appreciate it excuse me as laura struggled not to stagger to the door melissa indulged in a long sigh god i love this business chapter twelve it was after ten when laura turned up the drive to templeton house she had the good solid tired of accomplishing a job well the kind of tired she realized as she let herself in the house that didnt yearn for sleep still she reminded herself she had another full day coming up starting in just over nine hours what she needed was a nice hot bath and bed after checking in on her daughters and finding them both deeply asleep she drew that bath filled it lavishly with fragrant salts and bubbles and sank in with a long sigh she stretched out gazed up through the tiny skylight over the tub and dreamed over the stars her life was clicking back into gear she thought she had her daughter back there were bound to be some bumps along the way and she would negotiate them but everything had been so blissfully normal that morning on the drive to school her family was in order her parents busily enjoying their lives and their work josh and margo doting on their new baby kate and byron anticipating theirs her job at the hotel was fulfilling and made her feel part of the templeton team again and the shop she smiled and smoothed frothy bubbles down her leg the shop was an exciting unexpected fantasy that brought so much pleasure so many surprises as busy as shed been throughout the day shed missed swinging in ringing up sales talking to customers just being with kate and margo she would manage a few hours the next afternoon barring any calamity then again shed begun to enjoy even to anticipate certain kinds of calamity they offered her the challenge of finding the right answer the satisfaction of knowing that she could find the solution inside herself like a book she mused a whole new chapter of her life was opening up she was going to enjoy it she let the water drain stepped out of the deep oversized tub toweled off slowly and creamed her skin dreamily after removing the pins from her hair and placing them in the little silver box where she kept them she brushed until the curls bounced and shone it wasnt until she was dressing again and caught herself humming that she fully realized she wasnt going to bed or not alone shocked she stared at the reflection in the mirror the woman there simply dressed in silk slacks and blouse stared back shed been preparing for a man she realized the bath the lotions the scents shed been preparing for michael but now she was thinking again and she wasnt sure she could go through with it he wanted her but he didnt know her he didnt know what she wanted needed she wasnt certain herself so how could he be she didnt know how to offer herself to a man not in reality in dreams perhaps where everything was slow and misty but in the clear dark where there were movements and consequences she wasnt sure once she had offered herself to another man in another life and it hadnt been enough to do so again and fail again would destroy her coward she thought closing her eyes was she going to remain alone and celibate for the rest of her life because she hadnt succeeded as a wife and therefore as a lover if he wanted her she wanted to be taken tonight she wanted him to give her no choice tonight she rushed downstairs quickly before she could change her mind and the night was thrilling windswept full of sound and scent she ran through it as women had for centuries toward fate toward a man and lost her nerve at the base of the steps his lights were on she had only to climb up that one short flight of wooden stairs and knock on the door he would know and would take she would she promised herself as she crossed her hands over her speeding heart as soon as she had composed herself as soon as the giddiness faded a little she went into the stables instead moving down the line of drowsy horses she hadnt seen the foal since its birth she reminded herself she only wanted to look to admire then she would go up and knock at the stall door she studied the mother and child the foal lay curled on the hay the mare standing slacklegged beside her i miss having a baby who needs me she murmured they trust you to take care of them its the most incredible feeling isnt it knowing that came from you she indulged herself another moment stroking the mares head when it was offered then she turned and he was there all in black he was like a shadow that became real in a blink she stepped back i was i hadnt seen the foal since i didnt mean to disturb you youve been disturbing me for a long time longer than i realized his gaze holding hers he stepped forward i saw you running across the lawn in the starlight you looked like something out of a dream but youre not are you no she retreated again nerves shattered i should go i she couldnt take her eyes off his as he came closer boxed her against the stall door i should go pretty laura templeton he murmured you always look so polished so perfect nothing out of place he skimmed a finger over the soft lapel of her blouse dipped a finger in the vee and watched her eyes go dark makes a man like me want to muss you up get right under that polish and find out just who the hell you are he closed his hands over her breasts calloused hands over thin silk felt her shudder who the hell are you laura why are you here her heart was pounding against his palm so violently that she wondered it didnt simply leap out into his hand i came to see the foal liar he pressed her back against the wood and when the door gave she would have stumbled if he hadnt held her i bet he never mussed you up did he always polite always the gentleman you wont get that from me i she was panicked now thrilled terrified her gaze darted from his as hay crackled under her feet the stall was empty but for them she was alone with him trapped i dont know how to do this i do i can make you stay or i can make you run i wonder which itll be but you came to me so itll be my way he fisted his hands on the opening of her blouse shredded it in one quick shocking yank stay or run his eyes were dark demanding focused on hers cool air shivered over her bare skin if you stay youre mine my way stay or run he gripped her hair yanked her head back and watched her waited stay he murmured then crushed his mouth to hers and ravished speed and desperation she was pummeled by both as he dragged her down into the hay and branded her lips her throat her breasts she cried out when his teeth closed over her lancing heat from breast to loins until her body was a bucking writhing mass of sensation the asking was over she knew the choice was made now he would take as he had in the dreams that haunted her at night rough and fast and mercilessly and she wanted that the painful spin out of control the hard tough impatient hands scraping her skin the relentless almost brutal mouth feeding on her she found his flesh hot smooth the hay beneath her was prickly abrading her skin and adding one more reeling sensation the sound of her clothes tearing under his frantic hands hands that streaked back to squeeze and probe and possess was unreasonably erotic she could hear herself cry out hear her own short harsh panting each gasp of shock and pleasure helpless as a raft on a stormtossed sea she rolled thrashed and gave herself over to fate every time her hands gripped him those neat ladys nails biting in his blood swam each time she whimpered moaned his pulses whipped the first time her body convulsed and his name his name burst like a sob through her lips his head reeled he could see every fresh shock in her eyes those clouded gray storms that widened unfocused closed on a throaty moan no one had given her this of that he could be sure no one had taken her where he would take her of all the things shed been given all the places shed traveled in her privileged life this was new though some part of him deeply buried hurt that this was all he could offer he would make it enough for tonight for tonight and as long as it lasted he would and could be to her what no one had ever been he could feel every dark flash of new pleasure sing through her body and explode inside his own he could hear her shocked gasps and swallow them he could take more still more and make her arch violently against him in desperate greed and that delicate ivory skin so smooth so fragrant dewed with the clean sweat of good sex his hands so strong so quick so powerful they cupped her bruised destroyed her own were lost in his hair dragging him down until his mouth found hers again until she could answer that hard vicious kiss with one of her own his body was so tight so relentlessly male muscles bunching under her hands ridges of old scars sliding under her questing fingers his skin was hot burning and bloomed damp when she bit desperately at his shoulder the air was ripe thick and tasted of him on each gulping breath she took whatever he did to her she welcomed whatever he demanded she gave he lifted her hips high and his eyes burned into hers with one violent thrust he was inside her hilt deep the hands shed gripped on his arms slid limply to the hay as her body simply erupted stay with me laura his fingers dug into her flesh and he began to move stay with me what choice did she have she was locked trapped steeped her breathing was slow now shallow her vision misted at the edges but she moved with him stroke now for stroke he shuddered when she came when she closed around him like a damp fist and he fought a vicious war with himself not to follow not yet there was more even as the blood roared like the sea in his head he wanted more and so he dragged her up until her legs locked around him until her body flowed back so fluidly it might have been made of water worked her until her new frenzy was met matched until her head dropped on his shoulder then and then only he buried his face in her hair and let himself fall his weight pinned her to the floor it was an odd and drugging feeling having a mans full weight on her again and it was a triumphant feeling to know that he was incapable of moving that he was as dazed as sated as she she didnt have to doubt it shed seen his eyes felt his hands heard the gritty groan sound in his throat he had been caught trembling on that stunning moment when he had lost himself and come inside her there in the darkened stables with the sweet smell of hay and horses her clothes in tatters and her blood singing she felt like a woman again not like a mother a friend a responsible member of society like a woman she didnt want to fumble now to begin stuttering out foolish truths that it had never been this way before that she hadnt known it could be better she thought for both of them to keep it light so she smiled found the strength to lift her hand and stroke his hair looks like i redeemed that rain check his chuckle tickled her throat what was your name again sugar gathering his reserves he rolled lazily over pulling her with him until she was sprawled on his chest her smile was both smug and sleepy there was hay in her hair god youre pretty such a pretty little thing the proper laura templeton with the surprising and flexible steam engine of a body whod have thought it she certainly hadnt and she raised a brow i cant say that i or it has ever been described quite that way before her lips quirked i think i like it since youre in such a good mood why dont you tell me now why you came here tonight to see the foal fastidiously she picked hay out of his hair then shifted her gaze back to his on the way to you you knew id come i was counting on it if you hadnt id have had to breach the castle walls and drag you out i dont know how much longer i could have done without you michael moved she laid her hand on his cheek would you have ravished me sugar i did ravish you its the first time anyone has she waited a beat watched her own finger trace down his throat i hope it wont be the last i wasnt looking for one quick romp in the hay satisfied with that she nodded smoothed his hair again then ill come back she lowered her mouth to his lingered over it i should go now he merely shifted their positions pinned her again laura you dont really think im going to turn you loose tonight she felt the quick hitching thrill of being overpowered you arent no that roughpalmed hand slid up closed over her breast and his mouth became busy at her throat she arched under him shuddered out a sigh good still she hadnt meant to stay until morning hadnt meant to fall into twilight sleep in a pile of hay with her body curled around his hadnt realized she would awake fully aroused with his mouth on hers and his hands his hands michael and when her eyes fluttered open he slid slow and deep inside her moved inside her with long lazy strokes that had dreams misting over reality he watched her face that lovely flush from sleep and sex that warmed her cheeks the eyes smoky and dazed the mouth swollen from his that trembled on each breath they would look at each other now in the light see as they took each other up with a rhythm soft and silky hay motes fluttered in the fragile light of morning danced in the quiet air night birds gave way to the lark in the stables horses began to stir cats stretched and hunted up sunbeams and her hands reached for him cupped his face guided his mouth once again to hers as they gently slid over michael she said again i cant keep my hands off you i dont want you to but hed seen bruises on that delicate skin as shed slept i was rough with you last night did i forget to thank you for it he lifted his head grinned i guess screaming my name ten or twelve times was thanks enough well then she pushed his hair back from his face and her eyes were sober i dont ever want to be treated like some fragile piece of glass not ever again so if i want to break out the cuffs and whips youre game her mouth fell open in speechless shock i i im kidding christ what a package she was he thought on a roar of laughter and all his on a spurt of delight he got to his feet and picked her up at least until weve established trust you dont really i mean i dont think i could or would like when he laughed so hard he nearly dropped her she lifted her chin i dont care to be the butt of your sick joke it wasnt that sick and sugar youve got a firstclass butt he planted a loud smacking kiss on her mouth but since i doubt you want to stroll back to the house showing it off lets go get you some clothes id appreciate it if you would what are you doing she all but squeaked it as he carried her out of the stall taking you upstairs to get you something to put on you cant just cart me outside this way im naked were naked michael i mean it oh my god sunlight and cool morning air slapped her as he stepped through the stable door its early he said easily no ones around yet were naked it was all she could say as he started up the stairs were standing outside naked looks like its going to be a hell of a day too you got anything on for tonight i didnt he understand that they were standing on his little porch in the full light of day buck naked get me inside chilly im working on it he shifted her and managed the doorknob the insult she fumed the insensitivity the outrageousness of it put me down sure he set her obligingly on her feet and waited for the show to begin she didnt disappoint him are you out of your mind what if one of the girls had looked out the window and seen us its not even six in the morning do they usually stare out the window at dawn with binoculars of course not thats hardly the point i wont be hauled around that way because you in your warped brain find it amusing now get me a shirt he ran his tongue around his teeth as he considered her even with hay in her hair and flushed head to toe with embarrassment and temper she managed to be dignified it was fascinating sugar youre getting me stirred up again and i dont think we have time for another round you peasant barbarian with an effort she reined in it was impossible to have a reasonable argument under the circumstances id like to borrow some clothes please what the hell itll only take a few minutes michael she jerked back stunned when she saw the intention in his eyes michael i will not be dragged to the floor kissed into mindless submission driven to bonesplitting climax oh god she fisted her hands on the rug and let herself be ravished it took more than a few minutes so that laura found herself sneaking like a thief into her own house if she could just get upstairs she thought easing open a side door and creeping into the parlor into her room her children would be waking for school any minute her children wincing carrying her shoes she tiptoed into the hall was she out of her mind how could she possibly explain herself if miss laura if the worst happened laura thought fatalistically and turned to face a shocked ann sullivan annie i was just ah out early walking very slowly ann continued down the stairs she had been widowed for more than twentyfive years but she knew the look of a woman whod spent the night in a mans arms youre wearing a mans shirt she said stiffly and theres hay in your hair ah clearing her throat laura reached up and plucked out a bent shaft yes thats true i was out as i said and youve never been able to lie your way out of an open door ann stopped at the base of the stairs facing down her quarry very much like a mother about to lecture a reckless child with a mixture of amusement and apprehension laura recognized the signs annie youve been down at the stables rolling around in the hay with that sharpeyed womanizing michael fury yes ive been down at the stables laura said shrugging on her cloak of dignity yes ive been with michael and im a grown woman with the sense of a peanut what were you thinking of ann continued poking out a finger a woman like you wrestling in a hayloft with the likes of him because where she loved she had patience lauras voice was calm i imagine you know very well what i was thinking of whatever you think of him or of my sense the fact remains that im thirty years old annie he wanted me i wanted him and in all of my life all of it no one has ever ever made me feel the way he did a moments pleasure for a moments pleasure laura nodded if that was all it amounted to she swore she would go to her grave grateful i was married ten years and never knew what it was like to be pleasured or i hope to pleasure a man like that and im sorry you disapprove anns face pokered up its not my place to disapprove oh dont give me that dignifiedhousekeepertomistress routine annie its years too late with a sigh she laid a hand over the rigid one with which ann gripped the newel post i know how much you care i know that everything you say you say out of concern and love but even that cant change the way i feel or what i need and you think you need michael fury no i know i do i havent decided what to do about it or where i want to go from here but i do know that i fully intend to have a great many moments of pleasure whatever the cost yes for once in my life the hell with the cost i need to shower she started up the stairs paused turned i dont want you going down there badgering michael over this annie that is not your place or anyone elses ann inclined her head kept it lowered until she heard laura close the door to her room perhaps it wasnt her place to speak to michael fury but she knew her duty and she would do it without hesitation she walked down the hall and into the library the call to france wouldnt take long then they would see she thought brooding out the window they would see id like to speak with mr or mrs templeton if you please its ann sullivan the housekeeper of templeton house in the stables in the hay all night in the secondfloor kitchen of pretenses kate swiveled on the stool and gaped the tenminute afternoon break was a great deal more interesting than shed expected you why is that so shocking ignoring her tea laura drummed her fingers on the counter im human arent i not some sort of windup doll pal it sounds like you were pretty wound up to me and im not shocked exactly i mean i wouldnt have imagined bouncing on the hay was your style but hey whatever works she grinned and sampled one of the cookies laura had picked up at the bakery and i take it that it worked just fine mollified laura took a cookie herself i she said smugly was an animal with a snort kate raised one of lauras arms over their heads way to go champ so now about the details i cant well maybe no the gleam in her eye matched kates no come on just one detail then one little detail of lauras wild night she laughed shook her head nibbled on her lip god knew she could tell kate or margo anything and it had been so rare lately for her to be able to share something so wonderful and reckless fastidiously she brushed crumbs off the counter he ripped my clothes off metaphorically or literally literally just tore them to shreds just she pressed a hand to her stomach god god kate echoed fanning a hand in front of her face thats it laura scooted off the stool and dumped her cold tea into the sink i cant do this it feels like high school pal youve graduated and your cap and gown are in tatters congratulations she cocked her head as laura rinsed out her cup she knew the woman who carefully washed out china as well as she knew herself are you in love with him laura watched the water run and drain i dont know love this kind of love isnt as simple as i once thought it was im afraid i could be and i dont want to complicate everything you once told me that love just happened couldnt be planned kate pointed out i found out you were right with care she set the cup to drain shed already given kates question a great deal of thought knowing it would be asked by those who cared the most if it does happen ill deal with it theres so much more to him than i ever imagined and every time i see one of those pieces i didnt know was there fall into place im more involved laura dried her hands and turned back to kate im not going to get dreamyeyed this time around or want more than someones capable of giving im just going to enjoy it is that going to work for you the way i feel this afternoon its working perfectly feeling loose she stretched her arms high absolutely perfectly glad to see you two are enjoying yourselves margo stepped into the doorway and scowled one of you was supposed to relieve me remember i unlike my feckless partners havent had a break in four hours sorry laura dropped her arms ill go no ill go kate hopped off the stool itll give you a chance to fill margo in fill me in on what michael screwed lauras brains out last night in a horse stall gracefully margo fluffed her hair while laura flushed really ripped her clothes off kate added as she headed out the door ill leave laura to fill in the details on a long hum margo settled herself on one of the padded ice cream chairs crossed her long shapely legs pour me some tea would you laura im whipped automatically laura poured a cup brought it to the table want a cookie dont mind if i do margo debated them selected nibbled now sit your butt down and start filling in those details and dont worry about being too specific chapter thirteen whistling between his teeth michael sent zip into a raging gallop bursting out of the woods into the sun like a flaming fire the little demon could run michael thought hed be sorry to lose him but the offer that had come in that morning closed the deal in a matter of hours the speedy little colt would be on his way to utah going to have some fun with the fillies up there kid and breed some champs and the asking price meant that michael could close the deal hed been negotiating for a particularly finelooking palomino mare and her doeeyed foal the mare was ornery he mused had twice tried to kick him and her handler during the inspection michael liked her the better for it and for the fact that shed bred such a tough little foal a foal he was already planning to raise for stud couple more years michael thought the new colt would cover twenty mares and at four his full complement of sixty theyd do fine together he decided that snippy palomino mare and the energetic little buckskin shed birthed would help him start a new phase of his business within two years he projected fury ranch was going to mean something something more than livelihood and survival it was going to mean quality and that michael thought as zip tore around the stables was something hed lived most of his life without it would have been impossible and worse embarrassing for him to explain to anyone that he had always wanted quality not just for what he had or what he built but for what he was hed always wanted to come from something to be something and he had come from nothing that hed had to face couldnt be changed nor could he change the fact that it left a sore spot inside him that was never really eased hed gone years telling himself it didnt matter what his parents had been how hed grown up or how hed lived but it did matter now more than ever he knew it mattered there was a woman in his life who shouldnt have been there sooner or later he had no doubt shed see that for herself the insult of it and the inevitability made him push the colt for more speed not for a minute would he have admitted that he was racing away rather than toward nor would he admit even to himself that his emotions had been in turmoil from the moment hed stepped inside the stables last night and found her as if she was meant to be there with him for him as if he could take and hold maybe even deserve something as lovely and fine and vital as laura and be for her what she could be for him the hell with that michael told himself squinting into the sunlight as the colt flew over the ground no way he was going to start fashioning pretty little dreams about a life with laura if he was one thing he was a realist his time with her was temporary and he would damn well pack as much into it as he could while it lasted he was already into the run the colt bunched for the leap when michael spotted the figure loitering at the paddock they sailed over the fence spewed up dirt and dust thats a hell of a horse byron called out as michael trotted to him he is bending michael slapped zips neck then dismounted sold him today guy in utah after uncinching the saddle michael hung it over the fence wants to breed for speed hell get it byron leaned over patted the colts sleek throat isnt even winded nope hell tire his rider out first im surprised youre not using him for stud yourself hes prime yeah hes prime but i have more foundation to build before i add a stud couple more years he thought picturing the foal again and well both be ready right now its horse trading and building on the investment youve got a good start that walker there byron gestured what are you asking max michael glanced around watched the horse swish his tail id sell my own mother first he held up his hand and max walked over glad to see me max max peeled back his lips so his teeth showed and split the air with a horsey laugh give us a kiss then max nibbled affectionately on michaels chin and being nobodys fool snuffed at his pockets true love is never enough want one a kiss from your horse or a carrot whichever ill pass on both thanks but he stroked maxs mane as the horse crunched the carrot you got some finelooking stock here you in the market i told myself i wasnt especially with the baby coming he looked longingly at the mare nursing her foal shit this takes me back michael picked up a dandy brush and began to groom zip what are you about twoten twelve byron said absently twotwelve that bay gelding with the two front socks hed carry you byron studied the bay noted the lines the flashy white blaze handsome bastard isnt he good saddle horse well mannered but no pussy needs a firm hand the right hand michael tucked his tongue in his cheek as he continued to work make you a good deal seeing as youre related to josh and married to one of my favorite people i didnt come by to horsetrade no placidly michael leaned against zip lifted a hoof to pick it out why then i was in the neighborhood more or less and thought you might want to come by on saturday night poker im usually up for a game then he paused narrowed his eyes this isnt going to be one of those enlightened evenings with women asking if a straight beats a flush kate would knock you on your ass for that comment but byron grinned no its purely sexist men only then im in thanks maybe ill win that bay from you keep dreaming de witt good heart room he murmured about sixteen hands isnt he michael smothered a grin continued to clean his mounts hooves about just turned four his sire was a walker his dam a darkeyed floozy from baton rouge shit he was sunk you stable yep here for now then at my place when its finished should be ready to start construction in a couple weeks lets take a closer look in his saville row suit and magli shoes byron climbed into the paddock ive heard you southern boys are cardsharps and horse thieves michael commented as they strolled companionably toward the bay you heard right how long was she going to make him wait michael paced the floor contemplated the bottle of wine on the counter it made him scratch his head hed actually gone out and bought wine not his usual style but hed figured sex in a horse stall wasnt lauras usual either the least he could do was offer her a civilized drink before he jumped her again which was just what he wanted to do if she ever got there of course she was coming hed reminded himself of that half a dozen times over the last hour the way it had been between them the night before she had to be just as eager for a repeat performance shed have thought of him during the day countless times the way hed thought of her the way he would have sworn hed smelled her every time he took a breath the way hed caught himself going off into some brainless trance because he could see her face in his head or hear her voice or want her just want her when had he ever wanted anything like this once hed wanted escape and hed gotten it hed wanted danger and risk and reckless adventure and hed gotten that too and when hed wanted peace a life he could look at with some measure of pride hed gone out and gotten that as well but did he have laura was she going to slip silkily through his fingers before hed gotten a good grip or before hed figured out what the hell to do with her about her she was out of his league and knowing it pissed him off made him determined to drag her to equal ground sex was a great equalizer and he had her there for now furious with himself for niggling at what shouldnt have been a problem he poured a glass of the wine he sniffed it shrugged downed it when in rome fury but he set the glass aside and began to pace again prowling back and forth across the length of the room like a cat prowling the confines of a cage hed caught a glimpse of ann that afternoon when he supervised the transfer of the colt from the bullets she shot out of her eyes he had the feeling that laura hadnt managed to get past her that morning it made him grin to think of it the elegant lady of the house sneaking in at dawn in a baggy shirt and jeans caught by the everpresent coldeyed housekeeper maybe sullivan had locked laura in his grin vanished as the idea popped into his head maybe she had laura trapped inside refusing to let her out maybe she was and maybe he should get a grip on himself he decided the hell with it he headed for the door he was going after her when he yanked it open laura jumped back a full step pressed a hand to her throat you scared the life out of me sorry i was about to rescue you from the dungeon oh she smiled puzzled were you but you seemed to have managed it on your own i couldnt come any sooner weve been having a little chaos my parents have decided to come out for a quick visit theyll be here in a couple of days and the girls were so excited i had a hard time getting them to bed then we had to you dont have to explain to me just come here he pulled her close and released a portion of frustrated need in one rough kiss pressing her back against the doorjamb he fisted his hands in her hair and released more the same she thought wrapping herself around him the same heat the same rash the same wonder when she could breathe again she kept her clenched hands on his shirt i thought what but she shook her head nothing smiling she lifted her hands to frame his face hello michael hello laura he circled her inside closed the door with his boot i was going to offer you some wine oh thank you that would be nice but its going to have to wait he swung her into his arms oh thats even nicer he did bring her a glass when she was sitting on his rumpled bed wearing his shirt not having what he considered her misplaced sense of modesty he sat across from her naked knee to knee im kind of celebrating he told her and tapped the glasses together she felt so loose she was certain she could slide right into the sheets what are you kind of celebrating i sold two horses today one to your brotherinlaw byron surprised she sipped recognized the rich tang of a good templeton chardonnay funny kate never mentioned that they were buying a horse i guess he hadnt told her yet oh uhoh does kate have a problem with horses no but its quite a commitment im surprised they didnt discuss it first im sure she will be too id say he can handle her its not a matter of handling one way or the other marriage is a partnership and decisions require discussion and mutual agreement and what are you grinning at you look cute sitting there all mussed up from sex and lecturing me on relationship ethics i wasnt lecturing she took a small cool sip from her glass i was simply stating dont you believe in relationship ethics yep his hand wandered up her thigh but i figure like in any partnership sometimes one end makes a decision on its own and ethics get bent a little i like this little birthmark way up here his fingers skimmed high on her thigh over a small crescent shape looks like a moon sexier than a tattoo youre trying to distract me doesnt take much effort but he trailed his finger back down to her knee i dont want to see the guy get popped by his wife he fell for the horse and maybe i gave him a little push he moved his shoulders if kate has a problem we can lose the deal laura tilted her head and then in your opinion kate would be a shrew and byron a milquetoast i was thinking wuss actually amused he straightened her leg so that he could lift her knee and kiss it did you always talk everything over nice and civilized with ridgeway no that was part of the problem i did what i was told and behaved like a proper dutiful and spineless wife sorry annoyed with himself for the need to pry open that door to her life he gave her knee a quick squeeze bad question no it wasnt she shifted a little leaning back on the pillows propped on the iron headboard i learned from it i learned i wont ever be spineless again or ineffectual or quietly desperate she tapped her fingers against the glass as she put into words what had been in her heart what he did i let him do which makes it as much my fault as his im only sorry it took finding him in bed with another woman to force me to fix my life youre happy now yes and grateful she smiled again grateful to you too his thumb skimmed around to rub the back of her knee for for helping me realize i have a sex drive appreciating her he leaned up nipping her lips with his as he set his glass on the table beside the bed you had problems with that im not having them now maybe i should check just to be sure but before she could circle him into her arms he slipped back i think ill start down here he murmured and lifted her foot youre not going to oh her head fell back as his teeth and tongue went to work they do reflexology in the spa at the resort she murmured as he bombarded all manner of tiny sensitive nerves it never felt like this youre not going to start fantasizing that im viktor the massage boy are you she laughed moaned shuddered no the realitys just jesus she dropped her glass splattering wine over herself and the sheets oh im sorry let me no you dont he gave her a gentle shove that sent her weakly back onto the pillows just stay where you are until i finish he scraped his teeth over her ankle things were a little rushed before i think i skimmed over some of the finer points he pressed the heel of his hand lightly against her had her hips rising i suggest you hang on sugar im going to take you for a long hard ride it was like being assaulted on all sides inside and out mind and body she could do nothing but absorb react experience he worked his way up as if she were a meal to be savored course by course the lights he left burning blazed too bright burned her eyes even when she closed them the air breezy through the open windows was suddenly too thick so that each breath she took was a gasp her skin no longer cool pulsed with the beat of blood beneath and with the skim of hands and mouth the long muscles in her thighs quivered as he cruised over them and the sheets rustled at the bunch and flex of her hands shed never been tasted this way touched this way as if she were everything and all things and his mouth closed over her suddenly greedy rough and focused on that core of wet heat until she flew up like an arrow with the sharp edge of her own pleasure stabbing her he was mad for her now wild to see her pinned on the jagged peak of her own ecstasy her head was flung back her eyes blind her hands wrapped around the iron posts of the bed as if only that desperate grip kept her anchored and he was mad to drive her farther he used his hands until she bucked against him in frantic pleading rhythm watched her watched her until his name sobbed out of her until her hands lost their grip until her body went pliant as pooled wax she lay still wrecked unable to do more than moan when he lifted her enough to slip the shirt away from her shoulders youre beautiful ms templeton gold he touched his hand to her hair rose and her breast she trembled under his touch michael she opened heavy eyes saw the room spin i cant cant you gently now he lowered his head flicked his tongue over her nipple i wonder i know you didnt you havent she reached for him knowing she would find him hard and ready let me some other time he smiled though his blood had leaped when her fingers closed around him ill take a rain check lets just see if we can finish this the oldfashioned way this time he closed his mouth over her breast and sent the ache echoing down you do things inside me her breath began to hitch again that curl of new need began to spread and ache and throb you have no idea what you do inside me it was building again impossibly strong she could have wept he feasted on her breasts teeth and tongue hungry for the flavor of her that fragile and floral taste hed come to crave he took her hands wrapping them around the posts again keeping his clamped over hers the thought ran through her reeling head that they were both trapped both locked in both prisoners of this accepting she lifted her mouth to his linking there as well and met his fast desperate thrust then it was only blind speed blazing heat gasps and the animals song of flesh against flesh harder deeper until he was buried in her until still linked hands mouths sex they plunged later when blood had cooled and the air was quiet again she shifted his arm curled around her held i thought you were asleep she murmured was i have to go i cant sneak in the house at dawn every morning carrying my shoes little while more he was still half asleep and his voice was thick with it i wanna hold you her heart melted gently she brushed the hair back from his face wild untamed hair she thought devils hair dark and seductive only a little while she rested her head on his shoulder her hand on his heart but he was already asleep again so she lay there for a little while feeling his heart beat mrs williamson slid a stack of pancakes under michaels nose it seemed the least he could do was eat them she watched him take the first bite her arms folded over her breasts the best he said when i get my place back together im going to miss sneaking over here and having you feed me sure you dont want to marry me and come along you keep asking you might get surprised she topped off his coffee the boy had always had a raging appetite she reflected for all manner of things did you finish up that casserole i sent down i ate it bowl and all absently he reached down to scratch the kitten that wound hopefully through his legs and the pie and those cookies he grabbed her hand nibbling on it while she clucked at him if you were to see your way to making one of those chocolate cakes the one with the cream and the cherries black forest miss lauras favorite it is apparently they shared the same taste out of bed as well she probably wouldnt miss a piece or two of it well see about it she skimmed her hand through his hair tugged on the ponytail you need a decent haircut man your age wearing your hair like a hippie the last hippie emigrated to greenland in theres a small commune there where they still make love beads oh youre a smart one you are eat your breakfast ive got to see that those children are fed before they go off to school and miss laura she continued bustling back to the stove eats like a sparrow never takes the time to sit down and start the day with a decent meal just coffee she tells me well you cant fuel a body on coffee lauras body seemed fueled fine to him but he didnt think it wise to mention it mrs williamson might be fond of him but he didnt imagine shed approve of him luring the mistress into hot sweaty bouts of sex shes going to make herself sick like miss katie did last year michael stopped brooding looked up kate was sick an ulcer even the idea of it insulted her mrs williamson stopped flipping pancakes to turn around to him can you imagine that overdoing undereating overworrying until she was flat on her back well we took care of that right enough shes okay now she looks great fit and fine and expecting too kates pregnant the grin split michaels face no shit he winced when she sent him a narrowed look he remembered she didnt care for such language in her kitchen sorry well overlook it this time shes got herself healthy and happy our kate that man she married wont let her get away with that kind of nonsense theres a sensible man one who knows how to take care of a woman they look good together classy michael thought frowning down at his plate but then byron had grown up in southern comfort and kate was in every way that mattered a templeton they fit he added that they do its a good feeling to see miss kate happy and miss margo so nice and settled and whats miss laura got but those two angels to raise on her own she gestured with her spatula stopped for a breath its a good thing her parents are coming back for a time theres no one in the world straightens out a tangle like mr and mrs t when the door opened she closed her mouth not wanting to be taken for gossiping mrs williamson i oh hello michael laura looked as fresh as a rosebud in her neat pale yellow suit not at all like the woman who had sobbed out his name the night before unless you looked at the eyes hello laura mrs williamson took pity on a starving man blueberry pancakes the girls will be in heaven sit down miss laura and have a plate now no i cant just coffee please i was looking for annie she accepted the cup mrs williamson handed her ive got to go in early theres a problem at the office she looked at her watch i should be in the car already i cant find annie and i need to see if she can run the girls to school shes gone its her day for the farmers market oh laura pressed her fingers to her eyes i forgot then ill have to ill run them in busily rearranging her schedule laura blinked at him what ill run them to school i couldnt impose but its no problem and i dont think you have time to argue about it go on to work i think i can get two girls to school without permanent damage i didnt mean he was right she admitted with another glance at her watch she didnt have time to argue i appreciate it thanks its hornbecker academy if you take south to i know where it is he interrupted same place you went yes shed had no idea hed known where she went to school much less remembered it i really appreciate this michael im so late she set the coffee aside then stood flustered when he took her hand relax the hotels not going to collapse if youre late for a meeting no but my department might ali has to turn in her english composition this morning she has it i checked but you might want to remind her and kayla should go over her spelling words on the drive in she has a test ali can help her i said ill handle it yes but if youd make sure they take umbrellas ive set them out it may rain now he rose and forgetting he had an audience took her face in his hands and kissed her go away i she glanced over to where mrs williamson was by all appearances busy humming over her pancakes im going but they need to be reminded to feed the dog sometimes out because she apparently needed a boost he pulled her to the door go nag somebody else when she opened her mouth again he gave her a friendly slap on the butt to send her along how does anyone start a morning like that he wondered then turned and found mrs williamson eyeing him soberly he cursed but was wise enough to do it only mentally is it like that around here every day ignoring his question she stepped forward walked around him he thought he had a pretty good idea of what she was seeing a man who came in the back door because he didnt belong at the front one she stopped faced him pursed her lips i wondered if you had your eye on anything else around here besides my cooking because she had a way of making him want to shuffle his feet he tucked his hands in his pockets so so good she gave his cheek a brisk pat and was amused by the surprise on his face the boy she thought had never had a clue of his own worth so good for both of you and about time i say first time in her life that girls had a real man humbled speechless he shook his head when he found his voice again he took her hands mrs williamson you slay me i will if you break her heart but in the meantime you should be good for each other now sit down and finish your breakfast before its cold if youre going to handle those girls yourself this morning you need your fuel i love you i really do her face creased in a wide smile i know that boy i love you right back now sit down and eat theyll be down in a minute and chattering like magpies chapter fourteen michael fury had jumped off buildings fought in jungles weathered a typhoon at sea raced cars at high speed and at one time or another broken several major bones in his body hed been in bar fights spent the night in a cell where the artwork on the walls ran to anatomically exaggerated etchings of female organs he had killed men and loved women and he had he realized led a sheltered life he had never faced the perils and predicaments of getting two girls out of the house on a school day what do you mean you cant wear those shoes they dont go with my outfit his eyes narrowed as he studied alis floral skirt and pink sweater hadnt she been wearing some green thing a minute ago thats what you said the last time and it looks fine to me theyre just shoes in the way of every female since eve strapped on a fig leaf ali rolled her eyes theyre the wrong shoes i have to change them well hurry up jesus he muttered as she dashed back upstairs leaving kayla tugging on his hand i forgot how to spell bedlam allison she giggled at that no really is it lam or lem a he was pretty sure spelling homework wasnt exactly his strong point and if they didnt get moving he was going to be late meeting his contractor the backup with building permits had already put him behind now allison and her shoes allison im walking out the door with or without you in ten seconds sometimes mama says that too kayla informed him but she never does i will come on he tugged kayla to the door you cant go without her eyes wide kayla trotted beside him to his car mamas going to be mad if you do were going in the car come on how will ali get to school she can walk michael said grimly in whatever shoes shes picked out this time hed solved the crisis of kaylas broken barrette hadnt he and her hair looked okay to him tied back with the rubber band hed pulled out of his own hair he hadnt panicked when ali claimed to have misplaced her book bag but had found it himself under the kitchen table where shed dumped it during her breakfast hed remained the calm mediator when the two girls had fallen into a minor catfight over whose turn it was to feed the pets and he had not faltered when bongo had expressed his sorrow that his young mistresses were leaving him by peeing in the foyer no he had stood strong through all of that michael thought as he gunned the engine but he knew when he was being dicked around and he wasnt taking it impatience turned to smugness when he saw ali flying out of the house indignation flashed in her eyes as she pulled open the car door you were going without me thats right blondie get in not wanting him to see under the circumstances that the nickname delighted her she angled her chin theres only two seats where am i supposed to sit beside your sister but in now at the snapped order she moved fast squeezing beside kayla pouting dramatically when michael reached over to tug the seat belt around both of them she announced i dont think this is legal it was her best ladyofthemanor voice michael realized her mothers voice call a cop he muttered and started down the drive for the next fifteen minutes he was treated to a run of complaints shes pushing me shes taking all the room shes sitting on my skirt the muscle behind his eye began to twitch how did anyone anyone tolerate this every morning of their life i need to go over my words kayla wailed im having a test michael alis pushing her elbow in me again ali get a grip he blew away the hair that thanks to his gift to kayla danced in his eyes theres not enough room ali informed him loftily shes taking up the whole seat i am not you are too i am at the snarl issuing from the man beside them both girls lapsed into momentary silence satisfied michael took a calming breath what are the spelling words i cant remember i have them written down in my notebook the wail inched back into her voice if i dont get a hundred i dont get to play on the computer at free time so get the notebook out this as he should have known caused more complaints youre stepping all over my shoes youre getting them dirty kayla im going to i dont want to hear about those shoes blondie the twitch was back double time not a word about the shoes here are my words triumphant kayla waved the notebook conking him on the head in her enthusiasm well study them or something no ali reads them and i spell them and i have to use each one in a sentence i dont want to read them michael sent ali a narrow look want to walk oh all right with little grace she snatched the notebook theyre just baby words they are not youre just mad because tod likes marcie better than you he does not and i dont care anyway and you didnt learn your words because you were too busy drawing dumb pictures they are not dumb youre dumb because cut it out right now if i have to stop this car appalled he trailed off had he just said what he thought hed said dear christ he was forced to take several calming breaths allison just read the words im going to she sniffed peered down her nose at kaylas carefully written list committed committed she parroted the letters then bit her lip she fumbled for the sentence looked hopefully at michael michael fury innocently volunteering to drive two young girls to school has now been committed to an institution for the permanently insane it made ali laugh hes just being silly dont bet on it kid but he racked his brain to come up with an alternative the witness pointed accusingly at the man who had committed the crime hows that okay they ran through the rest with michael nearly crosseyed by the time he pulled through the gates of the academy his ancient porsche merged with shining mercedes sedate lincolns and snappy fourwheeldrives scram he said unhooking the seat belt im late youre supposed to say have a good day kayla reminded him yeah well have one then later michael she rolled her eyes now kiss us goodbye she pursed her lips planted one on him amused he peered over at ali ali doesnt want to kiss me shes still mad at me i am not she sniffed then graciously leaned over kayla and touched her lips to his cheek thank you for driving us to school it was my education he told her then watched them scurry up the granite steps with hordes of other children jesus laura he rested his aching head on the steering wheel how do you get through that every day without drinking heavy she could have told him it was all a matter of planning discipline and priorities and prayers for patience at the end of this particular day because the first three had crumbled in her hands she was doing a lot of praying could she have anticipated that two women from rival romance magazines would start a fistfight in the lobby she didnt think so could she have guessed that after their efforts to dispel the hairpulling teethsnapping namecalling furor two of her bell people would require stitches she doubted it she could have after the event predicted the arrival of the press the cameras the questions and the necessity for her to answer questions but she didnt have to like it things hadnt gone that much more smoothly when shed arrived late at pretenses to find kate in an uproar because margo had delved into her sacrosanct spreadsheets then there had been the customer who instead of watching the three children shed herded into the shop with her loitered in the wardrobe room while they ran rampant the result was a broken vase fingersmudged counters and frazzled nerves the woman left in a huff after being asked to watch her children and pay for the damages life was no more simple when she returned home ready to whimper and found herself faced with an upcoming science project the request to volunteer to chaperone a field trip to the aquarium and that parental terror long division it didnt perk up her mood to discover that bongo had expressed his adoration for her by burrowing into her closet and chewing three shoes each from a different pair and her parents were arriving the next day all right laura scrubbed her hands over her face after shed changed into slacks she would handle it homework was done bongo chastised and it was unlikely that templeton would be sued because a couple of women went ballistic in the lobby still she needed some air which would give her an opportunity to make certain that old joe had the garden up to speed that the paths had been swept and since shed forgotten to ask ann to see that the pool was vacuumed and readied for her mothers visit she would see to that herself rolling up her sleeves as she went she passed alis room she stopped a moment and smiled she heard both of her daughters inside chattering away over some recent movie heartthrob who wasnt yet old enough to shave they were giggling nothing could be really wrong with the world when her daughters were giggling she slipped out the side door knowing that ann would lecture her to leave the landscaping and pool to old joe and his grandson but laura knew that young joe was cramming for his final exams and it would take her ten well twenty minutes to put things right besides she enjoyed the mindless task of manually vacuuming the pool it gave her a chance to dream in the garden which she noted with pleasure was blooming beautifully old joes bursitis must have been behaving itself hed put in new beds of annuals filling in among the perennials with splashes of color and sweeps of shape the paths were swept clean the mulch damp from watering and raked smooth looks like were in business she said to the pup who trotted along with her shed had to forgive him for the shoe incident when he looked so ashamed and contritely licked her face now you sit and behave yourself willing to make amends bongo plopped on the skirt of the pool watching her over his shaggy paws out of eyes dazed with love of course laura thought if shed remembered to pick up a new droid the pool would be cleaned automatically all she had to do was remember to write it down when she went back in the house otherwise she was going to have to break down and buy one of those electronic pads like kate kept in her pocket at all times but it wasnt a problem to unwind the hoses from their tidy box in the pool shed or slip the attachments together she went about it mechanically daydreaming she would settle the kids for the night it was so good to have ali smile and mean it at their goodnight hug perhaps ali was disillusioned about her father but she felt better about herself that was what mattered most then she would go over the household accounts with annie laura mused things were looking up there as well her dual incomes and the interest on the investments kate had made for her were holding them above water by lauras calculations in another six months or so they might actually be able to swim a few laps so she wouldnt sell any more of her jewelry unless absolutely necessary she wouldnt have to duck and dodge questions from her parents or josh and maybe just maybe shed be able to juggle funds to buy that horse for ali after all shed take a close look at her own books later or tomorrow she mused thinking of michael she wanted to go to him again tonight to forget everything but being feeling he did that for her made her feel like the center of the universe when he made love to her shed always dreamed of a man who would think of nothing but her when she was in his arms who would lose himself in her as she lost herself in him of knowing that he was so focused on her when he touched her that there was room for nothing else in his mind or heart oh she did wish she knew his heart that was her problem she admitted running the pole smoothly through the water she wanted that foolishly romantic love shed dreamed of as a girl seraphinas love she thought with a quiet laugh the kind a woman would die for well she couldnt afford to be dewyeyed enough to hurl herself off a cliff for anyone she had children to raise a house to run and a career a surprisingly interesting career to maintain so she would happily settle for whatever she and michael had between them and be grateful for it more than grateful she thought tonight in bed when he put his hands on her again those impatient roughpalmed hands that took whatever they wanted and made her wild with need the way he murmured her name softly deeply when he slid into her to mate what the hell are you doing the pole nearly slipped out of her hands at the sharp tone her head jerked up and there was her lover scowling standing spreadlegged hands in his pockets with his hair loose and flowing fighting against a reckless urge to leap on him and tear in she tilted her head why im mixing a soufflé what does it look like why the hell are you doing that yourself he was beside her in two angry strides pulling the pole away dont you have servants to do this actually no i let the pool boy go a couple of years ago when i learned that candy was using him for her personal maintenance as well as her pool i found it awkward he wasnt going to smile or even smirk coming across her like this seeing her laboring over some ridiculous menial chore after putting in a full day burned him then hire another one im afraid it doesnt fit into the scheme of things just now in any case im perfectly capable of doing it myself taking a closer look she brushed at his hair you seem a little frazzled michael rough day hed been in a pisser of a mood since his contractor had estimated it would be six months before the rebuilding was completed there had been a lot of blahblah about permits inspections zoning but the upshot was that he was going to be lauras tenant for a great deal longer than hed anticipated he didnt want to be her tenant to hand over a rent check every month it wasnt the money he thought fuming it was the it was awkward ive had better he nudged her aside and began to run the vacuum himself but were not talking about me you cant raise two kids hold down two jobs and deal with this sort of nonsense too why dont you just close the damn pool because i enjoy swimming and there are a lot of women who do a great deal more than i do and manage very well theyre not you which said it all in his mind no they dont have a beautiful home that no one would ever take from them and they dont necessarily have a job that theyre in no danger of jeopardizing if they need to flex their schedule insulted she fought with him over the pole i am not the pampered princess you seem to think im a she hissed tugged capable intelligent woman who can run her life very well im sick and tired of people patting me on the head and saying poor laura behind my back she yanked swore i am not poor laura and i can clean my own goddamn pool give me back the stupid pole no it had calmed him considerably to see her temper flare it wasnt much of one as far as he could see but there was potential in those stormy eyes flushed cheeks gritted teeth keep messing with me sugar and ill toss you in its a little cool for a dip this evening fine do it yourself youre a man after all and men are so much more capable of doing mindless chores but i didnt ask for your help nor do i need it nor do i need your sterling advice or your unsolicited criticism on how i handle my life thats telling me he said equably my hands are starting to shake her eyes narrowed into slits you too could be taking a dip interesting he thought did she actually have a physical temper in there is that so you want to try to take me down if i did youd be treading water in oh no bongo no insults paled when she caught sight of the pup busily digging up the newly planted pansies stop that stop that right now she dashed across the pool skirt snatched up the pup and frowned at his dirt and mulchsmeared nose how could you didnt i tell you no its bad youre not to dig in the flowers when she set him down to survey the damage bongo cheerfully leaped into the mess and began digging again i said no stop it why dont you listen to me because he knows youre a pushover bongo at michaels voice the pup lifted his head and grinned sheepishly michael could almost hear the sentiment well gee mick just having a little fun here michael snapped his finger pointed and bongo padded out shook himself and sat politely torn between disgust and admiration laura hissed between her teeth how do you get him to do that its a gift thats just great disgust won she dragged her hands through her hair i cant control a fivepound puppy just takes practice and patience well i dont have time to practice now she was down on her knees in a flash salvaging bedding plants and im out of patience old joe is going to kill me for this laura though it seemed obvious to point it out michael crouched and pointed it out anyway he works for you a lot you know she muttered desperately smoothing upturned mulch with her bare hands if i so much as sniff an undesignated rose in his garden he she broke off scowling dont just sit there help me i thought you didnt need any help shut up michael she brushed a hand over her cheek smeared it with garden dirt just shut up and save these pansies before bongo and i both end up in the pound since you ask so nice he shoved roots back into soil and heard her let out a long keening moan not like that for lords sake youre not planting redwoods have a little delicacy sorry its my first day on the job he shook his head as she shifted and knelt in the dirt in a way that was sure to send her trim pastel slacks into the rag heap and all he thought to save the sensibilities of an ancient gardener you run scared of the rest of your staff too damn right most of them have been here longer than i have this could work her hands coated now with black soil smoothed and patted youll hardly be able to tell when im done here but who am i fooling he can tell if you pluck a spray of crabgrass which is fine as long as youve asked first its looking fine to me like youd know a pansy from a geranium she muttered now youre getting nasty youve got something casually he swiped his hand over her cheek adding a fresh layer of dirt there and here you need a little to even out the look i suppose you think thats funny struggling for dignity she brushed at her face and only succeeded in making it worse no he picked up a handful of damp pine mulch and dropped it onto her hair thats funny a pity i dont have your raucous sense of humor but let me try she rubbed both of her filthy hands over his shirt there im dying from laughter now he glanced down at his shirt hed just washed the damn thing now youve done it he said quietly the tone warned her not to inch back not to bother with reason and excuses but to run she sprang to her feet sending the dog into frantically joyful barks she managed two sprinting yards before he snagged her around the waist and lifted her off her feet you started it she managed between choked laughs uhhuh so im obliged to finish it ill have your shirt cleaned whoops she watched the world revolve as he flipped her over into his arms why mr fury youre so masterful so strong so what are you doing amusement turned to panic as she caught a glimpse of his direction and realized his intention michael this isnt funny now just my raucous sense of humor again he told her as he strode toward the edge of the pool dont now i mean it michael in selfdefense she locked her arms around his neck im covered with dirt and its chilly and ive just cleaned the pool just look at the way it sparkles too controlling her frantic wiggling he toed off his shoes looks so pretty in the twilight doesnt it i will make you pay she vowed i swear i will make you pay if you dare hold your breath he suggested and jumped in but she was shrieking when she hit the water swallowed it came up choking you fool you idiot you she swallowed more when he pushed her head under what he hadnt counted on was that laura templeton had been captain of her swim team had won a drawer full of medals and had more than once successfully defended herself against a big brothers bullying while he treaded water and roared with laughter she nipped fluidly between his legs grabbed hold where a man was most vulnerable and squeezed she could hear the muffled echo of his yelp smiled grimly and yanked downward streaking away she broke the surface and waited smugly for him to wheeze out breaths and flail toward the side now that she said slicking back her dripping hair was funny he had his breath back mostly and eyed her narrowly want to fight dirty sugar this is my element michael youre in over your head think so hed done more than a few water stunts in his day he pushed off the side and pursued she was faster than hed given her credit for and slicker he knew when he was being taunted the way she nipped just out of reach in a dive for the bottom the fluidity with which she changed direction and dodged they surfaced again watching each other over the lapping water wet jeans are constricting she cocked her head if you need an excuse she snagged one of her shoes as it floated by sighed four pair in one day has to be a record philosophically she planted her feet and stood the water streamed off her glued the thin material of her blouse to the high full curve of breast to the narrow torso and subtle flare of hip in the shadowed light her dripping hair curled wildly and glowed like wet gold now you are playing dirty he murmured pouring the water out of her shoe she looked over at him her hand remained aloft her eyes on his as he slowly skimmed through the water toward her as he stood he slid his hands over her thighs hips sides and left them molded to her breasts michael the shoe dropped out of her hand and plopped into the water we cant im just going to kiss you his hands slipped wetly to her back down to cup her bottom as he eased back until they were floating again and touch you and drive us both a little crazy oh her head was already spinning as his teeth caught her lip tugged well if thats all she wrapped herself around him let him take her through the cool water it was her mouth that grew hungrier more avid seeking his over and over again going deeper with tongues tangling breath clashing need pounded through him with anvil shocks she was destroying him her legs gripped hard so that her tight little body molded to his her hips moving seductively so that sex rubbed sex laura but she answered with an impatient moan tunneling her hands through his hair savaging his throat his loins began to throb like a wound hold on a minute i want you her voice was thick the words hot against his skin i want you i want you we cant do this here could they his mind went blank when her mouth fit to his again he sank with her so that the water surrounded them her hair floated out like the mermaid who watched them from the bottom he wanted to keep sinking sinking just like this with his mouth hard on hers sink into a world where air didnt matter light didnt matter where there was nothing but her and this churning sweet ache of need when they surfaced again he shook his head trying to clear it then kicked once to keep them afloat no it wasnt a word hed expected to say to a woman under the circumstances and it came out weak as he pressed her head onto his shoulder youd better give me a minute she floated with him dizzy with desire dazed with triumph i seduced you sugar you damn near killed me she threw her head back and laughed i seduced you she repeated her face glowing i didnt know i could its liberating you come on over to my place tonight and you can be as liberated as you want right now keep your hands off me she linked her hands behind his neck easing back so that she could see his face in the falling light you wanted to tear my clothes off again im still thinking about it so behave yourself i wanted to tear yours off too i wonder what that would feel like to just rip away at your clothes and bite you sometimes i just want to sink my teeth into your shut up in defense he cupped her head and pulled it to his shoulder again i think ive created a monster i dont know about that but you sure hit the switch i like it she laughed again and arched back so that she was floating from the waist up lets come back here tonight when everyones asleep and go skinnydipping and make love in the water then well go for a walk on the cliffs and make love there just like seraphina and felipe she rose up again water streaming from her lets do something crazy he was about to do something crazy just then when he caught the sound of footsteps on the path and movement subtly he hoped he changed his grip hoping he wasnt holding any inappropriate part of the daughter of the house laura susan templetons brows shot up into her spiky bangs she didnt consider herself to be a woman who was easily surprised but it certainly rocked her to see her daughter clinging to a man in the pool with the look of a woman who had recently been thoroughly aroused still on her face mom shock came first then the heat in her cheeks from embarrassment she wiggled but michael held firm neither of them knew if it was out of stubbornness or habit youre here yes i am but you were supposed to be here tomorrow we finished up our business a little early she spoke smoothly but then she was a smooth woman small and delicately built like her daughter she looked young and chic in her valentino traveling suit her dark blond hair capped gamine style around a sharp interested face we thought she said with a faint edge of amusement that wed surprise you i think we succeeded yes i was just we were how was the trip laura ended lamely fine manners polished to a high sheen susan stepped forward smiled its michael isnt it michael fury yeah with a jerk of his head he tossed his wet hair back nice to see you again mrs templeton chapter fifteen if id known you were coming in this evening id have held dinner called the rest of the family composed now and dry laura sat beside her father in the parlor we ate on the plane thomas patted her hand he was thanks to his wifes discretion blissfully unaware of what his daughter had been doing in the pool an hour earlier and well see everyone tomorrow i swear those girls have grown a foot since christmas it seems like laura sipped brandy her mother was upstairs putting the girls to bed at her insistence it postponed the questions laura knew didnt eliminate them theyre so excited that youre here we didnt think youd be back until summer got to see our katie girl he told her only one of the reasons he mused but it would do well enough imagine our little kate having a baby shes glowing i know its a cliché but she really is she and byron go around beaming all the time oh and wait until you see j t oh dad hes so perfect hes sitting up now and he laughs all the time those wonderful belly laughs i could just eat him up she curled her legs up studied him over the rim of her snifter and how are you fit and fine it was no less than true he was a handsome man one who didnt take his health for granted and disciplined himself with exercise and interests he wasnt one who took his business or his success for granted he watched over things with a shrewd and focused eye nor did he take his family for granted he kept them close in heart and mind the result was a firm body still lanky in his fifties a face that had lived well and accepted the lines and dents of time with gratitude his eyes were smoke like his daughters and the silver in his hair glinted richly in the lamplight you dont look fit and fine she said and smiled when his brow knit you look dashing and you look happy it relieved him but he worried at the cause was it as annie had prophesied darkly a transitory state attributable to michael fury or was his little girl finally finding her feet again youre taking some time for yourself again im enjoying myself it wasnt quite the answer but it was truth ali and i have resolved some things shes happier so im happier i love my work my sisters keep giving me new babies to play with with a sigh she leaned her head on his shoulder i havent felt quite so content in a long time your mother and i worry about you i know and i wont bother to tell you not to but i will tell you im fine better than fine we heard that peters to be married again her teeth went on edge to candace litchfield word travels laura murmured people are more than pleased to spread that sort of news are you all right with it i was upset initially she admitted remembering that hammer blow to the midsection when theyd made the announcement that night at the club a kneejerk reaction really it was mostly the idea of candy being stepmother to my babies and worry about how the girls would handle it and he said quietly his hand over hers and now that its all settled in it just doesnt matter she turned her hand under his squeezed really doesnt matter at all the girls have adjusted theyll go to the wedding in may because its the right thing for them to do they dont particularly care for candy but theyll be polite then theyll come home she added and well get on with our lives theyre good girls thomas agreed good sharp girls i know its not easy for them but they have you so its you im concerned with theres no need in fact ive come to the conclusion that peter and candy are perfectly suited i couldnt be more happy for them he waited a beat ran his tongue around his teeth thats nasty yes she sighed lavishly it is i like it thats my girl now lets talk about something much more interesting she sat back again grinning let me tell you about the impromptu boxing match in the lobby today when susan came back in it was to the roar of her husbands laughter and the rich undertone of her daughters she stood for a minute enjoying the scene she could count every week every month that had passed since she had seen her little girl laugh that freely gnawing her lip she considered if michael fury had anything to do with it she owed him whatever annie might think as a woman she understood and appreciated the need of another woman to have at least once at least briefly a dangerous man in her life as a mother well they would see tommy your granddaughters want a kiss good night he was up like a shot ill have to give them one then and no more than one story susan murmured to him as he passed no matter how much you want to play he pinched her cheek winked and walked on that should keep him busy for an hour susan glided over to the liquor cabinet poured herself a brandy and will give you time to tell me about michael fury her mother laura thought rarely circled around a point if she could zero right in josh must have told you about the mud slides how michael lost his house yes i know the background laura her daughter susan thought could evade like a champ hes raising horses now and renting the stables for a time hes got wonderful horses laura leapt on the ploy youll have to see for yourself several are trained for stunts its fascinating hes teaching the girls to ride you know theyre crazy about him and are you crazy about him its been good for the girls to be around a man who pays attention to them patient susan reached down to pet bongo only one of the changes she mused as the dog vibrated with pleasure under her hand i was asking about you laura how you feel about him im very fond of him hes been helpful and kind are you sure you dont want me to get you something to eat some fruit and cheese no i dont want fruit and cheese susan reached over to still her daughters nervous hand are you in love with him i dont know laura leveled her breath and met her mothers gaze im sleeping with him im sorry if you disapprove its not for me to disapprove over something that personal at this point in your life but there was a pang youre being careful of course hes very attractive yes he is and nothing like peter no laura agreed nothing at all like peter is that why youre attracted to him because hes the antithesis of your exhusband im not using peter as a yardstick restless she rose maybe i was to some extent its difficult not to compare when youve only been with two men im not sleeping with michael to prove anything to anyone but because its he makes me i want him and he wants me will that be enough for you laura i dont know its enough for now she turned away paced to the fire it was quiet tonight just a warm glow and a subtle hiss i failed before i wanted it to be perfect i wanted to be perfect maybe i wanted to be you oh honey its not your fault laura said quickly when her mother got to her feet please dont think i mean that its only that i grew up seeing you how you were how you are so competent and wise and flawless im not flawless laura no one is you were to me you are you never faltered never stumbled never let me down i stumbled she crossed the room took her daughters hands countless times i had your father to help me get my balance and he had you to help him thats what i always wanted dreamed of the kind of marriage and life and family you made and im not foolish enough to think it didnt take effort and mistakes and sleepless nights to make it but you did i didnt you make me angry when you blame yourself laura shook her head i dont completely but i know im not blameless either i set my sights impossibly high every time i had to readjust them lower them it was harder i dont ever want to do that again if you set your sights too low you can miss a great deal maybe but im not pushing for more here than what i have part of me will always want what you and dad have not only for myself but for my children but if its not in the cards im through crying over it im going to give them the best life i can and make the best one for myself too right now michaels an important part of it does he know how important laura shrugged her shoulders its often difficult to tell how much michael knows but i know this peter didnt love me not ever laura no its true and i can live with that in fact she discovered it was easier to live with than she had imagined but i loved him and i married him and stayed with him for ten years both of us and certainly the children would have been better off if i hadnt been so determined to make it work if i had just accepted the failure and let go i think youre wrong susan said quietly by doing everything you could do to hold your marriage and your family together you can look back and know you did your best maybe and perhaps one day she would look back with michael i dont have to carry the burden of making something work or of living with the illusion that i have a man who loves me and wants what i want and im happier than ive been in too long to remember then im happy for you and will keep my own counsel susan thought for now lets go rescue your father she said tucking her arm through lauras before those girls have him wrapped around their fingers so tight he bounces the year thomas templeton married susan conroy he added the tower suite as his innovation for templeton house the house had already stood a hundred years with nearly every generation of his family toying with or expanding the original design he had built it out of fancy and a love for the romantic he had made love with his wife there countless nights conceived both of their children within the charming rounded walls in the big rococo bed although susan often said josh had been made on the bokhara rug in front of the fire he never disputed her on such matters now with flames simmering in the adams fireplace a bottle of templeton champagne chilled in a silver bucket and moonlight filtering in through the high windows he curled with his wife of thirtysix years on that same rug i think youre trying to seduce me he offered her a glass brimming with frothy wine youre such a sharp woman susie and smart enough to let you smiling she touched a hand to his face tommy how could so many years have gone by you look the same he pressed his lips to her palm just as lovely just as fresh now it takes me hours to maintain the illusion its no illusion he nestled her head on his shoulder watched the fire leap as a log gave way to the heat do you remember the first night we slept here you carried me up the steps up every single one and when you brought me in here you had flowers everywhere gardens of them roses strewn over the bed wine chilling the candles lighted you cried you overwhelmed me you often did and do still she tilted her face up brushed her lips over his jaw i knew i was the luckiest woman in the world to have you to be loved the way you loved me and to be wanted the way you wanted me she shut her eyes turned her face against his throat oh tommy tell me whats troubling you its laura isnt it i cant bear to see her hurt i can stand anything but that even though i know that children have to go their own way fight their own battles it breaks my heart i can still remember the day she was born the way she curled into my arms so small and precious and you think michael fury is going to break her heart i dont know i wish i did she rose walked to the window that looked out over the cliffs cliffs she knew that laura had haunted since childhood its knowing shes already had it broken that kills me inside i spoke with her tonight when you were up with the girls and i realized as she talked to me that as hard as shes worked to rebuild her life part of her is still so vulnerable so raw so exposed she believes shes failed tommy failed my ass incensed he sprang up peter ridgeway failed in every way possible and did we fail by not preventing could we have stopped her it was a question hed asked himself dozens of times over the last few years could we have no susan said after a long moment we might have postponed it we might have persuaded her to wait a few months a year but she was in love she wanted what we have thats what she said to me tonight tommy she wanted what we have when he laid a hand on her shoulder she reached back gripped tight i hate that she couldnt have it that she was denied the security and excitement and beauty of it now she doesnt believe she ever will have it shes a young woman susie a lovely and loving young woman shell fall in love again she already has shes in love with michael tommy she hasnt admitted it to herself yet she protects herself by thinking of it as sex please he winced its not easy to think of my little girl that way it made her laugh and turn to him your little girl is in the middle of a hot affair with joshs rebellious young friend should i get the gun so she laughed again embraced him oh tommy here we are with no way to stop it again nothing to do but wait and hope i could have a little talk with him you could i could but nothing we say is going to change lauras mind or her heart hes gorgeous intrigued thomas eased her back frowned into her eyes is that so absolutely devastatingly dangerously gorgeous sexy as sin her lips trembled at the corners as his frown deepened and he still has that thehellwithit look in his eye the one that makes every woman still breathing think shes the one person on earth who could make him care is that what you think flattered she patted his cheek i think i admire her taste and as a woman her luck as a mother im terrified of him maybe i will have a chat with him soon then he blew out a breath damn it susie ive always liked the boy so have i there was always something rawly honest about him and whatever annie thinks he wasnt and isnt a hoodlum what he is is basic and do we want our daughter involved with a basic man who ran off to sea at eighteen and has done any number of things not discussed in polite company she winced the same thought had passed through her head that sounds so snobbish it sounds like parental concern to me it doesnt matter if shes three or thirty its still our job to worry about her and men like michael come and go on their own whim she murmured they arent looking for roots laura would wither without them and from what she said the girls are attached to him how will it affect them to have another man walk out of their lives she burrowed against him theres nothing we can do but be there for them then thats what well do we watched margo and kate find the way through their problems laura will get through and they have each other she shifted so that they could look out toward the cliffs together the three of them are always there for each other that shop of theirs has worked magic for them whatever happens laura has them and the pride in what theyve built together but im greedy tommy she took his hand laid it on her heart i want her to have her dream i want her to have what we have i want to believe that shell stand at the window look toward the sea with a mans arms around her a man who loves her and will stand by her a man who can make her feel the way you make me feel she cupped his face in her hands so im going to believe it and if shes got any of me inside her shell fight for what she wants the way i fought for you you ignored me he reminded her wouldnt give me the time of day her smile bloomed slowly and it worked didnt it perfectly then one day i let you find me by calculated accident alone in the rose garden at the club and i let you kiss me like this she lifted her mouth drew the kiss out warm and slow and tommy templeton never seeing the punch went down for the count you always were sneaky susie he swung her up into his arms and made her laugh and i got exactly what i wanted just she murmured as he lowered her to the rug the way im going to get exactly what i want right now laura saw the lights in the tower room as she walked toward the cliffs and for a moment she stood watching the silhouette of her parents embracing it was a lovely sight stirred her heart and her envy they fit so perfectly together she thought turning back toward the song of the sea their rhythms their styles their goals their needs shed learned the hard way that what her parents had what they worked for and preserved wasnt a given but a rarity to be celebrated her new perspective only brought her more admiration for them she walked the cliffs alone something she hadnt done for weeks she wanted michael the low hum of desire was constant and thrilling but she wouldnt go to him tonight nor she believed did he expect her they had parted awkwardly she undeniably embarrassed at having been caught frolicking in the pool by her own mother he obviously uncomfortable she thought they both would need time to adjust the light was strong glowing with the clouds chased away to clear skies by a stiff westerly wind as familiar with the cliffs as with her own parlor laura picked her way down easily negotiating rocks and a path slippery with pebbles until she came to a favored ledge there she sat letting the wind whip at her face and the sea thunder in her ears and there listening for the whisper of ghosts thinking of lost love she was content from his window michael watched her go down the slope the long loose jacket she wore streaming out behind her like a cloak romantic mysterious he pressed his hand to the glass as if he could touch her then drew it back irritated with himself she wasnt coming to him small wonder he thought hooking his thumbs in his pockets as he watched her climb down rocks as gracefully as a fawn her parents were back and with them he expected came a reminder of the difference in their positions laura templeton may have been working for a living she may have scrubbed a few bathtubs but she was still laura templeton and he was still michael fury from the wrong side of the hill shed be busy now he supposed entertaining scheduling dinner parties during her parents stay those fancy flowerbedecked exclusive affairs that templeton house was renowned for there would be lunch at the club quick rounds of tennis erudite conversations over coffee and brandy the ritual was more foreign to him than greek and he had no desire to learn either so if she was going to brush him off what was the difference with a shrug he turned away from the window and stripped off his shirt he could lure her back into the sack another time or two if he wanted sex was nothing more than a weakness he could exploit hers to satisfy his own he heaved the shirt aside frustrated that it wasnt something hard and breakable goddamn it he wanted her now here with him who the hell did she think she was who the hell did he think he was eyes grim he pulled off his boots and threw them both against the wall where they at least made a satisfying thud he knew exactly who he was and so he thought did she laura templeton was going to find herself hardpressed to shake him loose until he was damn good and ready he wasnt finished with her yet not by a long shot she could have tonight he thought stripping off his jeans hed let her have tonight all quiet and safe because her nights werent going to stay quiet and they werent going to stay safe he dropped naked to the bed and glared at the ceiling and he would have her right back where he wanted her the hell with her parents her fancy friends and her perfect pedigree shed taken on a mongrel now shed have to deal with him from her perch on the ledge laura stretched her arms up cool damp air caressed her skin where the sleeves of her jacket fell down to her elbows she thought of how michael caressed that skin rough and demanding one moment then the next with surprising and devastating tenderness he had so many moods she thought so many needs he had in such a short time awakened so many moods so many needs in her no she was no sleeping beauty she reflected but she felt as though shed been sleeping for decades waiting for him to find her and he had she realized theyd found each other so why was she sitting here alone trying to reorganize her schedule for the next day and the day after that tomorrow would come anyway she could be with him right now shed go to him laura closed her eyes tight wished if his lights were still on when she stood and looked back she would go to him and he would be there waiting wanting she stood holding her breath and turned and let it out again as she saw nothing but night and the deeper silhouettes of darkened buildings he hadnt waited she brushed the chill from her arms calling it foolish it wasnt rejection it only meant he was tired and had gone to bed and she should do that herself there were dozens of things that needed to be done the next day that would be done better after a good nights sleep and they werent bound to spend every night together thered been no promises between them none at all she thought furious that her eyes stung as she turned back to the sea no promises no plans no soft words was that what she wanted still after she should have known better what weakness was this in her that craved those words those promises those plans couldnt she be content with what was and not always dream about what could be it didnt matter what shed told herself she realized as she sat down again it didnt matter what shed told her mother or margo or kate or what shed told michael it had all been lies she who was famous for being a pathetically poor liar had pulled this one off beautifully she was in love with him she was so stupidly in love with him and no one had a clue part of her had already seen them together tomorrow a year from tomorrow ten years lovers partners family more children a home a life shed lied to him to everyone including herself and now as it was with lies she would have to continue to spin them and live them to make the first of them hold it wouldnt be fair to him otherwise for he hadnt lied he had wanted her and she had no doubt that he cared for her he cared for her children was willing to offer a hand to help he gave her his body had awakened hers and had offered her a friendship that she valued and still she wasnt satisfied selfish she wondered or just foolish it hardly mattered she had created the illusion and would continue it or lose him when it was over whenever it ended she wouldnt regret it or curse god shed go on because life was long and precious and deserved the best she could give it when the time came and she had no choice but to live without him shed remember what it had been like to feel again and to love and shed be grateful steadier now she braced a hand on the ground to push herself up her fingers closed over the disk as if theyd known it was there waiting for her with her heart drumming loud as the waves below she lifted it up turned it under the stream of the moonlight it glinted dully the single gold coin untouched she thought with a shiver unseen for a hundred and fifty years since a young girl desperate had hidden it away to save for her lover this the symbol of the dream the promise and the loss lay cool in the center of her palm seraphina she murmured and her breath caught as she closed her fingers over the coin as she felt the wild need of a reckless young girl laura curled into a ball on the ledge high over the violent waves and wept chapter sixteen the sorrel colt was bright pretty and stubborn as a fleabitten mule michael was working hard to prove that he was even more stubborn by god youll do it you little bastard you know how as if to say that was hardly the point the colt tossed his head rolled his eyes in michaels direction and stood firm theyd been dealing with each other for just over six months and both of them wanted to be in charge you think youve got these fancy digs and three squares to stand around posing michael slapped the bat in his hand and the colts ears flickered you even think about kicking me again and youll be eating dirt he stepped forward the colt danced back michaels eyes narrowed dangerously hold vibrating the colt did so pawing the ground in challenge as michael approached you and me michael said gripping the bridle as the colt began to swing around to get a good shot with his back leg were going to go a round dont you dare strike that animal both michael and the colt looked up in annoyance at the sharp order and saw the trim form swinging through the paddock gate you should be ashamed of yourself fired up susan grabbed the colts bridle and stepped between the horse and the bat i dont care if he belongs to you or not i wont have an animal mistreated on my property as if realizing that sympathy was on his side the colt lowered his head and nuzzled susans shoulder suck up michael muttered look mrs templeton i is this the way you treat your horses clubbing them when they dont behave as youd like you brute color flashed into her cheeks reminding michael of laura if you dare to raise a hand to one of these animals while im around ill personally kick your butt off templeton property and halfway to hell yes he could see now where laura got those licks of temper hed caught a few glimpses of and he could have sworn the colt was smirking at him mrs templeton then ill have you arrested she barreled on there are laws against cruelty to animals laws created to deal with insensitive brutes like you and if you ever dare to mistreat this sweet horse theres not a sweet bone in his body michael interrupted resisting the urge to rub the thigh that still sang from its rude encounter with a hoof and i wasnt going to use this to beat sense into his hard head though its tempting shed seen the look in his eye and the bat in his hand threw up her chin i suppose you were going to play baseball with him no maam it might be funny years later when he didnt ache everywhere were not playing at anything here and if you want to take a good look youll see the only one with bruises on him in this paddock is me she did look noted that although the coat was gleaming with a healthy layer of sweat the horse was unharmed in fact he was magnificent and the look in his eye wasnt fear she realized it was if such a thing were possible humor michael on the other hand was filthy and there was the telltale outline of a hoofprint on the leg of his jeans if you threaten him with a bat his only recourse is to strike out i would think youd mrs templeton patience was wearing thin and going ragged around the edges does this little bastard look threatened to you right now all hes doing is gloating it appeared that he was susan admitted making another close study of the colts eyes then explain why if youd just let loose of him before he sees i can be slapped around by a woman half my weight and i completely lose the upper hand here along with six months work id appreciate it she did loosen her grip on the bridle but warily im warning you michael if you dare to hurt him ill do more than slap you around i believe it michael muttered as she took a single step back would you move back to the fence please bastard still has a problem with control charming name with her arms folded susan took a few more steps in retreat and stayed poised ready to leap youve got me in it now havent you with a firm hand michael took the bridle pulled the colts head down until their eyes were level make me look like an idiot pal and i might just mistake your face for a spalding got that the colt snorted then jerked his head clear when michael released it michael shifted his grip on the bat curling fingers around tip and base then lifted it after a humming war of wills the colt reared up pawed the air up heedless of striking hooves michael stepped under them stay up there bastard nobodyll feed you if you kill me shifting the bat again he grabbed a handful of mane and swung up onto the nearly vertical back at the quick and easy grace of the move the fluidity with which man and horse merged susan sighed in admiration and again when michael turned the mount in a half circle the pressure of michaels knees brought the horse down stay back michael ordered susan without looking at her this is the part were having trouble with he brought bastard into a rear again rolled off and under the dancing hooves dont you step on me michael muttered as he felt the ground shake dont you step on me you son of a shit a hoof caught him in the hip just a graze but it was the principle of the thing he was on his feet again staring the horse down you did that on purpose youre going to do it again till you get it right limping only a little michael picked up the discarded bat and went through the entire routine again and again when they were both winded and hed managed to complete the drill without breaking anything michael limping a bit more went over to the bag hed slung over the fence and took out an apple the colt followed him pushed his head against michaels back dont try to make up im only giving you this because im not on my way to the hospital the colt nudged him again then tried to eat michaels hair cut it out you are such an ass kisser here the apple he offered was taken eagerly and you have revolting manners he added when bits of apple flew i owe you an apology michael stopped rubbing his bruised butt and looked at susan in his concentration hed forgotten she was still there no problem maybe i was thinking about bashing him one no you werent she stepped over ran a hand over the colts smooth neck youre in love with him i hate the bastard dont know why i ever took him on umhmm she smiled absently brushed some of the paddock dirt off the sleeve of michaels shirt he certainly looks illkept illused illfed too embarrassed now michael shrugged hes an investment a good stunt horse earns good money im sure she simply couldnt stand it now she broke into excited questions how in the world did you teach him to do that how do you keep him from trampling you arent you worried how long have you been working with him rolling his aching shoulders michael settled on the last question not long enough hes smart but hes got some rough edges then he grinned you had me quaking mrs templeton i figured you were going to grab the bat out of my hands and go to work on me with it i might have she caressed the colt i cant stand to see something abused cant say i care for it myself there was this wrangler on a set a while back he had this terrific horse sweetnatured generous but the wrangler was never satisfied always pushing for more working that horse to exhaustion and never giving anything back it was bad enough to see him breaking that horses heart and his spirit but then he started using a whip and his fists and whatever else came in handy michael paused to shovel the hair out of his eyes squint at the sun he got himself a bad rep nobody wanted to hire him or work with him anymore they all said it was too damn bad cause that horse was a rare one why wasnt something done theres politics the network the wranglerd been in the game a long time i was pretty new at it then and i never did care much for politics i talked him into selling me that horse made a pretty decent stake working with him you talked the wrangler into selling michael looked back at her more or less did you use the whip or just your fists i dont care for whips and max the walker i bought he cant stand the sight of them he nipped the bag away before the colt could investigate the contents you out for a walk this morning mrs templeton i could use that for an excuse but i imagine we both know i wanted to speak with you yeah i figured you or your husband would come down and hed prepped himself for it youre going to have to talk while i work my stock need some exercise all right she went with him as he walked out of the paddock and into the stables laura tells me youre giving the girls riding lessons just a few basics ive got some quiet saddle ponies i was treated to a dissertation on mr fury and his horses over breakfast this morning youve made quite an impression on my granddaughters let me help you she said taking the bridle of one of the horses hed begun to lead out and youve made an impression on my daughter as well shes a beautiful woman yes she is and shes been through hell in many ways its made her stronger but shes vulnerable michael and more easily bruised than either you or she might realize you want me to promise not to hurt her he stepped back as the horses trotted into the paddock i cant do that no you wouldnt do that as i recall even as a boy you were careful not to make promises you dont make you dont break he said simply and went back to the stables you had a difficult childhood she began then broke off raising her eyebrows when his head whipped around i dont believe in blaming what is on what was iimagine you had a dandy childhood is that responsible for everything you are she nodded slowly as he led out the next horses well put she murmured no i wouldnt like to think so but it did give me a solid foundation to build on and mines shaky though hed told himself he wouldnt allow it the bitterness came through you dont have to tell me where i come from mrs templeton i know she stopped him by reaching up closing her hand over his that wasnt a criticism im not blind michael and i dont like to think im narrowminded either i can see youre building something here and i know why you left your childhood behind before anyone should have to when he said nothing she smiled and let him go i know what goes on in my own house michael and i know what goes on in the lives of my childrens friends if your back needs to go up because i felt sorry for that boy then so be it my heart broke for you you wasted your sympathy i dont think so but as you said thats what was now is what is you never cross the wire in the marathon of parenthood michael you never finish the race and take a victory lap laura is a grown woman free to make her own choices and live her own life but that doesnt stop me from worrying or wondering or hoping she chooses well he knew what she was telling him had expected it and youve got to wonder considering things if shes choosing well this time she nodded slowly yes i wont say that sex doesnt last it can and does if youre lucky but it isnt enough by itself hed expected to be warned away but he wasnt ready to be pushed if youve come down here to ask me to stay away from her youre wasting your time i wont do it she measured him id be disappointed in you if you would what im asking you to do is be kind she looked away to where the horses pranced just be kind you want a promise ill give you one ill never treat her the way ridgeway did i wont cheat or lie or take anything from her she doesnt want to give me and i wont leave her feeling like a failure susans gaze came back and sharpened it was the words yes but more the edgy anger behind them that had her reevaluating you understand better than i gave you credit for i understand failure just fine and he knew that compared to a woman like susan templeton he might not be a failure but he could hardly be considered a success if thats all ive got work to do michael remembering that hed always been easily roused and prone to impatience she kept her hand firm and her eyes level with the storm in his its nice to have you at templeton house again now will you show me the horse you told me about is it that walker over there watching you as if hed die if you asked him to michael blew out a breath and wondered how a man was supposed to understand any of the templeton females yeah thats max hes just hoping for a handout why dont you introduce me i actually told her i was sleeping with him laura kept her voice low as she slipped clothes back onto hangers in the wardrobe room i cant believe i stood there and told my own mother i was having sex with michael odds are shed figured it out for herself margo slipped discarded shoes back into their slots and probably wasnt all that shocked as its likely she knew youd had sex before seeing as you have two children you know what im talking about laura mumbled its weird howd she take it well enough poor dad is tiptoeing around the subject as though if he wakes it up it would start an orgy well you could hardly pretend nothing was going on when mrs t caught you and michael playing lifeguard in the pool she chuckled checked her hair in the mirror god i wish id seen that one im sure it was illuminating for all parties it felt like that time annie caught us necking with biff and mark on the cliffs the cliffs she exclaimed before margo could comment lord my mind is a sieve today wait she dashed out nearly bumping into a customer and causing kate to eye her curiously in the back office laura dug her purse out of a drawer and the coin out of the small zippered compartment whats the problem kate demanded slipping in did margo forget to order boxes again well be out by monday if she hasnt what have you got there the cliffs laura pressed a hand to her heart last night i forgot you found one in a leap kate snatched it from lauras hand excitement and triumph spurted straight up into her heart you found another one seraphinas dowry and you forgot to tell us this morning was such a zoo i didnt know i would be in until dad insisted hed cover for me at the hotel and then kayla and ali were begging to stay home from school to spend time with mom and oh never mind she finished with a wave of her hand yes i forgot margo opened the door behind them would the two of you mind terribly if we attempted to run the business today we have customers who what have you got laura found it and forgot when letting the door close smartly at her back margo took the coin from kate where last night on the cliffs on that ledge where i like to sit sometimes i was just sitting there thinking and when i started to go back i saw it well felt it laura corrected i put my hand down right on it id been sitting right beside it just like the other times margo murmured when one was just there for me and one was just there for kate its a sign there she goes kate rolled her eyes and eased a hip onto the desk well what would you call it margo snapped back we search like maniacs have been on and off since we were kids nothing weve all but groomed those cliffs with tweezers nothing she said again gesturing wildly then each one of us goes there at some turning point in her life and there it is a coin one for each which means she stopped looked up from the gold glinting in her hand and stared at laura which means she said slowly youre in love with michael fury what in the world does one have to do with the other to buy time laura took the coin back set it in the middle of the desk blotter the day i went there and found mine i was thinking about josh and what i was going to do about being in love with him and kate she looked over at her friend who was frowning in thought she went thinking about byron you were in love with him werent you yeah but kate trailed off look this is a little too twilight zone for me open that accountants mind for a minute impatient margo turned back to laura and took her by the shoulders are you in love with michael that isnt i asked a direct question laura and ill know if you lie all right yes but it doesnt love matters margo said quietly we matter maybe thats the whole point she released laura and reached into her pocket where she habitually carried her coin this matters she placed it beside lauras and looked at kate who rose and took her own out of her purse it matters kate agreed when the three coins sat side by side were still in it together have you told mick laura no and no i dont know if im going to or how ill handle it i cant plan things out like you kate or run on instinct the way you do margo i have to do it my way which means i suppose maintaining illusions and waiting to see what comes and my emotions are my responsibility then she smiled traced a fingertip over all three coins a sign from seraphina well maybe it is maybe shes telling me not to put all my dreams into one mans hands this time or she might be telling you that you can find that dream if you know where to look margo draped an arm over lauras shoulders either way you cant stop looking its the same as jumping off a cliff havent stopped looking she patted margos hand before reaching for her coin and i think this calls for a celebration why dont we get together tonight and open some champagne talked me into it kate pocketed her own coin i was coming over anyway poker night at the de witts thats right laura grinned dads already rubbing his palms together so margo are you up for it ill be there margo picked up her coin but held it she hoped laura wouldnt put hers or her dreams away too quickly maybe we can get mum and mrs t a little drunk and play some poker ourselves im game why dont we kate broke off at the brisk knock on the office door the customer who poked her head in seemed annoyed and impatient excuse me but is anyone working here im so sorry all conciliatory smiles laura stepped over we had a small problem what can i help you with michael had never been driven to a poker game in a limo and he wasnt sure how he felt about it not that he hadnt ever ridden in one before after all hed worked in hollywood for five years but to a poker game it felt well pretentious then again as josh had said when he came to the stables to fetch him no one would have to worry about how many beers they knocked back obviously at home in the plush surroundings thomas leaned back and tapped his finger on his knee in time with the aria playing on the stereo all michael could think was that big limos opera and poker didnt mix and he began to worry just what the hell hed gotten himself into im feeling lucky thomas wiggled his eyebrows i hope you two boys brought plenty of money which made michael realize that his idea of plenty of money and thomas templeton of templeton hotels idea of plenty of money were unlikely to be in the same ballpark jesus he could lose his shirt and his ego in one funfilled evening my wife fell in love with a tennessee walker you have down at the stables michael thomas crossed his legs at the ankles and decided to see how much of a rise he could get out of young michael fury maybe ill win him from you before were done tonight i dont bet my horses michael said easily or my friends nice watch mr templeton he flicked a glance over thomass slim gold rolex i could use a new watch thomas let out a bark of laughter and slapped michael on the knee a boy needs his dreams i ever tell you about the time i played sevencard stud for thirtysix hours that was in chicago in now we not thethirtysix hours in chicago story josh moaned im begging you shut up harvard almost comfortable michael stretched out his legs some of us havent heard it pleased thomas grinned at michael then ill tell you and you can be afraid it wasnt such a bad ride after all and things looked up when they pulled into the driveway of the multidecked house on seventeen mile and the uniformed driver unloaded two cases of blue moose beer a templeton product from the limos trunk now thats a hell of a beer michael said then hooked his thumbs in his pockets and studied the wood and glass the decks and gardens of the de witt homestead and thats a hell of a house easy access to the beach too josh added kate recommended the property to byron before they got together good call it looks like her michael decided streamlined classy unique man oh man mustang and its cherry too he walked over to the car ran a loving hand over the fender what a beaut and that vette firstround sting ray mmm sweetheart let me pop your hood we going to play poker or are you going to make love to inanimate objects all night he shot a look at josh inanimate my ass honeys like this have more personality and sex appeal than half the women you dated shows that you havent met the women ive dated i dated some of them myself michael strolled toward the front door glancing over his shoulder at the cars then at josh including your wife joshs grin faltered and so did his feet you never dated margo didnt i enjoying himself michael climbed the short flight of wooden steps i seem to recall a couple of interesting evenings in france youre just trying to psych me out and it was working ask her michael said mildly damned if he wouldnt his head reeling with visions he didnt want josh reached around and opened the door two big yellow dogs raced forward and flung themselves at the newcomers nip tuck sit byron called out the order as he stepped into the wide living area the dogs sat butt to butt and continued to vibrate you can put the beer in the kitchen thanks he motioned the driver toward the kitchen think you brought enough we run out josh said we send for more got food i whipped up a few things unable to resist two lolling tongues and two pairs of adoring eyes michael crouched and made friends with the dogs you cook how do you think he got me to marry him kate stepped out smiled thinly you still here josh moved over to tug her hair go play with your own kind she elbowed him away i was just leaving but i want to say that the concept of the allmale poker game is a neanderthal practice that i find insulting particularly when its taking place in my own house being a wise man byron limited himself to rolling his eyes behind her back but michael didnt have to live with her he straightened grinned yeah yeah tell it to gloria steinem and get lost i have no desire to stay and listen to a bunch of fools belch snort and tell lies about the women theyve had chin lifted she snatched her purse from a chair and i was going to tell byron all about that night i picked you up on fishermans wharf and we shut up mick her brows drew together her color rose im leaving wait a minute her husband made a grab missed what night it was nothing she seared michael with a look it was nothing aw sugar michael murmured now youve hurt my feelings men are pigs she tossed back as she slammed the door behind her well that got rid of her michael decided where are the cards margo and kate josh eyed him narrowly cant fault my taste can you michael tucked his hands in his pockets like i said where are the cards men deserve their little rituals susan stretched out on the long arm of the conversation pit in the family room just as we deserve ours i dont mind snuggled back against a mountain of pillows margo nibbled from a bowl of popcorn kate gets huffy where is kate wandering to the window laura looked out she should be here by now oh shed have waited to yank their chains before she left margo shrugged and reached for the champagne shell be along god knows this is better than poker and beer and a bunch of cigar smoke but shes got to make her point ready for a glass mum ann paused in her perusal of the videotapes chosen for the marathon viewing well maybe just a little one they had champagne popcorn a platter of crudites fresh fruit three choices of dip including white chocolate and a stack of movies the baby was sleeping in the nursery and her favorite women were here margo judged it the perfect girls night out im going to do your nails i dont want the fussing margo smiled at her mother its fun mum ive got the perfect shade for you red hot lover ann snorted into her wine i wont wear any such thing as if id be painting my fingernails anyway men go for it to tease margo leaned closer and bob the butchers had his eye on you for years he certainly has not her face flaming ann fumbled with the stack of tapes thats nonsense we have a good customer relationship nothing more he saves the leanest cuts for miss annie margo fluttered her lashes then laughed you should give him a break one of these days oh laura stop worrying about kate shell be here im not worrying just watching and thinking of michael she admitted what was he doing why was it their paths hadnt crossed once since the night before but she made herself come away from the window and pour a glass of champagne what are we going to watch first i vote for to have and have not you know how to whistle dont you steve susan sighed dipped a moist red strawberry into creamy white chocolate the worlds champion comeon worlds best brushoff margo said continuing the theme bette davis id love to kiss you but i just washed my hair best wrenching goodbye laura said getting into the swing bogart to bergman well always have paris when kate came in ten minutes later they were in a heated debate over the ten most dangerous men in cinema history newman margo insisted its the eyes cold or hot and incredibly blue you watch the long hot summer hud or grant susan sat up to make her point dangerous because its unexpected the charm undermines a womans defenses and he has her bogart laura disagreed in anything raw dangerous elemental a hero despite his instincts i cant believe youre discussing men disgusted kate plopped down i just left those four baboons is that white chocolate she reared up again and used her finger to dip in and she continued licking it they were already smug superior and sarcastic micks the worst i cant believe he brought up that time i ran into him on the wharf and we we laura came to attention we what nothing she should have filled her mouth kate decided and began to do so it was nothing he was home on leave and he looked sort of interesting we went for a drive thats all you went for a drive laura repeated with michael thats all well yeah mostly done it now kate thought as every eye in the room focused on her well okay so maybe i experimented a little for a minute whos in charge of the vcr before she could pop up to take charge herself laura clamped a hand on her shoulder define experimented i let him kiss me a couple of times thats it just that do we have bringing up baby i could use a laugh you and michael necked in his car not necked exactly i wouldnt call it necking margo she appealed to her friend for help no a couple of kisses does not constitute necking i necked with him so i know this to be true you laura choked grabbed the champagne bottle you i give him a ten on both technique and style and since that was a number of years ago i can only assume hes improved even that she laughed got up to pop a movie in now mrs t is trying to figure out if she should make a comment or a statement of any kind and mum is sitting there steaming over the idea that the disreputable michael fury has had his very tasty lips clamped on all three of her girls thats just the kind of talk i expect from you ann said with a sniff and id hate to disappoint you hes one of the dangerous men all right she leaned back and patted her mothers knee affectionately thank god for them chapter seventeen he wasnt feeling particularly dangerous with the trash byron had dealt him hed held fairly steady in the first hour of the game keeping his bets conservative even predictable while he studied each of his opponents for their tells they were good he admitted all three of them this wasnt any suckers game they may have been the classy high rollers who normally gambled in palaces but he had learned his skills aboard ship where boredom could tempt a man to toss a months pay into the pot just to break the monotony at a card table any card table michael knew a wise man studied his quarries and his foes josh flicked a thumb over his jaw when he had a solid hand and his eyes went blank and cool when he was bluffing de witt tended to reach for his beer when he had a winner and templeton well templeton was a cagey dog but as the second hour got under way michael noted that the man puffed harder on his cigar when he prepared to rake in the chips calculating michael discarded drew into a pitiful pair of treys he had a choice considered the practicalities and decided it was time to shake things up theres your ten he told josh flipping in his chips raise it ten twenty to me absently byron reached down to scratch one of his dogs a sign michael thought smugly that he had nothing im in twenty tommy knocked into the pot and ten more out josh tossed his cards down and rose to help himself to one of the fat sandwiches on the counter ill see your raise and bump it twenty and you two can fight this hand out byron pushed back gulped his beer the boy had been bumping the pot since the deal thomas mused and studied the pretty trio of ladies in his hand well they would have to see what he was made of your twenty and fifty more michaels eyes met thomass over the cards held steady as he pushed chips into the pot fifty and fifty back call or fold thomas studied his opponent then wheezed out a breath between his teeth ill give you this one he decided and tossed his cards down well he demanded when michael scooped back the chips what did you have when michael merely smiled and began to stack his chips thomas hissed out another breath you bluffed me i can see it you didnt have shit a man has to pay to see mr templeton eyes narrowed thomas leaned back tommy he said when a man bluffs me cold he ought to call me by name my deal michael gathered the cards shuffled stud sevencard he grinned you in tommy im in and ill still be in when youre writhing on the floor and begging for mercy michael flipped in his ante a boy needs his dreams thomas let loose a laugh then reached into his pocket damned if i dont like you fury have a cigar a real one not one of those girl smokes byron puffs on thanks but i quit still he sniffed longingly at the clouds of smoke anyway those cubans look too much like a dick josh choked on smoke pulled his cigar out of his mouth thanks mick im really going to enjoy this now howling with laughter thomas slapped his hand on the table deal the cards and prepare to lose your shirt during hour three michael took a pass and walked outside he peed companionably with the dogs and watched the nightdrenched sea hell of a spot isnt it michael looked back over his shoulder as byron approached you sure picked one i was thinking i could put up a small stable there at the edge of the cypress grove simple two stalls two i figure solos lonely even for a horse i liked the look of that pinto mare shes a sweetheart he tucked his tongue in his cheek you clear it with your wife byrons eyes were mild and amused i know all kinds of ways around my wife more i assume than you do even after picking her up on fishermans wharf i was just rattling her cage and yours he lifted his hands palms out never laid my hands on her hardly byron chuckled shook his head i think well just leave that particular door closed but if you want to ride josh about margo id find it entertaining i dont want to have to fight him hes tougher than he looks loosened three of my teeth when we were twelve michael checked them with his tongue and his old mans liable to take bets on the outcome thats the templetons theyll bet on anything look at the way kate margo and laura bet on the shop i keep meaning to go by there again im not much on fancylady shops but im wondering how laura handles clerking i think youll be surprised and impressed i have been its given them something solid and special gives them a living it gives them more than that it gives them unity and a goal and love either the beer or the women were making him sentimental but byron went with it i wasnt around when they conceived it put it together took the chance margo selling off almost everything she owned my conservative accountant pooling her investments to make her share and laura selling her wedding ring she sold her wedding ring to build that shop yeah it was right after they found out ridgeway had pretty much cleaned out their joint accounts she wouldnt take templeton money for the shop so she hocked her wedding and engagement rings to make the down payment on the building what women they are yeah michael frowned out to sea the socialite the model and the accountant they sweated over it they cleaned and sanded and painted and figured out how to make it work it knocks me out to walk in there and see how they are together how they are together anywhere you see them out on the cliffs rooting around in the rocks and dirt for seraphinas dowry all these years theyre still together still looking kate was wild tonight when she told me laura had found another coin he was trying to see it all to settle all these facets into an image in his head he blinked laura she found a coin when last night took a walk down on the cliffs kate says she does that from time to time when she needs to clear her head or just be alone she found one a gold doubloon just like margo did and kate did oddest fucking thing each one of them finding a coin months apart by accident rather than design their treasure hunts turn up nothing then boom one of them just picks up a gold piece off the ground as if it had been there all along makes you wonder the back door slammed open and thomass voice boomed out is this a poker game or a damn church social cards are getting cold then deal em byron called back coming he asked michael yeah laura walks on the cliffs at night now and again byron waded through the dogs who ran circles around him and last night she just reached down and picked up a gold coin spanish son of a bitch thats weird ill tell you whats weirder im beginning to believe theyre going to find the whole thing that theyre the only ones who will never believed it existed ask laura to show you her coin byron suggested you might change your mind i might do that michael murmured then walked back into the comforting arena of cigar smoke and beer when he dragged himself up the stairs at three am he still had his shirt his horses and his ego he would have counted himself lucky for that the fact that he was also eight hundred dollars richer was just icing he thought he might put it toward buying a pretty yearling quarter horse hed had his eye on he stepped through his front door and stumbled over the warm bundle stretched out there jesus christ as he hit the floor the dog yelped shuddered then licked humbly at michaels face bongo what the hell are you jesus get your tongue out of my mouth michael swiped a hand over his face shifted and ended up with wriggling puppy on his lap yeah yeah youre sorry how the helld you get in here learn how to pick locks now he came with me laura stepped out of the bedroom he loves me he didnt want to sleep in my bed all alone me either maybe it was the beer or his abrupt meeting with the floor but his voice seemed to have been lost somewhere along the way she was standing in the lamplight smiling and wearing nothing but one of his shirts her hair was tousled her skin flushed and when he managed to clear his vision he noted that her eyes were bright if a bit unfocused she was in simple words beautiful sexy and drunk did you come for the rent her laugh was low and frothy its after business hours i came for you thought youd never get here how was the poker game profitable how was the movie marathon illuminating did you ever watch really watch the way people kiss in black and white its she sighed ran a hand down her breasts until he had to roll his tongue back into his mouth wonderful she decided just wonderful come and kiss me michael in black and white sugar he had very few rules and was struggling to remember this one as he set the dog aside and rose youre plowed i am indeed she shook back her hair leaned against the doorway for balance dyou know michael i have never been drunk in my life a little tipsy i will admit to having been on occasion a little tipsy but drunk never not done not acceptable for a woman of my standing in the community your secrets safe with me bongo and i will walk you home im not going home she straightened steadied herself enjoying the liberating way the room tilted as she stepped toward him until ive had you then you can tell me if i kiss as good as kate and margo shit he muttered under his breath word travels fast around here you can even rip my clothes off again she linked her arms around his neck its your shirt anyway i like wearing your clothes its almost like having your hands on me are you going to put your hands on me michael im debating ill tell you a secret she pressed against him put her mouth on his ear wanna know my secret she was going to be sorry come sunrise but he skimmed his hands under the shirt what the hell yeah tell me a secret i have dreams about you i used to have them before too long time ago when you would come around with josh i had dreams about you but i never told anybody because it wouldnt be appropriate for a woman of your standing she chuckled nipped his earlobe and sent his blood pressure through the roof xactly you know what id dream about you ill tell you youd find me id be on the cliffs or in my room or in the forest and youd find me and my heart would start to pound so hard so fast she took his hand pressed it against her heart to show him i couldnt move or breathe or even think she continued and her hand laid over his on her breast youd come toward me not saying anything just looking at me looking until my knees were weak until the blood was rushing in my head youd kiss me so rough so hot the way no one else ever would no one else would dare to touch me the way you touched me no it was like drowning he thought staring into those deep gray eyes was like drowning no one would youd rip my clothes rip them off and take me right there wherever we were just the way you did that night just like in my dreams i must have always known you would one day she circled away arms lifted like a dancer on point while he stood where he was aching viciously aching thats my secret i dreamed of you oh my heads spinning she laughed pressed a hand to it being drunk feels just like it feels having you on top of me inside me pounding in me god god i love it she combed her hair back from her face grinned at him look at you standing there watching me never expected to hear such talk from laura templeton did you he knew standing there watching her that if hed been dying of thirst he would have begged for her rather than a single sip of water no and if you dont remember this in the morning im going to be damn sorry im just full of surprises tonight she lifted her arms hooked them behind her head and stretched i watched all those movies drank all that wine ate chocolate and laughed and cried and sighed all those things women do laura lowered her hands again and turned a slow fluid pirouette that made his shirt flow up out i watched margo talk annie into having her nails painted and kate dozing off with her head on my mothers lap margo nursing the baby when he woke i loved it all so much loved being with them my life is them and my babies but through it all you were in the back of my mind where is michael does he still want me and i thought well see ill be there when he comes home and well see if he does if i can make him want me do you he didnt speak couldnt have simply crossed to her dragged her against him and plundered joy and need and pleasure burst through her in one sizzling ball of heat her laugh was smoke like her eyes as he pulled her to the floor no no giddy now and brave enough she rolled on top of him let me this time i want to see if i can he was ripe to explode and pulled her down again laura for christs sake me she jerked back shook her reeling head i want to do things to you things that might be considered inappropriate for a woman of my station he struggled to clamp down on hurry when she straddled him want to use me do you her lips quirked at the gleam in his eyes thats right look we scared bongo hes curled up in the corner hell get over it what do you want to do to me i have to figure it out she blew out a breath toyed with the buttons of his shirt ive got another secret if its anything like the last one itll probably kill me its not a good one now her lips pouted well maybe since it turned out this way it is peter never ripped my clothes off christ forget it and him but when he reached up she evaded him i want to tell you so youll know its kind of funny really we always had very appropriate sex not like with you she traced the vee above the button with a fingertip always proper sex except when we didnt have sex at all which was most of the time and all through the last year we were married and you know what she placed her hands on either side of his head and leaned down a heavyeyed morethantipsy woman what she hummed in her throat as he stroked her breasts you can do that she murmured i dont mind at all but i was saying we had a system no he had a system i was just there he would put on classical music chopin always the same sonata i sometimes still get a tick in my eye when i hear it he would close the door lock it lest a wandering servant be shocked by the goingson though the staff would hardly have business in there at ten fortyfive in the evening it was mostly always at ten fortyfive so he was a creature of habit michael flipped open buttons and found her flesh umm no you dont she sat up again youre trying to distract me he would turn off the lights get into bed he would kiss me three times not two not four but three times then he would i dont think i want a playbyplay here of ridgeways style in the sack in the marital bed please well well just skip right along then since it isnt very interesting anyway at elevenohfive he would wish me a pleasant night and go to sleep the twentyminute special huh you could set your clock by it oh michael she stretched her arms up giving him tempting glimpses of soft white swells i thought it was me i thought that was just the way it was had to be but it isnt it wasnt it doesnt she cupped her breasts in her hands let her eyes close its never predictable with you i never know what youll do where youll touch me next or how and its never proper its so wonderfully improper the things you do with your hands with your mouth on me she dropped her hands to his chest do you have any idea what its like to discover at thirty that you have a sex drive no he couldnt help but smile at her she was so beautifully drunk i found mine at sixteen and never lost sight of it she laughed flinging her head back and making his teeth ache with the need to bite into that slim white throat oh but this is better has to be its like finding seraphinas dowry somehow you know its there somewhere or hope it is and then when you find it after all that time all that wondering its so sweet since you found that elusive sex drive his hands slid up her torso why dont we put it to use im going to make you sweat she eased down again scraped her teeth over his jaw you might even beg now youre getting cocky i take that as a challenge to demonstrate she shoved up her sleeves which fell right back down again are you man enough to agree not to touch me until i say you can he lifted a brow wondering just what the lady had in mind your loss sugar i dont think so ultimately no hands she murmured and pressed his to his sides except mine she lowered her lips to his brushed teased nibbled margo said you had a very tasty mouth she smiled when he winced she was right i think ill stay right here a while she lingered on his mouth changing the angle the depth the tone of the kiss light one moment intense and urgent the next then sultry smoky his fingers aching curled into the carpet not bad for a beginner he managed in a voice rusty with need and i learn fast your hearts pounding michael she nipped at the pulse in his throat cruised over dampening flesh then she gripped his shirt at the shoulder pulled when the seam stayed fast he chuckled from both humor and frustration want me to do that for you i can handle it she eased back kept her eyes on his as she yanked hard the seam ripped exposing muscle and skin she pounced on it like a starving cat oh your body she whispered then crossed her hands taking hold of his shirt and sending cloth and buttons flying you have such a body tough and scarred and tight i want it her mouth streaked down his shoulder over his chest quick greedy bites and sucks feathering openmouthed kisses and flicks of tongue but when his hands came up to grip her hips she shoved them away with a single word mine rising up she shrugged off the shirt then once more bent to her task she was destroying him in a way he hadnt known he could be destroyed slowly inevitably she was taking him in a way he hadnt known he could be taken greedily intently his breath thickened caught released on a groan when she laved her tongue low on his belly every muscle quivered taut wires close to snapping thoughts filled and emptied from his mind so rapidly that he couldnt gain hold sensation rammed violently into sensation like two clenched fists the scent of her elegant as royalty the sheen of her skin glossy as a damp rose and the stroke of her hands restless as lust giddy on her own power she tugged open the button of his jeans felt his body tense like a runner on the mark she lowered her mouth tasting there just there where denim and flesh met and heard him choke out her name she could do this to him she thought as she dipped her tongue under the denim to tease she could create this desperation and weakness this violent need in a strong vital man she could make him want her to the point of madness and she could take whatever she wanted from him she nudged the material down closed her teeth over his hip and heard the breath explode out of his lungs he was helpless she knew lost in her and she could make him ache she took him into her mouth clamped him in a wet velvet vice and shot his system into chaos his hands fisted in her hair as his body bucked under her when her mouth cruised up to his belly again over quaking muscle he was ready to kill to have her still gripping her hair he yanked her head back reared up she felt one shocking jolt at the dark burn of his eyes then his mouth was clamped on hers i didnt say you could touch me she panted it out as his lips branded her throat her shoulders her breasts you didnt beg i need you he found her with his hand shoved her over the peak he was still clinging to now goddamn it take me in triumphant she threw her head back and her laugh was rich and wild locking her legs around his waist she arched back yes bowed like a bridge when he drove himself into her she cried out no longer surprised but shuddering nonetheless over the speed and violence of the orgasm she arrowed up again her body locked to his her hips pumping more she demanded tearing nails down his back michael more blind with greed she shoved him back dug her hands into his waist and took more the storm raged through him whipping toward peak but he could see her rising and falling over him her eyes closed to heated slits her head back in abandon the animal inside him mated with hers until shed ridden both to exhaustion through hazy vision he saw her melt down on him and felt the quakes of the aftershocks rush through her his own body felt bruised numbed weightless so that he wasnt even aware that his arms were locked tight around her like a man holding everything that mattered told you i could do it she murmured turning her lips to his throat yeah you sure showed me he pressed his lips to her hair wallowed there laura he said her name quietly almost to himself then closed his eyes and tried for both their sakes not to hear the rest of it i love you love you you wanted me yes i wanted you her hair smelled like sunlight weakened him all over again will you do something for me michael yeah anything terrifying thought anything will you carry me to bed im still drunk sure baby just hold on he rose with her a feat that even in her impaired state made her heart flutter and one more thing her head dropped limply against his shoulder and when she moaned he had panicked visions of finding a basin to shove under her face before she was sick okay dont worry ill take care of you itll be fine all right warm and soft and trusting she curled into him then blinked against sudden hard light what what her head cocked curiously why are we in the bathroom its the handiest place to be sick go ahead and toss up that wine sugar youll feel better im not going to toss up perfectly good champagne she wrapped her arms tighter when he tried to set her down im not going to be sick then she flopped back dead weight like a woman in a faint and laughed until it echoed off the walls oh thats so sweet you were going to hold my head while i vomited god michael she raised up again kissed him sloppily youre the cutest thing just so cute and sweet i could eat you right up my hero embarrassed he narrowed his eyes maybe ill just stick your head in the toilet anyway if youre not going to lose the champagne and chocolate what do you want i told you to carry me to bed i would think it would be obvious smiling she traced a finger down his chest i want you to want me again if it wouldnt be an imposition he glanced down at her warm rosy naked female his female i guess i could manage that good and do you think you could well she leaned over and whispered something in his ear that made his blood take a quick trip to his loins thats pretty inappropriate behavior but he made a beeline for the bed under the circumstances chapter eighteen experiencing a first hangover laura discovered wasnt nearly as much fun as experiencing a first drunk instead of having a head filled with light and color and gloriously rambling ideas she had one crammed with noise along the lines of a poorly directed high school band with the percussion section banging away gleefully at her left temple her system didnt feel free and floaty but clogged the way her mouth seemed clogged with enough dirt to make half a dozen mud pies she was grateful that michael had left her alone rather than witness the humiliation she wouldnt think about the fact that shed spent the night in his bed and now would have to stagger into the house where her family and the staff would shoot her questioning looks she tried to drown those unmerciful drummers under the shower then bit down on her lip when she realized the new sound she heard was her own whimpering under normal circumstances she would never have gone through any of michaels things but she finished up a fumbling search through the mirrored medicine cabinet and bathroom drawers and nearly wept when she found a bottle of aspirin she took four another break in tradition then deciding she couldnt be much more intrusive used his toothbrush she didnt look in the mirror until shed dressed and even then it was a mistake her face was deathly pale her eyes smudged and swollen and as she didnt have so much as a tube of lipstick with her there was nothing she could do about it knowing she had to get it over with she stepped outside and moaned quietly as the sunlight sent hot little spears into her eyes her head didnt feel like the practice field for a marching band now now it felt like glass very thin very fragile glass and it was balanced precariously on her neck hows it going sugar she winced jerked her head fell off smashed on the steps at her feet thank god she had another one she turned it struggled to smile as michael dusted his hands on his hips and walked toward her good morning im sorry i didnt hear you get up the way you were sawing them off i figured youd sleep till noon the insult of the headache faded snore she certainly did not snore she wouldnt dignify such a lie with a comment i have to be at the shop in a couple of hours youre working today she didnt look to be in any shape for it to him give yourself a break laura and go crawl back into bed saturdays are our busiest day he shrugged his shoulders her choice hows the head which one now she did smile a little certainly a man like michael would understand hangovers its bad but no longer unbearable next time you go on a bender chug plenty of water and pop a couple aspirin before you pass out it usually helps take the edge off the morning after i dont intend to have a next time but thanks now that might be a shame he trailed a finger over the back of her hand you make a very inventive drunk hows the memory her blood must have been moving still for she felt it rise up to sting her cheeks its good a little too good i certainly wouldnt have i cant believe that i she shut up closed her eyes you can stop me anytime from making a total fool of myself i kinda like it come here he drew her against him cradling her aching head on his shoulder ice water he murmured stick your face right into a bowl of ice water try to get some food in your system then you just have to tough out the rest of it okay shed have preferred just staying there for the rest of her life i have to go i shouldnt have slept here last night with her face pressed against him she didnt see the disappointment and the hurt shadow his i cant imagine what everyone will think right his eyes were impassive again when he drew her away you go on and shore up the damage to the templeton name i didnt mean forget it he wasnt going to let it touch him forget it he repeated why dont you go riding with me tomorrow tomorrow she pressed her fingers to her eyes if she didnt get them out of the sun soon they were going to implode we have the treasure hunt well go in the morning youll be back for seraphina riding it had been years since shed ridden in the hills through the forest all right id love it can we go about eight that way i can sure eight he gave her a quick pat on the cheek before walking away dont forget the ice water no i but he had already disappeared around the side of the building baffled by his rapid shift of mood she considered following him then she looked at her watch and accepted the reality that her obligations for the day didnt allow time to puzzle out the enigma of michael fury no one asked questions demanded answers or voiced disapproval when laura tucked her children into bed that night she realized she had gotten through the entire day without having anyone question her absence from her own bed oh thered been vibes in the air worry curiosity but shed dodged even those shed survived a hangover as well and the world had not come to an end maybe just maybe laura templeton did not have to be perfect after all she left her daughters and crossed the hall to her own room there she freshened her lipstick brushed her hair she needed to go and join her parents and the old friends who had come for dinner she needed to make certain everyone was comfortable and entertained and oh she needed to stretch out for five minutes just five she promised herself as she lay down crosswise on the bed a quick catnap would set her up help her get through the rest of the evening the minute she closed her eyes she was dead to the world something has to be done mrs t hands gripped tight at her waist ann stood in susans quiet sitting room in the tower suite it has to be all right annie sit down it had been a long evening and though shed been pleased to see old friends susan had hoped for a few moments of solitude before bed the look on anns face warned her she wouldnt get it now whats the trouble you know what the trouble is mrs t too fretful to sit ann wandered the room fussing with curtains realigning candlesticks fluffing pillows you saw how pale and tired miss laura was today you had to see for yourself yes i did see and ive been pale and tired myself the day after ive overindulged in champagne oh as if that was all of it and thats something shes never done before him either perhaps she should have susan thought she sighed annie stop tidying the room and sit down she spent the night with him the whole of it over there with him above the horses because her lips wanted to twitch susan glanced down at her own hands as ann sat across from her yes annie im aware of that well it cant go on and that ann felt was that just how do you expect to prevent a grown woman from doing as she chooses the fact is laura is very attracted to michael perhaps more than attracted shes been lonely and unhappy and now she isnt hes taking advantage of that hes a bad influence why she didnt even come down and say good night to her guests shes never shirked her duties that way she was tired annie and the greenbelts are my and tommys friends which isnt the point at all really you cant worry yourself so about all of this youre her mother but you know i love her just as you love my girl when margo had troubles you worried yourself for her yes understanding susan laid a hand over anns theyre our children and thats as its always been but children grow and go their own way no matter how we worry thats how its always been too shed listen to you mrs t ive been thinking on it the words came out fast now and seemed so logical to her miss laura she hasnt gone away with the girls for such a long time shes been working hard and hasnt had a holiday the spring vacations coming up for ali and kayla they could go away for a while you know how the girls love to go to disneyland if you put the notion in miss lauras head shed take them and it would give her time and distance shed have a clearer eye about what shes doing i think laura and the girls deserve a break but a week in disneyland isnt going to change her feelings for michael annie shes just caught up right now if she had some time without him clouding her mind shed see that man for just what he is at a loss susan threw up her hands let them slap down on the arms on her chair in a show of impatience for gods sake annie what is he why do you dislike him so intensely hes a brute is what he is a brute and a user and probably a fortune hunter as well hell hurt her in more ways than one and im not having it she pressed her lips tight together im not to clear her own temper susan took a long breath i want you to explain to me what hes done you know very well that when he was no more than twelve he was sneaking around this house he was joshs friend and giving mister josh stolen cigarettes daring him into all manner of foolishness boys do foolish things at twelve christ annie i taught my best friend how to smoke when we were fourteen its stupid but its children and was it a childs foolishness that sent him to jail whats this susans face paled a bit michael was in jail how do you know i hear things he was locked up for fighting in a bar oh they didnt keep him but overnight but they locked him up right enough the man likes to use his fists oh for heavens sakes i thought hed robbed a bank or killed someone i may not approve but i cant condemn a man for sleeping in a cell overnight because he punched someone in a bar you dont even know who started it or why or how can you make excuses suddenly furious ann sprang up how can you the man is with your daughter night after night hell use them on her eventually shell do or say something and hell use his fists on her the way he did on his own mother what are you saying a jiggle of fear settled low in her stomach a man who will strike his own mother bloody her mouth and blacken her eye wont think twice about doing the same to another woman shes so small and delicate mrs t i cant bear the thought of what he could do to her you believe michael fury beat his own mother susan said slowly she told me so herself came looking for him here with her poor face all black and blue i took her into my room and did what i could for her and she told me michael had come home the night before drunk and had hurt her had driven her husband off then left her there alone i wanted to go to the police but she wouldnt have it she whirled away emotions choking her ah he belonged in a cell he belonged in a cage if you had only seen her face if that man raises a finger to miss laura i annie i did see michaels mother susan rose i did speak with her then you know he ran off to sea just after that rather than face what hed done mrs t we have to make him go away from here we cant have a man whos capable of what he is near miss laura and her babies ill tell you what she told me annie after she came to shout at me for keeping michael here after that night here ann had to press a hand to her outraged heart to keep it in place that man was here you let him stay here in this house after he slept in the stables until he shipped out he never laid a hand on that woman you saw her she told me she blamed him she couldnt blame herself not then but i had the truth out of her it was her husband who beat her and who had done so before she had come to work with black eyes before and michael didnt put them there but she said i dont care what she said susan shouted the memory of it still made her blood burn a mother blaming a child for her own failings that boy came home and saw his stepfather beating his mother and he protected her the thanks he got for giving that beast what he deserved was having his own mother kick him out of the house tell him he had no right to interfere that he was to blame she stopped for a moment struggled to calm herself and when michael was gone when she knew shed lost him she sat right here in this room and broke down she told me everything but she told me i believed ann sank down in a chair oh sweet god she begged me to help her find him to persuade him to come back she was alone you see and michaels mother was a woman who didnt know how to be alone i want to believe that somewhere inside she regretted what shed done what shed said to him and she loved him but all i saw was a miserable selfish woman who was afraid to be without a man even if the man was the son shed driven away oh mrs t ann pressed her hand against her mouth the tears that swam in her eyes were tears of guilt and pity youre sure of this annie forget what she told you even what ive just said and tell me honestly what you see when you look at him as if you knew nothing more about him than what youve seen since he came here he works hard she sniffled and tugged a tissue from her pocket hes good with children and his animals hes kind to them hes got the devil in his eye and something hard comes into it he doesnt watch his language as he should around the children and i dont think she trailed off wiped her eyes hes good to them and hes been good for them i cant deny it and im ashamed theres no shame in worrying over the ones you love im sorry you were living with the fear that laura had gotten herself involved with the kind of man you thought he was ive hardly slept since hes been here i kept waiting for him to oh the poor boy what a terrible thing to go through and him barely old enough to shave regular youll sleep better now susan murmured but im still keeping my eye on him she managed a weak smile men who look that way theyre not to be trusted around a woman well both worry susan squeezed annies hand we know our laura dont we she needs home family love when everything else is brushed aside thats what she is i dont know if shell find that with michael or what it will do to her if she doesnt shed found something else the thrill of streaking over the hills of racing through lowlying fog that hugged the ground like a river of hearing the thunder of hooves and feeling the strong sleek mount beneath her gather itself to jump she sailed over a fallen log and burst into a clearing where the sun flashed white oh god its wonderful after reining in she leaned low over the horses neck ill never be able to do without this again youre a clever man michael fury she straightened and turned to study him as he sat easily on max how could i buy a horse for myself and not buy that mare for ali ill give you a hell of a deal on three the little bay gelding fits kayla like a glove you ride like a demon laura he reached down to pat the neck of the mare laura rode and fancy here suits you i figured she would apparently you know your horses and your women his eyes flicked up to hers his woman for the moment apparently you look stunning vital rested i slept like the dead last night nearly ten hours trying her hand at flirting she sent him a sidelong look under her lashes did you miss me hed reached for her half a dozen times during the night nah when her face fell he laughed grabbing her by the shirt he tugged her sideways just enough to meet her lips what do you think he dismounted lets give them a rest weve been riding them hard he tossed the reins over a branch as she slid agilely to the ground did you find any more coins yesterday nothing not even a bottle cap i cant oh i didnt tell you did i the other night i heard for reasons he couldnt pin down it had annoyed him that she hadnt come running to him with her coin good for you it was the oddest thing she stretched muscles unused to riding i put my hand right on it just the way you would if youd dropped a quarter and reached down to she blinked lost her train of thought he was standing there just standing there with the sun at his back and his eyes focused on her face what is it you said youd dreamed of me now and years ago on the cliffs in your room in the forest youd turn and id be there yes wasnt it foolish to have her heart lodged in her throat to feel both fear and anticipation prickle hot on her skin michael and id touch you he floated a palm over the curve of her breast felt the quiver there were parts of her life that were barred to him parts of his that he would keep barred from her but here here was equal ground and taste you laid his mouth over hers felt the heat and take you swept her into his arms felt the ache and i will she lay beside him naked in the sunlight with birds singing in the trees he hadnt torn her clothes it amazed her that she wouldnt have stopped him from doing so even if shed had to ride back to templeton house bare as lady godiva instead he had been so gentle so tender that even now she could have wept ive never made love outside she murmured i didnt know it could be so lovely she sat up stretched so many firsts i dont suppose there are many firsts i can give you she smiled down at him bad michael furys already done them all and then some he said with his eyes closed theres so much you dont talk about knowing it was all too typical to pry into a mans past when you were in love didnt stop her she traced a finger down his chest so many secrets inside you told me a couple of yours last night quid pro quo no of course not he opened his eyes you want to know something about me ask she shook her head and started to shift but he reached up and held her still afraid of the answer no she said steadily im not and im surprised youd think i would be fine ask i she hesitated still then gave in all right you said you were married before but you never mentioned her or what happened her name was yvonne we got divorced all right miffed by the terse response she reached for her shirt we should be getting back shit he rubbed his hands over his face and sat up as she shrugged into the soft and now wrinkled broadcloth okay you want to know i met her when i was racing she liked to party with drivers and you fell in love with her christ youre a child in so many ways he stood and dragged on his jeans i fell into bed with her we liked each other we had good sex so we kept falling into bed and we kept having good sex then she got pregnant oh she rose slowly and kept her eyes on her trousers as she slipped them on you said you didnt have children i assumed do you want to hear this or not she looked up surprised by the bitterness in his voice not if you dont want to tell me if id wanted to talk about it i probably would have he swore again then took her arm as she bent to retrieve her boots sit down just sit goddamn it nobody uses that wounded look the way you do he pressed his fingers to his eyes and struggled for control once hed opened up this part of his life he would have to open others she would ask more questions he would give her the answers he accepted it there in the sunwashed woods with his body still warm from hers that this was the beginning of the end okay she got pregnant so we talked about it the best thing for everybody was to go for the abortion simple quick done so we made the arrangements im sorry thats a difficult decision you you never questioned that youd been the one who that id gotten her pregnant yvonne wasnt a liar or a cheat she said the kid was mine it was mine we were friends laura im sorry it was hard for both of you we figured we were doing the smart thing i was trying to make a name for myself on the circuit she had just started a new job a baby didnt fit hell neither of us knew anything about kids about parenthood we were what we were he looked her in the eye scrabblers looking for a good time she kept her gaze level are you telling me it was easy a casual shrug an oops no his eyes shifted stared off into the trees into the shadows no it wasnt easy it just made sense we agreed it was the best solution but the night before we were to go in for it we figured out something else we both wanted it we both wanted the baby it didnt make any sense we didnt know what we were doing but we both wanted the baby she didnt have the abortion no we got married we figured what the hell lets do it lets have a baby she tried to knit things a smile ghosted around his mouth she didnt have a clue we read books went in for one of those sonogram things jesus christ it was just beautiful we argued about names and did all the things i guess everybody does the smile went away and she thought as she watched his eyes so did he middle of the night she was about four months along she started bleeding bad she was in pain and scared we were both so scared i got her to the hospital but it was already pretty much over by then we lost the baby im sorry she rose again but didnt touch him im so sorry michael theres nothing more painful than losing a child no theres nothing the doctors said she was young and healthy and we could try again in a little while we pretended we would tried to keep it together but we started fighting sniping at each other id slam out leave her alone shed slam out leave me alone one night i came home and she was waiting for me shed figured it out before i had she was a smart woman wed stopped being friends all wed had to keep us married was the baby and the baby was gone now we were stuck and we didnt have to be stuck she was right so we decided to start being friends again and stop being married end of story she touched him now took his face in her hands felt the tension theres nothing i can say to ease that kind of grief the kind you carry with you forever no matter what he shut his eyes let his brow rest on hers i wanted the baby i know she eased her arms around him you loved it already i understand im sorry michael gently she stroked his back im sorry i made you tell me it was almost ten years ago its done he drew back then swore at the tears on her cheek dont do that hell you should have asked me something else uneasy he brushed the tears away like about how i used to stunt double for mel gibson she sniffled straggled to give him the smile he wanted did you really you women always go for mel maybe you should come down to hollywood with me i could introduce you he twined a blond curl around his finger me and max we have to go down tomorrow tomorrow she shook her head youre going to la you didnt mention it just got a call saturday with a shrug he sat down to tug on his boots action western with your pal mel he wants me and max so we got to do some meetings some test shots see if we can give them what theyre looking for thats wonderful id think youd be more excited its a job i dont suppose youre interested in tagging along id love to but i cant leave the girls and work how how long will you be gone she bit the question back theyll be so impressed when i tell them ive got a guy coming in for a few days to see to the stock while im gone i should be back by friday oh only a few days she smiled again if you are i have this opening i have to go to on friday night would you like to go an opening of what its an exhibit at the art gallery expressionists to his credit he didnt snort you want me to go look at paintings and make all sorts of idiotic comments on brushstrokes and underlying meanings his cocked his head do i look like a guy whos going to stand around sipping espresso and talking about the use of color on canvas no he was sitting on a stump bare to the waist with faint purpling braises on his ribs his hair was wild and tousled no you dont no more he thought than she looked like a woman who would toss aside responsibility and ran off to la with her lover for a week what the hell is she doing with me he wondered as he rose and to me if this goes on much longer what will we do to each other wed better get back he shrugged into his shirt you dont want to keep seraphina waiting michael she laid a hand on his chest ill miss you good he lifted her into the saddle chapter nineteen he wasnt gone a few days but nearly two weeks laura reminded herself every night that he was under no obligation to call her to tell her what was delaying him or just so that she could hear his voice she reminded herself that they had an adult relationship in which each party was free to come and go as he or she pleased it was because shed never had a relationship like it before she told herself that she was fretting worrying feeling hurt she certainly had plenty to keep her busy and she had learned the hard way never to allow a man to be responsible for providing her with a fulfilling life that was her job one she intended never to neglect again with her work her children her family and friends she had a full contented life perhaps she wanted to share it with michael and to be a part of his life but she wasnt a lovestruck teenager who sat by the phone hour by hour waiting for it to ring though she did try to will it to ring a time or two at the moment though she wasnt worried about the phone she had other problems on her hands alis spring dance recital would begin in less than two hours not only was no one ready but one of the kittens had coughed up a hairball in the middle of kaylas bed causing much dismay and more female disgust and one of the barn cats had gone exploring seducing bongo into giving mad chase through the herb garden which resulted in bad news for the chamomile and tansy and earned bongo a bloody nose nothing laura did could lure the insulted hissing cat down from the cypress tree where he had taken shelter and bongo continued to whimper pitifully under her bed despite all of that her biggest problem was ali herself the girl was moody uncooperative and whiny her hair was terrible she claimed her stomach was upset she didnt want to go to the recital she hated recitals she hated everything her patience strained laura tried one more time to style alis hair to the childs specifications honey if youre nervous about tonight its all right youll be wonderful you always are im not nervous ali pouted into the mirror i never get nervous before i dance i just dont want to go people are depending on you your instructors the other girls in your troupe the family you know how excited grandma and granddad were when they left for uncle joshs everyones looking forward to tonight i cant depend on anybody can i i have to do what i say ill do but nobody else does around the circuit again laura thought im sorry youre disappointed your father wont be there hes i dont care about him in a badtempered move ali shrugged and scooted out from under her mothers hands he never comes anyway it doesnt matter then whats the problem nothing ill go ill do it because i keep my promises my hair looks much better now she said with dignity thank you honey if youd i have to finish getting dressed she pressed her lips together a small girl pretty in her tights and ballet skirt its not your fault mama i didnt mean it to sound that way im not angry with you then what mama kaylas wail bounced down the hallway i cant find my red shoes i want to wear my red ones you can go help her ali said and tried to smile ill be downstairs in a minute thanks for doing my hair over its all right because she could see the sorrow haunting alis eyes she leaned down and kissed her on both cheeks i love playing with your hair and i suppose if you wanted to put just a little of that lip gloss on it would be all right you mean before we go not just for onstage just for tonight laura tapped her fingers against alis lips youre not growing up on me any faster than i can help it maaamaaa my shoes and neither is she laura murmured im coming downstairs ali ten minutes tops she found the shoes who would have expected to find them right there on the shoe shelf in the closet after pulling a brush through her own hair laura herded her girls toward the door come on troops get a move on this train leaves in five minutes ill get it annie she called out when the doorbell rang could you check on bongo before you leave hes under my bed and she broke off as she pulled the door open and found michael standing on the other side michael youre home it looks that way if she had leapt into his arms right there in her own home there in front of her children he doubted he could have stuck with the decision hed made but she didnt she only smiled at him held out a hand it was kayla who leapt did you bring max back with the simplicity of childhood she hugged his waist and lifted her mouth for a kiss did he come home too sure max and i travel together whered you get the red shoes kid pretty snappy mama bought them theyre my favorites you came michael halted his admiring study of kaylas red shoes and lifted his gaze to alis face she looked he thought so much like her mother just then with that stunned wonder on her face and the emotion swimming in her eyes i told you i would i thought youd forgotten i thought you were too busy forget an invitation from a beautiful ballerina to watch her dance he shook his head as he straightened boy that wouldnt say much about my memory head cocked he held out the bouquet of pink baby roses we do have a date right you didnt go call some other guy to take my place no are these for me mouth open in a litle o of confused delight she stared at the roses for me who else for me she breathed it taking the flowers in her hands thank you mama michael brought me flowers i see and her eyes stung a bit theyre lovely well use the waterford annie stood a few steps back in the hall her hands folded her eyes on michaels face when a girl receives her first flowers from a man they should be treated as something very special i want to put them in the vase myself and so you should it will only take a moment miss laura yes all right thank you annie ill help kayla raced down the hall let me smell them ah her first flowers laura murmured man why do females always get weteyed over a bunch of posies which reminded him that hed never given laura flowers never real ones just something plucked carelessly out of the ground hed never thought of it had never he realized given her anything but good hot sex flowers are symbolic and she remembered the pretty little wildflowers hed given her so sweet so simple so right everything is to women you could be right she turned back beaming at him it was so thoughtful of you to bring them and to come i didnt realize shed asked you had no idea she was counting on it she asked me a couple of weeks ago he dipped his hands in his pockets laura hadnt asked him he remembered hadnt mentioned it ive managed to avoid ballet for thirtyfour years this ought to be an experience i think youll find it painless she started toward him now and he took his hand out of his pocket to take hers before she could touch him so how are you he asked fine was he just tired she wondered or was this distance she felt did things go well in la yeah it went theyll start shooting in about three weeks well get a couple months work out of it maybe more youll stay in la during the filming she said slowly as a weight sank in her stomach he shrugged it wasnt the time to get into all of this and he was spared when ali marched back down the hall bearing her vase of baby roses like a trophy dont they look beautiful mama annies going to put them in my room theyre perfect we really need to go performers have to be there thirty minutes before curtain ill take those now sweetheart annie slipped the vase from alis hand and ill be there to see you dance she inclined her head toward michael in what from anyone else he would have taken as a friendly smile we all will it wasnt impossible to put everything out of his mind for a couple of hours the kid was so cute all of them were but it was hard to sit beside laura in the middle of all those people the families the partners the couples and not be miserable but hed had time and hed had the distance to allow himself to take a good hard look at what was going on and what was happening to him hed fallen for her all the way it would never work hed seen himself in the dingy little bar in south la drinking beer and swapping stories with wranglers going back to his hotel room after a long day sweaty dirty smelling of horse and hed seen himself growing up in a house that had breathed neglect and violence and tension hed seen himself for what he was a man who had chased all the wrong things most of his life and had found plenty of them a cliff rat son of a waitress and a wastrel who would in time and with effort be able to make a decent living and hed seen laura the templeton heiress sitting in her plush country club drinking tea dressed in her tidy suit running a fancy boutique strolling through a grand hotel that she owned he didnt doubt that hed given her something or that under different circumstances they could give each other more but it would be only a matter of time before the haze of lust cleared from her eyes and she saw what she was doing having an affair with a horse trainer they were both better off that hed seen it first knowing her he doubted she would be able to break it off clean she was too soft too kind to walk without guilt worse she might continue the relationship long after shed realized her mistake because of that sterling sense of obligation he was no good for her he knew it the people who knew both of them understood it eventually she would know it and it would kill him maybe if he hadnt run into that old buddy of his in la the old merchant marine stevedore hed shipped with drunk with raised hell with one of the men who had gone to war with him for profit after the sea lost its lure but they had run into each other and the stories were rehashed the memories swam back and for one harsh illuminating moment he had looked into the surly bitter usedup face of the man across from him and had seen himself michael fury was a man he never wanted to touch laura a man he never wanted her to know if such a man tried to touch her to know her she would cringe in shock before either of them had to cope with that he would do her a favor and slip out of her life as ah twirled on stage laura laid a hand over his and squeezed and broke his heart dont they look wonderful margo murmured beside her josh tapped his foot absently to the music and continued to watch his niece theyre all great but alis the best naturally she chuckled a little leaned closer to his ear but i was talking about laura and michael hmm distracted he shifted and glanced at the couple one row in front of them laura and michael what theyre wonderful together yeah i guess he trailed off stunned as the meaning seeped in what do you meantogether ssh she shushed him fighting back another laugh together together what are you blind his throat went dry and tight theyre not seeing each other theyre not dating dating she had to clamp a hand over her mouth for gods sake josh theyve been sleeping together for weeks how could you not know sleeping shock rage disbelief all slammed together against the words how the hell do you know that because laura told me she hissed into his ear and because if she hadnt i have eyes in my head ssh she ordered when he opened his mouth youre annoying people and heres alis solo he shut his mouth but not his mind he had a great deal to think about and as far as he was concerned his old pal michael fury had a great deal to answer for thered been nothing he could do about it that night but go home and grill his wife then argue with her over the situation josh put her attitude down to female hormones women found michael romantic which had always been his good luck and was the crux of the current problem josh found him in the paddock working a yearling on the lounge line i need to talk to you fury michael recognized the tone something was stuck in joshs craw he wasnt in the mood for it not when he was still thinking about the baffled hurt on lauras face the night before when hed given her a quick pat on the head and told her he was beat in other words im going to bed sugar and youre not invited still he released the yearling and walked to the fence where josh waited so talk are you sleeping with my sister ah well the time had come we dont sleep much michael said easily and braced when joshs hand whipped out and gripped his shirt watch it harvard what the fuck do you think youre doing who the hell do you think you are i asked her to rent this place to you do you a favor and you just jump right in i didnt jump alone damned if hed take the rap for that shes a big girl josh i didnt lure her into the stables promising her candy i didnt force her the idea of it curdled his blood then shamed him you wouldnt have to he shot back you forget who youre talking to i know you mick know your style christ we cruised together often enough yeah we did eyes level michael pried joshs fingers off his shirt but that was all right the two of us going out sniffing out babes this is my sister i know who she is if you knew if you had any idea what shes been through the past few years how easily bruised she is youd stay the hell away from her the women you played with always knew the rules went in for the game thats not laura and because shes your sister because shes a templeton shes not entitled to play bitterness rose like bile certainly not with me i trusted you josh said quietly i always trusted you its one thing for you to hit on kate and on margo but im damned if im going to stand back and watch you make it three for three his eyes went very cold very hard at his side his fist clenched and in his mind he saw it strike out fast it took all of his will and a lifetime of friendship not to follow through get the fuck away from me now you want to take a swing you take one weve gone around before not like this michael thought as his system revved toward violence now they were men and the stakes were higher and if he had any family any that really mattered this was it standing here right now prepared to break his neck why dont we try this instead ill be out by the end of the week ive already started making the arrangements torn now between friendship and family josh narrowed his eyes what arrangements you barely have your foundation up on the new construction ill probably sell it as is once ive relocated to la is that far enough away from your sister harvard or do i have to go to hell when did this come up do i have to check that with you too go away josh im busy here and youve made your point im not sure i have and as he watched his oldest friend walk away josh was no longer sure what the point was he knew she would come there was no way to avoid or prevent it they hadnt been together in two weeks and she would expect him to want her of course he did pitifully but he wouldnt touch her it was only worse now hed nearly talked himself out of his earlier decision had told himself he could find a way to make it work between then the visit from josh had snapped things back into reality he would make it clean he would make it quick she would be hurt a little there was no way to avoid or prevent that either but she would get over it still though hed known she would come he hadnt expected her so soon hadnt expected himself to be so unprepared when he saw her standing in his doorway with the sun in her hair and her eyes so pure so gray so warm i took off from the shop a little early she began she knew she was talking quickly bubbling over with nerves something was wrong she could have been deaf and blind and still have sensed it i thought since my parents were taking the girls into carmel for dinner id see if youd like me to fix yours women like you dont cook sugar they have cooks youd be surprised she came in not waiting for the invitation and swung past him into the kitchen mrs williamson taught us all including josh at least the basics i make an exceptional fettuccine alfredo i thought id see what you had before i brought over ingredients seeing her poking around the kitchen as if she belonged there as if he could come home after a hard day and find her cheerfully waiting for him tore him apart so his voice was cool and careless im not much on fancy sauces sugar well well try something else why wouldnt he say her name she wondered fighting panic he hadnt once said her name since hed come home she turned to him and couldnt prevent herself from leading with her heart oh i missed you michael so much she was halfway across the room reaching for him he could all but feel the way her soft delicate arms would wrap around his neck he stepped back lifted both hands to ward her off im filthy i havent had a chance to jump in the shower you wouldnt want to mess up a nice silk blouse why should it matter hed once torn one off her he hadnt held her in days yet he stood there now with was it boredom in his eyes what is it michael her stomach jittered echoed in her voice are you angry with me deliberately he tilted his head why do you do that why do you always assume that whatevers going on around you is your fault or your responsibility thats a real problem youve got there he added as he walked past her to get a beer out of the refrigerator he twisted off the top drank deep do i look mad to you no she folded her hands gathered her composure no you dont you look vaguely annoyed that im in your way i assumed youd want me to come that youd want to be with me tonight its a nice thought but dont you think this has run its course this you and me sugar weve taken this about as far as its going to go he tipped the beer back again wiped his mouth with the back of his hand listen youre a hell of a woman i like you i like your style in bed and out but we both know weve got to move on eventually she would breathe she told herself however tight the fist was around her heart she would breathe slow and easy i take that to mean youve decided to move on now some things came up when i was in la changed my plans i like to be fair with a woman ive slept with so i figured i should let you know im moving down there next week youre moving to la but your house never meant a damn to me he jerked his shoulder just a place ones the same as the other ones the same as the other she thought dully one house one woman why did you come back at all i left my horses he forced his lips into a grin you went to alis recital you brought her flowers i told the kid id go i dont make many promises so i dont break the ones i do make in this at least he didnt have to improvise youve got terrific kids laura ive liked getting to know them and i wouldnt have let her down last night if you go theyll be devastated theyll get over it he said his voice roughening im just a guy who passed through you cant believe that she stepped toward him you cant believe you mean so little to them they love you michael i im not their father dont lay that guilt trip on me ive got my own life to worry about and thats it she drew in another breath but it wasnt slow it wasnt easy see you around its been fun we meant nothing to you sure you did look sugar lifes long a lot of people walk through it both of us gave each other what we were looking for at the time just sex great sex he smiled again then because his reflexes were good dodged by inches the bottle she picked up and heaved at him before he could recover from the shock of that she was using her hands both of them shoved hard enough against his chest to knock him back two full steps hey how dare you how dare you lower what we have what i felt to some animal urge you son of a bitch you think you can brush me off like an inconvenient speck of lint then walk away a lamp went next and he could only watch speechless and duck fast when she threw whatever came to her hand at his head you didnt think id cause a scene did you she picked up an end table toppled it wrong finished with me are you just like that she snapped her fingers under his nose and im supposed to meekly walk away sob into my pillow and say nothing he backed up something like that so it wasnt going to be quick and clean he decided but messy nonetheless it had to be done break the place up if it makes you feel better its your stuff i expect even royalty has to have its tantrums dont you speak to me that way as if i were some interesting toy thats suddenly run amok you came into my life you exploded into my life and changed everything now youre just finished weve got nothing here and we both know it its just one of those times i saw it first she snatched up a bowl and sent it crashing through his kitchen window another time he might have been impressed with the force and velocity and her aim but at the moment he could only suffer i aint paying for the damages sugar and i never made you any promises told you any lies you knew yourself what you were getting when you came looking for me you wanted me to take the choice out of your hands you wanted me to take you so you wouldnt have to say it thats fact i didnt know how to say it she shot at him well i did and that was fine with both of us you havent got a choice here either its just done her breath was heaving shuddering as she tried to calm it temper her temper she knew was horrible when unlocked and when the key was turned with pain so much the worse thats cruel and its cold where the temper had missed its mark the quiet words arrowed straight into his heart thats life just done she let the tears come they hardly mattered so thats how this sort of thing is accomplished you say its just done and it is so much less complicated than divorce which is the only way ive ended a relationship i didnt cheat on you he couldnt bear having her think that of him or herself i never thought of another woman when i was with you this has nothing to do with you ive just got places to go nothing to do with me she closed her eyes the temper was gone now quickly as always drained to exhaustion i never would have said you were a stupid man michael or a shallow one but if you can say that youre both she lifted her hands rubbed away the tears she wanted to see him clearly since it would be the last time he was rough wild moody he was she thought everything i wonder that you dont even know what youre throwing away what i would have given you what you could have had with me and ali and kayla theyre your kids this was another hurt just as deep just as bloody templetons you wouldnt have given them to me youre wrong pathetically wrong i already had she walked to the door opened it you do what you have to do and go where you have to go but dont ever think it was just sex for me i loved you and the only thing more pitiful than that is that even as you turn me away like this so carelessly i still do chapter twenty michael took a step forward then stopped himself she didnt know what she was saying couldnt know he forced himself to step back from the door then turned and watched her walk away across the lawn continued to watch when she changed directions broke into a run shed go to the cliffs he realized she was angry and hurt so she would go to the cliffs to finish crying when she was finished she would think she would stay angry and hurt for a while and hate him longer than that but he knew that eventually she would see it was for the best she wasnt in love with him he scrubbed his hands over his face it already felt raw and battered maybe she thought she was or had talked herself into it he decided it was a kneejerk female reaction that was all it fit a woman like laura sex and love need and emotion she wasnt seeing the big picture but he could men who had lived as he had lived didnt end up happy ever after with women of her class her breeding sooner or later shed have come to the same conclusion found herself drawn back to the country club style maybe she would never forgive him for seeing it first but that couldnt be helped it would kill him to be with her and wait to know that when the passion had dimmed she would still stay with him shed be kind she couldnt be otherwise but he would know when he had become just another obligation he was doing them both a favor by getting out of her life josh was right and no one knew him better but he continued to stand staring out at the cliffs and the lone figure who stood there twisting the knife in his own heart finally he turned away and left the room that was as disrupted as his life to go down to his horses she hadnt known how completely a heart could shatter shed thought she knew when her marriage had ended laura had been certain she would never grieve in quite the same way again shed been right she thought now and pressed both hands to the ache in her heart this was different this was worse her feelings for peter had eroded so slowly over the years that there had barely been any left by the time it was over but this she squeezed her eyes tight and though the air was still and warm she shuddered shed never loved anyone the way she loved michael wildly outrageously brutally and all those feelings were so fresh so bright and new she had treasured them shed treasured discovering that she could feel again realizing she could want and be wanted as a woman shed admired what he was what hed made himself and she had fallen as much in love with the rough and dangerous man as the kind and gentle one within now he wanted it over and there was nothing she could do crying didnt help and her tears were already dry temper changed nothing and she was already ashamed of the way she had snapped in front of him hed think her pitiful now but that couldnt be helped either she stepped closer to the edge to watch the waves beat against rock she felt that way she mused battered by forces that were beyond her control lapped in a violent endless war with no choice but to stand it didnt help it simply didnt help to tell herself she wasnt alone that she had her family her children her home her work because she felt alone completely alone there on the edge of the world with only the thunder of the sea for company even the birds were gone no gulls cried today none wheeled white toward the hard blue sky or dipped toward the spewing waves she could see nothing but the rolling of the endless sea how could she accept it that she would never love this way again why was she expected to go on to do everything that needed to be done alone always alone and know that she would never turn in the night and find someone there who loved her why had she been given this glimpse into what she could have and feel and want if it was only going to be taken away and why was the one thing she had dreamed of all of her life always always just out of her reach she imagined that this was what seraphina had felt as she stood here so many years before grieving the loss of her lover laura looked down pictured that dizzying somehow liberating plunge into space and the fierce furious heart that had taken it had she screamed as the rocks rushed up laura wondered or had she strained to meet them trembling laura took a step back seraphina had found nothing but an end she thought a horribly easy end to pain her own wouldnt be easy because she would have to live with it live without michael and finally accept that she would live without her dream she barely noticed the rumble took it at first for the seas thrashing the ground seemed to jitter under her feet blank for a moment she stared down watched pebbles dance then the roar filled her ears and she knew panicked she tried to stumble back away from the edge the ground rolled unbalancing her as she grabbed frantically for a rock the wave of earth lifted her up and pushed her hard over the rim of the world the horses sensed it first eyes wheeling white panicked whinnies michael reached up to calm the mare he was grooming then he felt it the ground shuddered under him he swore as the noise grew and horses plunged above his head came the sound of crashing glass straining wood the freight train roar deafened him as he fought to keep his balance tack leapt off the walls and fell jangling on the shuddering brick he yanked stall doors open focused on getting his horses out in the wild confusion of the moment one thought pierced like a lance laura my god laura he stumbled forward fighting free when the earth tried to heave him back he raced into the brilliant sunlight ignoring the violent undulations of the tidy green lawn when he was knocked flat he clawed his way back up skidded down the slope no one would have heard him screaming her name as he ran toward the cliffs he didnt hear it himself it lasted no more than two minutes that stretch and shift of the earth all was still preternaturally still when he reached the cliffs shed gone home he told himself shed gone back to the house was safe secure a little shaken perhaps but a native californian didnt panic at every trembler hed go check on things himself as soon as he as soon as he made sure when he looked over the edge and saw her his legs buckled on a ledge fifteen feet below inches away from oblivion she lay white as death one of her arms was flung out so that her hand dangled over that narrow bed of rock into space he wouldnt remember the climb down to her the sharp bite of rock into his hands the small nasty avalanches of dirt and pebbles where his feet slid the stinging slices as roots and rock tore viciously at his clothes and flesh blind terror and instinct took him down fast where a single misstep one incautious grip would have sent him plunging cold sweat dripped into his eyes skidded along his skin he thought was sure she was dead but when he reached her he fought back the panic and fear and placed a trembling finger on the pulse in her throat and it beat okay okay his hands trembled still as he brushed the hair from her cheeks its all right youre all right he wanted to drag her up hold her rock her to him until this greasy sickness in his gut passed he knew better than to move her even with thoughts of aftershocks spinning in his head he knew he had to check the extent of her injuries before he risked shifting her concussion broken bones internal injuries christ paralysis he couldnt get his breath and had to squeeze his eyes shut for a moment and force air in and out until he was calm he made himself move slowly carefully lifting her eyelids to check the pupils gently moving his hands over her head gritting his teeth at the blood that smeared on his fingers her shoulder shed dislocated it he realized as he probed it would be screamingly painful when she woke dear god he wanted her to open her eyes his breath came fast and harsh as he continued to check her no breaks a lot of bruises and some bad cuts and scrapes but nothing was broken he agonized over her back and neck knew he had to leave her to call for an ambulance and the thought of leaving her alone there on that ledge knowing that if she woke it would be to terror and pain ripped him its going to be all right he took her hand squeezed gently trust me i wont be long ill be back when her fingers flexed in his relief burned through him in cold fire laura can you hear me dont move baby open your eyes if you can hear me but i dont want you to move her world was white and thick and cold so cold then there were shadows shifting receding voices whispering under a brilliant roar then his face close to hers dark eyes so blue they burned michael yeah he had to swallow couldnt fear had dried up every bit of the saliva in his mouth yeah youre going to be all right you just took a little fall i want you to michael she said again then her white world flashed red pain sliced through her long ragged blades of it that had her crying out rearing against his hands stop i know it hurts but i dont know how bad it is you have to lie still lie still but the way shed already twisted terrified him look at me look at me tell me if you can feel this he put a hand on her thigh pressed when she nodded he pressed her other leg move your feet for me laura okay good part of his throat opened again when he saw her feet move and flex youre a little banged up thats all and in shock he noted studying her pupils and in pain im going to get you up my shoulder she tried to reach for it fought off a wave of nausea black and boiling nausea the pain was unspeakable and even breathing threatened to make her retch did i break it no just knocked it out of joint his hands were clammy when he closed them over hers blood oozed from a dozen gashes he didnt even feel done it myself a couple times hurts like hell im going to be right back okay just a couple minutes no dont the wrenching pain slammed into her she tried to move away escape it sweat pearled on her face and her eyes went glassy okay hold on he couldnt leave her like this in shock and pain simply couldnt leave her here suffering he could fix it though the thought of what it would take out of both of them churned like acid in his stomach i can pop it back in ill hurt you but itll give you relief youre better off with a doctor though just hanging on until i can get please she closed her eyes agony was an icy white knife digging into muscle and bone i cant think i cant think over it he shifted braced himself beside her he wiped a hand over his mouth smearing blood dont think i want you to scream let out one long loud scream what scream goddamn it he held her down with one hand took a firm grip on her arm hissing when her eyes opened wide and stared into his now she felt the jerk the sick roll of it echoing in her stomach and white again whitehot then nothing his hands were slick with sweat and blood slippery enough that he nearly lost hold his stomach churned as he watched her eyes roll back felt her go limp under him gritting his teeth he snapped the joint into place then his breath whooshed out and he lowered his brow to hers oh baby im sorry im sorry he did lift her now cradling her in his arms rocking them both he lost track ten seconds ten minutes he had no sense of time passing until she stirred again its all done dont worry he pressed his lips to her hair buried his face there until he managed a greasy grip on control its better now yes she was floating pain was everywhere but it was dull now throbbing almost gently in her limbs its better i cant remember what happened an earthquake it knocked you off onto the ledge gently he checked her head the bleeding had stopped but he worried over the lump and the broken skin youre going to have some champion bruises knocked me off my god she turned her face into his chest shivered off the cliff nearly into the sea she thought onto the rocks below like seraphina how bad the house the horses oh michael the girls its fine everythings fine it wasnt a big one i dont want you to worry hed do that for both of them now that he was calmer he was taking stock the quake had shifted rock and earth there was nothing left of the rough path leading back up hed have to leave her climb back up and get ropes let me look at you he studied her face too pale he thought and her pupils were still dilated hows your vision blurry no its fine i have to see if the girls are all right theyre fine theyre with your parents remember in carmel she was lucid he told himself her pulse was rapid but strong how many fingers two she said and gripped the hand hed held up annie the house i said everythings fine trust me all right she closed her eyes again and let herself float i fell off the cliff thats about it he pressed her hand to his lips held it there until he could speak again now listen im going to have to leave you here for a couple minutes then im coming back and ill get you up you have to leave me you cant make the climb i want you to lie right here stay still promise me laura open your eyes and look at me promise me you wont move until i come back she looked at him i wont move until you get back its cold here he stripped off his denim jacket laid it over her thatll help a little just relax now relax and wait for me ill wait for you she murmured the world seemed to revolve in slow motion she watched him rise turn confused she saw him scale the cliff his hands and feet finding purchase showering down little cascades of dirt she smiled dreamily thinking he looked like a hero scaling castle walls was he saving her from the tower climbing up so high to kiss her awake no no he was leaving her she remembered he was leaving her she thought dully and watched too buffered by shock to feel alarm as he slid five full feet down the cliff face she watched as he swung a hand up dug in with bare fingers and fought his way up the rough unforgiving wall he was going away she thought but he would come back for her hed come back then he would leave again when he reached the top he stared down at her his eyes seemed oddly close again as if she could reach up and touch his face then he was gone and she was alone hed left her he didnt want to be part of her life any longer or to allow her to be part of his he would come back she didnt doubt that he would come back and do as hed promised but she would still be alone and she would survive laura thought because there really was no other choice she hadnt leapt from the cliff she hadnt tossed her life aside fate had pushed her but she would survive that as well and go on poor seraphina drifting a little laura turned her head she hadnt fought for life hadnt survived and had lost all of her dreams a tear trickled down her cheek in sympathy in sorrow and as she turned to brush it away her gaze fell on the small dark hole in the wall of the cliff a cave she thought hazily there was no cave on this ledge the rocks had moved she realized and sighed a little everything had moved she inched her way toward the opening a secret place she thought a hiding place a lovers place she was smiling as she pushed herself up sat smelled surely she smelled the faint scent of a young girls perfume seraphina she murmured even as she reached her hand inside the opening and laid it on the polished wood of a chest ive found you poor seraphina lost for so long she continued to speak and if the words were incoherent there was no one to hear she knelt waited for her head to stop spinning and tried to drag the chest into the light laura goddamn it her smile soft her eyes vague she lifted her face and saw him atop the cliff seraphina weve found her michael come and see stay put stay just where you are it was the hit on the head he thought and worked rapidly to secure the rope to the horn of maxs saddle she was disoriented confused his heart drummed in his throat at the idea that she might try to stand she might fall before he could get back to her hold steady he ordered max then played out the rope he went over the edge with more speed than caution the rope burning his wounded hands and the cliff striking out to punish him his ankles sang when he landed and his breath came fast but he had her again hard against him safe you promised not to move seraphina in the cave i cant get it by myself its too heavy i need margo and kate in a minute lets get this on you working fast he looped the rope around her youre not going to have to do anything but hold on to me max and i will get you up all right she didnt question it it was all so simple after all could you get it out for me just out here in the light its been in the dark so long sure now im going to lift you up you look at me nothing but me i will but the chest what chest in the cave dont worry about it ill but he glanced over at the gesture of her hand and saw the dull gleam of brass against wood the shadow of shape jesus christ seraphinas dowry would you pull it out into the light it was small no more than two feet long a domed box of cedar fitted with brass hinges and no more than twenty pounds he judged as he hefted it out a simple box uncarved yet he could have sworn he felt something as his hands closed over it heat where there should have been none a faint vibration that tickled his fingertips it lasted only a moment no more than two heartbeats then it was just a small chest fashioned out of smooth wood and brass ah of her dreams locked away laura said softly all locked away because the one she wanted most was over the quake shifted the rocks frowning michael studied the cave cut so neatly in the wall id say another one some time ago covered it up she wanted us to find it shes been leading us here all our lives now you have it however intriguing the find he had priorities i want you to put your arms around my neck and hold on can you do that hows the shoulder its sore but i can manage how are we going to let me worry about it he helped her to her feet kept himself between her and the edge just keep looking at me he continued pulling her arms up until they linked around him its a good strong rope youve got nothing to worry about did you climb up the cliff i thought i saw you climbing up nothing to it he said aware that her mind was drifting fell off a few too on film he continued to talk as he tested the rope hold tight now were going up max back back the rope went taut with one arm firmly around lauras waist michael let his feet leave the ground and put himself in the walkers hands rocks scraped painfully against his back he used his heels to aid the ascent while sweat ran down his face and the muscles of his arms screamed almost there he told her we didnt get seraphina we have to get her ill go back and get her just hold on look at me she snapped back into focus stared into his eyes you came back for me sure hold on for an instant his heart stopped they were inches from the edge dangling between sky and sea if any one of them faltered they would lose reach up just one hand now reach up laura and grab hold she did as he asked watched her own hand grip the edge of rock and dirt slip away grip again thats it pull ignoring his tortured muscles he levered her up dragging himself behind her as his horse strained to pull them the last foot michael bellied up to level ground then simply lay there his body sheltering hers his face buried in her hair laura god laura his mouth sought hers and for a moment he sank out of terror and into oblivion well get you home well get you home now he drew back pain my head its all right lie still let me take care of you he released the rope let it dangle and gathered her into his arms max hell come dont worry hell come he carried her away from the cliffs and up the long slope to templeton house with max following placidly behind his legs didnt begin to shake until ann burst out of the front door oh sweet lord ive been looking for her everywhere what happened my poor lamb she took a fall he continued moving through anns fluttering hands she needs to get inside in the parlor sprinting ahead ann called desperately up the stairs mrs williamson jenny ive found her then to michael how bad is she everyones on the way i called when i couldnt find her lay her down here on the sofa and let me see oh sweetheart your head what in the world mrs williamson stopped out of breath in the doorway shes had a fall ann snapped out we need hot water bandages i fell off the cliff laura said as her head settled back into place oh my dear god where does it hurt let me look at you she broke off when she heard the sound of cars speeding up the drive doors slamming everyones here ann pressed a kiss to lauras brow everythings all right now susan burst through the doorway first stopped braced herself as her heart tilted well she managed calmly enough whats all this i fell off a cliff laura told her michael got me up i hit my head that was all she got out before the room filled with people and hands that wanted to touch and voices that babbled questions quiet thomas took his daughters hand shot the order out to the group at large josh call the doctor tell him were bringing laura in no rousing herself laura sat up and patted kaylas head as her daughter laid it in her mothers lap i dont need the doctor ive just hit my head its a nasty bump mrs williamson tutted as she continued to clean the blood and dirt from lauras head wouldnt be surprised if you have a concussion here little girl michael he didnt notice all the eyes that focused on him all he could do was stare down at laura i dont know how long she was out five six minutes but shes been lucid her visions not blurred theres nothing broken he wiped a hand over his mouth she had a dislocated shoulder she probably fell on her left side itll be sore but shes got good rotation i dont want to go to the hospital the er will be packed with people after a tremor i dont want to be one of them i need to be home then you should stay home margo crouched beside her we can take care of you you gave us a scare gave myself one murmuring she wrapped her arm around ali as the girl burrowed into her side im fine just a few bumps and bruises it was quite an adventure try scuba diving the next time you want an adventure reaching over the back of the couch kate laid a hand on lauras shoulder my heart cant take this we found seraphinas dowry what kates fingers gripped what its there on the ledge where i fell there was a cave and it was there wasnt it michael i didnt imagine it did i its there ill get it for you youll be getting nothing mrs williamson said lifting her voice over the fresh spurt of questions sit down before you fall down boy and let me see to your hands youve made a fine mess of yourself oh good lord focusing on someone other than her daughter for the first time susan snagged michaels wrist his hands were coated with dirt and blood the knuckles mangled youve cut them to pieces her eyes lifted to his swam overflowed as she realized what hed done michael theyre fine im fine he jerked away abruptly he couldnt breathe wasnt certain how much longer he could stand ive got to see to my horses when he staggered out susan took a step after him mom josh put a hand on her arm let me please bring him back here josh he needs tending to he wont come josh said to himself as he went after his friend michael he hurried across the terrace over the yard feeling like a fool for chasing a man who walked like a drunk beside a clopping horse goddamn it michael wait he caught michael by the shoulder spun him around and stepped back involuntarily at the molten fury that spurted out get away from me im done here im not you listen dont fuck with me now ignoring the pain in his hands michael shoved josh back im in the mood to hurt somebody and it might as well be you fine take a shot the shape youre in i could blow on you and knock you down you idiot you stupid son of a bitch why didnt you tell me you were in love with her what the hell difference does it make only all you stood there and let me dump a pile of shit on you and did nothing all you had to do was open your mouth and say it i thought you were using her i did use her didnt i i used her then i tossed her aside just like you said i would ask her i know what its like to be in love with a woman and be scared boneless you wont make it work and i know what its like to want it so much you screw it up now i know what its like to be a part of making two people i care about miserable and i dont like it this isnt about you id figured out it was time to move on before you had your say ive got other plans ive got things he trailed off turned to press his face into maxs warm throat i thought she was dead his shoulders shuddered and he didnt have the will or the energy to shrug off joshs hand i looked down and saw her lying there and thought she was dead i cant remember anything else until i was down there and put my hand on her throat felt her pulse beating shes going to be all right both of you are she wouldnt have been down there if i hadnt told her it was done if i hadnt hurt her he drew back rubbed his hands over his face smearing blood shes being taken care of so thats fine ive got no place here youre wrong no ones shutting you out but you christ mick youre a mess he took a good look at the battered hands the torn and bloody clothes he didnt want to think quite yet of how close his sister and his friend had come to dying come back inside let mrs williamson fuss over you you look like you could use a drink too ill get one when im done done with what i told her id get the damn chest didnt i im going to get it josh opened his mouth as michael started away again arguments he decided were fruitless hold up ill get byron well do it together chapter twentyone an hour later dirty and a little sore josh and byron brought the small chest into the parlor thered been a couple of dicey moments during an aftershock when the three of them had been caught crouching on the ledge wondering if theyd lost their minds fortunately it had passed and now the chest still unopened sat on the coffee table waiting i cant believe it margo murmured she brushed the wood with her fingertips its real after all this time she smiled over at laura you found it we found it she corrected we were always meant to her head throbbed dully as she reached for kates hand wheres michael he didnt josh bit back an oath he needed to check on his horses ill get him for you byron offered no it was his choice laura reminded herself and her life had to continue its so small isnt it she mused so simply made i suppose all of us had imagined something huge and ornate and extraordinary but its just a plain serviceable chest the kind that lasts she took a deep breath ready with margo and kate beside her she put a hand on the latch it opened easily soundlessly the interior releasing a scent of lavender and cedar inside were a young girls treasures and dreams a rosary fashioned from lapis with a heavy silver crucifix a brooch of garnets rose petals drying to dust gold yes there was gold glinting as it was poured out of a leather pouch but there were linens meticulously embroidered and carefully folded handkerchiefs with lacy edges turning yellow an amber necklace a ring crafted to fit a small finger and studded with little ruby stones that glistened like new blood pretty pieces of jewelry that suited a young woman not yet married and a locket that held a curl of dark hair bound by gold thread tucked in with them was a small book with a red leather cover inside was the careful conventschool writing of a wellbred woman we met on the cliffs today early when there was still dew on the grass and the sun was rising slowly from the sea felipe told me he loved me and my heart was brighter than the dawn laura rested her head against margos shoulder her diary she murmured she put her diary in with her treasures locked away poor girl i always thought id feel thrilled when we found it kate reached into the box stroked a finger over the amber beads i just feel sad she hid away everything that was important to her in this little box and left it behind you shouldnt feel sad laura laid the open diary on her lap she wanted us to find it and to open it again i like to think it had to wait until all three of us faced something we thought we couldnt face but we did we have she reached out took each of their hands in hers and we should put these in the shop in a special case we couldnt sell any of it margo murmured we couldnt sell seraphinas treasures no not to sell laura smiled at the simple box to let other people dream michael left the rubble of his living room just as it was he was going to stand in the shower and drown out the aches and pains after hed had a drink in fact now that he thought of it getting pissfaced drunk was probably a much happier way to drown out the pain he bypassed beer and took out a bottle of jamesons as he poured a tumbler half full he ignored the insistent knocking on his door go the fuck away he muttered and took one long swallow it did little to improve his mood when ann sullivan pushed open his door well i see youre already drowning your sorrows in the middle of this chaos she set down a box on the counter and frowned at the destruction i wouldnt have thought thered be this much damage we lost only a few breakables at the main house laura did most of it he lifted his glass again as ann pursed her lips did she its rare for her to let her temper loose but a wicked one it can be well sit down well tend to you before we clean up the mess i dont want to clean it up and i dont want to be tended to go away she merely reached into the box and took out a covered plate mrs williamson sent you food i asked her to let me come instead shes worried about you nothing to worry about he studied his hands ive had worse ive no doubt but youll sit down and let me clean those cuts she set a basin bottles bandages on the counter i can take care of myself he lifted the glass peered at the level of whiskey ive already made a start in her nononsense style ann came around the counter and shoved him into a chair sit when youre told shit he rubbed his shoulder where shed pushed it burned like fire and keep a civil tongue in your head she busied herself filling the basin with hot water got infection brewing already ive no doubt the sense of a bean is what youve got she snatched one of his hands and got to work if youre going to play nurse nancy at least goddamn that hurts i imagine dont you swear at me michael fury her eyes stung when she saw just how badly hed damaged his hands but her movements remained brisk and not particularly sympathetic thisll bite some the burn of the antiseptic that she generously poured over open wounds made his eyes cross and filled the air with wild blue curses youve a raw irish tongue reminds me of my uncle shamus what part does your family come from galway goddamn it why dont you just use battery acid and be done with it big strong man like you whining over a little peroxide and alcohol take another drink then as i havent a bullet for you to bite on it scored his pride as shed meant it to michael tipped back the glass and scowled at her he decided to brood while she wrapped gauze over his hands done he demanded with those for the time being youll want to keep the bandages dry and theyll need to be changed regular since i assume youll be as stubborn as miss laura about a doctor dont need a doctor he jerked his shoulder but regretted it when it throbbed shell be fine too shes got enough people hovering over her she inspires love and loyalty because shes generous with giving both rising ann emptied the basin refilled it take off whats left of your shirt he cocked a brow well annie im a little impaired but if id known you had an urge to ow he gaped shocked speechless as she gave his ear a hard twist ill twist more than your ear if you behave like a baboon take that shirt off boy christ he sat for another moment rubbing his stinging ear whats your problem your hands arent the only things youve cut to blazes now get the shirt off so i can see what youve done to yourself what the hell do you care i could bleed to damn death and you wouldnt bat an eye youve always hated me no ive always been afraid of you and that was foolish youre just a pitiful man who hasnt a clue of his own worth and i made mistakes im sorry for and i hope im woman enough to admit it because he wasnt cooperating she tugged off his tattered tshirt herself i thought you had beaten your mother what my mother i never i know that be still oh jesus boy youve done a job here oh poor lad she crooned now as she dabbed gently at the gashes on his back youd have killed yourself for her wouldnt you suddenly tired unbearably tired he laid his head on the counter shut his eyes go away leave me alone i wont nor will anyone else youll have to be the one to do it hold on now this is going to hurt he hissed between his teeth as the antiseptic bit i just wanna get drunk you will if you must she said easily but a man who would brave an earthquake to get to his woman should have enough nerve to face her sober this bruising could use liniment well well see to that after weve seen to the rest take off your pants oh for christs sake im not going to christ he yelped when she twisted his other ear all right all right you want me naked you got it he rose wrenched the button of his torn jeans tugged them off id have gone to the hospital if id known what the alternative was going to be that cut on your thigh could use stitches but well do what we can he sat badtemperedly but shoved the tumbler aside he didnt feel like drinking any longer is she all right a smile ghosted around anns mouth but she kept her head lowered shes hurting in more ways than one she needs you no she doesnt the last thing you know what i am now she lifted her head looked him dead in the eye yes i know what you are but do you michael fury do you know what you are he worried over it like a man worrying over an aching tooth how could he concentrate on what he needed to do when he kept seeing her the way she had been white and still on that ledge or the way she had looked eyes filled with hurt and temper as shed turned at the door and told him she loved him distractions didnt help hed dealt with the mess of the apartment because ann had ordered him to get up off his butt and take out the trash hed calmed his horses rehung his tack then taken the tack down again and packed it he wasnt staying anyway in the end hed given up and started across the lawn to templeton house it was reasonable wasnt it he argued with himself to want to check on her she probably should be in the hospital her family wouldnt push her it was obvious to him that when laura templeton dug her heels in no one could push her he would just check then hed make arrangements to stable his horses elsewhere until he could get the hell out of dodge as he walked through the garden kayla and ali popped up from their perch on the terrace where theyd been playing jacks his first thought was that he hadnt known kids still played jacks then they launched themselves at him you saved mama from the earthquake kayla all but climbing up into his arms made his fresh bruises throb not exactly he began i just you did solemneyed ali looked up into his face everyone said so he started to shrug uncomfortable in the role of hero but she took his hand and her eyes were clouded with worry they said she was going to be all right everyone said she was going to be all right is she why ask him damn it how did he get to be the authority but he crouched down unable to resist that trembling lip sure she is she just got some bumps thats all alis lips curved a little okay she fell off the cliff kayla continued and found seraphina and she got hurt but you and max came to pull her back up mrs williamson said max should have a whole bushel of carrots he grinned tousled her hair what do i get she said you already got your reward what is it search me you got hurt too soberly kayla lifted his bandaged hands one at a time and kissed them do they hurt does that make it better emotion swarmed through him a stinging hive of bees that left behind a sweet ache no one in all his life had ever kissed his hurts yeah much he pressed his face into her hair for a moment wishing wanting is it all right if we go down and see max instinctively ali stroked michaels hair to soothe him to thank him yeah hed like that ah your mom shes in the parlor everyones supposed to be quiet so she can rest but you can go in ali beamed at him shed want to see you and kayla and i are going to get up every morning early before school and clean the stalls until your hands are better you dont have to worry i coward he thought tell them you wont be here tell them youre leaving couldnt just couldnt thanks as they dashed off he watched them two pretty young girls racing away through fanciful gardens he stepped over the scattered jacks and after three tries managed to lift his hand and open the terrace door she wasnt lying on the couch as hed expected but standing at the window her back to the room looking out toward the cliffs she was so small he thought everything about her telegraphed fragility and yet she was the strongest woman hed ever known she should have seemed delicate just then highly breakable with her hair pulled back the soft fluid folds of a white robe wrapped around her but when she turned and those last gilded beams of the setting sun danced against the window at her back she seemed simply indestructible i was hoping youd come her voice was calm as was she a close brush with death had shown her that she could indeed survive anything even michael fury i wasnt able to thank you coherently before or to see how badly you were hurt im fine hows the head she smiled it feels as though i smashed it on a rock would you like a brandy im not allowed myself my many medical advisers tell me i cant have any alcohol for twentyfour hours no ill pass the whiskey hed downed earlier wasnt sitting very well as it was please sit down leading with manners she gestured to a chair weve had quite a day havent we michael i wont forget it anytime soon your shoulder ive had enough fussing its sore she sat smoothing down her robe as she did im sore my head aches and occasionally i get this quick twist in my stomach when i let myself think about what might have happened what would have happened if you hadnt found me her brow lifted as she watched him prowl the room other than that first long stare when shed turned to him hed barely looked at her to keep her own hands still she linked them in her lap is something else on your mind michael other than my medical report i just wanted to see he stopped hooked his thumbs in his pockets and made himself look at her listen i dont see any point in leaving this business hanging between us what business youre not in love with me patiently attentive she angled her head im not no youve just got it all mixed up with sex and now probably with gratitude and thats just stupid so now im stupid dont twist things around im trying to untwist them she leaned forward to touch the box still open on the coffee table you havent seen seraphinas dowry arent you curious its nothing to do with me but he looked down saw the glint of gold of silver of glossy beads not a hell of a lot considering youre wrong its quite a bit considering her gaze lifted to his again quite a bit why did you go back down for it i told you i would a man of your word she murmured i was fuzzy at the time but things are clearer now i remember lying there watching you climb up that rock wall clinging like a lizard your hands bleeding slipping when the wall would give way you could have been killed i guess i should have just left you there you couldnt have done that youd have gone down for anyone thats who you are and you went back for this she stroked the lid of the box because i asked you youre making it bigger than it was you brought me something ive looked for my entire life her eyes swimming with emotion stayed on his i cant make that bigger than it is how many times did you climb up climb down for me michael when he said nothing only turned away to pace again she sighed it makes you uncomfortable gratitude admiration love youre not in love with me dont tell me what i feel because her voice had sharpened he glanced back warily if she started throwing things again he doubted he had the energy to dodge dont you dare to tell me what i feel youre entitled not to feel the same way entitled not to want me to love you but youre not entitled to tell me what i feel then you are stupid he exploded you dont even know who i am i killed for money she waited a beat then rose and walked over to pour herself a glass of mineral water youre referring to when you were a mercenary it doesnt matter what title you put on it i killed i got paid for it i dont suppose you believed in the cause you were fighting for he opened his mouth shut it wasnt she hearing him it doesnt matter what i believed or didnt i killed for profit ive spent the night in a cell ive slept with women i didnt know calmly she sipped are you apologizing michael or bragging christ almighty dont pull that snotty ladyofthehouse routine on me ive done things you cant even imagine in this rarefied world you live in she drank rarefied is it she murmured as compared to the reality you live in michael fury youre a snob jesus christ you are as you see it im above desperation or needs or sins because i come from money and maintain a certain social status im not supposed to understand a man like you much less care for him is that right yeah he ached everywhere that about sums it up let me tell you what i see michael i see someone who has done what he had to do to survive and i understand that very well even living in my pathetic rarefied world i didnt mean someone who didnt give up no matter what got in the way she interrupted staring him down i see someone who decided to take a new direction in his life and is making it work he has ambition decency and courage and i see a man who can still grieve over a child he never had a chance to know she was making him into something he wasnt and she was scaring the life out of him im not what youre looking for youre what i found i have to live with that and when you go i will im doing you a favor he muttered you cant even see it youd have figured it out for yourself sooner or later youve already got the seed in your head which means you know it isnt going anywhere with us it cant and you knew it did i why dont you explain how youve come to that conclusion there were dozens of examples but only one stuck out youre damn careful not to touch me when anyones around is that so she set down her glass with a snap stay right there incensed she marched to the door and out leaving him scowling after her why the hell was he getting into all this he asked himself why was he arguing with her why couldnt he just touch her one more time just hold her one more time then hed go laura strode back in dragging thomas in her wake youre supposed to be resting her father scolded oh hello michael i was about to go down and talk later laura ordered then marched straight to michael hey was all he managed before she grabbed him by the hair dragged his head down and fixed her lips hotly on his he lifted his hands dropped them again then gave up and crushed her against him her body was drumtight all but vibrating with fury but her mouth was soft sweet and the kiss weakened his knees there she pulled away spun toward a baffled and grinning thomas thanks dad if you wouldnt mind leaving us alone again no fine michael i believe you and i will have a little talk later thomas closed the door discreetly behind him satisfied laura demanded not nearly shed just churned up all the urges hed nearly managed to quell saying nothing he yanked her against him again what the hell was that supposed to prove it doesnt change and then he broke just broke shuddering he buried his face in her hair fought to find his breath i thought you were dead he managed oh god laura i thought you were dead oh michael every drop of temper drained out of her as she stroked his back it was horrible for you im sorry so sorry were fine now you saved me gently she cupped his face and studied those dark stormy eyes you saved my life she murmured and touched her lips to his no he jerked back shocked at how close shed come to bringing him to his knees were not going that route were not mixing this up again she stood where she was watching all those violent emotions flit over his face and slowly her aching heart began to swell and to heal her smile bloomed why youre afraid of me arent you afraid of us i see i have been stupid after all thinking it was only me youre in love with me michael and it scares you dont put words in my mouth he began then backed up a full step as she came toward him dont whatll happen if i touch you now the sense of power of right glowed inside her you might shatter tough guy holding it all in i could break you just by doing this and she laid her hand on his cheek youre making a mistake he clamped a hand on her wrist and his fingers trembled you dont know what youre doing i cant be what you need why dont you tell me what you think i need then you figure ill polish up and start playing tennis at the club go to the gallery openings and buy a tux its never going to happen im not going to start drinking brandy and playing billiards or sit in a steam room with a bunch of overweight rich guys and talk about the latest stock reports she began to laugh and the laughter made her head ache and spin so that she had to sit on the arm of the settee until she caught her breath thats telling me you think this is a joke so will all your fancy friends there goes laura templeton with that mongrel she picked up she sobered quickly i could slap you i could actually slap you for that in fact she had to grip her hands together to stop herself from doing just that thats insulting to me and to those i consider my friends you think i care about any of that do you really think so little of me i think everything of you he said and stopped her tirade before it could begin if thats true then you should respect what it is i do need with some alterations its the same thing ive needed my whole life i need my family and my work my home i need to feel that i put in as much as i take out i need my children to be happy and safe and i need someone i love and who loves me to share it all to be there for me i need someone wholl depend on me and whom i can depend on i want someone wholl listen and understand wholl touch me when i need to be touched wholl make my heart beat a little faster when he looks at me the way you look at me michael the way youre looking at me right now youre not going to let me walk he said quietly yes yes i will she reached into the box took out the locket if you need to go to prove something to escape from something even if that something is what we feel for each other i cant stop you she laid the locket down again gently but i wont stop loving you or needing you ill just live without you ill live without the life we could make without seeing my children light up when you walk into the room without the other children we could make together she narrowed her eyes when she saw the flicker in his eye did you think i wouldnt want more children that i havent already dreamed what it would be like to hold a baby we made together no i didnt think youd want more children with me she was breaking him bit by bit laura she rose waited but he only shook his head a family michael thats all ive ever really dreamed of you changed a great deal inside of me but never that you gave me all those firsts and because i was so dazzled by you so in love with you i didnt see that i could give you something back ill give you a family michael he wondered if he could speak how any man could when faced with the gift of everything he would ever need every treasure imagined and sought and despaired of im wrong for you ive got to be wrong for you and it was never supposed to come to this between us i took you because i could because i wanted you more than id ever wanted anything youre right for me she corrected you have to be right for me and what was it never supposed to come to between us michael to plans to futures his gaze was drawn to the open box again and all those tiny precious treasures ive barely started to get my business off the ground hardly made a dent in getting my life into some kind of decent order ive got nothing for you dont you dont you have dreams michael and arent some of them the same as mine she wanted to reach for him then but this time he would have to reach first she would let him walk he realized if he turned and stepped back out the door they would both go on she was waiting for him she was willing to take him just as he was and with her he realized he might find there was more in him more for him than hed ever allowed himself to dream im going to give you one more chance before i say what i have to say what i wasnt going to say what i didnt think youd want to hear how many chances did a man get he wondered how many lives how many offers of everything that mattered he took a step toward her stopped once i say it the door closes for both of us do you understand that her lips curved do you i understood it the minute i saw you again his eyes went dark dangerous stay or run laura she lifted her chin this time she would say it stay then youll have to live with it and me he took her hand not gently but possessively his battered fingers clamping onto hers ive never loved another woman thats a first you gave me she closed her eyes i feel as though ive waited my whole life to hear you say that i havent said it yet he lifted his free hand to her face look at me when i do i love you laura he said when her eyes opened maybe i always did i know i always will ill never lie to you or leave you to handle things alone ill be a father to your children all of them ill love them all of them and theyll never have to wonder if i do michael overcome she turned her lips into his palm kissing his hurts much as kayla had thats everything no its not so heres the rest he waited until her eyes cleared and met his if you want to take a chance on this ill give you whatever i have whatever i can make and whatever i can be the words were just there he realized just there waiting to be said absently he reached over plucked a tulip from the vase on the table beside them held it out to her marry me be my family rather than take the flower she closed her hand over his around the stem yes she touched her lips to his cheek settled her head with a sigh on his shoulder yes she said again feeling his heart thud against hers as she looked into the simple box filled with dreams ive found you she murmured turning her mouth up to michaels weve found each other finally
