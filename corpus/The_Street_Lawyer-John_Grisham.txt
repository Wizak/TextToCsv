 chapter one mister mister pointed at the dynamite around his waist i pull this he said and we die the old black man got into the elevator behind me he smelled of smoke and cheap wine and life on the streets without soap his beard and hair were halfgray and very dirty he was wearing sunglasses and a long dirty coat hung down to his knees he looked fat probably because he had all his clothes on in the winter in washington the street people wear all their clothes all the time they cant leave any of their clothes at home because they dont have a home the old man didnt belong here everything here was expensive the lawyers in the building who all worked for drake and sweeney were paid an unbelievable amount of money i knew that because i was a drake and sweeney lawyer myself the elevator stopped at six the man hadnt pushed an elevator button when i stepped out and turned right he followed me i pushed the heavy wooden door of a big meeting room there were eight lawyers at the table inside and they all looked surprised they were looking behind me so i turned my friend from the elevator was standing there he was pointing a gun at me put that gun down said one of the lawyers at the table his name was rafter he was a hard man in a courtroom maybe the hardest lawyer that drake and sweeney had suddenly a shot hit the ceiling rafters eyes opened wide and his mouth shut lock the door the man said to me i locked the door of the meeting room stand against the wall we all stood against the wall the man took off his dirty coat and put it carefully on the large expensive table in the center of the room he had five or six red sticks around his waist tied there with string i had never seen dynamite before but they looked like dynamite to me i wanted to run and hope for a bad shot when he fired at me but my legs were like water some of the lawyers were shaking with fear and making noises like scared animals please be quiet said the man calmly then he took a long yellow rope and a knife from the pocket of his pants you he said to me tie them up rafter stepped forward listen friend he said what do you want the second shot went into the wall behind rafters ear do not call me friend said the man what would you like us to call you i asked him quietly call me mister i tied the eight lawyers with the yellow rope one of them barry nuzzo was my friend we were the same age thirtytwo and we had started at drake and sweeney on the same day only our marriages were different his was successful and mine wasnt he had three kids claire and i didnt have any i looked at barry and he looked at me i knew we were both thinking about barrys kids we could hear police cars outside and noises as the police entered the building mister pointed at the dynamite around his waist i pull this he said and we die for a second we all looked at each other nine white boys and mister i thought of all those terrible shootings you read about in the newspapers a crazy worker returns to work after lunch with a gun and kills everybody in his office there had been killings at fastfood restaurants and playgrounds too and those dead people were children or honest workers who would care about us we were lawyers time passed what did you eat for lunch today mister asked me breaking a long silence dynamite he spoke clearly and from the sound of his voice he had had a good education he hadnt always been on the streets i had chicken and salad i said surprised alone no i met a friend how much did it cost for both of you thirty dollars mister didnt like that thirty dollars he repeated for two people you know what i had for lunch no i had soup free soup from a shelter and i was glad to get it you could feed a hundred of my friends for thirty dollars you know that yes mister call your boss there was a phone on the table i called arthur jacobs eight hundred lawyers worked for drake and sweeney around the world but at seventynine jacobs was the oldest of the partners here in washington he answered at the first ring of the phone mr jacobs michael are you ok wonderful i said what does he want from us i spoke to the man what do you want mister soup with bread said the man get it from the shelter at l street and th they put a lot of vegetables in the soup there one soup with bread i said into the phone no said the man get soup and bread for all of us mr jacobs i said i heard i can hear him a shelter for street people does carry outs mr jacobs please just do it he has a gun and dynamite i put the phone down you said the man he was talking to me whats your name michael brock how much money did you earn last year dont lie i thought quickly i didnt lie a hundred and twenty thousand he didnt like that how much did you give to poor people i dont remember my wife does that thank you mr brock mister pointed the gun at the other lawyers he asked all of them the same questions nate malamud the only partner in the room earned more than a million dollars more than a million mister said to him i know you you walk past me when i sit on the sidewalk every morning you never give me any money why cant you help poor people homeless people nate was a big man with white hair he had been with drake and sweeney for thirty years he was red in the face with embarrassment now im sorry he said who did the eviction said mister suddenly and again who did the eviction nobody spoke none of us understood him but mister wasnt looking for an answer he looked out the window maybe he was thinking maybe he was dreaming maybe he was watching the police out there our soup and bread arrived half an hour later there was a knock on the door and somebody outside shouted through the door your food mister shouted back if i see a policeman out there ill kill these men then he pointed the gun at my head the two of us walked slowly to the door unlock the door and open it very slowly mister said there was nobody outside the food was on the floor near the door as i stepped outside and bent down to pick it up i heard a shout stay down a policeman stepped quickly out of the office opposite and shot mister through the head mister fell without a sound and my face was covered in blood whose blood mister was lying on the floor half his head had gone but the sunglasses still covered one eye his hands were nowhere near the dynamite policemen came running from all the offices are you hurt one of them asked me i didnt know i couldnt see there was blood on my face and shirt and a liquid that i discovered later was part of misters brain chapter two devon hardy who did the eviction mister had asked but i guess he already knew the answer to that a policeman led me to the first floor of the building where friends and family and doctors were waiting the doctors crowded around but where was my wife six hours in a room with a gunman and she hadnt come to see me it was funny really because my wife claire was a doctor herself at one of the biggest hospitals in washington i lay on a table for ten minutes while doctors examined me to make sure i was all right then my secretary polly arrived there were tears in her eyes as she put her arms around me wheres claire i asked her i called the hospital shes working polly knew there wasnt much left of the marriage are you ok she asked i think so ill take you home i was pleased someone was telling me what to do my thoughts came into my head slowly it was like i was under water we left the drake and sweeney building by a back door there were police cars everywhere and ambulances and television vans even a fire truck im alive im alive i realized smiling for the first time im alive i looked up to heaven and said a very big thank you when i got home to our apartment on p street in georgetown claire wasnt there i sat in the empty apartment and thought about her we had met the week after i moved to washington i was just out of yale with a great job she came from one of americas oldest families we were in love we got married but drake and sweeney make you work very hard the first year i worked fifteen hours a day six days a week i saw claire on sundays and we went out together when i wasnt too tired for the last five years i had worked about hours a month thats eight hours every day for six days with two or three hours on sunday but young lawyers at drake and sweeney dont complain about long hours fewer than one in ten become partners and everybody wants to be that one in ten because you earn at least a million dollars a year claire was good about it for the first few months but then she got tired of having a husband who was never there and i didnt blame her there are a lot of divorces at drake and sweeney long hours at work each hour paid for by a client are more important than a happy wife by the end of our first year together claire was unhappy and we werent talking together very much she decided to go to medical school and i thought that was a great idea drake and sweeney were telling me that i was a possible future partner i just had to work even harder when claire was studying i didnt feel so guilty about that but claire didnt just study she worked unbelievably long hours she had decided she wanted to be a great doctor soon we were playing a crazy game called icanworkharderthanyou and another game called my job is more important than your job because im a doctor and lawyer my boss arthur jacobs of course was on my team he had become a partner in drake and sweeney at the age of thirty the youngest ever partner and he would soon be the oldest ever working partner the law was his life all three of his divorced wives could tell you that i woke up suddenly i had fallen asleep in an armchair at the apartment and claire was sitting in a chair next to me where were you today i said at the hospital at the hospital nine of us are in a room with a crazy man and a gun for six hours we get lucky and escape eight families come and see their relative because theyre interested in whether or not hes alive and how do i get home my secretary drives me i couldnt be there oh no of course you couldnt be there how silly of me i couldnt be there because the police asked all doctors to stay at their hospitals until the situation at drake and sweeney ended they always do that when theres a possible shooting oh did you call i tried i guess there were a lot of people trying next morning we made breakfast together we ate in the kitchen watching the small television the six oclock news showed the drake and sweeney building and you could see mister looking out of the window the television news said the dynamite wasnt real the sticks were made of wood and mister had painted them red the gun was real enough though it was a stolen misters real name was devon hardy he was fortyfive he had fought in vietnam he had been in prison a few times for stealing but he wasnt a big criminal and he was homeless with no known family that mornings washington post had more details according to someone called mordecai green the director of the th street law center devon hardy had recently lost his job then he became homeless he was living in an old warehouse this wasnt unusual a lot of homeless people move into empty buildings because they have no money for their own place devon hardy had recently been evicted from the warehouse as an illegal squatter lawyers are responsible for evictions who did the eviction mister had asked but i guess he already knew the answer to that and now i knew it too drake and sweeney had thrown mister into the streets chapter three mordecai green mordecai green was a warm caring man whose work was on the streets he was a lawyer with a heart i had told polly i would be at work today the day after mister came into the office but for the first time ever i didnt go to work when i was well enough to go just as it started to snow i got into my car a lexus and drove through the streets of washington the snow came down harder and harder i just drove pollys voice came over the car phone she sounded worried where are you who wants to know a lot of people arthur jacobs wants to see you you have clients waiting for you im fine polly tell everybody im at the doctors office are you no but i could be i drove around georgetown not going anywhere just driving the clouds were dark the snow would be heavy people were hurrying through the snow on the sidewalks i saw a homeless man and wondered if he knew devon hardy where do street people go in a snowstorm i called the hospital i wanted to ask claire to meet me for lunch but the hospital said claire was busy and they couldnt contact her that was the end of our lunch together i turned and went northeast past logan circle into the gang area of the city and drove until i found the th street law center i parked at th and q certain that i would never see the expensive lexus again the th street law center was in an old tall red brick house that had seen better days the windows on the top floor were protected by pieces of wood over the glass the door wasnt locked i went in slowly out of the snow and entered another world it was a law office all right but there was no expensive furniture here not like at drake and sweeney i stepped into a large room which had three metal desks each covered in files there were more files on old pieces of carpet on the floor the computers and the only photocopier were ten years old there was a large photograph of martin luther king on one wall the office was busy and dusty and interesting you looking for somebody asked a woman at a desk with the name sofia mendoza on it she looked mexican she wasnt smiling but i did it was funny nobody at drake and sweeney would talk to a visitor like that they would lose their job but i would soon lean how important sofia was to the th street law center im looking for mordecai green i said but just then he came out of his office sofia went back to her work green was an enormous black man at least two meters tall and very heavy he was in his early fifties with a gray beard and round red glasses he shouted something about a file to sofia and then turned to me can i help you i want to talk to you about devon hardy i said and gave him my drake and sweeney card he looked at me for a few seconds and then looked quickly at sofia who was speaking in fast spanish into the phone mordecai green walked back into his office and i followed him in the office was a small room with no windows and the desk and floor covered in files and law books sit down he said but you might get dirty what do you want i sat down i was in the room with devon hardy when he was shot i said i couldnt think this morning i didnt want to go to work so i came here any idea why he did it because of the eviction said mordecai green a few months ago he moved into an old warehouse at the corner of florida avenue it wasnt a bad place for a homeless person it had a roof some toilets water who owned the warehouse mordecai pulled a thin file from one of the piles on his desk it was exactly the one he wanted he looked at the file for a minute the warehouse was owned by a company called riveroaks and riveroakss lawyers are drake and sweeney probably is that all no i heard that devon hardy and the others got no warning of the eviction but you can evict squatters with no warning oh yes you cant evict tenants without a warning though was devon hardy a squatter or a tenant i dont know i thought of another question how did devon hardy know about drake and sweeney who knows he wasnt stupid though crazy but not stupid i had taken enough of his time he looked at his watch i looked at mine we exchanged phone numbers and promised to stay in contact mordecai green was a warm caring man whose work was on the streets protecting hundreds of nameless clients he was a lawyer with a heart on the way out sofia didnt look up from her conversation on the phone the lexus was still there covered by an inch of snow chapter four mom and dad welcome to the world son you think the guys in factory jobs like what theyre doing youre getting rich they arent after i left mordecai greens office i drove around and around the city while the snow fell as a lawyer with hours to work which my clients paid for i couldnt do this sort of thing just moving with the traffic not going anywhere but i was doing it now i didnt want to go back to the empty apartment i didnt want to go to a bar either id probably never leave so i drove i went through poor parts of the city i had never seen before then i went back to drake and sweeney i went up in misters elevator again walked along the hall to my office and sat down at my desk for the first time i wondered how much everything in my office had cost the expensive old desk the red leather armchairs and the persian carpets werent we just chasing money here in this building why did we work so hard to buy a more expensive carpet or an older desk was that a good reason to work was this the life i wanted in my expensive room i thought of mordecai green giving his time to help people who had nothing i had about ten pink telephone messages from clients on my desk and none of them interested me i didnt like this work my clients were big companies and i worked on their lawsuits against other big companies the lawsuits continued for years maybe a hundred lawyers worked on each one all sending paper to each other polly came in and brought me cookies she put them on the table with a big smile before she left for home for the day a couple of lawyers came in said how you doin and left again they were probably on their way home too alone in the office again i picked up one big file and then another one which lawsuit did i want to work on today i didnt want to work on any of them i couldnt do it it didnt make any sense to me now i went to my computer and began searching our client files riveroaks was started in in hagerstown maryland it was a private company so it was difficult to get information about it riveroaks was the client of a drake and sweeney lawyer called braden chance i didnt know the name but i looked again in our computer files braden chance was a partner in real estate on the fourth floor he was fortyfour years old married and went to law school at duke there were fortytwo files for riveroaks four were about evictions riveroaks had bought a warehouse on florida avenue on january some squatters were evicted from the warehouse one of them as i now knew was devon hardy the file on the eviction itself had a number next to it the number meant that only braden chance could open the file i wrote down the files name and number and walked down to the fourth floor when i got there i saw a legal assistant and asked him where braden chances office was he pointed to an open door across the hall although it was late chance was at his desk looking busy he didnt like me just walking in from the hall at drake and sweeney you phoned first and made an appointment but that didnt worry me very much chance didnt ask me to sit down but i did and he didnt like that either you were next to the guy when he got shot he said unpleasantly after i said devon hardys name yes i said terrible for you huh its over mr hardy whos now dead was evicted from a warehouse was it one of our evictions it was said chance but he didnt look at me as he spoke i guessed that arthur jacobs had looked at the file with him earlier in the day what about it added chance was he a squatter of course he was theyre all squatters arent they our client just got them out of the warehouse are you sure he was a squatter not a tenant chance looked angry what do you want could i see the file no why not im very busy will you please leave if he was a squatter theres no problem why cant i see the file because its mine and i said no hows that maybe thats not good enough he stood his hands shaking as he pointed to the door i smiled at him and left the legal assistant from the hall had heard everything and we exchanged looks and smiles as i passed his desk the mans a fool he said very quietly i smiled again yes but what was chance hiding there was something wrong and it was in that file i had to get it i went back to my office to think the phone rang it was claire why are you at the office she spoke very slowly and her voice was colder than the snow outside i looked at my watch i remembered we had arranged to have dinner together at the apartment i uh well a client called from the west coast i had used this lie before it didnt matter im waiting michael should i start to eat no ill be back at the apartment as fast as i can i ran from the building into the snowstorm but i didnt really care that another evening together had been ruined a few hours later claire and i were having our coffee by the kitchen window the snow had finally stopped i had an idea lets go to florida i said she gave me a cold look florida ok the bahamas we can leave tomorrow its impossible not at all i dont have to work for a few days why not because im going crazy and at drake and sweeney if you go crazy then you get a few days off you are going crazy i know its fun actually people are nice to you they smile polly brought me cookies today i like it the cold look returned and she said i cant and that was the end of that i knew she couldnt do it she was a doctor people had appointments with her but also she didnt want to go with me ok i said then im going to memphis for a couple of days to see my parents oh really she said she didnt even sound interested i need to see my parents its been almost a year and this is a good time i think i dont like the snow and i dont feel like working like i said im going crazy claire got up and went to bed well call me she said over her shoulder i knew that was the end of my marriage and i hated to have to tell my mother my parents were in their early sixties and trying to enjoy not working for the first time in their lives mom had been a bank manager dad had been a lawyer in atlanta they had worked hard saved hard and given the best of everything dad always wanted me to be a lawyer like him i rented a car at memphis airport and drove east to the rich part of the city where the white people live the blacks had the center of the city and the whites the area outside sometimes the blacks moved out from the center into a white area and then the whites moved further out my parents lived on a golf course in a new glass house you could see the golf course from every window i had called from the airport so mom knew i was coming whats wrong she asked when she saw me nothing im fine wheres claire you guys never call us you know i havent heard her voice in two months claires fine mom were both alive and healthy and working very hard are you spending enough time together no are you spending any time together not much i saw the tears in her eyes im sorry mom its lucky we dont have kids to talk about something else i told her the story of mister are you all right she asked a look of shock on her face of course im here arent i the company wanted me to take a couple of days holiday so i came home you poor thing claire and now this later that afternoon my dad and i played golf dad im not very happy at drake and sweeney i said i dont like what im doing welcome to the world son you think the guys in factory jobs like what theyre doing youre getting rich they arent be happy he was happy he was winning at the golf ten minutes later he said are you changing jobs im thinking about it why dont you just say what youre trying to say as usual i felt weak and like i was running away from something im thinking about working for the homeless i said as a lawyer i added quickly dad didnt stop playing he hit a ball into the distance id hate to see you throw it all away son he said youll be a partner in a few years we walked after his ball a street guys killed in front of you and you have to change the world you just need a few days away from work is that all chapter five lontae burton inside were a young mother and her children all dead the mother had started the engine of the old car and left it running of course the apartment was empty when i returned friday night but there was a note in the kitchen just like me claire had gone home to her parents in providence for a couple of days i knew claire wanted to end the marriage too i just didnt know how badly i went for long walk it was very cold outside with a strong wind i passed beautiful homes with families in them eating and laughing and enjoying the warmth then i moved onto m street friday night on m was always fun time the bars and coffee shops were full and people were waiting in line to get into the restaurants i stopped at the window of a music club listening to sad music with snow over my feet watching the young couples drink and dance for the first time in my life i didnt feel young i was thirtytwo but in the last five years i had worked more than most people do in twenty i was tired those pretty girls in there would never look at me now i went back to the apartment at some time after nine the phone rang it was mordecai green are you busy he asked to do what to work the shelters are full we dont have enough helpers ive never done that kind of work can you put butter on bread i think so then youre the man for us were at a church on th and euclid ill be there in twenty minutes i changed into the oldest clothes i had jeans and an old blue jacket and took most of my money out of my wallet as i closed the apartment door behind me i was excited and i didnt exactly know why i parked the lexus opposite the church the attack i half expected didnt happen no gangs the snow kept the streets empty and safe for now i went into the church down into a big room below it and entered the world of the homeless it was unbelievable how many people were in that room volunteers were giving out blankets and apples mordecai was pouring fruit juice into paper cups and talking all the time a line waited patiently for food at a table i went to mordecai and he said hello like i was an old friend its crazy he said one big snowstorm and we work all night he showed me the bread the butter the meat and the cheese its real complicated you do ten with meat and then ten with cheese ok yeah you learn fast then he disappeared i made ten sandwiches quickly then i slowed and watched all the people most of the homeless looked down at the floor most of them said thank you to the volunteers when they got the food then they ate slowly even the children were careful with their food mordecai came back and started making sandwiches next to me where does the food come from i asked him food bank people give it tonight were lucky because we have chicken usually its just vegetables how many shelters like this are there in the city this isnt actually a shelter the church kindly opens its doors when the weathers bad when the doors close they go out again i tried to understand this then where do these people live some are squatters theyre the lucky ones some live on the streets some in parks some in bus stations some under bridges usually its ok but they cant stay out in the open tonight its too cold they have to go to one of the shelters how many shelters are there about twenty two are closing soon no money how many beds about five thousand and how many homeless good question theyre a difficult group to count maybe ten thousand i thought about that then i asked mordecai about himself you have a family yes a wife three sons ones in college ones in the army and and we lost our third boy on the streets ten years ago he was killed gangs what about you married no kids mordecai disappeared again a helper brought cookies i took four of them and walked to a corner where a young mother was asleep with a baby under her arm and two small children half asleep under blankets the oldest boys eyes opened wide when he saw the cookies in my hand i gave him one his eyes shone as he took it and ate all of it then he wanted another one he was small and thin no more than four years old the mother woke up saw the cookies and smiled whats your name i said to the boy after two cookies he was my friend for life ontario how old are you he showed me four fingers four i said he said yes and put his hand out for another cookie which i gladly gave him i wanted to give him things anything he wanted where do you live i whispered in a car he whispered back you got more apple juice sure i went to the kitchen and got him a cup of apple juice and more cookies the mother was sleeping again like many homeless people she moved a lot in her sleep she was cold i took my jacket off and put it over her then the baby cried and woke her without thinking i took the baby smiling at the mother all the time she was happy to let me hold it so she could get some sleep i stayed there until three in the morning the next day was saturday since tuesday when i met mister i hadnt worked even one hour for drake and sweeney i lay in bed i hated the work at drake and sweeney i didnt want to go back ever i had breakfast at a cafe on m and wondered what ontario was having for breakfast then i went shopping candy and small toys for the kids soap for them all warm clothes in lots of childrens sizes i had never had so much fun spending two hundred dollars and i wanted to spend more i wanted to put that family in a hotel for a month i wanted to start a lawsuit against the person who had made them homeless i couldnt wait to have ontarios family as my clients i went back to the church leaving all the toys and clothes in the car but ontarios family werent there i asked mordecai where they were who knows the homeless go from kitchen to kitchen shelter to shelter next morning sunday i had the small television in the kitchen on while i ate breakfast but the tv news stopped me from eating i heard the words but i didnt want to believe them i walked toward the television my feet were heavy my heart was cold my mouth was open in shock and disbelief sometime around pm washington police found a small car near fort totten park in a gang area in the northeast of the city it was parked on the street inside were a young mother and her children all dead the mother had started the engine of the old car and left it running to keep the family warm the air in the car poisoned them while they slept they gave the mothers name it was lontae burton the baby was temeko the other children were alonzo and ontario their candy and toys and soap and clothes were still in my car chapter six a new person now i too carried my photograph of a yearold black mother who had died for nothing in a car i was at the th street law center how much would a funeral cost i asked mordecai i dont know are you interested i want them to have a good funeral ok then lets arrange it now we got into mordecais old ford taurus the burton familys bodies were in the morgue of the general hospital mordecai entered like he owned the place im mordecai green lawyer for the burton family he informed an anxious young man behind the desk a doctor from the hospital arrived and mordecai pushed open the big metal door inside the white room were lines of bodies covered in sheets their names were on little pieces of paper tied to their toes we stopped in a corner lontae burton said the doctor and pulled the sheet down to her waist it was ontarios mother all right in a white dress she looked the same as when i saw her alive a few days ago she looked like she was sleeping i couldnt stop staring at her thats her said mordecai in a confident and loud voice like hed known her for years only one sheet covered the children they were lying in a line with their hands by their sides like little soldiers i wanted to touch ontario i wanted to tell him i was sorry i wanted to wake him up take him home give him some food give him everything he could ever want thats them said mordecai i looked up to heaven and i heard a voice in my head say dont let it happen again the doctor took us to an office we helped the assistant make a list of everything that had been found with the family my old blue jacket was the best thing they owned do you want it back mordecai asked me no i waited outside in the car while mordecai arranged the funeral in another office he told me the price would go up if they saw my expensive clothes in less than a week i had seen five dead street people first mister had changed my life now ontario had broken my heart there was a knock on the car window i jumped its five thousand dollars all four mordecai shouted through the closed car window yeah yeah i said and he disappeared back into the hospital soon he was back driving fast the funeral will be tuesday at the church here at the hospital the newspapers will be there and television its a big story thanks mordecai i said after the funeral theres going to be a march a march to the government buildings on capitol hill for the burton family television is going to film it the newspapers are going to write about it are you ok no i called in sick tuesday at ten i left for the funeral it was a very nice church beautiful it didnt open its doors to the homeless and i could understand why i sat alone i could see mordecai with two people i didnt know the tv people were in one corner i could also see the coffins the babys coffin was very small ontarios coffin and his brothers were bigger but not much bigger lontae burtons parents were dead but her grandmother was there she put flowers on the coffins and for a terrible second i thought she was going to open them i had never been to a black funeral before and i didnt know what to expect but i had seen old film of coffins open at funerals after the funeral there was the march to capitol hill there were big photos of lontae burton everywhere and under her face the words who killed lontae on capitol hill mordecai spoke to the people he didnt talk about the homeless he talked about the last hours of the burton family he talked about the babys last meal in the church he talked about the cookies the boys had eaten he described how the little family left the church and went back onto the streets into the snowstorm where lontae and her children lived only a few more hours mordecai described things he didnt actually know had happened but didnt care and the crowd didnt either when he described the family trying to get warm before they died i heard women crying around me if this man mordecai green could make a crowd cry like this he must be a great lawyer when mordecai finished we marched to the capitol the government building carrying the coffins i had never been on a march like this before rich people dont march their world is safe and clean and there are laws to keep them happy but now i too carried my photograph of a yearold black mother who had died for nothing in a car i wasnt the same person as i had been before mister and ontario came into my life and i could never be that person again so i accepted when mordecai green phoned me a few days later and invited me to a restaurant near dupont circle and when he invited me to join the th street law center i accepted his offer of a job too we can pay you thirty thousand dollars a year smiled mordecai youll be a partner lets see drake and sweeney beat that i smiled too i nearly told him about the file i needed from drake and sweeney the file that would give us the story of devon hardys eviction but i didnt that night i told claire my news it was almost ten and we were sitting in our favorite chairs with glasses of wine after a few minutes i said we need to talk what is it she asked unworried im thinking of leaving drake and sweeney oh really she either expected this or wanted to seem calm i had told her all about lontae burton and her family yes i cant go back there why not the works boring and unimportant i want to do something to help people i told you about mordecai green his law center has offered me a job im starting monday how much did he offer you thirty thousand a year thats ninety thousand dollars a year less than you earn now you dont do work for the homeless for the money as young law and medical students we had wanted to help people we told ourselves then that money was not important and now im tired she said she finished her wine and went to the bedroom the next day she visited a divorce lawyer i promised to leave the apartment by the weekend chapter seven braden chance and riveroaks the note read top key is to chances door bottom key is to the file drawer under the window i went back to drake and sweeney for my last day they didnt want me to leave there was a lot of work and they didnt want to find someone new i was invited to breakfast with arthur jacobs in the partners private dining room on the eighth floor how could i turn my back on a world of breakfasts in the partners dining room that was the idea over breakfast arthur suggested that i could stop working at drake and sweeney for a year and work pro bono work that lawyers do for no money to help people usually the very poor at the law center he said that drake and sweeney should do more pro bono work he offered to pay the difference between the law centers thirty thousand a year and what i earned at drake and sweeney i smiled i would be drake and sweeneys pro bono boy for a year and they could all feel good about themselves during that year a partner would take my clients i would return after a year happy and take my clients back actually i didnt say no immediately they had at least tried arthur often talked about pro bono work though clients and their paid hours always came first but i thought about the offer and then i said no by now i hated my old work too much to go back to it i didnt like the old me that had done the work very much either i was trying to explain to arthur that i was a different man now when braden chance sat down at a table not far from ours he didnt see me at first but then i saw him staring at me good morning braden i said loudly arthur turned around to see who i was talking to you know him he asked quietly weve met i said hes a fool said arthur very quietly it was the same word the legal assistant had used about chance when i got back to my office there were two files on my desk they hadnt been there before my breakfast with arthur in the first one there was a list of names headed people evicted riveroaks number four was devon hardy number ten was lontae burton and three children i sat there for two or three minutes in silence why would anyone put something like this on my desk if the information wasnt true at the bottom of the page someone had written a few words in pencil the eviction was wrong i opened the second file there were two keys in it and a typed note the note read top key is to chances door bottom key is to the file drawer under the window i put the files away i had to do some work i also had a working lunch that day working lunch meant that the client was paying but the law had never seemed so unimportant and boring i got through the day only because i knew it was my last at drake and sweeney it was almost five before i got a few minutes alone i said goodbye to polly and locked the office door from the inside i took the files out again and began to think and make notes i had an idea who had sent the files the young legal distant who had called chance a fool legal assistants did the evictions and it was his job to put documents in the file i phoned another legal assistant and asked him for the name of chances distant the guy was called hector palma he had been with drake and sweeney about three years all in real estate we met in the library on the third floor hector palma was very nervous did you put those files on my desk i asked him there was no time to play games what files his eyes went around and around the room looking at everything except me the riveroaks eviction you were there right yeah he said whats in the riveroaks file bad stuff tell me i have a wife and four kids i need this job youll be ok youre leaving what do you care i wasnt surprised he knew people talked i was news so before i leave you want me to go into chances office and take a file and i cant be sure whats in it do what you want and he ran out of the library i went back to my office and made some more notes i would lose my job if i was caught taking the file but i was already leaving it would be much worse if i was caught in chances office with a key that wasnt mine i didnt like the idea at all then there was the problem of copying the file some drake and sweeney files were very thick i would have to stand in front of a photocopier for a long time and also our photocopiers worked from a plastic card that had our names on it drake and sweeney knew exactly who copied what i could use a photocopier somewhere else but it was illegal to take the file from the building and i was a lawyer but couldnt i just borrow the file i only needed it for half an hour to photocopy it i could take it to the th street law center photocopy it and bring it back immediately that made me a little less of a thief it was now getting late this friday night i was starting work with mordecai on monday it was now or never but i hadnt got a key to the th street law center i looked at my watch it was halfpast six i drove to th street my partners were still there sofia actually smiled at me but only for a second welcome to your new job said mordecai seriously like i needed all the luck in the world how about this he said pointing at my new office the best office in the area beautiful i said stepping inside my new office was about half the size of the one i had just left my drake and sweeney desk would be too big to go in there there was no phone i like it i said and i did ill get you a phone tomorrow said mordecai it was dark and sofia wanted to leave mordecai and i ate some sandwiches he had bought he made us both coffee i looked at the copier it was about ten years old but i knew it worked what time are you leaving tonight i asked mordecai with my mouth full of sandwich i dont know in an hour maybe why im going back to drake and sweeney for a couple of hours i have some last minute stuff they want me to finish then id like to come back here late would that be possible mordecai was eating his sandwich he reached into a drawer and threw me a key come and go as you please he said will it be safe no so be careful park as close to the door as you can walk fast then lock yourself in i walked fast to my car at seventhirty the sidewalk was empty my lexus was fine maybe i would be ok on the streets the drive back to drake and sweeney took eleven minutes if it took thirty minutes to copy chances file then it would be out of his office for about an hour and he would never know real estate was empty i knocked on chances door no answer i used the key to his door and went in should i turn on the light it was dark i would have to i locked the door turned on the light went to the bottom file drawer under the window and unlocked it with the second key i found the riveroaks file and was reading through it when a voice outside shouted hey and i jumped a conversation started outside two guys were talking baseball i turned off the lights listening to their talk then i sat on chances sofa for ten minutes i could put the file back if they saw me leaving chances office nothing would be done it was my last day but if they saw me taking a file that was very different be patient i told myself after baseball they started talking about girls i think they were a couple of young legal assistants working late then finally it was quiet i locked the drawer in the dark opened the door and went out hey shouted someone behind me i ran i ran to the back of the building got into the lexus and drove off that was stupid i thought why did i run why didnt i talk to the guy i still worked at drake and sweeney didnt i that was my last thought before the lexus was hit by a jaguar speeding down th street i remember a voice saying i dont see any blood and then i remember claire sitting by my bed at the george washington university medical center chapter eight hector palma michael you wont be a lawyer when theyve finished not here not anywhere youre going to lose your license i woke up at seven in the morning and a nurse gave me a note from claire it was a really sweet note it said that she had to go to work and that she had spoken to my doctors and i probably wouldnt die claire and i must look like a happily married couple to the doctors and nurses why were we getting a divorce my left arm was blue my chest hurt when i breathed i looked at my face in the bathroom there were some small cuts but nothing that wouldnt disappear over the weekend a nurse told me the jaguar had been driven by a gang member who sold drugs welcome to the streets i thought as i tried not to breathe too much the doctor came at seventhirty no bones were broken they wanted me to stay in hospital for one more day just to be safe but i said no i had to find a new apartment the first real estate office sent me to an apartment at adamsmorgan north of dupont circle it was three little rooms at the top of a house everything in the bathroom worked the floor was clean there was a view over the streets i took it that evening i went back to my old apartment to see claire we ate a chinese carryout our first ever meal together had been a carryout and this was our last meal together as husband and wife claire had the divorce papers waiting for me on the table and i signed them in six months i would be single do you know someone called hector palma she asked halfway through the chinese dinner my eyes opened wide yes he called an hour ago said he had to talk to you who is he a legal assistant with drake and sweeney he wants me to help him he has a problem must be a big one he wants to meet with you at nine tonight at nathans on m street why a bar i said half to myself half to claire he didnt say he sounded strange on the phone suddenly i wasnt hungry i finished the meal only because i didnt want to look worried in front of claire but it wasnt necessary she wasnt even looking at me i walked to m street parking is impossible on a saturday night it was raining and my chest hurt as i walked i thought about what to say i thought of lies i could tell after taking the file it seemed easier to lie hector might be there for drake and sweeney he might be wired to record what i said i would listen carefully and say little nathans was only halffull i was ten minutes early but he was there waiting for me at a table in the corner as i came in he jumped up from his seat and put his hand out you must be michael im hector palma from real estate nice to meet you huh didnt we meet in the library we sat down he started kicking me under the table i understood he was wired and they were watching a waiter came i ordered black coffee and hector asked for a beer im a legal assistant in real estate hector explained as the drinks arrived youve met braden chance one of our partners yes i said as they were recording everything i said i would say as little as possible i work mainly for him you and i spoke for a minute one day last week when you visited his office if you say so i dont remember seeing you he smiled and i kicked him back under the table we both understood the situation now listen i asked you to meet me because a file is missing from bradens office and you think i took it well no but it could be you you asked for that file when you went into his office last week so you do think i took it i said angrily well go to the police hector palma drank some of his beer drake and sweeney have already gone to the police he said the police found an empty file in your desk with a note about two keys one to the door the other to a file drawer they also found your fingerprints on the file drawer i hadnt thought about fingerprints drake and sweeney took everybodys fingerprints when they joined the company but that was five years ago and i had forgotten about it we might want to speak to you about all this again later said hector palma i picked up my coat and left i spent my first working day at the th street law c center getting the file back from the wreck of the lexus mordecai helped me we had to go to georgia avenue where the police keep wrecked cars i told mordecai that the file was important but not what was in it back home in my new apartment i looked at the file riveroaks was a real estate company they wanted to build a new mail office for the washington post office and then rent the building to them they had bought the warehouse where devon hardy and lontae burton lived and they wanted to pull it down and start rebuilding they were in a hurry they wanted to start pulling the warehouse down in february on january hector palma visited the warehouse his note about that visit was on the list of documents in the file but it wasnt actually in the file somebody had taken it out almost certainly chance after mister had visited us on friday january hector palma returned to the warehouse with the police and evicted the people who were living there the eviction had taken three hours hector palmas note about it was two pages long although he tried to hide what he felt it was clear that he disliked being part of the eviction he described how lontae burton had fought with the police my heart stopped when i read the mother had three children one a baby she lived in a tworoom apartment with no bathroom they slept on the floor she fought with the policemen while her children watched in the end she was carried out of the building i drove to th street and copied the file then i went back to my old apartment claire was at the hospital i took my sleeping bag a few suits my radio the small tv from the kitchen my cd player and a few cds a coffeepot a hair dryer and three blue towels i left a note telling her i was gone i didnt know what i felt i had never moved out before i wasnt sure how it was done as i drove away i didnt feel happy to be single again claire and i had both lost back at the th street law center my first visitor was my old friend barry nuzzo he sat down carefully in the chair opposite my desk he didnt want to get dirt on his expensive suit was he wired like hector palma maybe they had sent barry because he was my friend and also one of misters guests that tuesday afternoon so youre here for the money he said joke of course youre crazy theyre going to come after you michael you cant take a file you mean a criminal lawsuit for theft probably and they talked to the bar association rafters working on it michael you wont be a lawyer when theyve finished not here not anywhere youre going to lose your license i wasnt ready for that i have the file the file has plenty of information about drake and sweeney in it you cant use the file michael you cant use it in a lawsuit because you took it from our offices and thats theft i said nothing i didnt know what i was going to do but i knew i couldnt give the file back now i had nothing else in the fight against drake and sweeney barry stood up to leave will you phone me some time michael he said at the door sure chapter nine the homeless im michael where do you live ruby here and there the building had been a department store many years ago now the sign on it said samaritan house its a private shelter mordecai said ninety beds the foods ok some churches in arlington got together and they pay for everything weve been coming here for six years inside we used a bedroom as an office this is a good office mordecai said we can be private here what about a bathroom i asked theyre in the back you dont get your own bathroom in a shelter i could hear radios people were getting up it was monday morning and they had jobs to go to is it easy to get a room here i asked mordecai although i already knew the answer nearly impossible theres a long waiting list how long do they stay maybe three months this is one of the nicer shelters so theyre safe here after three months the shelter tries to find them an apartment and our clients all come from shelters i asked half come from the shelters mordecai said the other half from the streets we take anybody anybody whos homeless the people here at this shelter have jobs but they dont earn enough to pay rent for an apartment so when they get one they lose it again one missed paycheck and they lose their homes my first client was called waylene age twentyseven two children no husband her problem wasnt complicated she had worked in a fastfood restaurant she started to tell us why she left her job but mordecai said that the reason didnt matter she hadnt had her last two paychecks because she had no address the restaurant had sent the checks to the wrong place the checks had disappeared and nobody at the restaurant cared will you be here next week mordecai asked waylene wasnt sure maybe here maybe there she was looking for a job she might move in with someone or get her own apartment well get your money and well have the checks sent to our office said mordecai he gave her the address of the th street law center she said thanks and left call the fastfood restaurant mordecai told me tell them youre waylenes lawyer be nice at first if they dont send the checks stop being nice if necessary go there and get the checks yourself i wrote down everything mordecai said like it was complicated waylenes paychecks were for two hundred and ten dollars my last client at drake and sweeney was trying to get nine hundred million dollars but i was happy enough when i got home at the end of the day my new apartment now had some old chairs in it and the tv was on a box i smiled at my furniture my mother had called i listened to her voice on the answerphone she and dad wanted to visit me that evening i watched basketball on tv and had a few beers at eleventhirty i called claire we hadnt talked in four days why shouldnt we talk we were actually still married i thought maybe we could have dinner soon the phone rang and then a voice said hello it was a man i couldnt speak i had been gone less than a week and claire had a man in the apartment at eleventhirty i almost put the phone down but then i said id like to speak to claire please whos calling michael her husband shes in the shower he said he sounded pleased with himself tell her i called i said i walked around the room until midnight then i went for a walk in the cold why did our marriage go wrong who was that guy was he someone she had known for years and i didnt know about him i told myself it didnt matter we werent divorcing because of other people we were divorcing because of us and if she was free to find another guy then i was free to find someone too yeah right at am i was walking around dupont circle stepping over people sleeping in the street it was dangerous but i didnt care after a couple of hours i went home and got some sleep then i wanted to work i got to th street before eight that morning ready to start as i walked through the snow making my way to the law center i thought of my clients by now i had a few there was waylene and her paychecks there was also marvis like me marvis wanted a divorce his wife was on drugs she had taken everything he had including their two children marvis wanted them back how long will a divorce take marvis had asked me six months i told him marvis was clean he didnt drink and he was looking for work i enjoyed the half hour i spent with him and i wanted to help him another client was a yearold woman her husband was dead and the government was sending her money to the wrong place i could get all her money back and then get it sent to the right place a lot of my clients had problems like that they were just not getting money often from the government that should be theirs when i reached the law center a little woman was sitting against our door the office was still locked it was below freezing in the streets when she saw me she jumped to her feet and said good morning are you a lawyer yes i am for people like me she looked like she was homeless sure come in i opened the door it was colder inside than outside i made some coffee and found some old cookies i offered them to her and she quickly ate one whats your name i asked we were sitting in the front office next to sofias desk waiting for the coffee and for the office to get a little warmer ruby she said im michael where do you live ruby here and there she was between thirty and forty dressed in a lot of old clothes she was very thin tell me i said i need to know do you live in a shelter not now she said i live in a car i sleep in the back i poured two large paper cups full of coffee and we went into my office what can i do for you i asked with both hands on the coffee cup to keep warm and without looking at me she told me her story she and her son terence lived in a small apartment when terence was about ten she went to prison for four months for selling drugs terence lived with her sister those four months but when ruby came out of prison they had lost the apartment she and terence slept in cars warehouses and under bridges in warm weather when it was cold they went to the shelters she couldnt stop taking drugs a few years back she had worked for a couple called rowlands their children were grown and away from home ruby offered to pay mr and mrs rowlands fifty dollars a month if terence could stay with them the rowlands werent sure at first but in the end they agreed terence had a small bedroom at the rowlands house he started to get good grades at school the rowlands were good people ruby was allowed to visit terence for an hour each night with great difficulty she managed to pay each month as agreed she was pleased with herself until she went to prison again she couldnt stop taking drugs and now terence didnt want to talk to her he wanted to join the army mr rowlands was an army man one night ruby took some drugs and then went to the rowlands house she screamed and shouted and the rowlands and terence threw her out the next day the rowlands started a lawsuit they wanted terence to become their son ruby wasnt allowed to visit him until she stopped taking drugs i want to see my son she said i miss him so bad you wont see terence until you stop the drugs i said trying to say it nicely i had to get her onto a drugs program sofia knew where ruby should go sofia knew everything and everybody she made a phone call and then ruby and i were on our way to naomis womens center on th street it opened at seven closed at four and between those hours helped women with a drug problem i spoke with megan the young woman in charge of naomis we had a long talk it was the first long talk i had had with anyone in a long time chapter ten chicago theres going to be a lawsuit hector i said against drake and sweeney you cant hide from that i was sleeping on the floor at the apartment i liked it down there and it helped me understand my new clients in the middle of the night the phone rang it was claire the police were in her apartment wanting to search it for the file i looked at my watch it was am ill be right there the door was open and i ran in there were three policemen in there and i shouted at the nearest one im michael brock who are you lieutenant gasko said the policeman not very nicely claire i shouted get the video camera theres going to be a lawsuit lieutenant gasko lieutenant gasko showed me a document its signed by a judge he said and it says we can search for the file but he knew i was lawyer and he didnt look very happy the files not here because i dont live here i said now give me your names and then go claire was filming it all with the video camera their document was fine and i knew that but the three policemen gave me their names and then left can they come back asked claire no thats good did you tell them where i live i asked her michael i dont know where you live you just gave her a phone number i said goodnight without touching or kissing her i knew that was what she wanted i thought hard now i had to tell mordecai everything it was possible that the police would come to the law center looking for the file next morning i tried to phone hector palma from the law center his secretary said he had left the washington office i put the phone down now what i stared at the ceiling mordecai came into my office i started my story my wife and i arent together i moved out of our apartment im sorry said mordecai what else could he say dont be early this morning the police tried to search the apartment where i used to live they were looking for a file that i took when i left drake and sweeney what kind of file the devon hardy and lontae burton file im listening i dont think that devon hardy and lontae burton and the others were squatters i think they were tenants and if they were tenants the eviction was illegal it sure was cant evict tenants without warning but do you know or are you guessing i told mordecai the story of the riveroaks file i told him that something probably a note dated january was missing from the file and what do you think is in this note he asked i cant be sure but i think its a note from hector palma i think he knew they were tenants and he said that in the note but riveroaks wanted them out quickly so they could start pulling the warehouse down they wanted to start the new building for the post office in february i think hector palmas note of january was removed from the file so drake and sweeney could evict devon hardy and lontae burton and the others as squatters good said mordecai so we start a lawsuit for the family of lontae burton and the other people who were evicted yes i said that way hector palma has to tell the judge what he knows ill contact lontae burtons parents mordecai said they would be our clients in the lawsuit her parents are dead but she has a grandmother fine shell be our client but first we need to find hector palma i think drake and sweeney will keep him in the company if he leaves the company they lose control of him but they want him out of washington i think hes working for drake and sweeney in another city probably a new job with more money sofia shouted mordecai loud enough to be heard on capitol hill sofia were looking for someone sofia came in with paper and a pencil i know she said i heard she turned to me i can help tell me everything you know about this person i told sofia hector palmas name address and job i described him and said he had a wife and four kids age maybe thirty how much did he get a month at drake and sweeney as a legal assistant three thousand he has four kids so one or more will be in school he cant send kids to a private school on thirtyfive thousand well start with the schools then the churches she went back to her desk and she was on the phone for an hour each time she said hello in english asked for the person she wanted and then the conversation was in spanish an hour later she came back into my office they moved to chicago do you need an address but how did you dont ask a friend of a friend in their church they moved to chicago last weekend i can get you an address but it will take longer i dont need an address ive been to drake and sweeneys chicago office a couple of times two days later i was there again but i hadnt flown first class as in the old days i waited outside the drake and sweeney building from seven in the morning while lawyersthe third highest number after washington and new york arrived for work at hector palma arrived and i followed him into the building he got off on floor number fiftyone there was a phone there i phoned mordecai and told him about my progress then i phoned megan at naomis womens center ruby was still there doing ok hector palma wasnt going anywhere for the next ten hours so i had another long talk with megan there was a list of partners names on each floor i chose one i have an appointment with dick heile i said loudly as i passed the desk and then i walked past the desk down the hall hector had his own office in chicago hello hector i said as i walked in so hows chicago what what are you doing here i sat on hectors desk theres going to be a lawsuit hector i said against drake and sweeney you cant hide from that i didnt feel as confident as i tried to sound and whos starting this lawsuit lontae burtons grandmother and later the other people who were evicted when we find them hector just looked at me you remember lontae dont you hector she was the young mother who fought with the policemen when you were evicting everyone you felt bad about it because you knew she was a tenant so you wrote that in a note dated january and you put that in the file but braden chance took your note out again thats why im here hector i want a copy of that note why would i have a copy because youre smart hector you knew that drake and sweeneys evictions were illegal you knew how important your note was maybe you even guessed braden chance would remove it hector thought about that i guessed he wouldnt be happy hiding in chicago the evictions were wrong and he knew it he had tried to help me once before meet me at twelve in front of the building he said he was there on time i have four children please protect me he said as he gave me an envelope i thanked him got a taxi and opened the envelope the note was dated january it said that the tenants were paying one hundred dollars month rent on the fifteenth of every month to man called johnny there was even a copy of a receipt signed by johnny saying that he had received one hundred dollars rent from lontae burton on january it couldnt be any clearer they were tenants the eviction was illegal at chicago o hare airport i faxed copies of the note and the receipt to mordecai then i caught the next plane back to washington a taxi from the airport took me back to th street where mordecai and sofia werent looking as happy as i had expected lieutenant gasko was in the office waiting for me as he took me out to the police car sofia was phoning fast and talking fast first in english then in spanish but she and mordecai couldnt stop lieutenant gasko taking me to central police station like any other criminal drake and sweeney said i had taken their file and that was theft chapter eleven megan her eyes held mine for a second and i thought no wedding ring on her finger it was friday afternoon i knew mordecai could get me out on bail but some very bad things could happen to a good looking white boy in prison over the weekend in the police car to central i tried to think about all the great people who had spent some time in prison like martin luther king but then i thought of my parents their son in prison would be the end of their world my friends already thought i had ruined my life i didnt know what claire would think especially as she had a new man now at central gasko led me like a lost dog they took everything i had in my pockets and i signed for it then my photograph and fingerprints were taken there were police everywhere but only one other white face a man who was very drunk we were walking to the cells i was scared can i get bail i asked i think your lawyers working on it gasko said the cell door closed behind me there were five other prisoners in the cell with me all black all much younger than me i sat on the floor in the cell opposite i could see the drunk white guy and hear him shouting two large black men had him in a corner of the cell they were hitting his head minutes passed one of the young guys in my cell walked over to me this was the end nice jacket he said touching my jacket with his foot as i sat on the floor thanks i said trying to sound like i meant it he was eighteen or nineteen thin probably a gang member who had spent his life on the streets i could use a jacket like that he said giving me a kick with his foot you shouldnt be a lowlife street gang member then i thought would you like to borrow the jacket i asked i wasnt going to fight back if i did the other four would help the first one what did you say i said would you like to borrow the kick caught me in the head and i shouted from the shock my friend said he could use a jacket like that said one of the other four a gift would be nice i quickly took off my jacket and held it toward the young gang member who had kicked me is this a gift he said taking it its whatever you want it to be he kicked me again hard in the head is this a gift yes thanks man i sat in a ball on the floor my face hurt the floor was getting cold what would happen when i needed the toilet nice shoes said a voice above me i gave them to him mordecai got me out on bail at pm my bail was ten thousand dollars my friends at drake and sweeney had told the newspapers about my stay in prison lawyer out on bail was it theft i read the next day they took a photo of me when i first joined drake and sweeney and that was there too they were trying to ruin my life i wondered which client was paying for all the hours rafter and arthur jacobs were spending on me a client was definitely paying a client paid for every hour of every lawyers time riveroaks probably i went in to work at th street ruby was asleep in front of the door why are you sleeping here i asked she didnt answer she was hungry i unlocked the door made coffee and went to find the cookies the phone rang it was megan ruby had left naomis are you taking drugs again i asked ruby she didnt look at me no she said yes you are dont lie to me ruby im your friend and your lawyer and ill help you see terence but i cant help if you lie to me now will you go back to naomis yes good ill take you ok she took another cookie her fourth on the way back to naomis she said you were in prison how did you know you hear stuff on the street when we arrived megan took ruby into the womens group and then asked me to stay for coffee she threw a washington post to me bad night huh she said with a smile there was my photo again it wasnt too bad whats this she asked pointing at my face a guy in my cell wanted my shoes he took them she looked at my shoes old nikes those yes good shoes arent they how long were you in there a couple of hours then i got my life together im a new man now she smiled again a perfect smile her eyes held mine for a second and i thought no wedding ring on her finger she was tall and a little too thin her hair was dark red and short and wellcut her eyes were light brown very big and round and nice to look at she was very attractive and i wondered why i hadnt noticed it before i told her about me she told me about herself her father was in the church in maryland he liked baseball and he loved washington as a teenager megan had decided to work with the poor it was a job but a job she liked i told her the story of mister and how i had started working with the homeless she was very interested and asked lots of questions then she asked me to come back later for lunch if the sun was shining we could eat outside i liked that i thought it was romantic you can find love anywhere even in a shelter for homeless women chapter twelve the washington post the photographs said it all because of drake and sweeney these poor people were dead the file was thick rafter had worked very hard it was my copy of drake and sweeneys complaint to the bar association in one sentence i had stolen their file so now i should lose my license but it was a shock drake and sweeney wanted blood my blood it was frightening since i had started law school ten years earlier i had never thought of any other kind of work what would i do without a law license but there was one thing drake and sweeney didnt know yet tomorrow morning at nine oclock mordecai and i were starting a four million dollar lawsuit against them for the death of the burton family i went into mordecais office what do i do i said he smiled same as they did call the washington post i was at college with tim claussen hes one of their best journalists next morning we told tim claussen about the lawsuit against drake and sweeney the burton story was already big as a result of the march and my night in prison and this made it even bigger he asked us a lot of questions and i was happy to answer drake and sweeney went to the newspapers first the story was in the newspaper the next day for an old law company like drake and sweeney it was the worst thing in the world arthur jacobss photo appeared next to devon hardys there were also photographs of lontae burton taken from the march you didnt even have to read the story the photographs said it all because of drake and sweeney these poor people were dead the next day it got even worse for drake and sweeney the post office didnt like all these stories in the newspapers and they didnt want riveroaks as their real estate company that left riveroaks with nothing riveroaks told the washington post they didnt know the evictions were illegal a million dollar lawsuit for lost business by riveroaks against drake and sweeney was becoming possible arthur jacobs phoned mordecai at the law center he wanted to meet mordecai at drake and sweeneys offices to talk about the lawsuit without me mordecai smiled at me this could be the meeting he said maybe i replied my future could depend on mordecais talk with arthur jacobs that night i couldnt sleep mordecai was enjoying himself he told me afterward that he couldnt believe arthur jacobs was nearly eighty the old man told mordecai immediately that braden chance was gone he didnt choose to leave drake and sweeney they told him to go chance had been the only one who knew those people were tenants i believed that mordecai showed arthur jacobs the missing note from the file and the receipt rafter was at the meeting too with some other lawyers and for a long time none of them said a word then arthur jacobs made a suggestion he said he wanted to meet with us and a judge with the judge there we could decide everything on one day the burton lawsuit the theft of the file lawsuit and the bar association complaint the judge would be judge deorio who mordecai knew was a fair judge what do you think mordecai asked me what do you think i say we do it ill call judge deorio and arrange a time chapter thirteen burton against drake and sweeney you put this family on the street youve told us you did and thats where they died we were in judge deorios room but this wasnt a court there were two lawyer from riveroaks from drake and sweeney there was arthur jacobs rafter nathan malamud and barry nuzzo why malamud and nuzzo who were not going to speak for drake and sweeney then i understood malamud and nuzzo had gone back to work after that tuesday with mister they were fine so why wasnt i judge deorio said good morning and then gave mordecai five minutes to make the complaint against drake and sweeney in the burton lawsuit mordecai needed just two minutes he explained clearly how drake and sweeneys illegal eviction led to the deaths of lontae burton and her children arthur jacobs spoke for drake and sweeney he didnt disagree with mordecai about what had happened to lontae and her children but he said it was in part her own fault there were places for her to go arthur said there were shelters open she spent the night before in a church with many other people why did she leave her grandmother has an apartment in northeast why didnt this mother do more to protect her little family why was she in the street at all deorio asked and i almost smiled arthur stayed calm the eviction was wrong he said we are not arguing with mr green about that we are saying that events after the eviction were partly the mothers fault how much of it was her fault asked judge deorio at least half thats too high we dont agree judge deorio mr green mordecai stood shaking his head in disbelief like arthur was a firstyear law student there people have nowhere to live mr jacobs thats why theyre called homeless you put this family on the street youve told us you did and thats where they died we could go to court would you say the same thing there stand up in court mr jacobs say it was the mothers fault her family died arthur and the rest of the drake and sweeney lawyers looked scared enough at the idea of telling a court full of black people that the burton familys death was in part lontaes fault drake and sweeney are guilty of an illegal eviction said judge deorio thats clear i wouldnt advise you to blame the mother in a court mordecai and arthur sat down we had won the burton lawsuit without going to court now we would discuss how much drake and sweeney should pay rafter stood up he talked about how much money you usually got for dead children in lawsuits he had read a lot of these lawsuits across the us he offered fifty thousand dollars for each child he became boring he started to discuss the amount of money lontae had lost because she died and so she didnt go to work that was added to the money you usually got for dead children in total he offered seven hundred and seventy thousand dollars is that your final offer mr rafter asked judge deorio he looked like he hoped it wasnt no sir rafter said mr green mordecai stood again we do not accept their offer judge deorio sir this talk of the value of each child means nothing to me i know how much i can get if this comes to court and the people of washington decide and that is a lot more than mr rafter is offering these children were of course homeless black children mr rafter you have a son at private school would you take fifty thousand dollars for him rafter looked down and didnt reply i can walk into a washington court and i can get a million dollars each for lontae burtons little children thats the same as any child in an expensive school in virginia or maryland the defense team looked at each other they all had kids in expensive schools in virginia and maryland mordecai then talked about the last hours of lontae burton and her family as he had at capitol hill he was a born storyteller and he had a good story to tell his voice went up and then down in anger at the end he pointed at the drake and sweeney lawyers speaking for them those people in that warehouse he shouted theyre just a bunch of squatters throw them out he asked for four million dollars it was silent in the room when he finished judge deorio made some notes the next thing to discuss was the file do you have the file judge deorio asked me yes sir will you give it to me yes sir mordecai gave judge deorio the file and we all sat and watched for ten minutes while the judge read it when he had finished he said the file has been returned mr jacobs there was a criminal lawsuit about its theft what do you want to do now if we can agree on the burton lawsuit we will stop the criminal lawsuit against mr brock for theft of the file mr brock is that acceptable to you yes yes sir it is next we have the complaint to the bar association by drake and sweeney against michael brock mr jacobs arthur stood up again he talked about why it was wrong for a lawyer to steal a file from his own company he didnt seem to be enjoying it and he didnt take too long about it but i had been one of them and then i had damaged them they wouldnt forgive me for that the complaint to the bar association wouldnt be stopped i wasnt a criminal arthur said so they would stop the theft lawsuit but i was a lawyer and a good one and so the complaint should go to the bar association the lawyers from riveroaks didnt speak but it was clear they agreed it was of course their clients file i had taken and arthur spoke so well that actually i agreed with him too mr brock said judge deorio do you have anything to say i hadnt prepared anything but i wasnt afraid to say what i felt i looked arthur in the eyes and said mr jacobs i have always had a very high opinion of you and i still do i was wrong to take the file and i am sorry i did it i was looking for information and i was going to put the file back but all that is no excuse i apologize to you to drake and sweeney and to your client riveroaks mordecai told me afterwards that he knew immediately drake and sweeney would agree to his next suggestion the anger had gone out of the situation mordecai suggested twentyfive thousand dollars each to all the people evicted by drake and sweeney when we could find them he suggested three million dollars for the burton lawsuit paid at three hundred thousand a year and after a lot of talk we agreed that i would lose my license for nine months only chapter fourtheen a new life im thinking about my new life i said and we both smiled early friday i was happily helping homeless people at the th street law center though not of course speaking as a lawyer when arthur jacobs suddenly appeared at my door i said hello nicely though i couldnt imagine what he wanted he said no to coffee he just wanted to talk arthur said that the last few weeks had been the most difficult of his fiftysix years as a lawyer drake and sweeney was ok again now but he still couldnt sleep he felt guilty about the deaths of the burton family and he would never forget it and he was tired of chasing money i was too surprised to say much so i just listened arthur was suffering and i felt sorry for him he asked about the law center and the work we did how long had the center been there how many people worked there where did the money come from this gave me an opportunity and i took it i told arthur that because i couldnt work as a lawyer i was starting a pro bono program i was going to use lawyers from the big washington law companies these volunteer lawyers would work a few hours a week and i would tell them what to do we could reach thousands of homeless people arthur liked the idea as we discussed it the program grew larger after a few minutes he was talking about sending all of his washington lawyers to do pro bono work for a few hours a week would lawyers be too many arthur asked no i said but ill need help from inside drake and sweeney i know someone hes at the chicago office but im sure you can get him back as i had guessed arthur knew nothing about hector palma or how he had helped me get the riveroaks file hector would be back in washington in a month working with me arthur stayed in my office for two hours he was a much happier man when he left he had a purpose in life i walked him to his car and then ran to tell mordecai the good news we could help as many homeless people as we needed to megans uncle owned a house near fenwick island right near the ocean a perfect place for a weekend break we left washington friday afternoon i drove and megan told me where to go and ruby sat in the back seat eating cookies excited by the thought of spending a few days outside the city megan had told me very clearly that there were three bedrooms in her uncles house one for each of us it rained saturday a cold shower that blew in from the ocean megan and i sat and watched it out of the window sitting close together on the couch wheres our client i asked ruby watching tv what are you thinking she asked quietly everything and nothing thirtytwo days earlier i had been married to another woman living in a different apartment and doing different work i didnt even know the woman whose head was now on my shoulder how could life change so much in a month im thinking about my new life i said and we both smiled the end
