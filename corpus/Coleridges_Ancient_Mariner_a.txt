coleridge i the beginnings coleridge lived in what may safely be called the most momentous period of modern history in the year following his birth warren hastings was appointed first governorgeneral of india where he maintained english empire during years of war with rival nations and where he committed those acts of cruelty and tyranny which called forth the greatest eloquence of the greatest of english orators in the famous impeachment trial at westminster when coleridge was a sixteenyearold schoolboy in london a few years before his birth the liberal philosophy of france had found a popular voice in the writings of rousseau which became the gospel of revolution throughout europe in coleridges youth and early manhood the new hloise in the field of sentiment and of the relation of the sexes the social contract in political theory and mile in matters of education were books whose influence upon coleridges generation it would be hard to estimate when coleridge was four years old the english colonies in america declared their independence and founded a new nation upon the natural rights of man a nation that has grown to be the mightiest and most beneficent on the globe coleridge was seventeen when the french revolution broke out he was fortythree when napoleon was sent to st helena he saw the whole career of the greatest political upheaval and of the greatest military genius of the modern world fox pitt and burke the greatest liberal orator the greatest parliamentary leader and the greatest philosophic statesman that england has produced were at the height of their glory when coleridge went up to cambridge in in literature naturally since literature is but an interpretation of life the age was not less remarkable dr johnson was still alive when coleridge came up to school at christs hospital goldsmith had died eight years before but a new spirit was abroad in the younger generation macphersons fingal alleged to be a translation from the ancient gaelic poet ossian had appeared in thomas percys reliques of ancient english poetry a collection of folkballads and rude verseromances such as the common people cherished but critics had long refused to consider as poetry was published in these two books were of prime importance in fostering a new taste in literature a love of natural beauty of simplicity and of rude strength the new taste hailed with delight the appearance of a native lyric genius in burns whose first volume of poems was printed in it welcomed also the homely simple sweetness what coleridge and lamb called the divine chitchat of cowper whose task appeared in the preceding year but it was in coleridge himself and his close contemporaries and followers that the splendor of the new poetry showed itself he was two years younger than wordsworth a year younger than scott he was sixteen at the birth of byron twenty at that of shelley twentyfour at that of keats and he outlived all of them except wordsworth his genius blossomed early the ancient mariner his greatest poem was published some years before wordsworths ode on the intimations of immortality was written or scotts lay of the last minstrel he was in the prime of life or what should have been the prime of life forty years old when byron burst into sudden fame with the first two cantos of childe harold in he was fortysix when keats published endymion he was fiftyone when shelley was drowned and of all this gifted company coleridge though not the strongest character or the most prolific poet was the profoundest intellect and the most originative poetic spirit there was little hint however of future greatness or of fellowship with great names in his birth and early circumstances his father was a country clergyman and schoolmaster in the village of ottery st mary in devonshire a simplehearted unworldly man full of curious learning and not very attentive to practical affairs his mother managed the household and brought up the children both his parents were of simple westcountry stock but his father having a natural turn for study and having done well in his early manhood as a schoolmaster went at the age of thirtyone as a sizar or poor student to sidneysussex college cambridge took orders and was afterwards given the living of ottery st mary here he continued his beloved work of teaching in addition to his pastoral duties and by means of this combination won the humble livelihood which through his wifes careful economy sufficed for rearing his large family coleridge tells us that his father had so little of parental ambition in him that he had destined his children to be blacksmiths etc though he had resolved that i should be a parson and had accomplished his intention but for my mothers pride and spirit of aggrandizing her family several of the children rewarded their mothers care by distinguishing themselves in a modest way in the army or in the church but the only one about whom the world is curious now was the youngest of the ten samuel taylor coleridge who was born at ottery st mary october the essential traits of his later character appeared in his early childhood almost from infancy he lived in his imagination rather than in the world of reality the schoolboys drove me from play and were always tormenting me and hence i took no pleasure in boyish sports but read incessantly i became a dreamer and acquired an indisposition to all bodily activity and i was fretful and inordinately passionate sensibility imagination vanity sloth were prominent and manifest in his character before he was eight years old such is his own account of his childhood written to his friend poole in and it is an accurate description as far as it goes of the grown man but of the religious temper too the love of freedom and of virtue the hatred of injustice cruelty and falsehood that guided his uneven steps through all the pitiful struggle of his middle life of the conscience that made his weakness hell to him of these too we may be sure that the beginnings were to be seen in the boy at ottery st mary as indeed they were before his eyes in the person of his father who if not a firstrate genius was says his son a firstrate christian the good vicar died in and the next year a presentation to christs hospital having been secured for him little samuel not yet eleven years old went up to london to enter the famous old city school here in the great city pent mid cloisters dim where he saw nought lovely but the sky and stars one of some seven hundred bluecoat boys coleridge lived for nine years most of the boys at christs hospital then as now were given a commercial education which none the less included a very thorough training in latin but a few of the most promising students were each year selected by the masters for a classical training in preparation for the universities whence they were known as grecians coleridge was elected a grecian in the famous boyer famous for his enthusiasm alike in teaching the classics and in wielding the birch laid the foundation of coleridges later scholarship here too coleridge did a great amount of reading not laid down in the curriculum latin and greek poetry and philosophy mediaeval science and metaphysics and won the approval of his teachers by the excellence of his verses in greek and latin such as boys at school and students at the universities were expected to write in those days in the great city school as in the devonshire vicarage he lived in the imagination inert of body and rapacious of intellect but he was solitary no longer having found his tongue and among his more intellectual schoolfellows an interested audience while yet a boy he would hold an audience spellbound by his eloquent declamation or the fervor of his argument till as lamb who was one of his hearers tells us the walls of the old grey friars reechoed to the accents of the inspired charity boy that is the way his conversation or monologue as it often was affected not boys only but men and especially young men to his dying day he cast a spell upon men by his speech upon his schoolfellows upon young men at the universities in the pantisocracy days upon lloyd and poole at nether stowey upon earnest young thinkers in his last days at highgate so that even if he had never written the ancient mariner and the biographia literaria he would still be remembered for the inspiration of his talk further details of the life at christs hospital must be sought in lambs two essays especially that on christs hospital fiveandthirty years ago in having secured a christs hospital exhibition he entered jesus college cambridge his university life extended over three years from october to december it was an unhappy time for him and an uneasy time for his respectable relatives for reasons that were partly in his own nature and partly in the temper of the times even boyers severe training while it had made him a hard student and an unusual scholar for his years had failed to give him what he most needed as a balance to his intellect and imagination stability of character there is evidence that after the first few months during which the habits of his hard school life had not yet broken the new liberty of university life led him into extravagance if not dissipation work he doubtless did he won the browne medal for a greek ode on the slavetrade in but fitfully giving less and less attention to his regular studies and more to conviviality and above all to dreams of literary fame he wrote verses after various models sentimental fanciful or gallant he was enthusiastic in praise of a contemporary sonneteer the rev william bowles whose divine sensibility seemed to him the height of poetic feeling and in connection with wordsworths younger brother christopher who entered cambridge in he formed a literary society that discussed among other things wordsworths volume of early poetry descriptive sketches published in that year wordsworth himself was a cambridge man but had taken his degree in and gone abroad so that the two men whose personal friendship was to mean so much in english poetry did not meet until already in however coleridge had developed political theories or rather sympathies which were preparing him for fellowship with wordsworth the french revolution which after years of preparation took concrete shape in did not look to young englishmen in as it looks to us now nor even as it was to look to those same englishmen in in those first years warmhearted young enthusiasts at the universities saw in the violence of their fellowmen across the channel only the struggles of the beautiful spirit of liberty bursting the chains of agelong tyranny and corruption and calling men up to the heights to breathe diviner air bliss was it in that dawn to be alive but to be young was very heaven wrote wordsworth afterwards and in the glow of his young idealism he had gone over to france in the autumn of and was on the point of throwing in his lot with the revolutionists when his parents compelled his return by cutting off his supplies and many who like coleridge merely watched from afar shared his faith that a new order of things was to be established wherein love should be law and mans inhumanity to man become but a memory of things outworn less generous men with a selfish interest in established privileges timid men who looked with terror upon any prospect of change older and wiser men who better understood the foundations of social order and the nature of man all these looked with distrust upon the revolutionary idealism that was spreading from france through the younger generation of englishmen the new notions of liberty it was felt threatened not only the vested rights of property and the prescriptions of rank but the church too and religion some of the wouldbe reformers were avowed atheists some coleridge and his friends for instance in the pantisocracy period were communists in general they ascribed all the evils of society to institutions and wanted them abolished just how far coleridge had gone in this direction by the autumn of we do not know far enough at least to disturb his view of the future to worry his elder brother george a clergyman and schoolteacher who had in some measure filled a fathers place to the young genius and most important of all to alarm and distress a gentle girl in london for before he left christs hospital for cambridge he had become intimate at the house of a mrs evans and most of the letters preserved from his first two years at the university were addressed to her or to one of her two daughters anne and mary with the latter coleridge was in love and that she had some regard for him is apparent from a letter she sent him in before that however coleridge had taken a step that seemed likely to close at once his college career and his prospects of literary fame the reasons have not been recorded probably pecuniary embarrassment the yeasty state of his religious and political ideas and impatience or despondency over his loveaffair with mary evans combined to precipitate his flight what we know is that he ran away from cambridge and in december enlisted as a dragoon in the army coleridge had hardly taken the step before he repented of it his letters to his brother george who with other friends bestirred himself for coleridges release as soon as his whereabouts was discovered are rather distressing in their selfabasement the efforts of his friends were successful and in april he returned to the university where a public admonition was the extent of his punishment and he continued in receipt of his christs hospital exhibition but coleridges college days were practically over he was now nearly twentytwo years old and the revolutionary unrest which had doubtless contributed to his first escapade soon resulted in the formation of schemes that took him away from cambridge for good and all in june he made a visit to an old schoolfellow at oxford here he met robert southey of balliol college a friendship sprang up between them out of which before the end of the summer grew the utopian scheme of pantisocracy a company of gentlemen and ladies were to emigrate to america take up lands in the susquehanna valley and there establish an ideal community in which all should bear rule equally and find happiness in a life of justice labor and love the education of the young in the principles of ideal humanity was an important part of the scheme we are reminded of the brook farm experiment in new england a generation later which bears a daughters likeness to pantisocracy the chief difference being that the new england enthusiasts were mature men and women and really put the idea into practice whereas the pantisocrats were for the most part collegians and never got beyond the stage of talking and writing about their plans the scheme was further elaborated at bristol where coleridge returning from a vacation tour in wales again met southey and at bath the home of southey and of southeys betrothed and her sister edith and sarah fricker two sisters milliners of bath as byron contemptuously called them to the other sister sarah coleridge rather precipitately engaged himself his love for mary evans was not dead but he seems to have despaired of winning her and to have determined by uniting himself domestically with southey and his friends to make retreat from their communistic scheme impossible a few weeks later he is back at cambridge tortured apparently between his old love and his new engagement mary evans has written to him deploring his wild notions and the mad plan of pantisocracy yet confident that he has too much sensibility to be an infidel southey has reproved him rather sharply for failing to write to his betrothed at bath our next glimpse of him is at london discussing poetry and philosophy with lamb at the salutation and cat tavern and perhaps trying to get a sight of mary evans in december he is again at bristol in lively correspondence with southey about democracy pantisocracy and poetry but at the same time he addresses a last appeal to miss evans her answer is kind but final that chapter is closed and coleridge writes to southey that he will do his duty by which he means apparently that he will be faithful to pantisocracy and marry sarah fricker the pantisocracy scheme could not in the nature of things be longlived as a matter of fact it lasted little more than a year ending in a rupture between the two leading spirits just when they became brothersinlaw coleridge spent the summer of in bristol in company with southey writing and lecturing in october he was married to sarah fricker in st marys redcliff poor chattertons church in november southey married edith fricker and set sail for lisbon where his uncle was the english chaplain and pantisocracy was dead the break with southey was the natural result of attempting to force through a scheme impracticable in itself and doubly impracticable for the men who conceived it its collapse did not altogether sever their literary relations the collaboration begun in the fall of robespierre cambridge was continued in southeys joan of arc to which coleridge contributed the part afterwards printed with some additions as the destiny of nations and in coleridges first volume of poems bristol a more important contributor to this volume however was charles lamb whose initials were appended to four of the pieces a second edition appeared in june with eleven additions from coleridge besides verses by lamb and charles lloyd all under the title poems by st coleridge second edition to which are added poems by charles lamb and charles lloyd the publisher of both editions was joseph cottle a bookseller of bristol who played the part of provincial murray to the young poets in these years meanwhile coleridge after a period of lecturing and projecting had as we have seen married sarah fricker with whom he was now very much in love and had begun housekeeping in a cottage at clevedon near the bristol channel the beauty of the place and his happiness there are celebrated in the aeolian harp and reflections on leaving a place of retirement better known by its opening words low was our pretty cot his next residence was in bristol rather a base of operations than a home for coleridge was on the road much of the time lecturing preaching soliciting subscriptions for his political and philosophical paper the watchman which ran from march to may and trying in various other ways to provide for his family which was increased by the birth of a son in september at last in december he secured the little cottage at nether stowey in the quantock hills south of the bristol channel in somerset close to the house of his beloved friend thomas poole where he lived until his departure for germany in september ii at nether stowey the stowey period was the blossoming time of coleridges genius all the poems in this volume except the last four and besides these this limetree bower my prison frost at midnight and fears in solitude the bulk of his achievement in poetry were either written or begun in and it will be proper then to dwell a little on his circumstances his friends and his ideas during these two years the means of livelihood for himself and his family when he went to stowey were a subscription of about that poole and some friends got together for him that cottle paid for the second edition of the poems the promise of from the father of charles lloyd who was to live with him and study under his direction and such money as he could earn by reviews and magazine articles which he estimated at a year not a munificent provision for a household of three adults and a child but the theories of the simple life that had made pantisocracy seem a feasible project still inspired him with confidence sixteen shillings he wrote to poole would cover all the weekly expenses of my wife infant and myself this i say from my wifes own calculations further he will support himself by the labor of his hands if you can instruct me to manage an acre and a half of land and to raise in it with my own hands all kinds of vegetables and grain enough for myself and my wife and sufficient to feed a pig or two with the refuse i hope that you will have served me most effectually by placing me out of the necessity of being served this was in december just before he moved to stowey in february he wrote from his new home to another friend from seven till half past eight i work in my garden from breakfast till twelve i read and compose then read again feed the pigs poultry etc till two oclock after dinner work again till tea from tea till supper review so jogs the day and i am happy i raise potatoes and all manner of vegetables have an orchard and shall raise corn with the spade enough for my family we have two pigs and ducks and geese a cow would not answer the keep we have whatever milk we want from t poole there is a suspicious regularity about this schedule lamb wrote from london in january is it a farm that you have got and what does your worship know about farming his agricultural activity in the month of february must have been chiefly prospective and we may safely assume that poole supplied other things besides milk and that the poet spent more time reading dreaming and talking than he did raising potatoes a good deal of time must have been spent in the actual composition of his poetry including his play osorio which was written in and in studying the landscape beauties of the quantocks after the coming of the wordsworths to alfoxden he spent much of the time walking between alfoxden and stowey or further afield with wordsworth and his sister my walks he wrote afterwards were almost daily on the top of quantock and among its sloping coombs with my pencil and memorandumbook in my hand i was making studies as the artists call them and often moulding them into verse with the objects and imagery immediately before my eyes this does not sound much like raising corn with the spade on sundays he would sometimes preach before such unitarian congregations within walking distance as cared to hear him but as he would take no pay for his services his preaching contributed nothing toward the support of his family lloyd who was epileptic and subject to moody variation in his attachments was but an irregular housemate after the first few months and his contribution to the household expenses was correspondingly uncertain the future looked so dark in october that in spite of misgivings and former scruples he had concluded that he must become a unitarian minister as a less evil than starvation accordingly he was in shrewsbury in january preaching in the unitarian church and on the point of accepting the pastorate at a salary of a year when the sky brightened in another quarter thomas and josiah wedgwood sons of the famous potter and friends of thomas poole offered him an equal sum annually as a free gift they were wealthy men well able to afford it they attached no condition to the gift except that he should devote himself entirely to the study of poetry and philosophy which was precisely what he wanted to do and he was not long in determining to accept the offer i accepted it he wrote to wordsworth while still at shrewsbury on the presumption that i had talents honesty and propensities to perseverant effort the propensities alas remained propensities never acquiring the force of habit the pension however continued to be paid in full until when josiah wedgwood withdrew his half of it the other half upon the death of thomas wedgwood in had been secured to coleridge for life and this annuity must have constituted the chief reliance of mrs coleridge for many years if coleridge did not prosper financially he was at least fortunate in his friends and a mans friends are after all the best testimony to the character of his mind and heart when he went to stowey in december he was again on good terms with southey though the enthusiasm of their first fellowship was gone the friendship with lamb begun in their schooldays and renewed at the salutation and cat in was maintained by an eager correspondence and by lambs visit to stowey in july and although lloyds vagaries led to a coolness between the old friends in the following year the breach was soon healed and the friendship continued till death another with whom coleridge maintained a voluminous correspondence in was john thelwall theoretical democrat atheist and admirer of godwin whose visit to coleridge and wordsworth in the summer of so shocked the good conservatives of the neighborhood that wordsworth had to leave alfoxden in consequence of it but without doubt the dearest and most influential friend coleridge had before the wordsworths came into his life was thomas poole it was in order to be in daily intercourse with poole that he moved to stowey and pooles hesitation about securing the cottage for him arising coleridge seemed to fear from imperfect confidence and friendship was a source of agonized apprehension to the sensitive poet when we consider that poole was a selfeducated man a somersetshire tanner with no claim to literary genius or philosophical acquirements coleridges devotion to him and dependence on him bring out in a strong light the substantial elemental character of the man o poole coleridge wrote to him from germany afterwards you are a noble heart as ever god made poole had indeed in a marked degree the genius for friendship strength of character sympathy and selfeffacing devotion combined with prudence and sincerity made this man a tower of refuge for the unstable spirit of the poet no other single relation however can compare in importance for coleridges poetic development with that which sprang up in the summer of between him and william wordsworth just when they first met is not recorded we have seen that coleridge was acquainted with wordsworths younger brother in his college days and discussed with him wordsworths first published poems in january he told cottle that he wished to submit his visions of the maid of arc to wordsworth for criticism the earliest definite record of their personal acquaintance is a letter coleridge wrote to cottle while on a visit to wordsworth at racedown just over the somerset border in dorsetshire early in june about the beginning of july he is again at racedown and when he returns he brings wordsworth and his sister dorothy with him for a visit on the th lamb arrived for his longplanned reunion with coleridge the second week of july was thus a rich and longremembered time for all of them despite the fact that mrs coleridge accidentally emptied a skillet of boiling milk on her husbands foot which confined him during the whole time of charles lambs stay the others took long walks in the neighborhood amid such scenery as is described in this limetree bower my prison a poem that admirably voices the happiness of those days of spiritual fellowship the wordsworths did not return to racedown by a combination of curious circumstances a gentlemans seat with a park and woods elegantly and completely furnished in the most beautiful and romantic situation by the seaside four miles from stowey this we have got for wordsworth at the rent of twentythree pounds a year taxes included coleridge triumphantly announced to southey and in this house the manor of alfoxden the wordsworths remained for a year in daily companionship with coleridge and surrounded by scenes of natural beauty that have left a lasting mark on the work of both poets what the friendship with coleridge meant to wordsworth may best be seen in the prelude or growth of a poets mind wordsworths greatest long poem written some years afterwards and addressed throughout to coleridge there is no grief no sorrow no despair no languor no dejection no dismay no absence scarcely can there be for those who love as we do what wordsworth was to coleridge is more important for us here the admiration which the brilliant child of genius felt for the great preacherpoet is chiefly one feels an admiration for his character as a matter of fact wordsworth had written nothing up to his coming to alfoxden that would have preserved his name as a poet nothing so noteworthy or promising as what coleridge had already written but coleridge felt in this lean and thoughtful young man a strength of mind a depth and sureness of heart that compelled his allegiance and even imparted for the time some of that resolution in which he was by nature so sadly deficient the character of their friendship is to be seen not only in the published work of the two poets from this time on notably in dejection but perhaps even more clearly in dorothy wordsworths journal and in coleridges letters i speak with heartfelt sincerity he wrote to cottle in june and i think unblinded judgment when i tell you that i feel myself a little man by his side and yet do not think myself the less man than i formerly thought myself t pooles opinion of wordsworth is that he is the greatest man he ever knew i coincide wordsworths influence is evident in a letter from coleridge to his brother george in april i love fields and woods and mountains with almost a visionary fondness and because i have found benevolence and quietness growing within me as that fondness has increased therefore i should wish to be the means of implanting it in others and to destroy the bad passions not by combating them but by keeping them in inaction under the calming and clarifying influence of the stronger northern spirit the fever of his revolutionary dreams abated he found happiness in the conscious exercise of his poetic powers and for one year in his troubled existence his genius showed itself in all its splendor the immediate poetic result of their friendship was the lyrical ballads published by cottle in september the origin of the work has been described both by wordsworth in a prefatory note to we are seven and by coleridge in the biographia literaria chap xiv at first they were to collaborate in writing a poem the proceeds of which should pay the expenses of a little tour they were making when the plan was thought of in november and thus the ancient mariner was begun as this poem grew under coleridges shapingspirit of imagination wordsworth saw that he could only be a clog upon its progress and it was resigned to coleridge the plan was then enlarged to include a volume illustrating two cardinal points of poetry the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination wordsworth was to illustrate the former principle coleridge the latter and the proceeds of the book were to go toward the expenses of a trip to germany decided on in the spring of the bulk of the volume was wordsworths and was typically wordsworthian ranging from such simple ballads of humble incident as goody blake and the idiot boy to the magnificent blank verse of tintern abbey coleridges share consisted of a brief poem called the nightingale two short extracts from osorio and the rime of the ancyent marinere apart from the lyrical ballads coleridge conceived and finished between june and the departure for germany in and published in the latter year fire famine and slaughter frost at midnight fears in solitude and france he conceived and partly executed but did not then publish christabel kubla khan love the ballad of the dark ladie and the three graves thus all coleridges best poetry with the exception of those three saddest of voices out of a broken life dejection the lines to wordsworth on hearing him read the prelude and youth and age belongs either wholly or in its inception to the year of his fellowship with the wordsworths in the quantock hills of his political religious and literary opinions at this time he has left a fairly adequate account in his published writings and his correspondence especially in the biographia literaria and in the letter to the rev george coleridge referred to above the first year of his married life saw him still in spite of the failure of pantisocracy an eager visionary reformer upborne by generous enthusiasm and ardent religious feeling o never can i remember those days he wrote in the biographia with either shame or regret for i was most sincere most disinterested my opinions were indeed in many and most important points erroneous but my heart was single wealth rank life itself then seemed cheap to me compared with the interest of what i believed to be the truth and the will of my maker however much he may have consorted with unbelievers like thelwall and distressed his good brother george by his heterodoxy he was by nature deeply religious he tried in his letters to recover thelwall from his atheism though he heartily approved a sentiment expressed by the latter he who thinks and feels will be virtuous and he who is absorbed in self will be vicious whatever may be his speculative opinions godwins system of justice with its soulless logic he abhorred he preached often in unitarian churches to young hazlitt who heard him preach in january from the text and he went up into the mountain to pray himself alone it seemed as if the sounds had echoed from the bottom of the human heart and as if that prayer might have floated in solemn silence through the universe in politics he was when he went to stowey almost equidistant from all the three prominent parties the pittites the foxites and the democrats he was a vehement antiministerialist but after the invasion of switzerland a more vehement antigallican see the last two stanzas of france and still more intensely an antijacobin under wordsworths influence his thoughts turned in great measure from contemporary politics to more fundamental matters always his poetry had been the utterance of his essential being i feel strongly and i think strongly he wrote to thelwall in but i seldom feel without thinking or think without feeling hence though my poetry has in general a hue of tenderness or passion over it yet it seldom exhibits unmixed and simple tenderness and passion my philosophical opinions are blended with or deduced from my feelings wordsworth gave his feelings a new object and his philosophy a higher aim in april of the second year at stowey in the letter to his brother already quoted coleridge wrote i have for some time past withdrawn myself totally from the consideration of immediate causes which are infinitely complex and uncertain to muse on fundamental and general causes the causae causarum i devote myself to such works as encroach not on the antisocial passions in poetry to elevate the imagination and set the affections in right tune by the beauty of the inanimate impregnated as with a living soul by the presence of life in prose to the seeking with patience and a slow very slow mind quid sumus et quidnam victuri gignimus what our faculties are and what they are capable of becoming this last sentence is a sort of halfprophetic summary of his lifes work but the poetry soon gave way to the prose and he never again so nearly realized his poetical ideal as he had already done in the ancient mariner of his person and the impression he made upon people at this time there are various contemporary accounts to thelwall in november he sent the following description of himself my face unless when animated by immediate eloquence expresses great sloth and great indeed almost idiotic goodnature tis a mere carcass of a face fat flabby and expressive chiefly of inexpression yet i am told that my eyes eyebrows and forehead are physiognomically good but of this the deponent knoweth not as to my shape tis a good shape enough if measured but my gait is awkward and the walk of the whole man indicates indolence capable of energies i cannot breathe through my nose so my mouth with sensual thick lips is almost always open in conversation i am impassioned and oppose what i deem error with an eagerness which is often mistaken for personal asperity but i am ever so swallowed up in the thing said that i forget my opponent such am i the rev leapidge smith in his reminiscences of an octogenarian remembered him as a tall dark handsome young man with long black flowing hair eyes not merely dark but black and keenly penetrating a fine forehead a deeptoned harmonious voice a manner never to be forgotten full of life vivacity and kindness dignified in person and added to all these exhibiting the elements of his future greatness hazlitt in my first acquaintance with poets a paper that every student of coleridges life and poetry should read describing him as he appeared on his visit to hazlitts father at wem in says his complexion was at that time clear and even bright his forehead was broad and high light as if built of ivory with large projecting eyebrows and his eyes rolling beneath them like a sea with darkened lustre his mouth was gross voluptuous open eloquent his chin goodhumored and round but his nose the rudder of the face the index of the will was small feeble nothing like what he has done and dorothy wordsworth to close with a contemporary and sympathetic impression set him down in her journal after their first meeting at racedown thus he is a wonderful man his conversation teems with soul mind and spirit at first i thought him very plain that is for about three minutes he is pale thin has a wide mouth thick lips and not very good teeth longish loosegrowing halfcurling rough black hair but if you hear him speak for five minutes you think no more of them his eye is large and full and not very dark but grey such an eye as would receive from a heavy soul the dullest expression but it speaks every emotion of his animated mind it has more of the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling than i ever witnessed he has fine dark eyebrows and an overhanging forehead the friendly and keensighted woman gives a more sympathetic picture than the others but there must have been truth too in the view of the equally keensighted and less friendly hazlitt whose description accords well with coleridges selfportraiture and in the last sarcastic item too well with the remainder of the poets career footnotes footnote letters of samuel taylor coleridge ed by eh coleridge vol i p note footnote the uncertainty as to the color of his eyes is a tribute to their expressiveness carlyle described him in as having a pair of strange brown timid yet earnestlooking eyes emerson visited him in and found him with bright blue eyes and fine clear complexion iii the rest of the story coleridge lived for thirtysix years after he left stowey for germany in his fame as a poet grew as the world became acquainted with and learned to feel the peculiar charm of his poetry and he was even more famous for a while as a literary critic and a moral philosopher but they were years of weakwilled wandering of vast hazy plans and feeble performance lighted only here and there by glimpses of fragmentary accomplishment and that seldom in poetry keats died at twentysix leaving behind him a body of poetry hardly less wonderful than coleridge had fashioned at the same age and another poet sang of him the bloom whose petals nipt before they blew died on the promise of the fruit is waste in coleridge the poet died at nearly the same age almost as completely as if the man himself had passed within the twilight chamber of white death and dejection is that poets dirge the remaining years need therefore but few words coleridge had taken opium perhaps as early as his schooldays for relief from neuralgia he had recourse to it in march for sleeplessness in the following november for relief from violent nervous pains and near the close of the stowey period in may when the vagaries of lloyd the estrangement from lamb domestic anxiety and physical suffering had reduced him to a state of extreme nervous wretchedness he again took refuge in opiates of which kubla khan is partly the result he returned from germany in worked for a while on a newspaper in london and on a translation of schillers wallenstein and in the summer of removed to keswick in cumberland in the lake country where the wordsworths had already established themselves here in the autumn of he strove to finish christabel and did finish the second part in the winter and spring he suffered from a complicated illness in which he again had recourse to laudanum and from the spring of he was confirmed in the opium habit sinking often to pitiful depths of moral and physical misery he was in the mediterranean chiefly at malta from to his wife and children remained at keswick where southey and his family had become cotenants with them of greta hall southey it might almost be said took care of coleridges family henceforth for coleridge had begun to find his own fireside an intolerable place as early as lived little at home and made a formal separation from his wife in though they saw each other occasionally after that and the wedgwood annuity continued to be paid to mrs coleridge in he was living with the wordsworths at grasmere where he wrote several numbers of a politicophilosophical paper called the friend about the close of he was taken in hand by a mr and mrs morgan of hammersmith near london under whose care he kept the opium in check sufficiently to give his famous lectures on the principles of poetry in the winter of and another series in the early summer on shakespeare in the winter following his play of remorse a recast of the osorio of was acted in london with some success in the winter of he lectured in a conversational fashion at bristol he also wrote irregularly for the london papers during these years but his studies since his return from germany had been directed to metaphysics and especially to the philosophical bases of poetry and theology and the last twenty years of his life at least were occupied with plans for a great philosophical work covering these two fields of thought one of the fragments of the great work that actually came to light the biographia literaria seems to have been sent to the printers in a collected edition of his poetry was also begun while he was under the morgans care from till his death in he lived in comparative peace if not in happiness with a mr gilman of highgate near london an apothecary gilman and his wife were able so far to wean him from the drug or to regulate his use of it that he brought to the birth something of his vast plans in criticism and philosophy notably the biographia literaria and the aids to reflection the beginning of his stay with gilman was also marked by the publication of christabel and kubla khan and of a collected edition of his other poems including the ancient mariner considerably revised under the title sibylline leaves but the poems that were not finished in the first great period at stowey remained unfinished he talked divinely an archangel a little damaged lamb said and both by his talk and his metaphysical writings profoundly influenced the literature and philosophy of the century both in england and america but the poet in him was dead sense of past youth and manhood come in vain and genius given and knowledge won in vain and all which i had culled in woodwalks wild and all which patient toil had reared and all commune with thee had opened out but flowers strewed on my corse and borne upon my bier in the same coffin for the selfsame grave it would be a mistake to ascribe the paralysis of coleridges powers of constructive imagination exclusively to laudanum rather the resort to narcotics and the inability to control his creative faculty are alike symptoms of a temperamental malady which had its roots in his nature close to the seat of that special faculty under a favorable conjunction of outward circumstance and inward state imagination came it possessed him and he labored in it happily afterwards he could revise what he had shaped analyze it philosophically perfect some details of it but he could not proceed in the creative act after the inspiration had left him his own description of his nature indolence capable of energies is accurate as far as it goes the opium resorted to often no doubt to quicken the dreams in his brain as well as to relieve his bodily suffering helped to enfeeble his will but the indolence was in him before he became addicted to opium and he was never capable of energies at the call of duty but only at the call of his shaping spirit over whose coming and going he had no control poetically it is perhaps as well had he been like his friend wordsworth in strength and steadiness of purpose which is to suppose him another nature than he was his life would have been happier and more edifying but he would hardly have given us anything better than christabel and the ancient mariner romantic poetry of the higher type is essentially the creature of mood even wordsworths long and conscientious labors produced but a small bulk of poetry of this character amid dreary reaches of uninspired preaching coleridge waited in despondency often in selfupbraidings in the temporary deception of opium dreams with their consequent misery for the return of the spirit and it did not come footnotes footnote from the lines addressed to wordsworth after hearing him read the prelude in ii coleridges poems the ancient mariner the ancient mariner was first printed in the first edition of lyrical ballads again with considerable changes in the second edition and without further significant change in the editions of and its fifth appearance was in sibylline leaves again with some important changes and the addition of the latin motto and the marginal gloss in the poetical works and again in the poetical works the poem appeared in its final form as we now have it differing very little from the form it had in sibylline leaves one or two significant minor changes will be mentioned in the notes coleridges own account of the genesis of the poem given in the biographia literaria nearly twenty years later is interesting during the first year that mr wordsworth and i were neighbours our conversations turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence to the truth of nature and the power of giving the interest of novelty by the modifying colours of imagination the sudden charm which accidents of light and shade which moonlight or sunset diffused over a known and familiar landscape appeared to represent the practicability of combining both these are the poetry of nature the thought suggested itself to which of us i do not recollect that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts in the one the incidents and agents were to be in part at least supernatural and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions as would naturally accompany such situations supposing them real and real in this sense they have been to every human being who from whatever source of delusion has at any time believed himself under supernatural agency for the second class subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life the characters and incidents were to be such as will be found in every village and its vicinity where there is a meditative and feeling mind to seek after them or to notice them when they present themselves in this idea originated the lyrical ballads in which it was agreed that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural or at least romantic yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith mr wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object to give the charm of novelty to things of every day and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural by awakening the minds attention from the lethargy of custom and directing it to the wonders and loveliness of the world before us an inexhaustible treasure but for which in consequence of the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude we have eyes yet see not ears that hear not and hearts that neither feel nor understand with this view i wrote the ancient mariner and was preparing among other poems the dark ladie and the christabel in which i should have more nearly realized my ideal than i had done in my first attempt but mr wordsworths industry had proved so much more successful and the number of his poems so much greater that my compositions instead of forming a balance appeared rather an interpolation of heterogeneous matter mr wordsworth added two or three poems written in his own character in the impassioned lofty and sustained diction which is characteristic of his genius among them the lines composed a few miles above tintern abbey in this form the lyrical ballads were published lyrical they hardly were in any current meaning of that word they were narrative but they were ballads as the word was then understood the two cardinal points of poetry that coleridge says they had in view in this partnership production were both believed to be special marks of the ballad the charm of homeliness and simplicity and the spell of the supernatural and romantic bishop percys reliques of ancient english poetry had created a taste for the traditional poetry of humble folk spreading to germany and uniting there with the sentimental sensationalism of the eighteenth century this taste found expression in burgers lenore which in turn had a powerful influence in england five distinct translations of it appearing in of the distinction so much insisted on by later analysts of the true popular ballad its communal origin its impersonality its freedom from adornment its lack of conscious art the englishman of coleridges time took no account the ancient mariner is not a ballad in the sense in which sir patrick spens or young waters is a ballad it is in the highest degree a work of conscious and individual art it is rather to be classed like christabel as a romance but it was conceived and written under the influence of the ballad revival and bears many marks of that influence both in its general structure and in its details of workmanship much of the archaic diction and antique spelling as well as the ruder grotesquerie that in the first edition proclaimed its relation to the pseudoballadry of the time disappeared in the later editions but the archaisms the unpoetical diction and especially the disregard of tense coherence in the poem as we now have it contribute greatly to the atmosphere of romance as of a story removed alike from the commonplace experience of every day and from familiar literary conventions which it was coleridges intention to produce by a few devotional ejaculations heavens mother send us grace to mary queen the praise be given we are made to feel that the ancient mariner lived before the reformation in the ages of wonder and faith repetition as in many stanzas of part iv is a device caught from the folkballad and modified to produce the effect of a spell which is so strong a mark of the poem the abrupt opening the unannounced transitions in dialogue the omission of all but the vital incidents of the story all belong to the ballad style the verse form is what is known as the ballad stanza stanza of four lines a line of four accents followed by one of three the second and fourth lines riming variously extended and modified to suit the mood of the passage the prose summary in the form of a marginal gloss first added in the edition of is a practice taken from early printed books but not from balladry which is normally oral of the literary qualities of the poem much might be said but i call attention here to but two the organic structure of the story and the character of the imagery two important aspects of creative imagination the seven parts are seven stages of the narrative each except the last closing with a reference to the mariners sin the story proceeds like the successive acts of a play in part i the deed is committed in part ii the punishment begins in part iii the punishment reaches its climax part iv brings the turn in the crisis of his sufferings comes the consciousness of fellowship with other creatures and repentance for his cruelty parts v and vi relate his penance begun and his return by supernatural agencies to the world of human fellowship and part vii brings us back to the opening scene closing the whole with a moral the moral is so plainly set forth that one wonders how mrs barbauld could ever have complained as coleridge tells us she did that the poem had no moral his reply is worth recording i told her that in my opinion the poem had too much and that the only or chief fault if i might say so was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination it ought to have had no more moral than the arabian nights tale of the merchants sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well and throwing the shells aside and lo a genie starts up and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant because one of the date shells had it seems put out the eye of the genies son but the poet of knew better than the metaphysician of the moral is as essential a part of the whole poem as moral consciousness is of man without it the poem would be without the coherence of human interest which alone can secure for these shadows of imagination poetic faith the moral really is suffused throughout the work is the blood of its being that it should be formulated at the close is quite in accord with the simplicity which marked the whole conception of the lyrical ballads and is moreover perfectly harmonious with the spirit of the poem itself there have been poets who seemed to be without the moral sense and who have written poetry quite free from any moral like poe and his landscape visions but wonderful as they are they are abnormal and are less great as they are less completely human it may be that wordsworth as one infers from recollections of the composition of the poem suggested the moral plot but if so it entered at once and completely into coleridges imagination and governed the shaping of the poem from the start in all the very considerable changes and omissions that the poem underwent after it was first printed there was none that either retrenched from or added to the moral interpretation of the tale of its imagery the most evident characteristic is what may be called the anthropomorphic treatment of nature this although in accord with modern conceptions of primitive culture is not at all a mark of the popular ballad sun and moon and stormwind and ocean are in folksong sun and moon and wind and water and nothing more but in the ancient mariner they are living beings and now the stormblast came and he was tyrannous and strong he struck with his oertaking wings and chased us south along and straight the sun was flecked with bars heavens mother send us grace as if through a dungeongrate he peered with broad and burning face still as a slave before his lord the ocean hath no blast his great bright eye most silently up to the moon is cast if he may know which way to go for she guides him smooth or grim see brother see how graciously she looketh down on him this is the most noticeable of the modifying colours of imagination in the ancient mariner the practice might be classed as a sort of personification but how utterly different in its effect from the conventional literary personifications of the eighteenth century of gray in the elegy for instance grandeur and envy and honour in that admirable poem are not real persons to the imagination the abstraction remains an abstraction but in coleridges poem all nature is alive with the life of men other elements of that synthetic and magical power to which we have exclusively appropriated the name of imagination and which blends the idea with the image and the sense of novelty and freshness with old and familiar objects will be felt as the poem is studied wordsworth related in after years that the suggestion for the poem came from a dream of a phantom ship told to coleridge by a friend and that he wordsworth proposed the shooting of the albatross the revenge of the tutelary spirits and the navigation of the ship by the dead men and contributed the fourth stanza of the poem and the last two lines of the first stanza of part iv he had been reading shelvockes voyages a book in which he had found a description of albatrosses as they are seen in far southern waters other reading that may have suggested some of the scenery is described in the notes to the globe edition of coleridges poems there are also passages and situations in the last two acts of wordsworths play the borderers which coleridge read with great admiration in the summer of that have evident kinship with the ancient mariner and wordsworths peter bell composed at alfoxden but printed many years later suggests what the story might have become if coleridge instead of wordsworth had withdrawn from collaboration christabel and kubla khan christabel and kubla khan were first printed in in a pamphlet along with the pains of sleep a sort of contrast to kubla khan composed in in the preface to this pamphlet coleridge informs us that the first part of christabel was written at stowey in and the second part at keswick cumberland in the poem was intended originally for the lyrical ballads and it was with the hope of finishing it for the second edition that coleridge took it up again in the fall of there is a good deal of uncertainty as to just how much of the work was done at that time in two letters of that period he speaks of it as running up to lines and swelled into a poem of lines so that it is no longer suitable for the lyrical ballads but hardly half of this amount was printed in the pamphlet or has ever been found since one suspects that already in dreams and projects had begun to be confounded with performance in the latter of the two letters mentioned above he relates how his versemaking faculties returned to him after long and unsuccessful struggles with barrenness and deep dejection as the result of drinking at the house of a neighbouring clergyman so much wine that i found some effort and dexterity requisite to balance myself on the hither edge of sobriety on the whole it seems probable that christabel owes little to the forced efforts of his first year in the lake country like most of the other poems in this volume it is a product of the great year at stowey he himself told a friend in later years i had the whole of the two cantos in my mind before i began it adding very truly certainly the first canto is more perfect has more of the true wild weird spirit than the last down to the close of his life he dreamed of finishing this work he amused his listeners at highgate with a continuation of the plot and in he declared that if he were perfectly free from vexation and were in the ad libitum hearing of fine music he could yet finish christabel for i have as i always had the whole plan entire from beginning to end in my mind but i fear i could not carry on with equal success the execution of the idea wordsworth had a different recollection he told coleridges nephew in that he did not think coleridge had ever conceived in his own mind any definite plan for it that the poem had been composed while they were in habits of daily intercourse and almost in his presence and when there was the most unreserved intercourse between them as to all their literary projects and productions and he had never heard from him any plan for finishing it and added what is fully borne out by a study of coleridges life schemes of this sort passed rapidly and vividly through his mind and so impressed him that he often fancied he had arranged things which really and upon trial proved to be mere embryos the unfinished window in aladdins tower unfinished must remain wrote longfellow alluding to the dolliver romance that hawthorne left incomplete at his death there is strong kinship moral and artistic between coleridge and hawthorne both believed that the heart is more than the head and neither could force his imagination to work under unfavorable conditions but hawthornes failure of imagination came at the end of a fruitful and consistent career and his life failed with it in coleridge the poet died half a lifetime before the man and left the man the preacher and philosopher to lament his loss whether or not coleridge had the story complete in his mind what we have is a fragment and does not enable us to divine as some broken statues do the plan of the whole what it gives us is the romantic mood the sense of witchery by daylight and this it does more hauntingly than anything else in the english language it is a series of magical and unforgetable pictures it owes a good deal to the old verse romances and ballads that so impressed the imagination in those days of the mediaeval revival but it was itself a far stronger influence it operated as an original force both by its form and by its spirit upon the poetic imagination of the first half of the nineteenth century more widely and deeply than the work of any other man burns and keats not excepted scott heard it read from manuscript and the lay of the last minstrel with the series of verse romances that followed may almost be called a result of that reading the verse form of scotts romances certainly is poes poetry is as far as the poles removed from scotts yet a close study of poes work shows the influence of christabel to be even deeper here than in the lay of the last minstrel coleridge was fully aware of a special power both of imagination and of versemusic in the poem his attempts to complete it in brought persistently to his mind the project of a philosophy of poetry and especially of this poem as we may infer from a letter to poole in march i shall immediately publish my christabel with two essays annexed to it on the preternatural and on metre when the two cantos were at last printed in coleridge wrote in the preface the metre of the christabel is not properly speaking irregular though it may seem so from its being founded on a new principle namely that of counting in each line the accents not the syllables though the latter may vary from seven to twelve yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four nevertheless this occasional variation in number of syllables is not introduced wantonly or for the mere ends of convenience but in correspondence with some transition in the nature of the imagery or passion this is not to be taken quite literally the accentual principle was assuredly nothing new in english verse and syllablecounting though introduced by chaucer had to be reintroduced by the renaissance poets and did not become an unquestioned convention till the latter part of the seventeenth century but the return to free accentual verse in the christabel was an innovation at the beginning of the nineteenth century it is to be noted too that there are lines of three and even of two accents in part i in chap xv of the biographia literaria in a list of the specific symptoms of poetic power in shakespeares early work coleridge places first the perfect sweetness of the versification its adaptation to the subject and the power displayed in varying the march of the words the sense of musical delight with the power of producing it is a gift of imagination and this together with the power of reducing multitude into unity of effect and modifying a series of thoughts by some one predominant thought or feeling may be cultivated and improved but can never be learnt it is in these that poeta nascitur non fit kubla khan is the remembered fragment of a dream all that we know about it is contained in the note coleridge prefixed to it in the pamphlet of in the summer of coleridge says but this seems to have been a slip of his memory the author then in ill health had retired to a lonely farmhouse between porlock and linton on the exmoor confines of somerset and devonshire in consequence of a slight indisposition an anodyne had been prescribed from the effects of which he fell asleep in his chair at the moment that he was reading the following sentence or words of the same substance in purchass pilgrimage here the khan kubla commanded a palace to be built and a stately garden thereunto and thus ten miles of fertile ground were inclosed with a wall the author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep at least of the external senses during which time he has the most vivid confidence that he could not have composed less than from two to three hundred lines if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions without any sensation or consciousness of effort on awaking he appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole and taking his pen ink and paper instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are here preserved at this moment he was unfortunately called out by a person on business from porlock and detained by him above an hour and on his return to his room found to his no small surprise and mortification that though he still retained some vague and dim recollection of the general purport of the vision yet with the exception of some eight or ten scattered lines and images all the rest had passed away like the images on the surface of a stream into which a stone has been cast but alas without the after restoration of the latter opinion will ever vary as to its poetic worth coleridge himself professed to consider it rather as a psychological curiosity than as a thing of any supposed poetic merits to lamb he repeated it so enchantingly that it irradiates and brings heaven and elysian bowers into any parlour when he sings or says it and it has been a sort of touchstone of romantic taste ever since it supremely illustrates that sense of musical delight with the power of producing it which the poet declared to be a gift of the imagination that can never be learnt footnotes footnote see notes to this poem in the globe edition and eh coleridges letters of samuel taylor coleridge vol i p note france an ode this ode was written in february and first printed in the morning post for april of that year under the significant title of recantation in the autumn it was printed with its present title in a pamphlet together with fears in solitude another political poem and frost at midnight a poem on his infant child in october it was reprinted in the post with a prose argument see notes less necessary for the readers of that time than it may be now coleridge like wordsworth had welcomed the french revolution as ushering in an era of light and love in human society both though wordsworth more profoundly had been depressed by the excesses of and by the lust of conquest which became more and more evident under the directory and when at last in february the french armies invaded switzerland the ancient sacred home of liberty in europe coleridge recanted in this ode political poetry is likely to lose its power with the passing of the events and passions that give it birth it retains its power just in proportion as it is built on lasting and universal interests of the heart of man that france has retained its position as one of the great odes of the english language is due not only to the loftiness of its thought and the splendor of its imagery but even more to the fact that it turns from the political excitement of the hour to the grandeur and beauty of nature and to those aspirations and ideals whose home is in the heart of man love from the second edition of lyrical ballads it was planned by coleridge as an introduction to the ballad of the dark ladie which was never completed but of which some fifteen stanzas were printed in the edition of his poetical works its composition cannot be accurately dated it is conceived in the general spirit of the ballads but is simpler more purely a poem of sentiment than either christabel or the ancient mariner and makes no use of the supernatural its simplicity and absolute purity of tone are however something more than a negative virtue coleridge himself declared of it and the ancient mariner that they might be excelled but could not be imitated dejection an ode this ode was written in april at a time when after sickness opium domestic unhappiness and the consequent paralysis of his poetic faculty had driven him to seek distraction in the study of metaphysics he made a visit to wordsworth at dove cottage and in that vitalizing presence experienced a brief return of his powers enough to give wonderful expression to perhaps the saddest thoughts that ever visited ungoverned genius the earliest known form of the poem preserved in a letter to w sotheby of july shows what is apparent enough to one familiar with the relations existing between the two poets that it was conceived as a letter to wordsworth who is addressed in this earliest version as dearest poet wordsworth and william it was first printed in the morning post for october with edmund for wordsworths name and with some omissions but with the strong personal feeling undiminished and in its present form that is with the parts omitted in the print restored but with the substitution of lady for edmund and with numerous other omissions and changes notably in the last stanza all tending to depersonalize the poem in sibylline leaves in a hint given by wordsworth with the best intentions to a third person concerning the real nature of coleridges troubles was reported or rather misreported to coleridge and an estrangement fraught with deep grief to both ensued the breach was healed as much as such wounds may be by the mediation of a common friend in but the old glad and fruitful fellowship could never be restored coleridge wrote to poole february a reconciliation has taken place but the feeling which i had previous to that moment that i fear never can return all outward actions all inward wishes all thoughts and admirations will be the same are the same but aye there remains an immedicable but dejection is distinguished from the other poems in this volume by containing along with its wonderful interpretation of outward nature into harmony with his own else unutterable sadness coleridges and perhaps all poets essential philosophy of poetry it was natural that the metaphysics in which he had been immersed should color his thought but literature affords few if any instances of metaphysics so transformed into poetry in the crucible of feeling as is afforded by stanza v of this ode youth and age and work without hope in these two poems coleridge has left a record of the sadness of a life lived in darkness with the light of youth gone out or returning only in glimpses that showed what he had lost in these latter years he was busy enough in an incoherent visionary fashion and did even write and publish though in characteristically fragmentary form a work that made a great impression on young men in the second quarter of the century his aids to reflection but his activity was philosophical and theological not poetic and even in that field the product fell far short of his plans and promises the inner and real life of the man is revealed now as always in his poetry and amidst what profound dejection it glimmers on these two brief poems show youth and age was written in an air that whizzed right across the diameter of my brain over the summit of quantock at earliest dawn just between the nightingale that i stopt to hear in the copse at the foot of quantock and the first skylark that was a songfountain dashing up and sparkling to the ears eye out of sight over the cornfields on the descent of the mountain on the other side out of sight tho twice i beheld its mute shoot downward in the sunshine like a falling star of silver so he described the conception of the poem in the original ms printed by mr campbell in the notes to the globe edition it was a flash of poignant memory of the old days at stowey the first thirtyeight lines were printed in and the whole poem including the last six lines which were not in the

beholdeth a sign in the element afar off there passed a weary time each throat was parched and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye when looking westward i beheld a something in the sky at first it seemed a little speck and then it seemed a mist it moved and moved and took at last a certain shape i wist a speck a mist a shape i wist and still it neared and neared as if it dodged a watersprite it plunged and tacked and veered sidenote at its nearer approach it seemeth him to be a ship and at a dear ransom he freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could nor laugh nor wail through utter drought all dumb we stood i bit my arm i sucked the blood and cried a sail a sail with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call sidenote a flash of joy sidenote and horror follows for can it be a ship that comes onward without wind or tide gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us weal without a breeze without a tide she steadies with upright keel the western wave was all aflame the day was well nigh done almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun sidenote it seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship and straight the sun was flecked with bars heavens mother send us grace as if through a dungeongrate he peered with broad and burning face alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossameres sidenote and its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting sun the spectrewoman and her deathmate and no other on board the skeletonship are those her ribs through which the sun did peer as through a grate and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that womans mate sidenote like vessel like crew her lips were red her looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the nightmare lifeindeath was she who thicks mans blood with cold sidenote death and lifeindeath have diced for the ships crew and she the latter winneth the ancient mariner the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice the game is done ive won ive won quoth she and whistles thrice sidenote no twilight within the courts of the sun the suns rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with farheard whisper oer the sea off shot the spectrebark sidenote at the rising of the moon we listened and looked sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my lifeblood seemed to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the steersmans face by his lamp gleamed white from the sails the dew did drip till clomb above the eastern bar the horned moon with one bright star within the nether tip sidenote one after another one after one by the stardogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye sidenote his shipmates drop down dead four times fifty living men and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one sidenote but lifeindeath begins her work on the ancient mariner the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my crossbow part iv sidenote the weddingguest feareth that a spirit is talking to him i fear thee ancient mariner i fear thy skinny hand and thou art long and lank and brown as is the ribbed seasand i fear thee and thy glittering eye and thy skinny hand so brown fear me not fear not thou weddingguest this body dropt not down sidenote but the ancient mariner assureth him of his bodily life and proceedeth to relate his horrible penance alone alone all all alone alone on the wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony sidenote he despiseth the creatures of the calm the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i sidenote and envieth that they should live and so many lie dead i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and made my heart as dry as dust i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet sidenote but the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked on me had never passed away an orphans curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than that is a curse in a dead mans eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die sidenote in his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying moon and the stars that still sojourn yet still move onward and every where the blue sky belongs to them and is their appointed rest and their native country and their own natural homes which they enter unannounced as lords that are certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival the moving moon went up the sky and nowhere did abide softly she was going up and a star or two beside her beams bemocked the sultry main like april hoarfrost spread but where the ships huge shadow lay the charmed water burnt alway a still and awful red sidenote by the light of the moon he beholdeth gods creatures of the great calm beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the watersnakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam and every track was a flash of golden fire sidenote their beauty and their happiness sidenote he blesseth them in his heart o happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware sidenote the spell begins to break the selfsame moment i could pray and from my neck so free the albatross fell off and sank like lead into the sea part v oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole to mary queen the praise be given she sent the gentle sleep from heaven that slid into my soul sidenote by grace of the holy mother the ancient mariner is refreshed with rain the silly buckets on the deck that had so long remained i dreamt that they were filled with dew and when i awoke it rained my lips were wet my throat was cold my garments all were dank sure i had drunken in my dreams and still my body drank i moved and could not feel my limbs i was so light almost i thought that i had died in sleep and was a blessed ghost sidenote he heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky and the element and soon i heard a roaring wind it did not come anear but with its sound it shook the sails that were so thin and sere the upper air burst into life and a hundred fireflags sheen to and fro they were hurried about and to and fro and in and out the wan stars danced between and the coming wind did roar more loud and the sails did sigh like sedge and the rain poured down from one black cloud the moon was at its edge the thick black cloud was cleft and still the moon was at its side like waters shot from some high crag the lightning fell with never a jag a river steep and wide sidenote the bodies of the ships crew are inspired and the ship moves on the loud wind never reached the ship yet now the ship moved on beneath the lightning and the moon the dead men gave a groan they groaned they stirred they all uprose nor spake nor moved their eyes it had been strange even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise the helmsman steered the ship moved on yet never a breeze up blew the mariners all gan work the ropes where they were wont to do they raised their limbs like lifeless tools we were a ghastly crew the body of my brothers son stood by me knee to knee the body and i pulled at one rope but he said nought to me sidenote but not by the souls of the men nor by daemons of earth or middle air but by a blessed troop of angelic spirits sent down by the invocation of the guardian saint i fear thee ancient mariner be calm thou weddingguest t was not those souls that fled in pain which to their corses came again but a troop of spirits blest for when it dawned they dropped their arms and clustered round the mast sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths and from their bodies passed around around flew each sweet sound then darted to the sun slowly the sounds came back again now mixed now one by one sometimes adropping from the sky i heard the skylark sing sometimes all little birds that are how they seemed to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargoning and now t was like all instruments now like a lonely flute and now it is an angels song that makes the heavens be mute it ceased yet still the sails made on a pleasant noise till noon a noise like of a hidden brook in the leafy month of june that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune till noon we quietly sailed on yet never a breeze did breathe slowly and smoothly went the ship moved onward from beneath sidenote the lonesome spirit from the southpole carries on the ship as far as the line in obedience to the angelic troop but still requireth vengeance under the keel nine fathom deep from the land of mist and snow the spirit slid and it was he that made the ship to go the sails at noon left off their tune and the ship stood still also the sun right up above the mast had fixed her to the ocean but in a minute she gan stir with a short uneasy motion backwards and forwards half her length with a short uneasy motion then like a pawing horse let go she made a sudden bound it flung the blood into my head and i fell down in a swound sidenote the polar spirits fellowdaemons the invisible inhabitants of the element take part in his wrong and two of them relate one to the other that penance long and heavy for the ancient mariner hath been accorded to the polar spirit who returneth southward how long in that same fit i lay i have not to declare but ere my living life returned i heard and in my soul discerned two voices in the air is it he quoth one is this the man by him who died on cross with his cruel bow he laid full low the harmless albatross the spirit who bideth by himself in the land of mist and snow he loved the bird that loved the man who shot him with his bow the other was a softer voice as soft as honeydew quoth he the man hath penance done and penance more will do part vi first voice but tell me tell me speak again thy soft response renewing what makes that ship drive on so fast what is the ocean doing second voice still as a slave before his lord the ocean hath no blast his great bright eye most silently up to the moon is cast if he may know which way to go for she guides him smooth or grim see brother see how graciously she looketh down on him first voice sidenote the mariner hath been cast into a trance for the angelic power causeth the vessel to drive northward faster than human life could endure but why drives on that ship so fast without or wave or wind second voice the air is cut away before and closes from behind fly brother fly more high more high or we shall be belated for slow and slow that ship will go when the mariners trance is abated sidenote the supernatural motion is retarded the mariner awakes and his penance begins anew i woke and we were sailing on as in a gentle weather t was night calm night the moon was high the dead men stood together all stood together on the deck for a charneldungeon fitter all fixed on me their stony eyes that in the moon did glitter the pang the curse with which they died had never passed away i could not draw my eyes from theirs nor turn them up to pray sidenote the curse is finally expiated and now this spell was snapt once more i viewed the ocean green and looked far forth yet little saw of what had else been seen like one that on a lonesome road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread but soon there breathed a wind on me nor sound nor motion made its path was not upon the sea in ripple or in shade it raised my hair it fanned my cheek like a meadowgale of spring it mingled strangely with my fears yet it felt like a welcoming swiftly swiftly flew the ship yet she sailed softly too sweetly sweetly blew the breeze on me alone it blew sidenote and the ancient mariner beholdeth his native country oh dream of joy is this indeed the lighthouse top i see is this the hill is this the kirk is this mine own countree we drifted oer the harborbar and i with sobs did pray o let me be awake my god or let me sleep alway the harborbay was clear as glass so smoothly it was strewn and on the bay the moonlight lay and the shadow of the moon the rock shone bright the kirk no less that stands above the rock the moonlight steeped in silentness the steady weathercock and the bay was white with silent light till rising from the same sidenote the angelic spirits leave the dead bodies full many shapes that shadows were in crimson colors came sidenote and appear in their own forms of light a little distance from the prow those crimson shadows were i turned my eyes upon the deck oh christ what saw i there each corse lay flat lifeless and flat and by the holy rood a man all light a seraphman on every corse there stood this seraphband each waved his hand it was a heavenly sight they stood as signals to the land each one a lovely light this seraphband each waved his hand no voice did they impart no voice but oh the silence sank like music on my heart but soon i heard the dash of oars i heard the pilots cheer my head was turned perforce away and i saw a boat appear the pilot and the pilots boy i heard them coming fast dear lord in heaven it was a joy the dead men could not blast i saw a third i heard his voice it is the hermit good he singeth loud his godly hymns that he makes in the wood hell shrieve my soul hell wash away the albatrosss blood part vii sidenote the hermit of the wood this hermit good lives in that wood which slopes down to the sea how loudly his sweet voice he rears he loves to talk with marineres that come from a far countree he kneels at morn and noon and eve he hath a cushion plump it is the moss that wholly hides the rotted old oakstump the skiffboat neared i heard them talk why this is strange i trow where are those lights so many and fair that signal made but now sidenote approacheth the ship with wonder strange by my faith the hermit said and they answered not our cheer the planks looked warped and see those sails how thin they are and sere i never saw aught like to them unless perchance it were brown skeletons of leaves that lag my forestbrook along when the ivytod is heavy with snow and the owlet whoops to the wolf below that eats the shewolfs young dear lord it hath a fiendish look the pilot made reply i am afeared push on push on said the hermit cheerily the boat came closer to the ship but i nor spake nor stirred the boat came close beneath the ship and straight a sound was heard sidenote the ship suddenly sinketh under the water it rumbled on still louder and more dread it reached the ship it split the bay the ship went down like lead sidenote the ancient mariner is saved in the pilots boat stunned by that loud and dreadful sound which sky and ocean smote like one that hath been seven days drowned my body lay afloat but swift as dreams myself i found within the pilots boat upon the whirl where sank the ship the boat spun round and round and all was still save that the hill was telling of the sound i moved my lips the pilot shrieked and fell down in a fit the holy hermit raised his eyes and prayed where he did sit i took the oars the pilots boy who now doth crazy go laughed loud and long and all the while his eyes went to and fro ha ha quoth he full plain i see the devil knows how to row and now all in my own countree i stood on the firm land the hermit stepped forth from the boat and scarcely he could stand sidenote the ancient mariner earnestly entreateth the hermit to shrieve him and the penance of life falls on him o shrieve me shrieve me holy man the hermit crossed his brow say quick quoth he i bid thee say what manner of man art thou forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched with a woful agony which forced me to begin my tale and then it left me free sidenote and ever and anon throughout his future life an agony constraineth him to travel from land to land since then at an uncertain hour that agony returns and till my ghastly tale is told this heart within me burns i pass like night from land to land i have strange power of speech that moment that his face i see i know the man that must hear me to him my tale i teach what loud uproar bursts from that door the weddingguests are there but in the gardenbower the bride and bridemaids singing are and hark the little vesper bell which biddeth me to prayer o weddingguest this soul hath been alone on a wide wide sea so lonely t was that god himself scarce seemed there to be o sweeter than the marriagefeast t is sweeter far to me to walk together to the kirk with a goodly company to walk together to the kirk and all together pray while each to his great father bends old men and babes and loving friends and youths and maidens gay sidenote and to teach by his own example love and reverence to all things that god made and loveth farewell farewell but this i tell to thee thou weddingguest he prayeth well who loveth well both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all the mariner whose eye is bright whose beard with age is hoar is gone and now the weddingguest turned from the bridegrooms door he went like one that hath been stunned and is of sense forlorn a sadder and a wiser man he rose the morrow morn christabel part the first tis the middle of night by the castle clock and the owls have awakened the crowing cock tu whittu whoo and hark again the crowing cock how drowsily it crew sir leoline the baron rich hath a toothless mastiff which from her kennel beneath the rock maketh answer to the clock four for the quarters and twelve for the hour ever and aye by shine and shower sixteen short howls not over loud some say she sees my ladys shroud is the night chilly and dark the night is chilly but not dark the thin gray cloud is spread on high it covers but not hides the sky the moon is behind and at the full and yet she looks both small and dull the night is chill the cloud is gray t is a month before the month of may and the spring comes slowly up this way the lovely lady christabel whom her father loves so well what makes her in the wood so late a furlong from the castle gate she had dreams all yesternight of her own betrothed knight and she in the midnight wood will pray for the weal of her lover thats far away she stole along she nothing spoke the sighs she heaved were soft and low and naught was green upon the oak but moss and rarest mistletoe she kneels beneath the huge oak tree and in silence prayeth she the lady sprang up suddenly the lovely lady christabel it moaned as near as near can be but what it is she cannot tell on the other side it seems to be of the huge broadbreasted old oak tree the night is chill the forest bare is it the wind that moaneth bleak there is not wind enough in the air to move away the ringlet curl from the lovely ladys cheek there is not wind enough to twirl the one red leaf the last of its clan that dances as often as dance it can hanging so light and hanging so high on the topmost twig that looks up at the sky hush beating heart of christabel jesu maria shield her well she folded her arms beneath her cloak and stole to the other side of the oak what sees she there there she sees a damsel bright drest in a silken robe of white that shadowy in the moonlight shone the neck that made that white robe wan her stately neck and arms were bare her blueveined feet unsandald were and wildly glittered here and there the gems entangled in her hair i guess twas frightful there to see a lady so richly clad as she beautiful exceedingly mary mother save me now said christabel and who art thou the lady strange made answer meet and her voice was faint and sweet have pity on my sore distress i scarce can speak for weariness stretch forth thy hand and have no fear said christabel how camest thou here and the lady whose voice was faint and sweet did thus pursue her answer meet my sire is of a noble line and my name is geraldine five warriors seized me yestermorn me even me a maid forlorn they choked my cries with force and fright and tied me on a palfrey white the palfrey was as fleet as wind and they rode furiously behind they spurred amain their steeds were white and once we crossed the shade of night as sure as heaven shall rescue me i have no thought what men they be nor do i know how long it is for i have lain entranced i wis since one the tallest of the five took me from the palfreys back a weary woman scarce alive some muttered words his comrades spoke he placed me underneath this oak he swore they would return with haste whither they went i cannot tell i thought i heard some minutes past sounds as of a castle bell stretch forth thy hand thus ended she and help a wretched maid to flee then christabel stretched forth her hand and comforted fair geraldine o well bright dame may you command the service of sir leoline and gladly our stout chivalry will he send forth and friends withal to guide and guard you safe and free home to your noble fathers hall she rose and forth with steps they passed that strove to be and were not fast her gracious stars the lady blest and thus spake on sweet christabel all our household are at rest the hall as silent as the cell sir leoline is weak in health and may not well awakened be but we will move as if in stealth and i beseech your courtesy this night to share your couch with me they crossed the moat and christabel took the key that fitted well a little door she opened straight all in the middle of the gate the gate that was ironed within and without where an army in battle array had marched out the lady sank belike through pain and christabel with might and main lifted her up a weary weight over the threshold of the gate then the lady rose again and moved as she were not in pain so free from danger free from fear they crossed the court right glad they were and christabel devoutly cried to the lady by her side praise we the virgin all divine who hath rescued thee from thy distress alas alas said geraldine i cannot speak for weariness so free from danger free from fear they crossed the court right glad they were outside her kennel the mastiff old lay fast asleep in moonshine cold the mastiff old did not awake yet she an angry moan did make and what can ail the mastiff bitch never till now she uttered yell beneath the eye of christabel perhaps it is the owlets scritch for what can ail the mastiff bitch they passed the hall that echoes still pass as lightly as you will the brands were flat the brands were dying amid their own white ashes lying but when the lady passed there came a tongue of light a fit of flame and christabel saw the ladys eye and nothing else saw she thereby save the boss of the shield of sir leoline tall which hung in a murky old niche in the wall o softly tread said christabel my father seldom sleepeth well sweet christabel her feet doth bare and jealous of the listening air they steal their way from stair to stair now in glimmer and now in gloom and now they pass the barons room as still as death with stifled breath and now have reached her chamber door and now doth geraldine press down the rushes of the chamber floor the moon shines dim in the open air and not a moonbeam enters here but they without its light can see the chamber carved so curiously carved with figures strange and sweet all made out of the carvers brain for a ladys chamber meet the lamp with twofold silver chain is fastened to an angels feet the silver lamp burns dead and dim but christabel the lamp will trim she trimmed the lamp and made it bright and left it swinging to and fro while geraldine in wretched plight sank down upon the floor below o weary lady geraldine i pray you drink this cordial wine it is a wine of virtuous powers my mother made it of wild flowers and will your mother pity me who am a maiden most forlorn christabel answered woe is me she died the hour that i was born i have heard the grayhaired friar tell how on her deathbed she did say that she should hear the castlebell strike twelve upon my weddingday o mother dear that thou wert here i would said geraldine she were but soon with altered voice said she off wandering mother peak and pine i have power to bid thee flee alas what ails poor geraldine why stares she with unsettled eye can she the bodiless dead espy and why with hollow voice cries she off woman off this hour is mine though thou her guardian spirit be off woman off tis given to me then christabel knelt by the ladys side and raised to heaven her eyes so blue alas said she this ghastly ride dear lady it hath wildered you the lady wiped her moist cold brow and faintly said tis over now again the wildflower wine she drank her fair large eyes gan glitter bright and from the floor whereon she sank the lofty lady stood upright she was most beautiful to see like a lady of a far countree and thus the lofty lady spake all they who live in the upper sky do love you holy christabel and you love them and for their sake and for the good which me befell even i in my degree will try fair maiden to requite you well but now unrobe yourself for i must pray ere yet in bed i lie quoth christabel so let it be and as the lady bade did she her gentle limbs did she undress and lay down in her loveliness but through her brain of weal and woe so many thoughts moved to and fro that vain it were her lids to close so halfway from the bed she rose and on her elbow did recline to look at the lady geraldine beneath the lamp the lady bowed and slowly rolled her eyes around then drawing in her breath aloud like one that shuddered she unbound the cincture from beneath her breast her silken robe and inner vest dropt to her feet and full in view behold her bosom and half her side a sight to dream of not to tell o shield her shield sweet christabel yet geraldine nor speaks nor stirs ah what a stricken look was hers deep from within she seems halfway to lift some weight with sick assay and eyes the maid and seeks delay then suddenly as one defied collects herself in scorn and pride and lay down by the maidens side and in her arms the maid she took ah weladay and with low voice and doleful look these words did say in the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell which is lord of thy utterance christabel thou knowest tonight and wilt know tomorrow this mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow but vainly thou warrest for this is alone in thy power to declare that in the dim forest thou heardst a low moaning and foundst a bright lady surpassingly fair and didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity to shield her and shelter her from the damp air the conclusion to part the first it was a lovely sight to see the lady christabel when she was praying at the old oak tree amid the jagged shadows of mossy leafless boughs kneeling in the moonlight to make her gentle vows her slender palms together prest heaving sometimes on her breast her face resigned to bliss or bale her face oh call it fair not pale and both blue eyes more bright than clear each about to have a tear with open eyes ah woe is me asleep and dreaming fearfully fearfully dreaming yet i wis dreaming that alone which is o sorrow and shame can this be she the lady who knelt at the old oak tree and lo the worker of these harms that holds the maiden in her arms seems to slumber still and mild as a mother with her child a star hath set a star hath risen o geraldine since arms of thine have been the lovely ladys prison o geraldine one hour was thine thou st had thy will by tairn and rill the nightbirds all that hour were still but now they are jubilant anew from cliff and tower tu whoo tu whoo tu whoo tu whoo from wood and fell and see the lady christabel gathers herself from out her trance her limbs relax her countenance grows sad and soft the smooth thin lids close oer her eyes and tears she sheds large tears that leave the lashes bright and oft the while she seems to smile as infants at a sudden light yea she doth smile and she doth weep like a youthful hermitess beauteous in a wilderness who praying always prays in sleep and if she move unquietly perchance tis but the blood so free comes back and tingles in her feet no doubt she hath a vision sweet what if her guardian spirit twere what if she knew her mother near but this she knows in joys and woes that saints will aid if men will call for the blue sky bends over all part the second each matin bell the baron saith knells us back to a world of death these words sir leoline first said when he rose and found his lady dead these words sir leoline will say many a morn to his dying day and hence the custom and law began that still at dawn the sacristan who duly pulls the heavy bell five and forty beads must tell between each stroke a warning knell which not a soul can choose but hear from bratha head to wyndermere saith bracy the bard so let it knell and let the drowsy sacristan still count as slowly as he can there is no lack of such i ween as well fill up the space between in langdale pike and witchs lair and dungeonghyll so foully rent with ropes of rock and bells of air three sinful sextons ghosts are pent who all give back one after t other the deathnote to their living brother and oft too by the knell offended just as their one two three is ended the devil mocks the doleful tale with a merry peal from borrowdale the air is still through mist and cloud that merry peal comes ringing loud and geraldine shakes off her dread and rises lightly from the bed puts on her silken vestments white and tricks her hair in lovely plight and nothing doubting of her spell awakens the lady christabel sleep you sweet lady christabel i trust that you have rested well and christabel awoke and spied the same who lay down by her side o rather say the same whom she raised up beneath the old oak tree nay fairer yet and yet more fair for she belike hath drunken deep of all the blessedness of sleep and while she spake her looks her air such gentle thankfulness declare that so it seemed her girded vests grew tight beneath her heaving breasts sure i have sinnd said christabel now heaven be praised if all be well and in low faltering tones yet sweet did she the lofty lady greet with such perplexity of mind as dreams too lively leave behind so quickly she rose and quickly arrayed her maiden limbs and having prayed that he who on the cross did groan might wash away her sins unknown she forthwith led fair geraldine to meet her sire sir leoline the lovely maid and the lady tall are pacing both into the hall and pacing on through page and groom enter the barons presenceroom the baron rose and while he prest his gentle daughter to his breast with cheerful wonder in his eyes the lady geraldine espies and gave such welcome to the same as might beseem so bright a dame but when he heard the ladys tale and when she told her fathers name why waxed sir leoline so pale murmuring oer the name again lord roland de vaux of tryermaine alas they had been friends in youth but whispering tongues can poison truth and constancy lives in realms above and life is thorny and youth is vain and to be wroth with one we love doth work like madness in the brain and thus it chanced as i divine with roland and sir leoline each spake words of high disdain and insult to his hearts best brother they parted neer to meet again but never either found another to free the hollow heart from paining they stood aloof the scars remaining like cliffs which had been rent asunder a dreary sea now flows between but neither heat nor frost nor thunder shall wholly do away i ween the marks of that which once hath been sir leoline a moments space stood gazing on the damsels face and the youthful lord of tryermaine came back upon his heart again o then the baron forgot his age his noble heart swelled high with rage he swore by the wounds in jesus side he would proclaim it far and wide with trump and solemn heraldry that they who thus had wronged the dame were base as spotted infamy and if they dare deny the same my herald shall appoint a week and let the recreant traitors seek my tourney court that there and then i may dislodge their reptile souls from the bodies and forms of men he spake his eye in lightning rolls for the lady was ruthlessly seized and he kenned in the beautiful lady the child of his friend and now the tears were on his face and fondly in his arms he took fair geraldine who met the embrace prolonging it with joyous look which when she viewed a vision fell upon the soul of christabel the vision of fear the touch and pain she shrunk and shuddered and saw again ah woe is me was it for thee thou gentle maid such sights to see again she saw that bosom old again she felt that bosom cold and drew in her breath with a hissing sound whereat the knight turned wildly round and nothing saw but his own sweet maid with eyes upraised as one that prayed the touch the sight had passed away and in its stead that vision blest which comforted her afterrest while in the ladys arms she lay had put a rapture in her breast and on her lips and oer her eyes spread smiles like light with new surprise what ails then my beloved child the baron said his daughter mild made answer all will yet be well i ween she had no power to tell aught else so mighty was the spell yet he who saw this geraldine had deemed her sure a thing divine such sorrow with such grace she blended as if she feared she had offended sweet christabel that gentle maid and with such lowly tones she prayed she might be sent without delay home to her fathers mansion nay nay by my soul said leoline ho bracy the bard the charge be thine go thou with music sweet and loud and take two steeds with trappings proud and take the youth whom thou lovst best to bear thy harp and learn thy song and clothe you both in solemn vest and over the mountains haste along lest wandering folk that are abroad detain you on the valley road and when he has crossed the irthing flood my merry bard he hastes he hastes up knorren moor through halegarth wood and reaches soon that castle good which stands and threatens scotlands wastes bard bracy bard bracy your horses are fleet ye must ride up the hall your music so sweet more loud than your horses echoing feet and loud and loud to lord roland call thy daughter is safe in langdale hall thy beautiful daughter is safe and free sir leoline greets thee thus through me he bids thee come without delay with all thy numerous array and take thy lovely daughter home and he will meet thee on the way with all his numerous array white with their panting palfreys foam and by mine honour i will say that i repent me of the day when i spake words of fierce disdain to roland de vaux of tryermaine for since that evil hour hath flown many a summers sun hath shone yet neer found i a friend again like roland de vaux of tryermaine the lady fell and clasped his knees her face upraised her eyes oerflowing and bracy replied with faltering voice his gracious hail on all bestowing thy words thou sire of christabel are sweeter than my harp can tell yet might i gain a boon of thee this day my journey should not be so strange a dream hath come to me that i had vowed with music loud to clear yon wood from thing unblest warned by a vision in my rest for in my sleep i saw that dove that gentle bird whom thou dost love and callst by thy own daughters name sir leoline i saw the same fluttering and uttering fearful moan among the green herbs in the forest alone which when i saw and when i heard i wondered what might ail the bird for nothing near it could i see save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree and in my dream methought i went to search out what might there be found and what the sweet birds trouble meant that thus lay fluttering on the ground i went and peered and could descry no cause for her distressful cry but yet for her dear ladys sake i stooped methought the dove to take when lo i saw a bright green snake coiled around its wings and neck green as the herbs on which it couched close by the doves its head it crouched and with the dove it heaves and stirs swelling its neck as she swelled hers i woke it was the midnight hour the clock was echoing in the tower but though my slumber was gone by this dream it would not pass away it seems to live upon my eye and thence i vowed this selfsame day with music strong and saintly song to wander through the forest bare lest aught unholy loiter there thus bracy said the baron the while halflistening heard him with a smile then turned to lady geraldine his eyes made up of wonder and love and said in courtly accents fine sweet maid lord rolands beauteous dove with arms more strong than harp or song thy sire and i will crush the snake he kissed her forehead as he spake and geraldine in maiden wise casting down her large bright eyes with blushing cheek and courtesy fine she turned her from sir leoline softly gathering up her train that oer her right arm fell again and folded her arms across her chest and couched her head upon her breast and looked askance at christabel jesu maria shield her well a snakes small eye blinks dull and shy and the ladys eyes they shrunk in her head each shrunk up to a serpents eye and with somewhat of malice and more of dread at christabel she looked askance one moment and the sight was fled but christabel in dizzy trance stumbling on the unsteady ground shuddered aloud with a hissing sound and geraldine again turned round and like a thing that sought relief full of wonder and full of grief she rolled her large bright eyes divine wildly on sir leoline the maid alas her thoughts are gone she nothing sees no sight but one the maid devoid of guile and sin i know not how in fearful wise so deeply had she drunken in that look those shrunken serpent eyes that all her features were resigned to this sole image in her mind and passively did imitate that look of dull and treacherous hate and thus she stood in dizzy trance still picturing that look askance with forced unconscious sympathy full before her fathers view as far as such a look could be in eyes so innocent and blue and when the trance was oer the maid paused awhile and inly prayed then falling at the barons feet by my mothers soul do i entreat that thou this woman send away she said and more she could not say for what she knew she could not tell oermastered by the mighty spell why is thy cheek so wan and wild sir leoline thy only child lies at thy feet thy joy thy pride so fair so innocent so mild the same for whom thy lady died o by the pangs of her dear mother think thou no evil of thy child for her and thee and for no other she prayed the moment ere she died prayed that the babe for whom she died might prove her dear lords joy and pride that prayer her deadly pangs beguiled sir leoline and wouldst thou wrong thy only child her child and thine within the barons heart and brain if thoughts like these had any share they only swelled his rage and pain and did but work confusion there his heart was cleft with pain and rage his cheeks they quivered his eyes were wild dishonoured thus in his old age dishonourd by his only child and all his hospitality to the insulted daughter of his friend by more than womans jealousy brought thus to a disgraceful end he rolled his eye with stern regard upon the gentle minstrel bard and said in tones abrupt austere why bracy dost thou loiter here i bade thee hence the bard obeyed and turning from his own sweet maid the aged knight sir leoline led forth the lady geraldine the conclusion to part the second a little child a limber elf singing dancing to itself a fairy thing with red round cheeks that always finds and never seeks makes such a vision to the sight as fills a fathers eyes with light and pleasures flow in so thick and fast upon his heart that he at last must needs express his loves excess with words of unmeant bitterness perhaps tis pretty to force together thoughts so all unlike each other to mutter and mock a broken charm to dally with wrong that does no harm perhaps tis tender too and pretty at each wild word to feel within a sweet recoil of love and pity and what if in a world of sin o sorrow and shame should this be true such giddiness of heart and brain comes seldom save from rage and pain so talks as its most used to do kubla khan in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasuredome decree where alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea so twice five miles of fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round and here were gardens bright with sinuous rills where blossomed many an incensebearing tree and here were forests ancient as the hills enfolding sunny spots of greenery but oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover a savage place as holy and enchanted as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted by woman wailing for her demonlover and from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing a mighty fountain momently was forced amid whose swift halfintermitted burst huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail and mid these dancing rocks at once and ever it flung up momently the sacred river five miles meandering with a mazy motion through wood and dale the sacred river ran then reached the caverns measureless to man and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean and mid this tumult kubla heard from far ancestral voices prophesying war the shadow of the dome of pleasure floated midway on the waves where was heard the mingled measure from the fountain and the caves it was a miracle of rare device a sunny pleasuredome with caves of ice a damsel with a dulcimer in a vision once i saw it was an abyssinian maid and on her dulcimer she played singing of mount abora could i revive within me her symphony and song to such a deep delight twould win me that with music loud and long i would build that dome in air that sunny dome those caves of ice and all who heard should see them there and all should cry beware beware his flashing eyes his floating hair weave a circle round him thrice and close your eyes with holy dread for he on honeydew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise love all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred flame oft in my waking dreams do i live oer again that happy hour when midway on the mount i lay beside the ruined tower the moonshine stealing oer the scene had blended with the lights of eve and she was there my hope my joy my own dear genevieve she leant against the armed man the statue of the armed knight she stood and listened to my lay amid the lingering light few sorrows hath she of her own my hope my joy my genevieve she loves me best wheneer i sing the songs that make her grieve i played a soft and doleful air i sang an old and moving story an old rude song that suited well that ruin wild and hoary she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace for well she knew i could not choose but gaze upon her face i told her of the knight that wore upon his shield a burning brand and that for ten long years he wooed the lady of the land i told her how he pined and ah the deep the low the pleading tone with which i sang anothers love interpreted my own she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace and she forgave me that i gazed too fondly on her face but when i told the cruel scorn that crazed that bold and lovely knight and that he crossed the mountainwoods nor rested day nor night that sometimes from the savage den and sometimes from the darksome shade and sometimes starting up at once in green and sunny glade there came and looked him in the face an angel beautiful and bright and that he knew it was a fiend this miserable knight and that unknowing what he did he leaped amid a murderous band and saved from outrage worse than death the lady of the land and how she wept and clasped his knees and how she tended him in vain and ever strove to expiate the scorn that crazed his brain and that she nursed him in a cave and how his madness went away when on the yellow forestleaves a dying man he lay his dying words but when i reached that tenderest strain of all the ditty my faltering voice and pausing harp disturbed her soul with pity all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled my guileless genevieve the music and the doleful tale the rich and balmy eve and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued subdued and cherished long she wept with pity and delight she blushed with love and virginshame and like the murmur of a dream i heard her breathe my name her bosom heaved she stepped aside as conscious of my look she stepped then suddenly with timorous eye she fled to me and wept she half enclosed me with her arms she pressed me with a meek embrace and bending back her head looked up and gazed upon my face twas partly love and partly fear and partly twas a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart i calmed her fears and she was calm and told her love with virgin pride and so i won my genevieve my bright and beauteous bride france an ode i ye clouds that far above me float and pause whose pathless march no mortal may control ye oceanwaves that wheresoeer ye roll yield homage only to eternal laws ye woods that listen to the nightbirds singing midway the smooth and perilous slope reclined save when your own imperious branches swinging have made a solemn music of the wind where like a man beloved of god through glooms which never woodman trod how oft pursuing fancies holy my moonlight way oer flowering weeds i wound inspired beyond the guess of folly by each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound o ye loud waves and o ye forests high and o ye clouds that far above me soared thou rising sun thou blue rejoicing sky yea every thing that is and will be free bear witness for me wheresoeer ye be with what deep worship i have still adored the spirit of divinest liberty ii when france in wrath her giantlimbs upreared and with that oath which smote air earth and sea stamped her strong foot and said she would be free bear witness for me how i hoped and feared with what a joy my lofty gratulation unawed i sang amid a slavish band and when to whelm the disenchanted nation like fiends embattled by a wizards wand the monarchs marched in evil day and britain joined the dire array though dear her shores and circling ocean though many friendships many youthful loves had swoln the patriot emotion and flung a magic light oer all her hills and groves yet still my voice unaltered sang defeat to all that braved the tyrantquelling lance and shame too long delayed and vain retreat for neer o liberty with partial aim i dimmed thy light or damped thy holy flame but blessed the paeans of delivered france and hung my head and wept at britains name iii and what i said though blasphemys loud scream with that sweet music of deliverance strove though all the fierce and drunken passions wove a dance more wild than eer was maniacs dream ye storms that round the dawning east assembled the sun was rising though ye hid his light and when to soothe my soul that hoped and trembled the dissonance ceased and all seemed calm and bright when france her front deepscarred and gory concealed with clustering wreaths of glory when insupportably advancing her arm made mockery of the warriors ramp while timid looks of fury glancing domestic treason crushed beneath her fatal stamp writhed like a wounded dragon in his gore then i reproached my fears that would not flee and soon i said shall wisdom teach her lore in the low huts of them that toil and groan and conquering by her happiness alone shall france compel the nations to be free till love and joy look round and call the earth their own iv forgive me freedom o forgive those dreams i hear thy voice i hear thy loud lament from bleak helvetias icy caverns sent i hear thy groans upon her bloodstained streams heroes that for your peaceful country perished and ye that fleeing spot your mountainsnows with bleeding wounds forgive me that i cherished one thought that ever blessed your cruel foes to scatter rage and traitorous guilt where peace her jealous home had built a patriotrace to disinherit of all that made their stormy wilds so dear and with inexpiable spirit to taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer o france that mockest heaven adulterous blind and patriot only in pernicious toils are these thy boasts champion of human kind to mix with kings in the low lust of sway tell in the hunt and share the murderous prey to insult the shrine of liberty with spoils from freemen torn to tempt and to betray v the sensual and the dark rebel in vain slaves by their own compulsion in mad game they burst their manacles and wear the name of freedom graven on a heavier chain o liberty with profitless endeavour have i pursued thee many a weary hour but thou nor swellst the victors strain nor ever didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power alike from all howeer they praise thee nor prayer nor boastful name delays thee alike from priestcrafts harpy minions and factious blasphemys obscener slaves thou speedest on thy subtle pinions the guide of homeless winds and playmate of the waves and there i felt thee on that seacliffs verge whose pines scarce travelled by the breeze above had made one murmur with the distant surge yes while i stood and gazed my temples bare and shot my being through earth sea and air possessing all things with intensest love o liberty my spirit felt thee there dejection an ode written april late late yestreen i saw the new moon with the old moon in her arms and i fear i fear my master dear we shall have a deadly storm ballad of sir patrick spence i well if the bard was weatherwise who made the grand old ballad of sir patrick spence this night so tranquil now will not go hence unroused by winds that ply a busier trade than those which mould yon cloud in lazy flakes or the dull sobbing draft that moans and rakes upon the strings of this aeolian lute which better far were mute for lo the newmoon winterbright and overspread with phantom light with swimming phantom light oerspread but rimmed and circled by a silver thread i see the old moon in her lap foretelling the comingon of rain and squally blast and oh that even now the gust were swelling and the slant nightshower driving loud and fast those sounds which oft have raised me whilst they awed and sent my soul abroad might now perhaps their wonted impulse give might startle this dull pain and make it move so and live ii a grief without a pang void dark and drear a stifled drowsy unimpassioned grief which finds no natural outlet no relief in word or sigh or tear o lady in this wan and heartless mood to other thoughts by yonder throstle wooed all this long eve so balmy and serene have i been gazing on the western sky and its peculiar tint of yellow green and still i gaze and with how blank an eye and those thin clouds above in flakes and bars that give away their motion to the stars those stars that glide behind them or between now sparkling now bedimmed but always seen yon crescent moon as fixed as if it grew in its own cloudless starless lake of blue i see them all so excellently fair i see not feel how beautiful they are iii my genial spirits fail and what can these avail to lift the smothering weight from off my breast it were a vain endeavour though i should gaze for ever on that green light that lingers in the west i may not hope from outward forms to win the passion and the life whose fountains are within iv o lady we receive but what we give and in our life alone does nature live ours is her wedding garment ours her shroud and would we aught behold of higher worth than that inanimate cold world allowed to the poor loveless everanxious crowd ah from the soul itself must issue forth a light a glory a fair luminous cloud enveloping the earth and from the soul itself must there be sent a sweet

luminous cloud we in ourselves rejoice and thence flows all that charms or ear or sight all melodies the echoes of that voice all colours a suffusion from that light vi there was a time when though my path was rough this joy within me dallied with distress and all misfortunes were but as the stuff whence fancy made me dreams of happiness for hope grew round me like the twining vine and fruits and foliage not my own seemed mine but now afflictions bow me down to earth nor care i that they rob me of my mirth but oh each visitation suspends what nature gave me at my birth my shaping spirit of imagination for not to think of what i needs must feel but to be still and patient all i can and haply by abstruse research to steal from my own nature all the natural man this was my sole resource my only plan till that which suits a part infects the whole and now is almost grown the habit of my soul vii hence viper thoughts that coil around my mind realitys dark dream i turn from you and listen to the wind which long has raved unnoticed what a scream of agony by torture lengthened out that lute sent forth thou wind that ravst without bare crag or mountaintairn or blasted tree or pinegrove

the rushing of an host in rout with groans of trampled men with smarting wounds at once they groan with pain and shudder with the cold but hush there is a pause of deepest silence and all that noise as of a rushing crowd with groans and tremulous shudderings all is over it tells another tale with sounds less deep and loud a tale of less affright and tempered with delight as otways self had framed

praise to be forgiven for fame he askd and hoped through christ do thou the same notes the ancient mariner the latin motto is condensed by omission from about a page of thomas burnets archaeologiae philosophicae sive doctrina antiqua de rerum originibus published in london in burnet was master of charterhouse from till his death in and enjoyed considerable reputation as a man of curious learning in the archaeologiae he professed to reconcile a former work of his on the origins of the world with the account given in genesis the quotation is from chapter vii of book i de hebraeis eorumque cabal and may be translated thus i easily believe that the invisible natures in the universe are more in number than the visible but who shall tell us all the kinds of them the ranks and relationships the peculiar qualities and gifts of each what they do where they dwell mans wit has ever been circling about the knowledge of these things but has never attained to it yet in the meanwhile i will not deny that it is profitable to contemplate from time to time in the mind as in a picture the idea of a larger and better world lest the mind becoming wonted to the little things of everyday life grow narrow and settle down altogether to mean businesses at the same time however we must watch for the truth and observe method so as to distinguish the certain from the uncertain day from night instead of this motto the first edition had an argument prefixed as follows how a ship having passed the line was driven by storms to the cold country towards the south pole and how from thence she made her course to the tropical latitude of the great pacific ocean and of the strange things that befell and in what manner the ancyent marinere came back to his own country this was somewhat enlarged in the second edition and dropped thereafter page line eftsoons anglosaxon eftsona eft afterwards again sona soon renforced by the adverbial genitive ending s coleridge found the word in spenser and the old ballads kirk the scotch and northern english form of church the old ballads had been preserved chiefly in the north hence this northern form came to be looked on as the proper word for church in the ballad style marginal gloss driven all editions down to campbells had drawn but this he believes to have been a misprint since the narrative seems to require driven clifts this word arose from a confusion of cliff a precipice and cleft a fissure it was exceedingly common in the thth cent according to the new english dict which gives examples from captain john smith marlowe and defoe swound an archaic form of swoon found in elizabethan english thorough through and thorough are originally the same word and in shakespeares time both forms were used for the preposition cf pucks song in midsummer nights dream thorough bush thorough briar eat this form pronounced et is still in use in england and new england for the past tense of the verb though in america the form ate is now preferred eat as past participle however was archaic or rude even in coleridges time vespers properly a liturgical term meaning the daily evening service in church then in a more general way evening the century dict gives no examples of its use as a nautical term probably coleridge used it to give a suggestion of antereformation times the more familiar word for the evening service in the english church is evensong but coleridge in line prefers the little vesper bell for its suggestion of medievalism like gods own head the comparison is the converse of that in the bible matthew xvii revelations i where the countenance of christ glorified is said to shine as the sun sykes uprist this word was used in middle english as a noun and regularly as the d pers sing pres ind of the verb uprise in the reves tale line however chaucer uses it in a context of past tenses as coleridge does here as if it were a weak preterit and chaucer uses rist up in the same way several times sykes the furrow followed free this was changed in sibylline leaves to the furrow streamed off free because coleridge tells us from the ship itself the wake appears like a brook flowing off from the stern in the case of modern steamboats at least it would be more correct to say that the wake as seen from the stern of the boat looks like a brook following the boat the original reading was restored in the editions of and the very deep did rot etc the ship becalmed in tropic seas and the slimy things engendered there were a vision in coleridges mind before the ancient mariner was thought of in the lines contributed to southeys joan of arc in published with additions as the destiny of nations in sibylline leaves in an allegoric passage on chaos and love he wrote as what time after long and pestful calms with slimy shapes and miscreated life poisoning the vast pacific the fresh breeze wakens the merchant sail uprising the same subject had occupied wordsworths imagination before he and coleridge came together at stowey see wordsworths the borderers act iv slimy things strange creatures the spawn of the rotting sea for which the mariner has no name marginal gloss josephus michael psellus the only learned jew josephus that we know of is the historian of that name who lived in the first century of our era but little has been found in his works to justify this reference the platonic constantinopolitan michael psellus was a byzantine teacher of the eleventh century who wrote a dialogue in which demons are classified according to the element in which they live cooper sykes i wist wist is properly the past tense of an old verb wit to know but coleridge seems to use i wist here as equivalent to i wis see christabel l which is a form of iwis an adverb meaning certainly with throats unslaked etc a remarkable instance of onomatopoeia gramercy an exclamation meaning originally much thanks old french grand merci and so used by shakespeare merchant of venice ii richard iii iii but in the ballads it is often a mere exclamation of wonder and surprise and so coleridge uses it here grin coleridge says table talk may i took the thought of grinning for joy from my companions remark to me when we had climbed to the top of plinlimmon in wales in the summer of and were nearly dead with thirst we could not speak from the constriction till we found a little puddle under a stone he said to me you grinned like an idiot he had done the same to grin was originally to snarl and show the teeth as animals do when angry they go to and fro in the evening they grin like a dog and run about through the city ps lix prayerbook version where the king james version has make a noise like a dog hence idiots stupid people foolish people all who are or who demean themselves below the dignity of man grin rather than smile and so the mariners companions their muscles stiffened by drought could show their gladness only by the contortions of a grin not by a natural smile of joy without a breeze without a tide the phantom ship is a widespread sailors superstition that has been often used in the romantic literature of the nineteenth century see scotts rokeby canto ii xi marryats phantom ship poes ms found in a bottle and longfellows ballad of carmilhan in tales of a wayside inn second day it is seen in storms driving by with all sails set and is generally held to be an omen of disaster coleridge has shaped the legend to his own purposes the ship appears in a calm not in a storm and sailing without rather than against wind and tide and instead of a crew of dead men it carries only death and lifeindeath possibly he was acquainted with a form of the legend found in bechsteins deutsches sagenbuch pointed out by dr sykes in which falkenberg for murder of his brother is condemned to sail a spectral bark attended only by his good and his evil spirit who play dice for his soul are those her ribs etc instead of this stanza the first edition had these two are those her naked ribs which fleckd the sun that did behind them peer and are those two all all the crew that woman and her fleshless pheere his bones are black with many a crack all black and bare i ween jetblack and bare save where with rust of mouldy damps and charnel crust theyre patchd with purple and green and again after line the first edition had this stanza a gust of wind sterte up behind and whistled thro his bones thro the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth halfwhistles and halfgroans but this crude grotesquerie of horror quite in the taste of that day the day of monk lewis and mrs radcliffe coleridges finer poetical judgment soon rejected her lips were red etc lifeindeath who wins the mariner while death wins his shipmates is conceived as a witch something after the fashion of geraldine in christabel or duessa in the faerie queene but wilder stranger than either a thing of startling and evil beauty spensers pages of description however give no such vivid image of loathsome loveliness as do the first three lines of this stanza her skin was as white as leprosy is a feat in suggestion marginal gloss within the courts of the sun between the tropics of cancer and capricorn with one bright star within the nether tip an interesting case of poetical illusion no one of course ever saw a star within the tip of the horned moon yet a good many readers until reminded of their astronomy think they have seen this phenomenon coleridge apparently knew that the human mind would receive it as experience the phrase is no slip on his part the earlier editions had instead almost atween the tips which is astronomically justifiable but in sibylline leaves and later he wrote it as in the text and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my crossbow it was an ancient belief imaginatively revived by romantic poets that when a person died his soul could be seen or heard or both as it left the body cf keatss eve of st agnes first stanza rossettis sister helen and kiplings danny deever and thou art long etc for the last two lines of this stanza runs coleridges note to the passage in sibylline leaves i am indebted to mr wordsworth it was on a delightful walk from nether stowey to dulverton with him and his sister in the autumn of that this poem was planned and in part composed wordsworth in later years declared that he contributed also lines and four or five lines more in different parts of the poem which i could not now point out or ever or here is not the adversative conjunction but an entirely different word an archaic variant of ere meaning before for the sky and the sea etc another instance of the sound fitting the sense the rocking rhythm of the line is the rhythm of his fevered pulse the poem is full of this quality silly this word meant in old english timely from soel time occasion hence fortunate blessed from this was developed under the influence of medieval religious teaching the meaning innocent harmless simple and from this again our modern meaning foolish simple in a derogatory sense chaucer has the word in all these meanings and also in another a modification of the second wretched pitiable another shade of the same meaning appears in spensers silly bark ie frail ship and in burnss to a mouse thy wee bit housie too in ruin its silly was the wins are strewin the epithet may be due either to the gush of love that has filled the mariners heart or to his noticing the buckets long useless frail now filled with water sykes very likely to both together fireflags the notion of the fireflags hurried about was probably suggested to coleridge by the description of the northern lights aurora borealis in hearnes journey to the northern ocean a book printed in and known to both wordsworth and coleridge before hearne says i can positively affirm that in still nights i have frequently heard them make a rustling and crackling noise like the waving of a large flag in a fresh gale of wind see also wordsworths complaint of a forsaken indian woman cooper sometimes adropping etc the mariners sin was that in wanton cruelty he took the life of a friendly fellowcreature his punishment is to live with dead men round him and the dead bird on his breast in such solitude that god himself scarce seemed there to be until he learns to feel the sacredness of life even in the watersnakes the slimy things that coil in the rotting sea and the stages of his penance are marked by suggestions of his return to the privilege of human fellowship the angels music is like the song of the skylark the sails ripple like a leafhidden brook recollections of his happy boyhood in england and finally comes the actual land breeze and he is in his own countree observe the marginal gloss to line honeydew see note on kubla khan line his great bright eye etc dorothy wordsworth in her journal february describes the look of the sea by moonlight big and white swelled to the very shores but round and high in the middle shrieve to hear confession and pronounce absolution one of the duties of the priesthood in the catholic church the word is more often spelled shrive shrift is the abstract noun derived from it skiffboat a pleonastic compound a skiff is a boat coleridge is fond of such formations see for example ii of this poem and ii of christabel cooper ivytod a clump or bush of ivy cf spensers shepheards calender march ii ff at length within an yvie todde there shrouded was the little god i heard a busie bustling while each to his great father bends etc cf the th psalm prayerbook version v young men and maidens old men and children praise the name of the lord for his name only is excellent and his praise above heaven and earth christabel this couplet ran as follows in the first edition sir leoline the baron rich hath a toothless mastiff bitch in the editions of and coleridge changed it to the form printed in the text but bitch has been restored in all subsequent editions except mr campbells garnett thin gray cloud etc the thin gray cloud as also the dancing leaf of ll was observed at stowey they are noted in dorothy wordsworths journal january and march jesu this form of the word is nearer to the hebrew original than the more familiar jesus it is often though not exclusively used in ejaculation and prayer as here and was perhaps supposed to be the vocative form i wis this is a misinterpretation of middle english iwis from old english gewis certainly the lady sank etc the threshold of a house is in folklore a sacred place and evil things cannot cross but have to be carried over it i cannot speak etc geraldine blesses her gracious stars l but cannot join in praise to the holy virgin and jealous of the listening air this line was not in the first edition but was added in the edition of behold her bosom and half her side etc there exist at least three versions of this passage the text is that of the edition the edition of lacked ll having only these lines between and and she is to sleep by christabel she took two paces and a stride etc the third form is that of a ms copy of the poem once the property of wordsworths sisterinlaw sarah hutchinson and recently published in facsimile by mr eh coleridge which gives this reading for ll are lean and old and foul of hue and she is to sleep by christabel coleridge seems to have tried both ways that of revealing geraldines loathsome secret and that of leaving it an unknown and nameless horror and finally to have chosen the latter just as he rejected in later editions the charnelhouse particulars in the description of death in the ancient mariner unquestionably he was right the horror that is merely suggested and left shrouded in mystery for the imagination to work on is more powerful than that which is known the suppressed line however helps us in an age less familiar with notions of the supernatural to understand what geraldine is the character is conceived upon the general lines of duessa in the first book of the faerie queene a being of great external loveliness but within full of all uncleanness observe also that the thought shrouded here is half revealed later l bratha head wyndermere langdale pike etc for the relation of the second part of the poem to the lake country see introduction all of the places named in these lines are near the borderline between cumberland and westmoreland and within a dozen miles of the wordsworths home at grasmere keswick which was the home of coleridge from to and of his wife and children for many years thereafter is on derwent water in cumberland some ten miles north of grasmere the little river bratha runs into the upper or northern end of windermere a larger lake lying about three miles below grasmere and connected with it by another stream langdale pike or pikes for there are more than one is the name of the steep hills at the head of langdale on the cumberland border dungeonghyll is a ravine in langdale see wordsworths the idle shepherd boys or dungeonghyll force borrowdale lies over the border in cumberland and slopes the other way toward derwent water lord roland de vaux of tryermaine sir leoline lives at langdale hall a supposed castle in the immediate vicinity of the poets homes the friend of his youth whose daughter geraldine claims to be is given the name of a real family and an historical estate in eastern cumberland tryermaine in gilsland on the river irthing which forms part of the boundary between cumberland and northumberland scott in his notes to the bridal of triermain quotes as follows from burnss antiquities of westmoreland and cumberland after the death of gilmore lord of tryermaine and torcrossock hubert vaux gave tryermaine and torcrossock to his second son ranulph vaux ranulph being lord of all gilsland gave gilmores land to his younger son named roland and they were named rolands successively that were lords thereof until the reign of edward the fourth the conclusion to part the second campbell thought it highly improbable that these lines were originally composed as a part of christabel in a letter to southey may coleridge speaks of his eldest boy hartley then in his fifth year dear hartley we are at times alarmed by the state of his health but at present he is well if i were to lose him i am afraid it would exceedingly deaden my affection for any other children i may have then he writes the lines that we now have as the conclusion to part the second and adds a very metaphysical account of fathers calling their children rogues rascals and little varlets etc kubla khan kubla khan grandson of genghis khan was a mongolian conqueror who stretched his empire from european russia to the eastern shores of china in the thirteenth century his exploits like those of his grandfather and those of the mohammedan timur in the next century made a deep impression on the imagination of western europe compilers of travellerss tales like hakluyt and purchas caught up eagerly whatever they could find history or legend concerning the extent of his domain the methods of his government or the splendors of his court the passage in purchas his pilgrimage to which coleridge refers is as follows in xamdu did cublai can build a stately palace encompassing sixteene miles of plaine ground with a wall wherein are fertile meddowes pleasant springs delightfull streames and all sorts of beasts of chase and game and in the middest thereof a sumptuous house of pleasure quoted in the notes of the globe edition coleridges poem however contains suggestions and reminiscences from another part of purchass book and probably from other books as well it reads like an arras of reminiscences from several accounts of natural or enchanted parks and from various descriptions of that elusive and dangerfraught garden which mystic geographers have studied to locate from florida to cathay cooper the earthly paradise which was closed to man indeed but not destroyed when adam and eve were driven from its gates has exercised the imagination of the christian world from the early middle ages lactantius described it in the fourth century the author of the phoenix probably in the eighth century translated lactantius latin into anglosaxon verse sir john mandeville in the fourteenth century though he did not reach it himself because he was not worthy gives an account of it from what he has heard say of wise men beyond milton described it enchantingly in paradise lost dr johnson used a modification of it in rasselas and william morris in our own time made it the framework for a delightful series of worldold tales the idea indeed is not peculiar to christianity but is probably to be found in every civilization christian europe has naturally located it in the east and since the crusades which brought western europe more in contact with the east various eastern legends have been attached to or confounded with the original notion one of these is the abyssinian legend of the hill amara cf l where coleridges mount abora seems to stand for purchass amara amara in purchass account is a hill in a great plain in ethiopia used as a prison for the sons of abyssinian kings its level top twenty leagues in circuit and surrounded by a high wall is a garden of delight heauen and earth nature and industrie have all been corriuals to it all presenting their best presents to make it of this so louely presence some taking this for the place of our forefathers paradise the sides of the hill are of overhanging rock bearing out like mushromes so that it is impossible to ascend it except by a passageway cut out within the rocke not with staires but ascending little by little and closed above and below with gates guarded by soldiers toward the south of the level top is a rising hill yeelding a pleasant spring which passeth through all that plaine and making a lake whence issueth a river which having from these tops espied nilus never leaves seeking to find him whom he cannot leave both to seeke and to finde there are no cities on the top but palaces standing by themselves spacious sumptuous and beautifull where the princes of the royall blood have their abode with their families this legend looks backward to mandeville with whose account of the terrestrial paradise it has much in common and forward to milton who used some of its elements in his description of paradise in the fourth book of paradise lost see professor coopers article in modern philology iii ff from which this is condensed mr eh coleridge the poets grandson has recently shown that in the winter of coleridge read and made notes from a book travels through the cherokee country by the american botanist william bartram chapter vii of bartrams book contains an account of some natural wonders in the cherokee country that almost certainly afforded part of the imagery of kubla khan bartram says mr coleridge speaks of waters which descend by slow degrees through rocky caverns into the bowels of the earth whence they are carried by subterraneous channels into other receptacles and basons he travels for several miles over fertile eminences and delightful shady forests he is enchanted by a view of a dark sublime grove of the grand fountain he says that the ebullition is astonishing and continual though its greatest force of fury intermits note the word intermits regularly for the space of thirty seconds of time the ebullition is perpendicular upward from a vast rugged orifice through a bed of rock throwing up small particles of white shells he is informed by a trader that when the great sink was forming there was heard an inexpressible rushing noise like a mighty hurricane or thunderstorm that the earth was overflowed by torrents of water which came wave after wave rushing down attended with a terrific noise and tremor of the earth that the fountain ceased to flow and sank into a huge bason of water but as he saw with his own eyes vast heaps of fragments of rock coleridge writes huge fragments white chalk stones and pebbles had been thrown up by the original outbursts and forced aside into the lateral valleys from these and from other like sources coleridges mind was no doubt stored with suggestions of tropical wonder and loveliness which fell together if his own account of the making of the poem is to be relied on into the kaleidoscopic beauty of kubla khan it is not unlikely too cf ll that the ashtree dell at stowey which he had already used for a scene of supernatural terror in osorio bears some part in his avowed dream of xanadu alph the sacred river this name seems to be of coleridges own invention at least it has not been pointed out where he found it demonlover the demonlover or more often with sexes reversed the fairy mistress is a favorite theme of romance taken from folklore where it appears in many forms cf the ballads of thomas rymer tam lin and the demon lover in childs english and scottish popular ballads and scotts william and helen a translation of burgers lenore abyssinian maid mount abora see introductory note above honeydew a sweet sticky substance found on plants deposited there by the aphis or plantlouse it was supposed to be the food of fairies not improbably coleridge was thinking of manna a saccharine exudation found upon certain plants in the east mandeville describes it as found in the land of job this manna is clept bread of angels and it is a white thing that is full sweet and right delicious and more sweet than honey or sugar and it cometh of the dew of heaven that falleth upon the herbs in that country and it congealeth and becometh all white and sweet and men put it in medicines for he on honeydew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise professor cooper in the article cited in the introductory note above points out that this part of the poem contains perhaps reminiscences of the stories told of the old man of the mountain this was the title popularly given to the head of a fanatical sect of mohammedans in syria in the eleventh and twelfth centuries whose method of getting rid of their enemies has given us the word assassin to quote from mandevilles travels which has the essentials of the story though the chief is here called gatholonabes and his domain is not in syria but in the island mistorak in the lordship of prester john he had a full fair castle and a strong in a mountain so strong and so noble that no man could devise a fairer or a stronger and he had made wall all the mountain about with a strong wall and a fair and within those walls he had the fairest garden that any man might behold and he had also in that place the fairest damsels that might be found under the age of fifteen years and the fairest young striplings that men might get of that same age and they were all clothed in cloths of gold full richly and he said that those were angels and he had also made wells fair and noble and all environed with stone of jasper and of crystal diapered with gold and set with precious stones and great orient pearls and he had made a conduit under the earth so that the wells at his list should run one milk another wine and another honey and that place he clept paradise and when that any good knight that was hardy and noble came to see this royalty he would lead him into his paradise and show him these wonderful things for his sport and the marvellous and delicious song of divers birds and the fair damsels and the fair wells of milk wine and honey plenteously running and he would make divers instruments of music to sound in an high tower so merrily that it was joy to hear and no man should see the craft thereof and those he said were angels of god and that place was paradise that god had promised to his friends saying dabo vobis terram fluentem lacte et melle i shall give thee a land flowing with milk and honey and then would he make them to drink of certain drink hashish a narcotic drug whence their name of assassins whereof anon they should be drunk and then would they think it greater delight than they had before and then would he say to them that if they would die for him and for his love that after their death they should come to his paradise and they should be of the age of the damsels and they should play with them and yet be maidens and after that should he put them in a yet fairer paradise where that they should see the god of nature visibly in his majesty and in his bliss and then would he show them his intent and say to them that if they would go slay such a lord or such a man that was his enemy or contrarious to his list that they should not therefore dread to do it and to be slain themselves for after their death he would put them in another paradise that was an fold fairer than any of the tother and there should they dwell with the most fairest damsels that might be and play with them evermore and thus went many divers lusty pachelors to slay great lords in divers countries that were his enemies and made themselves to be slain in hope to have that paradise france an ode when coleridge republished this poem in the post in he prefixed to it the following argument first stanza an invocation to those objects in nature the contemplation of which had inspired the poet with a devotional love of liberty second stanza the exultation of the poet at the commencement of the french revolution and his unqualified abhorrence of the alliance against the republic third stanza the blasphemies and horrors during the domination of the terrorists regarded by the poet as a transient storm and as the natural consequence of the former despotism and of the foul superstition of popery reason indeed began to suggest many apprehensions yet still the poet struggled to retain the hope that france would make conquests by no other means than by presenting to the observation of europe a people more happy and better instructed than under other forms of government fourth stanza switzerland and the poets recantation fifth stanza an address to liberty in which the poet expresses his conviction that those feelings and that grand ideal of freedom which the mind attains by its contemplation of its individual nature and of the sublime surrounding objects see stanza the first do not belong to men as a society nor can possibly be either gratified or realized under any form of human government but belong to the individual man so far as he is pure and inflamed with the love and adoration of god in nature when france in wrath etc the storming of the bastile took place july on the th of august feudal and manorial privileges were swept away by the national assembly and on the th of august the assembly formally adopted a declaration of the rights of man in september the national convention abolished royalty and declared france a republic with what a joy my lofty gratulation unawed i sang coleridge wrote a poem on the destruction of the bastile probably in or soon after first printed in and in september some lines to a young lady with a poem on the french revolution first printed in the watchman in in which he tells his emotions when slumbering freedom roused with high disdain with giant fury burst her triple chain the disenchanted nation disenchanted because they found that freedom peace and virtue were not to be secured by mere proclamation and that all europe was not ready at the call of the revolutionists to abolish prescriptive rights and establish republican forms of society in january louis xvi was beheaded the act was followed pretty promptly by a coalition of england holland spain naples and the german states against the republic yet still my voice in religious musings and more ardently in the parts that he contributed to southeys joan of arc britains name england was from the beginning the centre of resistance to the violence and ambition of revolutionary france and pitt who controlled english policy in these years was looked upon as a coldblooded agent of tyranny by the french republicans and their english sympathizers sweet music of deliverance the french were so convinced that their revolution marked the beginning of a new era in human affairs that they determined to have a new chronology accordingly a commission of scientists was appointed to formulate a system which was adopted in october the era of the republic was to be counted from the autumnal equinox the year was divided into twelve months as before but they were renamed thermidor hot month fructidor fruit month nivose snow month c and ran in periods of thirty days each from the d of september this left five days undistributed which were set apart as feastdays in celebration of five virtues or ideals each month consisted of three decades and each tenth day or decadis was a holiday the purpose of this was to eradicate the observance of the christian sunday this chronology was in actual use in france until napoleon put an end to it in the municipality of paris in decreed that on the th of november the worship of reason should be inaugurated at notre dame on that day the venerable cathedral was profaned by a series of sacrilegious outrages unparalleled in the history of christendom a temple dedicated to philosophy was erected on a platform in the middle of the choir the goddess of reason impersonated by mademoiselle maillard a well known figurante of the opera took her seat upon a grassy throne in front of the temple and the multitude bowed the knee before her in profound admiration at the close of this grotesque ceremony the whole cortge proceeded to the hall of the convention carrying with them their goddess who was borne aloft in a chair of state on the shoulders of four men having deposited her in front of the president chaumette the spokesman of the procession harangued the assembly he proceeded to demand that the cidevant metropolitan church should henceforth be the temple of reason and liberty which proposition was immediately adopted the goddess was then conducted to the president and he and other officers of the house saluted her with the fraternal kiss amid thunders of applause after this upon the motion of thuriot the convention in a body joined the mass of the people and marched in their company to the temple of reason to witness a repetition of the impieties above described at st gervais a ball was given in the chapel of the virgin in other churches theatrical spectacles took place on sunday the th of november all the parish churches of paris were closed by authority with three exceptions religion was proscribed churches closed christian ordinances interdicted the dreary gloom of atheistical despotism overspread the land jervis the gallican church and the revolution quoted in larneds history for ready reference p the next year however robespierre had a decree passed of which the first article was the french people acknowledge the existence of the supreme being and the immortality of the soul and thereupon the inscriptions to reason that had been placed upon the french churches were replaced by others reading to the supreme being calm and bright after the downfall of robespierre in france gradually worked back to a less hysterical mood in october a new form of government known as the directory was established under which the people enjoyed comparative safety at home and developed a remarkable military efficiency against their foreign enemies bonapartes military genius brought him rapidly to the front in the wars of the directory it was he that created the cisalpine and ligurine republics and his policy directed the invasions of rome and of switzerland helvetia in march after having fostered or compelled the formation of republics under french protection in holland northern italy and rome the directory under pretence of defending the republican rights of the vaudois made a concerted attack upon switzerland berne the centre of resistance was taken despite the heroic defence of the mountaineers who for five centuries had maintained in bleak helvetias icy caverns a shrine of liberty for all europe dejection an ode of motto yestreen abbreviation of yestereven yesterday evening but now afflictions etc in march coleridge wrote to godwin in my long illness i had compelled into hours of delight many a sleepless painful hour of darkness by chasing down metaphysical game and since then i have continued the hunt until i found myself unaware at the root of pure mathematics the poet is dead in me and years afterward in a letter to an artist friend w collins december poetry is out of the question the attempt would only hurry me into that sphere of acute feelings from which abstruse research the mother of selfoblivion presents an asylum realitys dark dream in the earlier forms of the poem the lines corresponding to stood thus nay wherefore did i let it haunt my mind this dark distressful dream he seems to mean this loss of joy of poetic power is must be only an evil dream and i will shake it from my mind but he knows that it is a reality and so turns to forget it in the sensuous intoxication of the winds music or perhaps for coleridge is already a metaphysician reality is used here in opposition to ideality or imagination the truth of philosophy cf ll and the metaphysic habit of mind that the study of it induces what we call reality is a dream that has come between him and the world of the ideal in which he had and used his shaping spirit of imagination the passage is obscure bare crag etc the scenery here is that of the lake country where coleridge and wordsworth were then living the former at keswick in cumberland the latter at grasmere westmoreland otway coleridge wrote originally as thou thyself ie wordsworth see next note hadst framd the tender lay this he changed to edmunds self when he first printed the poem in and finally to otways self thomas otway was a dramatist of the time of charles ii born died he wrote among other plays two tragedies of wonderful pathetic power the orphan and venice preserved the theme and style of the former of these especially no doubt suggested his name to coleridge here otways own career was pathetic he died young neglected and according to one story starved to this story coleridge alludes in one of his early poems the monody on the death of chatterton while mid the pelting of that merciless storm sunk to the cold earth otways famished form t is of a little child etc alluding to wordsworths lucy gray which had been published in the second edition of lyrical ballads youth and age trim skiffs etc fulton had invented the steamboat in the first regular steamboat in british waters was built in altered size coleridge became very stout in his later years work without hope the sole unbusy thing cf george herberts employment all things are busie onely i neither bring hony with the bees nor flowers to make that nor the husbandrie to water these i find more substantial comfort now wrote coleridge to his friend collins in in pious george herberts temple which i used to read to amuse myself with his quaintness in short only to laugh at than in all the poetry since milton
