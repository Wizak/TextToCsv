 start books of blood volume contents son of celluloid rawhead rex confession of a shroud scapegoats human remains son of celluloid one trailer barberio felt fine despite the bullet sure there was a catch in his chest if he breathed too hard and the wound in his thigh wasnt too pretty to look at but hed been holed before and come up smiling at least he was free that was the main thing nobody he swore nobody would ever lock him up again hed kill himself rather than be taken back into custody if he was unlucky and they cornered him hed stick the gun in his mouth and blow off the top of his head no way would they drag him back to that cell alive life was too long if you were locked away and counting it in seconds it had only taken him a couple of months to learn that lesson life was long and repetitive and debilitating and if you werent careful you were soon thinking it would be better to die than go on existing in the shithole theyd put you in better to string yourself up by your belt in the middle of the night rather than face the tedium of another twentyfour hours all eightysix thousand four hundred seconds of it so he went for broke first he bought a gun on the prison black market it cost him everything he had and a handful of lous hed have to make good on the outside if he wanted to stay alive then he made the most obvious move in the book he climbed the wall and whatever god looked after the liquorstore muggers of this world was looking after him that night because hot damn if he didnt scoot right over that wall and away without so much as a dog sniffing at his heels and the cops why they screwed it up every which way from sunday looking for him where hed never gone pulling in his brother and his sisterinlaw on suspicion of harbouring him when they didnt even know hed escaped putting out an allpoints bulletin with a description of his preprison self twenty pounds heavier than he was now all this hed heard from geraldine a lady hed courted in the good old days whod given him a dressing for his leg and the bottle of southern comfort that was now almost empty in his pocket hed taken the booze and sympathy and gone on his way trusting to the legendary idiocy of the law and the god whod got him so far already singsing he called this god pictured him as a fat guy with a grin that hooked from one ear to the other a prime salami in one hand and a cup of dark coffee in the other in barberios mind singsing smelt like a full belly at mamas house back in the days when mama was still well in the head and hed been her pride and joy unfortunately singsing had been looking the other way when the one eagle eye cop in the whole city saw barberio draining his snake in a back alley and recognised him from that obsolete apb young cop couldnt have been more than twentyfive out to be a hero he was too dumb to learn the lesson of barberios warning shot instead of taking cover and letting barberio make a break hed forced the issue by coming straight down the alley at him barberio had no choice he fired the cop fired back singsing must have stepped in there somewhere spoiling the cops aim no that the bullet that should have found barberios heart hit his leg and guiding the returning shot straight into the cops nose eagleeye went down as if hed just remembered an appointment with the ground and barberio was away cursing bleeding and scared hed never shot a man before and hed started with a cop quite an introduction to the craft singsing was still with him though the bullet in his leg ached but geraldines ministrations had stopped the blood the liquor had done wonders for the pain and here he was half a day later tired but alive having hopped halfway across a city so thick with vengeful cops it was like a psychos parade at the policemens ball now all he asked of his protector was a place to rest up awhile not for long just enough time to catch his breath and plan his future movements an hour or two of shuteye wouldnt go miss either thing was hed got that bellyache the deep gnawing pain he got more and more these days maybe hed find a phone when hed rested for a time and call geraldine again get her to sweettalk a doctor into seeing him hed been planning to get out of the city before midnight but that didnt look like a plausible option now dangerous as it was he would have to stay in the locality a night and maybe the best part of the next day make his break for the open country when hed recouped a little energy and had the bullet taken out of his leg jeez but that belly griped his guess was it was an ulcer brought on by the filthy slop they called food at the penitentiary lots of guys had belly and shitchute problems in there hed be better after a few days of pizzas and beers he was damn sure of that the word cancer wasnt in barberios vocabulary he never thought about terminal disease especially in reference to himself thatd be like a piece of slaughterhouse beef fretting about an ingrowing hoof as it stepped up to meet the gun a man in his trade surrounded by lethal tools doesnt expect to perish from a malignancy in his belly but thats what that ache was the lot at the back of the movie palace cinema had been a restaurant but a fire had gutted it three years back and the ground had never been cleared it wasnt a good spec for rebuilding and noone had shown much interest in the site the neighbourhood bad once been buzzing but that was in the sixties early seventies for a heady decade places of entertainmentrestaurants bars cinemashad flourished then came the inevitable slump fewer and fewer kids came this way to spend their money there were new spots to hit new places to be seen in the bars closed up the restaurants followed only the movie palace remained as a token reminder of more innocent days in a district that was becoming tackier and more dangerous every year the jungle of convolvulus and rotted timbers that throttled the vacant lot suited barberio just fine his leg was giving him jip he was stumbling from sheer fatigue and the pain in his belly was worsening a spot to lay down his clammy head was needed and damn quick finish off the southern comfort and think about geraldine it was onethirty am the lot was a trystingground for cats they ran startled through the manhigh weeds as he pushed aside some of the fencing timbers and slid into the shadows the refuge stank of piss human and cat of garbage of old fires but it felt like a sanctuary seeking the support of the back wall of the movie palace barberio leaned on his forearm and threw up a bellyful of southern comfort and acid along the wall a little way some kids had built a makeshift den of girders fireblackened planks and corrugated iron ideal he thought a sanctuary within a sanctuary singsing was smiling at him all greasy chops groaning a little he staggered along the wall to the leanto den and ducked through the door somebody else had used this place to sleep in he could feel damp sacking under his hand as he sat down and a bottle clinked against a brick somewhere to his left there was a smell close by he didnt want to think too much about like the sewers were backing up all in all it was squalid but it was safer than the street he sat with his back against the wall of the movie palace and exhaled his fears in a long slow breath no more than a block away perhaps half a block the babeinthenight wail of a copcar began and his newly acquired sense of security sank without trace they were closing in for the kill he knew it theyd just been playing him along letting him think he was away all the time cruising him like sharks sleek and silent until he was too tired to put up any resistance jeez hed killed a cop what they wouldnt do to him once they had him alone theyd crucify him ok singsing what now take that surprised look off your face and get me out of this for a moment nothing then the god smiled in his minds eye and quite coincidentally he felt the hinges pressing into his back shit a door he was leaning against a door grunting with pain he turned and ran his fingers around this escape hatch at his back to judge by touch it was a small ventilation grille no more than three feet square maybe it let on to a crawlspace or maybe into someones kitchen what the hell it was safer inside than out that was the first lesson any newborn kid got slapped into him the sirensong wailed on making barberios skin creep foul sound it quickened his heart hearing it his thick fingers fumbled down the side of the grille feeling for a lock of some kind and sure as shit there was a padlock as gritty with rust as the rest of the metal work come on singsing he prayed one more break is all im asking let me in and i swear im yours forever he pulled at the lock but damn it it wasnt about to give so easily either it was stronger than it felt or he was weaker maybe a little of both the car was slinking closer with every second the wail drowned out the sound of his own panicking breath he pulled the gun the copkiller out of his jacketpocket and pressed it into service as a snubnosed crowbar he couldnt get much leverage on the thing it was too short but a couple of cursing heaves did the trick the lock gave a shower of rust scales peppered his face he only just silenced a whoop of triumph now to open the grille to get out of this wretched world into the dark he insinuated his fingers through the lattice and pulled pain a continuum of pain that ran from his belly to his bowel to his leg made his head spin open damn you he said to the grille open sesame the door conceded it opened suddenly and he fell back on to the sodden sacking a moment and he was up again peering into the darkness within this darkness that was the interior of the movie palace let the copcar come he thought buoyantly ive got my hideyhole to keep me warm and warm it was almost hot in fact the air out of the hole smelt like it had been simmering in there for a good long while his leg had gone into a cramp and it hurt like fuck as he dragged himself through the door and into the solid black beyond even as he did so the siren turned a corner nearby and the baby wail died wasnt that the patter of lawlike feet he could hear on the sidewalk he turned clumsily in the blackness his leg a deadweight his foot feeling about the size of a watermelon and pulled the grilledoor to after him the satisfaction was that of pulling up a drawbridge and leaving the enemy on the other side of the moat somehow it didnt matter that they could open the door just as easily as he had and follow him in childlike he felt sure nobody could possibly find him here as long as he couldnt see his pursuers his pursuers couldnt see him if the cops did indeed duck into the lot to look for him he didnt hear them maybe hed been mistaken maybe they were after some other poor punk on the street and not him well ok whatever he had found himself a nice niche to rest up awhile and that was fine and dandy funny the air wasnt so bad in here after all it wasnt the stagnant air of a crawlspace or an attic the atmosphere in the hideyhole was alive not fresh air no it wasnt that it smelt old and trapped sure enough but it was buzzing nevertheless it fairly sang in his ears it made his skin tingle like a cold shower it wormed its way up his nose and put the weirdest things in his head it was like being high on something he felt that good his leg didnt hurt anymore or if it did he was too distracted by the pictures in his head he was filling up to overflowing with pictures dancing girls and kissing couples farewells at stations old dark houses comedians cowboys undersea adventures scenes hed never lived in a million years but that moved him now like raw experience true and incontestable he wanted to cry at the farewells except that he wanted to laugh at the comedians except that the girls needed ogling the cowboys needed hollering for what kind of place was this anyhow he peered through the glamour of the pictures which were damn close to getting the better of his eyes he was in a space no more than four feet wide but tall and lit by a flickering light that chanced through cracks in the inner wall barberio was too befuddled to recognise the origins of the light and his murmuring ears couldnt make sense of the dialogue from the screen on the other side of the wall it was satyricon the second of the two fellini movies the palace was showing as their latenight double feature that saturday barberio had never seen the movie never even heard of fellini it would have disgusted him he preferred undersea adventures war movies oh and dancing girls anything with dancing girls funny though he was all alone in his hideyhole he had the weird sensation of being watched through the kaleidoscope of busby berkeley routines that was playing on the inside of his skull he felt eyes not a few thousands watching him the feeling wasnt so bad youd want to take a drink for it but they were always there staring away at him like he was something worth looking at laughing at him sometimes crying sometimes but mostly just gawping with hungry eyes truth was there was nothing he could do about them anyhow his limbs had given up the ghost he couldnt feel his hands or feet at all he didnt know and it was probably better that he didnt that hed torn open his wound getting into this place and he was bleeding to death about twofiftyfive am as fellinis satyricon came to its ambiguous end barberio died in the space between the back of the building proper and the back wall of the cinema the movie palace had once been a mission hall and if hed looked up as he died he might have glimpsed the inept fresco depicting an angelic host that was still to be seen through the grime and assumed his own assumption but he died watching the dancing girls and that was fine by him the false wall the one that let through the light from the back of the screen had been erected as a makeshift partition to cover the fresco of the host it had seem more respectful to do that than paint the angels out permanently and besides the man who had ordered the alterations halfsuspected that the movie house bubble would burst sooner or later if so he could simply demolish the wall and hed be back in business for the worship of god instead of garbo it never happened the bubble though fragile never burst and the movies carried on the doubting thomas died and the space was forgotten nobody now living even knew it existed if hed searched the city from top to bottom barberio couldnt have found a more secret place to perish the space however the air itself had lived a life of its own in that fifty years like a reservoir it had received the electric stares of thousands of eyes of tens of thousands of eyes half a century of moviegoers had lived vicariously through the screen of the movie palace pressing their sympathies and their passions on to the flickering illusion the energy of their emotions gathering strength like a neglected cognac in that hidden passage of air sooner or later it must discharge itself all it lacked was a catalyst until barberios cancer two the main feature after loitering in the cramped foyer of the movie palace for twenty minutes or so the young girl in the cerise and lemon print dress began to look distinctly agitated it was almost three in the morning and the latenight movies were well over eight months had passed since barberio had died in the back of the cinema eight slow months in which business had been at best patchy still the latenight double bill on fridays and saturdays always packed in the punters tonight it had been two eastwood movies spaghetti westerns the girl in the cerise dress didnt look like much of a western fan to birdy it wasnt really a womens genre maybe shed come for eastwood rather than the violence though birdy had never seen the attraction of that eternally squinting face can i help you birdy asked the girl looked nervously at birdy im waiting for my boyfriend she said dean have you lost him he went to the restroom at the end of the movie and he hasnt come out yet was he feeling er ill oh no said the girl quickly protecting her date from this slight on his sobriety ill get someone to go and look for him said birdy it was late she was tired and the speed was wearing off the idea of spending any more time than she strictly needed to in this fleapit was not particularly appealing she wanted home bed and sleep just sleep at thirtyfour shed decided shed grown out of sex bed was for sleep especially for fat girls she pushed the swing door and poked her head into the cinema a ripe smell of cigarettes popcorn and people enveloped her it was a few degrees hotter in here than in the foyer ricky ricky was locking up the back exit at the far end of the cinema that smells completely gone he called to her good a few months back thered been a hell of a stench at the screenend of the cinema something dead in the lot next door he said can you help me a minute she called back whatd you want he sauntered up the redcarpeted aisle towards her keys jangling at his belt his teeshirt proclaimed only the young die good problem he said blowing his nose theres a girl out here she says she lost her boyfriend in the john ricky looked pained in the john right will you take a look you dont mind do you and she could cut out the wisecracks for a start he thought giving her a sickly smile they were hardly on speaking terms these days too many high times together it always dealt a crippling blow to a friendship in the long run besides birdyd made some very uncharitable remarks about his associates and hed returned the salvo with all guns blazing they hadnt spoken for three and a half weeks after that now there was an uncomfortable truce more for sanitys sake than anything it was not meticulously observed he about turned wandered back down the aisle and took row e across the cinema to the john pushing up seats as he went theyd seen better days those seats sometime around now voyager now they looked thoroughly shot at in need of refurbishing or replacing altogether in row e alone four of the seats had been slashed beyond repair now he counted a fifth mutilation which was new tonight some mindless kid bored with the movie andor his girlfriend and too stoned to leave time was hed done that kind of thing himself and counted it a blow for freedom against the capitalists who ran these joints time was hed done a lot of damnfool things birdy watched him duck into the mens room hell get a kick out of that she thought with a sly smile just his sort of occupation and to think shed once had the hots for him back in the old days when razorthin men with noses like durante and an encyclopaedic knowledge of de niro movies had really been her style now she saw him for what he was flotsam from a lost ship of hope still a pillfreak still a theoretical bisexual still devoted to early polanski movies and symbolic pacifism what kind of dope did he have between his ears anyhow the same as shed had she chided herself thinking there was something sexy about the bum she waited for a few seconds watching the door when he failed to reemerge she went back into the foyer for a moment to see how the girl was going on she was smoking a cigarette like an amateur actress whos failed to get the knack of it leaning against the rail her skirt hitched up as she scratched her leg tights she explained the managers gone to find dean thanks she scratched on they bring me out in a rash im allergic to them there were blotches on the girls pretty legs which rather spoiled the effect its because im hot and bothered she ventured whenever i get hot and bothered i get allergic oh deans probably run off you know when i had my back turned hed do that he doesnt give a f he doesnt care birdy could see she was on her way to tears which was a drag she was bad with tears shouting matches even fights ok tears no go itll be ok was all she could find to say to keep the tears from coming no its not said the girl it wont be ok because hes a bastard he treats everyone like dirt she ground out the halfsmoked cigarette with the pointed toe of her cerise shoes taking particular care to extinguish every glowing fragment of tobacco men dont care do they she said looking up at birdy with heartmelting directness under the expert makeup she was perhaps seventeen certainly not much more her mascara was a little smeared and there were arcs of tiredness under her eyes no replied birdy speaking from painful experience no they dont birdy thought ruefully that shed never looked as attractive as this tired nymphet her eyes were too small and her arms were fat but the arms were her worst feature shed convinced herself of that there were men a lot of them who got off on big breasts on a sizeable ass but no man shed ever known liked fat arms they always wanted to be able to encircle the wrist of their girlfriend between thumb and index finger it was a primitive way to measure attachment her wrists however if she was brutal with herself were practically undiscernible her fat hands became her fat forearms which became after a podgy time her fat upper arms men couldnt encircle her wrists because she had no wrists and that alienated them well that was one of the reasons anyhow she was also very bright and that was always a drawback if you wanted men at your feet but of the options as to why shed never been successful in love she plumped for the fat arms as the likeliest explanation whereas this girl had arms as slender as a balinese dancers her wrists looked thin as glass and about as fragile sickening really she was probably a lousy conversationalist to boot god the girl had all the advantages whats your name she asked lindi lee the girl replied it would be ricky thought hed made a mistake this cant be the toilet he said to himself he was standing in what appeared to be the main street of a frontier town hed seen in two hundred westerns a dust storm seemed to be raging forcing him to narrow his eyes against the stinging sand through the swirl of the ochregrey air he could pick out he thought the general stores the sheriffs office and the saloon they stood in lieu of the toilet cubicles optional tumbleweed danced by him on the hot desert wind the ground beneath his feet was impacted sand no sign of tiles no sign of anything that was faintly toiletlike ricky looked to his right down the street where the far wall of the john should have been the street receded in forced perspective towards a painted distance it was a lie of course the whole thing was a lie surely if he concentrated hed begin to see through the mirage to find out how it had been achieved the projections the concealed lighting effects the backcloths the miniatures all the tricks of the trade but though he concentrated as hard as his slightly spacedout condition would allow he just couldnt seem to get his fingers under the edge of the illusion to strip it back the wind just went on blowing the tumbleweed tumbled on somewhere in the storm a barndoor was slamming opening and slamming again in the gusts he could even smell horseshit the effect was so damn perfect he was breathless with admiration but whoever had created this extraordinary set had proved their point he was impressed now it was time to stop the game he turned back to the toilet door it was gone a wall of dust had erased it and suddenly he was lost and alone the barndoor kept slamming voices called to each other in the worsening storm where was the saloon and the sheriffs office they too had been obscured ricky tasted something he hadnt experienced since childhood the panic of losing the hand of a guardian in this case the lost parent was his sanity somewhere to his left a shot sounded in the depths of the storm and he heard something whistle in his ear then felt a sharp pain gingerly he raised his hand to his earlobe and touched the place that hurt part of his ear had been shot away a neat nick in his lobe his earstud was gone and there was blood real blood on his fingers someone had either just missed blowing off his head or was really playing silly fuckers hey man he appealed into the teeth of this wretched fiction whirling around on his heel to see if he could locate the aggressor but he could see no one the dust had totally enclosed him he couldnt move backwards or forwards with any safety the gunman might be very close waiting for him to step in his direction i dont like this he said aloud hoping the real world would hear him somehow and step in to salvage his tattered mind he rummaged in his jeans pocket for a pill or two anything to improve the situation but he was all out of instant sunshine not even a lowly valium was to be found lurking in the seam of his pocket he felt naked what a time to be lost in the middle of zane greys nightmares a second shot sounded but this time there was no whistling ricky was certain this meant hed been shot but as there was neither pain nor blood it was difficult to be sure then he heard the unmistakable flap of the saloon door and the groan of another human being somewhere near a tear opened up in the storm for a moment did he see the saloon through it and a young man stumbling out leaving behind him a painted world of tables mirrors and gunslingers before he could focus properly the tear was sewn up with sand and he doubted the sight then shockingly the young man hed come looking for was there a foot away bluelipped with death and falling forward into rickys arms he wasnt dressed for a part in this movie anymore than ricky was his bomber jacket was a fair copy of a fifties style his teeshirt bore the smiling face of mickey mouse mickeys left eye was bloodshot and still bleeding the bullet had unerringly found the young mans heart he used his last breath to ask what the fuck is going on and died as last words went it lacked style but it was deeply felt ricky stared into the young mans frozen face for a moment then the dead weight in his arms became too much and he had no choice but to drop him as the body hit the ground the dust seemed to turn into pissstained tiling for an instant then the fiction took precedence again and the dust swirled and the tumbleweed tumbled and he was standing in the middle of main street deadwood gulch with a body at his feet ricky felt something very like cold turkey in his system his limbs began a st virus dance and the urge to piss came on him very strong another halfminute hed wet his pants somewhere he thought somewhere in this wild world there is a urinal there is a graffiticovered wall with numbers for the sexcrazed to call with this is not a fallout shelter scrawled on the tiles and a cluster of obscene drawings there are watertanks and paperless toiletroll holders and broken seats there is the squalid smell of piss and old farts find it in gods name find the real thing before the fiction does you some permanent damage if for the sake of argument the saloon and the general stores are the toilet cubicles then the urinal must be behind me he reasoned so step back it cant do you any more harm than staying here in the middle of the street while someone takes potshots at you two steps two cautious steps and he found only air but on the third well well what have we here his hand touched a cold tile surface whoeee he said it was the urinal and touching it was like finding gold in a pan of trash wasnt that the sickly smell of disinfectant wafting up from the gutter it was oh boy it was still whooping he unzipped and started to relieve the ache in his bladder splashing his feet in his haste what the hell he had this illusion beat if he turned round now hed find the fantasy dispersed surely the saloon the dead boy the storm all would be gone it was some chemical throwback bad dope lingering in his system and playing dumbass games with his imagination as he shook the last drops on to his blue suedes he heard the hero of this movie speak what you doin pissin in mah street boy it was john waynes voice accurate to the last slurred syllable and it was just behind him ricky couldnt even contemplate turning round the guy would blow off his head for sure it was in the voice that threatful ease that warned im ready to draw so do your worst the cowboy was armed and all ricky had in his hand was his dick which was no match for a gun even if hed been better hung very cautiously he tucked his weapon away and zipped himself up then raised his hands in front of him the wavering image of the toilet wall had disappeared again the storm howled his ear bled down his neck ok boy i want you to take off that gunbelt and drop it to the ground you hear me said wayne yes take it nice and slow and keep those hands where i can see them boy this guy was really into it nice and slow like the man said ricky unbuckled his belt pulled it through the loops in his jeans and dropped it to thefloor the keys should have jangled as they hit the tiles he hoped to god they would no such luck there was a clinking thud that was the sound of metal on sand ok said wayne now youre beginning to behave what have you got to say for yourself im sorry said ricky lamely sorry for pissing in the street i dont reckon sorry is sufficient penitence said wayne but really i am it was all a mistake weve had about enough of you strangers around these parts found that kid with his trousers round his ankles takin a dump in the middle of the saloon well i call that uncouth wheres you sons of bitches been educated anyhow it that what theyre teaching you in them fancy schools out east i cant apologise enough damn right you cant wayne drawled you with the kid in a manner of speaking what kind of fancytalk is that he jabbed his gun in ricks back it felt very real indeed are you with him or not i just meant you dont mean nothing in this territory mister you take that from me he cocked the gun audibly why dont you turn round son and lets us see what youre made of ricky had seen this routine before the man turns he goes for a concealed gun and wayne shoots him no debate no time to discuss the ethics of it a bullet would do the job better than words turn round i said very slowly ricky turned to face the survivor of a thousand shootouts and there was the man himself or rather a brilliant impersonation of him a middle period wayne before hed grown fat and sicklooking a rio grande wayne dusty from the long trail and squinting from a lifetime of looking at the horizon ricky had never had a taste for westerns he hated all the forced machismo the glorification of dirt and cheap heroism his generation had put flowers in riflebarrels and hed thought that was a nice thing to do at the time still did in fact this face so mockmanly so uncompromising personified a handful of lethal lies about the glory of americas frontier origins the morality of swift justice the tenderness in the heart of brutes ricky hated the face his hands just itched to hit it fuck it if the actor whoever he was was going to shoot him anyway what was to be lost by putting his fist in the bastards face the thought became the act ricky made a fist swung and his knuckles connected with waynes chin the actor was slower than his screen image he failed to dodge the blow and ricky took the opportunity to knock the gun out of waynes hand he then followed through with a barrage of punches to the body just as hed seen in the movies it was a spectacular display the bigger man reeled backwards under the blows and tripped his spur catching in the dead boys hair he lost his balance and fell in the dust bested the bastard was down ricky felt a thrill hed never tasted before the exhilaration of physical triumph my god hed brought down the greatest cowboy in the world his critical faculties were overwhelmed by the victory the duststorm suddenly thickened wayne was still on the floor splattered with blood from a smashed nose and a broken lip the sand was already obscuring him a curtain drawn across the shame of his defeat get up ricky demanded trying to capitalise on the situation before the opportunity was lost entirely wayne seemed to grin as the storm covered him well boy he leered rubbing his chin well make a man of you yet then his body was eroded by the driving dust and momentarily something else was there in its place a form ricky could make no real sense of a shape that was and was not wayne which deteriorated rapidly towards inhumanity the dust was already a furious bombardment filling ears and eyes ricky stumbled away from the scene of the fight choking and miraculously he found a wall a door and before he could make sense of where he was the roaring storm had spat him out into the silence of the movie palace there though hed promised himself to butch it up since hed grown a moustache he gave a small cry that would not have shamed fay wray and collapsed in the foyer lindi lee was telling birdy why she didnt like films very much i mean dean likes cowboy movies i dont really like any of that stuff i guess i shouldnt say that to you no thats ok but i mean you must really love movies i guess cause you work here i like some movies not everything oh she seemed surprised a lot of things seemed to surprise her i like wildlife movies you know yes you know animals and stuff yes birdy remembered her guess about lindi lee that she wasnt much of a conversationalist got it in one i wonder whats keeping them said lindi the lifetime ricky had been living in the duststorm had lasted no more than two minutes in real time but then in the movies time was elastic ill go look birdy ventured hes probably left without me lindi said again well find out thanks dont fret said birdy lightly putting her hand on the girls thin arm as she passed im sure everythings ok she disappeared through the swing doors into the cinema leaving lindi lee alone in the foyer lindi sighed dean wasnt the first boy whod run out on her just because she wouldnt produce the goods lindi had her own ideas about when and how shed go all the way with a boy this wasnt the time and dean wasnt the boy he was too slick too shifty and his hair smelt of diesel oil if he had run out on her she wasnt going to weep buckets over the loss as her mother always said there were plenty more fish in the sea she was staring at the poster for next weeks attraction when she heard a thump behind her and there was a piebald rabbit a fat dozy sweetheart of a thing sitting in the middle of the foyer staring up at her hello she said to the rabbit the rabbit licked itself adorably lindi lee loved animals she loved true life adventure movies in which creatures were filmed in their native habitat to tunes from rossini and scorpions did squaredances while mating and every bearcub was lovingly called a little scamp she lapped up that stuff but most of all she loved rabbits the rabbit took a couple of hops towards her she knelt to stroke it it was warm and its eyes were round and pink it hopped past her up the stairs oh i dont think you should go up there she said for one thing it was dark at the top of the stairs for another there was a sign that read private staff only on the wall but the rabbit seemed determined and the clever mite kept well ahead of her as she followed it up the stairs at the top it was pitch black and the rabbit had gone something else was sitting there in the rabbits place its eyes burning bright with lindi lee illusions could be simple no need to seduce her into a complete fiction like the boy this one was already dreaming easy meat hello lindi lee said scared a little by the presence ahead of her she looked into the dark trying to sort out some outline a hint of a face but there was none not even a breath she took one step back down the stairs but it reached for her suddenly and caught her before she toppled silencing her quickly intimately this one might not have much passion to steal but it sensed another use here the tender body was still budding the orifices unused to invasions it took lindi up the few remaining stairs and sealed her away for future investigation ricky oh god ricky birdy knelt beside rickys body and shook him at least he was still breathing that was something and though at first sight there seemed to be a great deal of blood in fact the wound was merely a nick in his ear she shook him again more roughly but there was no response after a frantic search she found his pulse it was strong and regular obviously hed been attacked by somebody possibly lindi lees absent boyfriend in which case where was he still in the john perhaps armed and dangerous there was no way she was going to be damn fool enough to step in there and have a look shed seen that routine too many times woman in peril standard stuff the darkened room the stalking beast well instead of walking bang into that clichй she was going to do what she silently exhorted heroines to do time and again defy her curiosity and call the cops leaving ricky where he lay she walked up the aisle and back into the foyer it was empty lindi lee had either given up on her boyfriend altogether or found somebody else on the street outside to take her home whichever shed closed the front door behind her as she left leaving only a hint of johnsons baby powder on the air behind her ok that certainly made things easier birdy thought as she stepped into the ticket office to dial the cops she was rather pleased to think that the girl had found the commonsense to give up on her lousy date she picked up the receiver and immediately somebody spoke hello there said the voice nasal and ingratiating its a little late at night to be using the phone isnt it it wasnt the operator she was sure she hadnt even punched a number besides it sounded like peter loire who is this dont you recognise me i want to speak to the police id like to oblige really i would get off the line will you this is an emergency i need the police i heard you first time the whine went on who are you you already played that line theres somebody hurt in here will you please poor rick he knew the name poor rick he said as though he was a loving friend she felt the sweat begin in her brow felt it sprout out of her pores he knew rickys name poor poor rick the voice said again still im sure well have a happy ending arent you this is a matter of life and death birdy insisted impressed by how controlled she felt sure she was sounding i know said lorre isnt it exciting damn you get off this phone or so help me so help you what what can a fat girl like you hope to do in a situation like this except blubber you fucking creep my pleasure do i know you yes and no the tone of the voice was wavering youre a friend of rickys is that it one of the dopefiends he used to hang out with kind of idiotgame theyd get upto all right youve had your stupid little joke she said now get off the line before you do some serious harm youre harassed the voice said softening i understand it was changing magically sliding up an octave youre trying to help the man you loveits tone was feminine now the accent altering the slime becoming a purr and suddenly it was garbo poor richard she said to birdy hes tried so hard hasnt he she was gentle as a lamb birdy was speechless the impersonation was as faultless as that of lorre as female as the first had been male all right im impressed said birdy now let me speak to the cops wouldnt this be a fine and lovely night to go out walking birdy just we two girls together you know my name of course i know your name im very close to you what do you mean close to me the reply was throaty laughter garbos lovely laughter birdy couldnt take it any more the trick was too clever she could feel herself succumbing to the impersonation as though she were speaking to the star herself no she said down the phone you dont convince me you hear then her temper snapped she yelled youre a fake into the mouthpiece of the phone so loudly she felt the receiver tremble and then slammed it down she opened the office and went to the outer door lindi lee had not simply slammed the door behind her it was locked and bolted from the inside shit birdy said quietly suddenly the foyer seemed smaller than shed previously thought it and so did her reserve of cool she mentally slapped herself across the face the standard response for a heroine verging on hysteria think this through she instructed herself one the door was locked lindi lee hadnt done it ricky couldnt have done it she certainly hadnt done it which implied two there was a weirdo in here maybe the same he she or it that was on the phone which implied three he she or it must have access to another line somewhere in the building the only one she knew of was upstairs in the storeroom but there was no way she was going up there for reasons see heroine in peril which implied four she had to open this door with rickys keys right there was the imperative get the keys from ricky she stepped back into the cinema for some reason the houselights were jumpy or was that just panic in her optic nerve no they were flickering slightly the whole interior seemed to be fluctuating as though it were breathing ignore it fetch the keys she raced down the aisle aware as she always was when she ran that her breasts were doing a jig her buttocks too a right sight i look she thought for anyone with the eyes to see ricky was moaning in his faint birdy looked for the keys but his belt had disappeared rickyshe said close to his face the moans multiplied ricky can you hear me its birdy rick birdy birdy were locked in ricky where are the keys keys youre not wearing your belt ricky she spoke slowly as if to an idiot whereareyourkeys the jigsaw ricky was doing in his aching head was suddenly solved and he sat up boy he said what boy in the john dead in the john dead oh christ dead are you sure ricky was in some sort of trance it seemed he didnt look at her he just stared into middledistance seeing something she couldnt where are the keys she asked again ricky its important concentrate keys she wanted to slap him now but his face was already bloody and it seemed sadistic on the floor he said after a time in the john on the floor in the john ricky nodded the movement of his head seemed to dislodge some terrible thoughts suddenly he looked as though he was going to cry its all going to be all right said birdy rickys hands had found his face and he was feeling his features a ritual of reassurance am i here he inquired quietly birdy didnt hear him she was steeling herself for the john she had to go in there no doubt about that body or no body get in fetch the keys get out again do it now she stepped through the door it occurred to her as she did so that shed never been in a mens toilet before and she sincerely hoped this would be the first and only occasion the toilet was almost in darkness the light was flickering in the same fitful way as the lights in the cinema but at a lower level she stood at the door letting her eyes accommodate the gloom and scanned the place the toilet was empty there was no boy on the floor dead or alive the keys were there though rickys belt was lying in the gutter of the urinal she fished it out the oppressive smell of the disinfectant block making her sinuses ache disengaging the keys from their ring she stepped out of the toilet into the comparative freshness of the cinema and it was all over simple as that ricky had hoisted himself on to one of the seats and was slumped in it looking sicker and sorrier for himself than ever he looked up as he heard birdy emerge ive got the keys she said he grunted god he looked ill she thought some of her sympathy had evaporated however he was obviously having hallucinations and they probably had chemical origins it was his own damn fault theres no boy in there ricky what theres no body in the john nobody at all what are you on anyhow ricky looked down at his shaking hands im not on anything honestly damn stupid she said she halfsuspected that hed set her up for this somehow except that practical jokes werent his style ricky was quite a puritan in his way that had been one of his attractions do you need a doctor he shook his head sulkily are you sure i said no he snapped ok i offered she was already marching up the rake of the aisle muttering something under her breath at the foyer door she stopped and called across to him i think weve got an intruder there was somebody on the extension line do you want to stand watch by the front door while i fetch a cop in a minute ricky sat in the flickering light and examined his sanity if birdy said the boy wasnt in there then presumably she was telling the truth the best way to verify that was to see for himself then hed be certain hed suffered a minor reality crisis brought on by some bad dope and hed go home lay his head down to sleep and wake tomorrow afternoon healed except that he didnt want to put his head in that evilsmelling room suppose she was wrong and she was the one having the crisis werent there such things as hallucinations of normality shakily he hauled himself up crossed the aisle and pushed open the door it was murky inside but he could see enough to know that there were no sandstorms or dead boys no guntoting cowboys nor even a solitary rumbleweed its quite a thing he thought this mind of mine to have created an alternative world so eerily well it was a wonderful trick pity it couldnt be turned to better use than scaring him shitless you win some you lose some and then he saw the blood on the tiles a smear of blood that hadnt come from his nicked ear there was too much of it ha he didnt imagine it at all there was blood heel marks every sign that what he thought hed seen hed seen but jesus in heaven which was worse to see or not to see wouldnt it have been better to be wrong and just a little spacedout tonight than right and in the hands of a power that could literally change the world ricky stared at the trail of blood and followed it across the floor of the toilet to the cubicle on the left of his vision its door was closed it had been open before the murderer whoever he was had put the boy in there ricky knew it without looking ok he said now ive got you he pushed on the door it swung open and there was the boy propped up on the toilet seat legs spread arms hanging his eyes had been scooped out of his head not neatly no surgeons job theyd been wrenched out leaving a trail of mechanics down his cheek ricky put his hand over his mouth and told himself he wasnt going to throw up his stomach churned but obeyed and he ran to the toilet door as though any moment the body was going to get up and demand its ticketmoney back birdy birdy the fat bitch had been wrong all wrong there was death here and worse ricky flung himself out of the john into the body of the cinema the walllights were fairly dancing behind their deco shades guttering like candles on the verge of extinction darkness would be too much hed lose his mind there was it occurred to him something familiar about the way the lights flickered something he couldnt quite put his finger on he stood in the aisle for a moment hopelessly lost then the voice came and though he guessed it was death this time he looked up hello ricky she was saying as she came along row e towards him not birdy no birdy never wore a white gossamer dress never had bruisefull lips or hair so fine or eyes so sweetly promising it was monroe who was walking towards him the blasted rose of america arent you going to say hello she gently chided er ricky ricky ricky after all this time all this time what did she mean all this time who are you she smiled radiantly at him as if you didnt know youre not marilyn marilyns dead nobody dies in the movies ricky you know that as well as i do you can always thread the celluloid up again that was what the flickering reminded him of the flicker of celluloid through the gate of a projector one image hot on the next the illusion of life created from a perfect sequence of little deaths and were there again alltalking allsinging she laughed iceinaglass laughter we never fluff our lines never age never lose our timing youre not real said ricky she looked faintly bored by the observation as if he was being pedantic by now shed come to the end of the row and was standing no more than three feet away from him at this distance the illusion was as ravishing and as complete as ever he suddenly wanted to take her there in the aisle what the hell if she was just a fiction fictions are fuckable if you dont want marriage i want you he said surprised by his own bluntness i want you she replied which surprised him even more in fact i need you im very weak weak its not easy being the centre of attraction you know you find you need it more and more need people to look at you all the night all the day im looking am i beautiful youre a goddess whoever you are im yours thats who i am it was a perfect answer she was defining herself through him i am a function of you made for you out of you the perfect fantasy keep looking at me looking forever ricky i need your loving looks i cant live without them the more he stared at her the stronger her image seemed to become the flickering had almost stopped a calm had settled over the place do you want to touch me he thought shed never ask yes he said good she smiled coaxingly at him and he reached to make contact she elegantly avoided his fingertips at the last possible moment and ran laughing down the aisle towards the screen he followed eager she wanted a game that was fine by him shed run into a culdesac there was no way out from this end of the cinema and judging by the comeons she was giving him she knew it she turned and flattened herself against the wall feet spread a little he was within a couple of yards of her when a breeze out of nowhere billowed her skirt up around her waist she laughed halfclosing her eyes as the surf of silk rose and exposed her she was naked underneath ricky reached for her again and this time she didnt avoid his touch the dress billowed up a little higher and he stared fixated at the part of marilyn he had never seen the fur divide that had been the dream of millions there was blood there not much a few fingermarks on her inner thighs the faultless gloss of her flesh was spoiled slightly still he stared and the lips parted a little as she moved her hips and he realised the glint of wetness in her interior was not the juice of her body but something else altogether as her muscles moved the bloody eyes shed buried in her body shifted and came to rest on him she knew by the look on his face that she hadnt hidden them deep enough but where was a girl with barely a veil of cloth covering her nakedness to hide the fruits of her labour you killed him said ricky still looking at the lips and the eyes that peeked out between the image was so engrossing so pristine it all but cancelled out the horror in his belly perversely his disgust fed his lust instead of killing it so what if she was a murderer she was legend love me she said love me forever he came to her knowing now full well that it was death to do so but death was a relative matter wasnt it marilyn was dead in the flesh but alive here either in his brain or in the buzzing matrix of the air or both and he could be with her he embraced her and she him they kissed it was easy her lips were softer than hed imagined and he felt something close to pain at his crotch he wanted to be in her so much the willowthin arms slipped around his waist and he was in the lap of luxury you make me strong she said looking at me that way i need to be looked at or i die its the natural state of illusions her embrace was tightening the arms at his back no longer seemed quite so willowlike he struggled a little against the discomfort no use she cooed in his ear youre mine he wrenched his head around to look at her grip and to his amazement the arms werent arms any longer just a loop of something round his back without hands or fingers or wrists jesus christ he said look at me boy she said the words had lost their delicacy it wasnt marilyn that had him in its arms any more nothing like her the embrace tightened again and the breath was forced from rickys body breath the tightness of the hold prevented him from recapturing his spine creaked under the pressure and pain shot through his body like flares exploding in his eyes all colours you should have got out of town said marilyn as waynes face blossomed under the sweep of her perfect cheekbones his look was contemptuous but ricky had only a moment to register it before that image cracked too and something else came into focus behind this facade of famous faces for the last time in his life ricky asked the question who are you his captor didnt answer it was feeding on his fascination even as he stared twin organs erupted out of its body like the horns of a slug antennae perhaps forming themselves into probes and crossing the space between its head and rickys i need you it said its voice now neither wayne nor monroe but a crude uncultivated voice a thugs voice tm so fucking weak it uses me up being in the world it was mainlining on him feeding itself whatever it was on his stares once adoring now horrified he could feel it draining out his life through his eyes luxuriating in the soullooks he was giving it as he perished he knew he must be nearly dead because he hadnt taken a breath in a long while it seemed like minutes but he couldnt be sure just as he was listening for the sound of his heart the horns divided around his head and pressed themselves into his ears even in this reverie the sensation was disgusting and he wanted to cry out for it to stop but the fingers were working their way into his head bursting his eardrums and passing on like inquisitive tapeworms through brain and skull he was alive even now still staring at his tormentor and he knew that the fingers were finding his eyeballs and pressing on them now from behind his eyes bulged suddenly and broke from their housing splashing from his sockets momentarily he saw the world from a different angle as his sense of sight cascaded down his cheek there was his lip his chin it was an appalling experience and mercifully short then the feature rickyd lived for thirtyseven years snapped in midreel and he slumped in the arms of fiction rickys seduction and death had occupied less than three minutes in that time birdy had tried every key on rickys ring and could get none of the damn things to open the door had she not persisted she might have gone back into the cinema and asked for some help but things mechanical even locks and keys were a challenge to her womanhood she despised the way men felt some instinctive superiority over her sex when it came to engines systems and logical processes and she was damned if she was going to go whining back to ricky to tell him she couldnt open the damn door by the time shed given up the job so had ricky he was dead and gone she swore colourfully at the keys and admitted defeat ricky clearly had a knack with these wretched things that shed never quite grasp good luck to him all she wanted now was out of this place it was getting claustrophobic she didnt like being locked in not knowing who was lurking around upstairs and now to cap it all the lights in the foyer were on the blink dying away flicker by flicker what the hell was going on in this place anyhow without warning the lights went out altogether and beyond the doors into the cinema she was sure she heard movement a light spilled through from the other side stronger than torchlight twitching colourful ricky she chanced into the dark it seemed to swallow her words either that or she didnt believe it was ricky at all and something was telling her to make her appeal if she had to in a whisper ricky the lips of the swingdoors smacked together gently as something pressed on them from the other side is that you the air was electric static was crackling off her shoes as she walked towards the door the hairs on her arms were rigid the light on the other side was growing brighter with every step she stopped advancing thinking better of her enquiries it wasnt ricky she knew that maybe it was the man or woman on the phone some pebbleeyed lunatic who got off on stalking fat women she took two steps back towards the ticket office her feet sparking and reached under the counter for the motherfucker an iron bar which shed kept there since shed been trapped in the office by three wouldbe thieves with shaved heads and electric drills shed screamed blue murder and theyd fled but next time she swore shed beat one senseless rather than be terrorised and the motherfucker all three feet of it was her chosen weapon armed now she faced the doors they blew open suddenly and a roar of white noise filled her head and a voice through the roar said heres looking at you kid an eye a single vast eye was filling the doorway the noise deafened her the eye blinked huge and wet and lazy scanning the doll in front of it with the insolence of the one true god the maker of celluloid earth and celluloid heaven birdy was terrified no other word for it this wasnt a lookbehindyou thrill there was no delicious anticipation no pleasurable fright it was real fear bowelfear unadorned and ugly as shit she could hear herself whimpering under the relentless gaze of the eye her legs were weakening soon shed fall on the carpet in front of the door and that would be the end of her surely then she remembered motherfucker dear motherfucker bless his phallic heart she raised the bar in a twohanded grip and ran at the eye swinging before she made contact the eye closed the light went out and she was in darkness again her retina burning from the sight in the darkness somebody said rickys dead just that it was worse than the eye worse than all the dead voices of hollywood because she knew somehow it was true the cinema had become a slaughterhouse lindi lees dean had died as ricky had said he had and now ricky was dead as well the doors were all locked the game was down to two her and it she made a dash for the stairs not sure of her plan of action but certain that remaining in the foyer was suicidal as her foot touched the bottom stair the swingdoors sighed open again behind her and something came after her fast and flickering it was a step or two behind her as she breathlessly mounted the stairs cursing her bulk spasms of brilliant light shot by her from its body like the first igniting flashes of a roman candle it was preparing another trick she was certain of it she reached the top of the stairs with her admirer still on her heels ahead the corridor lit by a single greasy bulb promised very little comfort it ran the full length of the cinema and there were a few storerooms off it piled with crap posters d spectacles mildewed stills in one of the storerooms there was a firedoor she was sure but which shed only been up here once and that two years ago shit shit shit she said she ran to the first storeroom the door was locked she beat on it protesting it stayed locked the next the same the third the same even if she could remember which storeroom contained the escape route the doors were too heavy to break down given ten minutes and motherfuckers help she might do it but the eye was at her back she didnt have ten seconds never mind ten minutes there was nothing for it but confrontation she spun on her heel a prayer on her lips to face the staircase and her pursuer the landing was empty she stared at the forlorn arrangement of dead bulbs and peeling paint as if to discover the invisible but the thing wasnt in front of her at all it was behind the brightness flared again at her back and this time the roman candle caught fire became light light became image and glories shed almost forgotten were spilling down the corridor towards her unleashed scenes from a thousand movies each with its unique association she began for the first time to understand the origins of this remarkable species it was a ghost in the machine of the cinema a son of celluloid give your soul to me a thousand stars said i dont believe in souls she replied truthfully then give me what you give to the screen what everybody gives give me some love thats why all those scenes were playing and replaying and playing again in front of her they were all moments when an audience was magically united with the screen bleeding through its eyes looking and looking and looking shed done it herself often seen a film and felt it move her so deeply it was almost a physical pain when the end credits rolled and the illusion was broken because she felt shed left something of herself behind a part of her inner being lost up there amongst her heroes and her heroines maybe she had maybe the air carried the cargo of her desires and deposited them somewhere intermingled with the cargo of other hearts all gathering together in some niche until until this this child of their collective passions this technicolour seducer trite crass and utterly bewitching very well she thought its one thing to understand your executioner another thing altogether to talk it out of its professional obligations even as she sorted the enigma out she was lapping up the pictures in the thing she couldnt help herself teasing glimpses of lives shed lived faces shed loved mickey mouse dancing with a broom gish in broken blossoms garland watching the twister louring over kansas astaire in top hat welles in kane brando and crawford tracy and hepburn people so engraved on our hearts they need no christian names and so much better to be teased by these moments to be shown only the prekiss melt not the kiss itself the slap not the reconciliation the shadow not the monster the wound not death it had her in thrall no doubt of it she was held by her eyes as surely as if it had them out on their stalks and chained am i beautiful it said yes it was beautiful why dont you give yourself to me she wasnt thinking any more her powers of analysis had drained from her until something appeared in the muddle of images that slapped her back into herself dumbo the fat elephant her fat elephant no more than that the fat elephant shed thought was her the spell broke she looked away from the creature for a moment out of the corner of her eye she saw something sickly and flyblown beneath the glamour theyd called her dumbo as a child all the kids on her block shed lived with that ridiculous grey horror for twenty years never able to shake it off its fat body reminded her of her fat its lost look of her isolation she thought of it cradled in the trunk of its mother condemned as a mad elephant and she wanted to beat the sentimental thing senseless its a fucking lie she spat at it i dont know what you mean it protested whats under all the pizzazz then something very nasty i think the light began to flicker the parade of trailers faltering she could see another shape small and dark lurking behind the curtains of light doubt was in it doubt and fear of dying she was sure she could smell the fear off it at ten paces what are you under there she took a step towards it what are you hiding eh it found a voice a frightened human voice youve no business with me you tried to kill me i want to live so do i it was getting dark this end of the corridor and there was an old bad smell here of rot she knew rot and this was something animal only last spring when the snow had melted shed found something very dead in the yard behind her apartment small dog large cat it was difficult to be sure something domestic that had died of cold in the sudden snows the december before now it was besieged with maggots yellowish greyish pinkish a pastel flymachine with a thousand moving parts it had around it the same stink that lingered here maybe that was somehow the flesh behind the fantasy taking courage her eyes still stinging with dumbo she advanced on the wavering mirage motherfucker raised in case the thing tried any funny business the boards beneath her feet were creaking but she was too interested in her quarry to listen to their warnings it was time she got a hold of this killer shook it and made it spit its secret theyd almost gone the length of the corridor now her advancing it retreating there was nowhere left for the thing to go suddenly the floorboards folded up into dusty fragments under her weight and she was falling through the floor in a cloud of dust she dropped motherfucker as she threw out her hands to catch hold of something but it was all wormridden and crumbled in her grasp she fell awkwardly and landed hard on something soft here the smell of rot was incalculably stronger it coaxed the stomach into the throat she reached out her hand to right herself in the darkness and on every side there was slime and cold she felt as though shed been dumped in a case of partiallygutted fish above her the anxious light shone through the boards as it fell on her bed she looked though god knows she didnt want to and she was lying in the remains of a man his body spread by his devourers over quite an area she wanted to howl her instinct was to tear off her skirt and blouse both of which were gluey with matter but she couldnt go naked not in front of the son of celluloid it still looked down at her now you know it said lost this is you this is the body i once occupied yes his name was barberio a criminal nothing spectacular he never aspired to greatness and you his cancer im the piece of him which did aspire that did long to be more than a humble cell i am a dreaming disease no wonder i love the movies the son of celluloid was weeping over the edge of the broken floor its true body exposed now it had no reason to fabricate a glory it was a filthy thing a tumour grown fat on wasted passion a parasite with the shape of a slug and the texture of raw liver for a moment a toothless mouth badly moulded formed at its headend and said im going to have to find a new way to eat your soul it flopped down into the crawlspace beside birdy without its shimmering coat of many technicolours it was the size of a small child she backed away as it stretched a sensor to touch her but avoidance was a limited option the crawlspace was narrow and further along it was blocked with what looked to be broken chairs and discarded prayerbooks there was no way out but the way shed come and that was fifteen feet above her head tentatively the cancer touched her foot and she was sick she couldnt help it even though she was ashamed to be giving in to such primitive responses it revolted her as nothing ever had before it brought to mind something aborted a bucketcase go to hell she said to it kicking at its head but it kept coming its diarrhoeal mass trapping her legs she could feel the churning motion of its innards as it rose up to her its bulk on her belly and groin was almost sexual and revolted as she was by her own train of thought she wondered dimly if such a thing aspired to sex something about the insistence of its forming and reforming feelers against her skin probing tenderly beneath her blouse stretching to touch her lips only made sense as desire let it come then she thought let it come if it has to she let it crawl up her until it was entirely perched on her body fighting every moment the urge to throw it off and then she sprang her trap she rolled over shed weighed pounds at the last count and she was probably more now the thing was beneath her before it could work out how or why this had happened and its pores were oozing the sick sap of rumours it fought but it couldnt get out from under however much it squirmed birdy dug her nails into it and began to tear at its sides taking cobs out of it spongy cobs that set more fluids gushing its howls of anger turned into howls of pain after a short while the dreaming disease stopped fighting birdy lay still for a moment underneath her nothing moved at last she got up it was impossible to know if the tumour was dead it hadnt by any standards that she understood lived besides she wasnt touching it again shed wrestle the devil himself rather than embrace barberios cancer a second time she looked up at the corridor above her and despaired was she now to die in here like barberio before her then as she glanced down at her adversary she noticed the grille it hadnt been visible while it was still night outside now dawn was breaking and columns of dishwater light were creeping through the lattice she bent to the grille pushed it hard and suddenly the day was in the crawlspace with her all around her it was a squeeze to get through the small door and she kept thinking every moment that she felt the thing crawling across her legs but she hauled herself into the world with only bruised breasts to complain of the abandoned lot hadnt changed substantially since barberios visit there it was merely more nettlethronged she stood for a while breathing in draughts of fresh air then made for the fence and the street beyond it the fat woman with the haggard look and the stinking clothes was given a wide berth by newsboys and dogs alike as she made her way home three censored scenes it wasnt the end the police went to the movie palace just after ninethirty birdy went with them the search revealed the mutilated bodies of dean and ricky as well as the remains of sonny barberio upstairs in the corner of the corridor they found a cerise shoe birdy said nothing but she knew lindi lee had never left she was put on trial for a double murder nobody really thought shed committed and acquitted for lack of evidence it was the order of the court that she be put under psychiatric observation for a period of not less than two years the woman might not have committed murder but it was clear she was a raving lunatic tales of walking cancers do nobodys reputation much good in the early summer of the following year birdy gave up eating for a week most of the weightloss in that time was water but it was sufficient to encourage her friends that she was at last goingto tackle the big problem that weekend she went missing for twentyfour hours birdy found lindi lee in a deserted house in seattle she hadnt been so difficult to trace it was hard for poor lindi to keep control of herself these days never mind avoid wouldbe pursuers as it happened her parents had given up on her several months previous only birdy had continued to look paying for an investigator to trace the girl and finally her patience was rewarded with the sight of the frail beauty frailer than ever but still beautiful sitting in this bare room flies roamed the air a turd perhaps human sat in the middle of the floor birdy had a gun out before she opened the door lindi lee looked up from her thoughts or maybe its thoughts and smiled at her the greeting lasted a moment only before the parasite in lindi lee recognised birdys face saw the gun in her hand and knew exactly what shed come to do well it said getting up to meet its visitor lindi lees eyes burst her mouth burst her cunt and ass her ears and nose all burst and the tumour poured out of her in shocking pink rivers it came worming out of her milkless breasts out of a cut in her thumb from an abrasion on her thigh wherever lindi lee was open it came birdy raised the gun and fired three times the cancer stretched once towards her fell back staggered and collapsed once it was still birdy calmly took the acidbottle out of her pocket unscrewed the top and emptied the scalding contents on human limb and tumour alike it made no shout as it dissolved and she left it there in a patch of sun a pungent smoke rising from the confusion she stepped out into the street her duty done and went her way confidently planning to live long after the credits for this particular comedy had rolled rawhead rex of all the conquering armies that had tramped the streets of zeal down the centuries it was finally the mild tread of the sunday tripper that brought the village to its knees it had suffered roman legions and the norman conquest it had survived the agonies of civil war all without losing its identity to the occupying forces but after centuries of boot and blade it was to be the tourists the new barbarians that bested zeal their weapons courtesy and hard cash it was ideally suited for the invasion forty miles southeast of london amongst the orchards and hopfields of the kentish weald it was far enough from the city to make the trip an adventure yet close enough to beat a quick retreat if the weather turned foul every weekend between may and october zeal was a wateringhole for parched londoners they would swarm through the village on each saturday that promised sun bringing their dogs their plastic balls their litters of children and their childrens litter disgorging them in bawling hordes on to the village green then returning to the tall man to compare traffic stories over glasses of warm beer for their part the zealots werent unduly distressed by the sunday trippers at least they didnt spill blood but their very lack of aggression made the invasion all the more insidious gradually these cityweary people began to work a gentle but permanent change on the village many of them set their hearts on a home in the country they were charmed by stone cottages set amongst churning oaks they were enchanted by doves in the churchyard yews even the air theyd say as they inhaled deeply even the air smells fresher here it smells of england at first a few then many began to make bids for the empty barns and deserted houses that uttered zeal and its outskirts they could be seen every fine weekend standing in the nettles and rubble planning how to have a kitchen extension built and where to install the jacuzzi and although many of them once back in the comfort of kilburn or st johns wood chose to stay there every year one or two of them would strike a reasonable bargain with one of the villagers and buy themselves an acre of the good life so as the years passed and the natives of zeal were picked off by old age the civil savages took over in their stead the occupation was subtle but the change was plain to the knowing eye it was there in the newspapers the post office began to stock what native of zeal had ever purchased a copy of harpers and queen magazine or leafed through the times literary supplement it was there that change in the bright new cars that clogged the one narrow street laughingly called the high road that was zeals backbone it was there too in the buzz of gossip at the tall man a sure sign that the affairs of the foreigners had become fit subject for debate and mockery indeed as time went by the invaders found a yet more permanent place in the heart of zeal as the perennial demons of their hectic lives cancer and heart disease took their toll following their victims even into this newfoundland like the romans before them like the normans like all invaders the commuters made their profoundest mark upon this usurped turf not by building on it but by being buried under it it was clammy the middle of that september zeals last september thomas garrow the only son of the late thomas garrow was sweating up a healthy thirst as he dug in the corner of the three acre field thered been a violent rainstorm the previous day thursday and the earth was sodden clearing the ground for sowing next year hadnt been the easy job thomas thought itd be but hed sworn blind hed have the field finished by the end of the week it was heavy labour clearing stones and sorting out the detritus of outofdate machinery his father lazy bastard had left to rust where it lay must have been some good years thomas thought some pretty fine damn years that his father could afford to let good machinery waste away come to think of it that he could have afforded to leave the best part of three acres unploughed good healthy soil too this was the garden of england after all land was money leaving three acres fallow was a luxury nobody could afford in these straitened times but jesus it was hard work the kind of work his father had put him to in his youth and hed hated with a vengeance ever since still it had to be done and the day had begun well the tractor was healthier after its overhaul and the morning sky was rife with gulls across from the coast for a meal of freshly turned worms theyd kept him raucous company as he worked their insolence and their short tempers always entertaining but then when he came back to the field after a liquid lunch in the tall man things began to go wrong the engine started to cut out for one the same problem that hed just spent ј having seen to and then when hed only been back at work a few minutes hed found the stone it was an unspectacular lump of stuff poking out of the soil perhaps a foot its visible diameter a few inches short of a yard its surface smooth and bare no lichen even just a few grooves in its face that might have once been words a loveletter perhaps a kilroy was here more likely a date and a name likeliest of all whatever it had once been monument or milestone it was in the way now hed have to dig it up or next year hed lose a good three yards of ploughable land there was no way a plough could skirt around a boulder that size thomas was surprised that the damn thing had been left in the field for so long without anyone bothering to remove it but then it was a long spell since the three acre field had been planted certainly not in his thirtysix years and maybe now he came to think of it not in his fathers lifetime either for some reason this stretch of garrow land had been left fallow for a good many seasons maybe even for generations in fact there was a suspicion tickling the back of his skull that someone probably his father had said no crop would ever grow in that particular spot but that was plain nonsense if anything plant life albeit nettles and convolvulus grew thicker and ranker in this forsaken three acres than in any other plot in the district so there was no reason on earth why hops shouldnt flourish here maybe even an orchard though that took more patience and love than thomas suspected he possessed whatever he chose to plant it would surely spring up from such rich ground with a rare enthusiasm and hed have reclaimed three acres of good land to bolster his shaky finances if he could just dig out that bloody stone hed half thought of hiring in one of the earth movers from the building site at the north end of the village just to haul itself across here and get its mechanical jaws working on the problem have the stone out and away in two seconds flat but his pride resisted the idea of running for help at the first sign of a blister the job was too small anyhow hed dig it out himself the way his father would have done thats what hed decided now two and a half hours later he was regretting his haste the ripening warmth of the afternoon had soured in that time and the air without much of a breeze to stir it around had become stifling over from the downs came a stuttering roll of thunder and thomas could feel the static crawling at the nape of his neck making the short hairs there stand up the sky above the field was empty now the gulls too fickle to hang around once the fun was over had taken some saltsmelling thermal even the earth that had given up a sweetsharp flavour as the blades turned it that morning now smelt joyless and as he dug the black soil out from around the stone his mind returned helplessly to the putrefaction that made it so very rich his thoughts circled vacuously on the countless little deaths on every spadeful of soil he dug this wasnt the way he was used to thinking and the morbidity of it distressed him he stopped for a moment leaning on his spade and regretting the fourth pint of guinness hed downed at lunch that was normally a harmless enough ration but today it swilled around in his belly he could hear it as dark as the soil on his spade working up a scum of stomachacid and halfdigested food think of something else he told himself or youll get to puking to take his mind off his belly he looked at the field it was nothing out of the ordinary just a rough square of land bounded by an untrimmed hawthorn hedge one or two dead animals lying in the shadow of the hawthorn a starling something else too far gone to be recognisable there was a sense of absence but that wasnt so unusual it would soon be autumn and the summer had been too long too hot for comfort looking up higher than the hedge he watched the mongolheaded cloud discharge a flicker of lightning to the hills what had been the brightness of the afternoon was now pressed into a thin line of blue at the horizon rain soon he thought and the thought was welcome cool rain perhaps a downpour like the previous day maybe this time it would clear the air good and proper thomas stared back down at the unyielding stone and struck it with his spade a tiny arc of white flame flew off he cursed loudly and inventively the stone himself the field the stone just sat there in the moat hed dug around it defying him hed almost run out of options the earth around the thing had been dug out two feet down hed hammered stakes under it chained it and then got the tractor going to haul it out no joy obviously hed have to dig the moat deeper drive the stakes further down he wasnt going to let the damn thing beat him grunting his determination he set to digging again a fleck of rain hit the back of his hand but he scarcely noticed it he knew by experience that labour like this took singularity of purpose head down ignore all distractions he made his mind blank there was just the earth the spade the stone and his body push down scoop up push down scoop up a hypnotic rhythm of effort the trance was so total he wasnt sure how long he worked before the stone began to shift the movement woke him he stood upright his vertebrae clicking not quite certain that the shift was anything more than a twitch in his eye putting his heel against the stone he pushed yes it rocked in its grave he was too drained to smile but he felt victory close he had the bugger the rain was starting to come on heavier now and it felt fine on his face he drove a couple more stakes in around the stone to unseat it a little further he was going to get the better of the thing youll see he said youll see the third stake went deeper than the first two and it seemed to puncture a bubble of gas beneath the stone a yellowish cloud smelling so foul he stepped away from the hole to snatch a breath of purer air there was none to be had all he could do was hawk up a wad of phlegm to clear his throat and lungs whatever was under the stone and there was something animal in the stench it was very rotten he forced himself back down to the work taking gasps of the air into his mouth not through his nostrils his head felt tight as though his brain was swelling and straining against the dome of his skull pushing to be let out fuck you he said and beat another stake under the stone his back felt as though it was about to break on his right hand a blister had bust a cleg sat on his arm and feasted itself unswatted do it do it do it he beat the last stake in without knowing he was doing it and then the stone began to roll he wasnt even touching it the stone was being pushed out of its seating from beneath he reached for his spade which was still wedged beneath the stone he suddenly felt possessive of it it was his a part of him and he didnt want it near the hole not now not with the stone rocking like it had a geyser under it about to blow not with the air yellow and his brain swelling up like a marrow in august he pulled hard on his spade it wouldnt come he cursed it and took two hands to the job keeping at arms length from the hole as he hauled the increasing motion of the stone slinging up showers of soil lice and pebbles he heaved at the spade again but it wouldnt give he didnt stop to analyse the situation the work had sickened him all he wanted was to get his spade his spade out of the hole and get the hell out of there the stone bucked but still he wouldnt let go of the spade it had become fixed in his head that he had to have it before he could leave only when it was back in his hands safe and sound would he obey his bowels and run beneath his feet the ground began to erupt the stone rolled away from the tomb as if featherlight a second cloud of gas more obnoxious than the first seemed to blow it on its way at the same time the spade came out of the hole and thomas saw what had hold of it suddenly there was no sense in heaven or earth there was a hand a living hand clutching the spade a hand so wide it could grasp the blade with ease thomas knew the moment well the splitting earth the hand the stench he knew it from some nightmare hed heard at his fathers knee now he wanted to let go of the spade but he no longer had the will all he could do was obey some imperative from underground to haul until his ligaments tore and his sinews bled beneath the thin crust of earth rawhead smelt the sky it was pure ether to his dulled senses making him sick with pleasure kingdoms for the taking just a few inches away after so many years after the endless suffocation there was light on his eyes again and the taste of human terror on his tongue his head was breaking surface now his black hair wreathed with worms his scalp seething with tiny red spiders theyd irritated him a hundred years those spiders burrowing into his marrow and he longed to crush them out pull pull he willed the human and thomas garrow pulled until his pitiful body had no strength left and inch by inch rawhead was hoisted out of his grave in a shroud of prayers the stone that had pressed on him for so long had been removed and he was dragging himself up easily now sloughing off the graveearth like a snake its skin his torso was free shoulders twice as broad as a mans lean scarred arms stronger than any human his limbs were pumping with blood like a butterflys wings juicing with resurrection his long lethal fingers rhythmically clawed the ground as they gained strength thomas garrow just stood and watched there was nothing in him but awe fear was for those who still had a chance of life he had none rawhead was out of his grave completely he began to stand upright for the first time in centuries clods of damp soil fell from his torso as he stretched to his full height a yard above garrows six feet thomas garrow stood in rawheads shadow with his eyes still fixed on the gaping hole the king had risen from in his right hand he still clutched his spade rawhead picked him up by the hair his scalp tore under the weight of his body so rawhead seized garrow round the neck his vast hand easily enclosing it blood ran down garrows face from his scalp and the sensation stirred him death was imminent and he knew it he looked down at his legs thrashing uselessly below him then he looked up and stared directly into rawheads pitiless face it was huge like the harvest moon huge and amber but this moon had eyes that burned in its pallid pitted face they were for all the world like wounds those eyes as though somebody had gouged them in the flesh of rawheads face then set two candles to flicker in the holes garrow was entranced by the vastness of this moon he looked from eye to eye and then to the wet slits that were its nose and finally in a childish terror down to the mouth god that mouth it was so wide so cavernous it seemed to split the head in two as it opened that was thomas garrows last thought that the moon was splitting in two and falling out of the sky on top of him then the king inverted the body as had always been his way with his dead enemies and drove thomas head first into the hole winding him down into the very grave his forefathers had intended to bury rawhead in forever by the time the thunderstorm proper broke over zeal the king was a mile away from the three acre field sheltering in the nicholson barn in the village everyone went about their business rain or no rain ignorance was bliss there was no cassandra amongst them nor had your future in the stars in that weeks gazette even hinted at the sudden deaths to come to a gemini three leos a sagittarian and a minor starsystem of others in the next few days the rain had come with the thunder fat cool spots of it which rapidly turned into a downpour of monsoonal ferocity only when the gutters became torrents did people begin to take shelter on the building site the earthmover that had been roughly landscaping ronnie miltons back garden sat idling in the rain receiving a second washdown in two days the driver had taken the downpour as a signal to retire into the hut to talk racehorses and women in the doorway of the post office three of the villagers watched the drains backing up and tutted that this always happened when it rained and in half an hour thered be a pool of water in the dip at the bottom of the high street so deep you could sail a boat on it and down in the dip itself in the vestry of st peters declan ewan the verger watched the rain pelting down the hill in eager rivulets and gathering into a little sea outside the vestry gate soon be deep enough to drown in he thought and then puzzled by why he imagined drowning he turned away from the window and went back to the business of folding vestments a strange excitement was in him today and he couldnt wouldnt didnt want to suppress it it was nothing to do with the thunderstorm though hed always loved them since he was a child no there was something else stirring him up and he was damned if he knew what it was like being a child again as if it was christmas and any minute santa the first lord hed ever believed in would be at the door the very idea made him want to laugh out loud but the vestry was too sober a place for laughter and he stopped himself letting the smile curl inside him a secret hope while everyone else took refuge from the rain gwen nicholson was getting thoroughly drenched she was still in the yard behind the house coaxing amelias pony towards the barn the thunder had made the stupid beast jittery and it didnt want to budge now gwen was soaked and angry will you come on you brute she yelled at it over the noise of the storm the rain lashed the yard and pummelled the top of her head her hair was flattened come on come on the pony refused to budge its eyes showed crescents of white in its fear and the more the thunder rolled and crackled around the yard the less it wanted to move angrily gwen slapped it across the backside harder than she strictly needed to it took a couple of steps in response to the blow dropping steaming turds as it went and gwen took the advantage once she had it moving she could drag it the rest of the way warm barn she promised it come on its wet out here you dont want to stay out here the barndoor was slightly ajar surely it must look like an inviting prospect she thought even to a peabrained pony she dragged it to within spitting distance of the barn and one more slap got it through the door as shed promised the damn thing the interior of the barn was sweet and dry though the air smelt metallic with the storm gwen tied the pony to the crossbar in its stall and roughly threw a blanket over its glistening hide she was damned if she was going to swab the creature down that was amelias job that was the bargain shed made with her daughter when theyd agreed to buy the pony that all the grooming and clearing out would be amelias responsibility and to be fair to her shed done what she promised more or less the pony was still panicking it stamped and rolled its eyes like a bad tragedian there were flecks of foam on its lips a little apologetically gwen patted its flank shed lost her temper time of the month now she regretted it she only hoped amelia hadnt been at her bedroom window watching a gust of wind caught the barndoor and it swung closed the sound of rain on the yard outside was abruptly muted it was suddenly dark the pony stopped stamping gwen stopped stroking its side everything stopped her heart too it seemed behind her a figure that was almost twice her size rose from beyond the bales of hay gwen didnt see the giant but her innards churned damn periods she thought rubbing her lower belly in a slow circle she was normally as regular as clockwork but this month shed come on a day early she should go back to the house get changed get clean rawhead stood and looked at the nape of gwen nicholsons neck where a single nip would easily kill but there was no way he could bring himself to touch this woman not today she had the bloodcycle on her he could taste its tang and it sickened him it was taboo that blood and he had never taken a woman poisoned by its presence feeling the damp between her legs gwen hurried out of the barn without looking behind her and ran through the downpour back to the house leaving the fretting pony in the darkness of the barn rawhead heard the womans feet recede heard the house door slam he waited to be sure she wouldnt come back then he padded across to the animal reached down and took hold of it the pony kicked and complained but rawhead had in his time taken animals far bigger and far better armed than this he opened his mouth the gums were suffused with blood as the teeth emerged from them like claws unsheathed from a cats paw there were two rows on each jaw two dozen needlesharp points they gleamed as they closed around the meat of the ponys neck thick fresh blood poured down rawheads throat he gulped it greedily the hot taste of the world it made him feel strong and wise this was only the first of many meals he would take hed gorge on anything that took his fancy and nobody would stop him not this time and when he was ready hed throw those pretenders off his throne hed cremate them in their houses hed slaughter their children and wear their infants bowels as necklaces this place was his just because theyd tamed the wilderness for a while didnt mean they owned the earth it was his and nobody would take it from him not even the holiness he was wise to that too theyd never subdue him again he sat crosslegged on the floor of the barn the greypink intestines of the pony coiled around him planning his tactics as best he could hed never been a great thinker too much appetite it overwhelmed his reason he lived in the eternal present of his hunger and his strength feeling only the crude territorial instinct that would sooner or later blossom into carnage the rain didnt let up for over an hour ron milton was becoming impatient a flaw in his nature that had given him an ulcer and a topflight job in design consultancy what milton could get done for you couldnt be done quicker he was the best and he hated sloth in other people as much as in himself take this damn house for instance theyd promised it would be finished by midjuly garden landscaped driveway laid everything and here he was two months after that date looking at a house that was still far from habitable half the windows without glass the front door missing the garden an assaultcourse the driveway a mire this was to be his castle his retreat from a world that made him dyspeptic and rich a haven away from the hassles of the city where maggie could grow roses and the children could breathe clean air except that it wasnt ready damn it at this rate he wouldnt be in until next spring another winter in london the thought made his heart sink maggie joined him sheltering him under her red umbrella where are the kids he asked she grimaced back at the hotel driving mrs blatter crazy enid blatter had borne their cavorting for half a dozen weekends through the summer shed had kids of her own and she handled debbie and ian with aplomb but there was a limit even to her fund of mirth and merriment wed better get back to town no please lets stay another day or two we can go back on sunday evening i want us all to go to the harvest festival service on sunday now it was rons turn to grimace oh hell its all part of village life ronnie if were going to live here we have to become part of the community he whined like a little boy when he was in this kind of mood she knew him so well she could hear his next words before he said them i dont want to well weve no choice we can go back tonight ronnie theres nothing we can do here the kids are bored youre miserable maggie had set her features in concrete she wasnt going to budge an inch he knew that face as well as she knew his whining he studied the puddles that were forming in what might one day be their front garden unable to imagine grass there roses there it all suddenly seemed impossible you go back to town if you like ronnie take the kids ill stay here train it home on sunday night clever he thought to give him a getout thats more unattractive than staying put two days in town looking after the kids alone no thank you ok you win well go to the harvestbloodyfestival martyr as long as i dont have to pray amelia nicholson ran into the kitchen her round face white and collapsed in front of her mother there was greasy vomit on her green plastic mackintosh and blood on her green plastic wellingtons gwen yelled for denny their little girl was shivering in her faint her mouth chewing at a word or words that wouldnt come what is it denny was thundering down the stairs for christs sake amelia was vomiting again her face was practically blue whats wrong with her she just came in youd better ring for an ambulance denny put his hand on her cheek shes in shock ambulance denny gwen was taking off the green mackintosh and loosening the childs blouse slowly denny stood up through the rainlaced window he could see into the yard the barn door flapped open and closed in the wind somebody was inside he glimpsed movement for christs sake ambulance gwen said again denny wasnt listening there was somebody in his barn on his property and he had a strict ritual for trespassers the barn door opened again teasing yes retreating into the dark interloper he picked up the rifle beside the door keeping his eyes on the yard as much as he could behind him gwen had left amelia on the kitchen floor and was dialling for help the girl was moaning now she was going to be ok just some filthy trespasser scaring her thats all on his land he opened the door and stepped into the yard he was in his shirtsleeves and the wind was bitingly cold but the rain had stopped underfoot the ground glistened and drips fell from every eave and portico a fidgety percussion that accompanied him across the yard the barn door swung listlessly ajar again and this time stayed open he could see nothing inside half wondered if a trick of the light had but no hed seen someone moving in here the barn wasnt empty something was watching him even now theyd see the rifle in his hands and theyd sweat let them come into his place like that let them think he was going to blow their balls off he covered the distance in a half a dozen confident strides and stepped into the barn the ponys stomach was beneath his shoe one of its legs to his right the upper shank gnawed to the bone pools of thickening blood reflected the holes in the roof the mutilation made him want to heave all right he challenged the shadows come out he raised his rifle you hear me you bastard out i said or ill blow you to kingdom come he meant it too at the far end of the barn something stirred amongst the bales now ive got the son of a bitch thought denny the trespasser got up all nine feet of him and stared at denny jeesus and without warning it was coming at him coming like a locomotive smooth and efficient he fired into it and the bullet struck its upper chest but the wound hardly slowed it nicholson turned and ran the stones of the yard were slippery beneath his shoes and he had no turn of speed to outrun it it was at his back in two beats and on him in another gwen dropped the phone when she heard the shot she raced to the window in time to see her sweet denny eclipsed by a gargantuan form it howled as it took him and threw him up into the air like a sack of feathers she watched helplessly as his body twisted at the apex of its journey before plummeting back down to earth again it hit the yard with a thud she felt in her every bone and the giant was at his body like a shot treading his loving face to muck she screamed trying to silence herself with her hand too late the sound was out and the giant was looking at her straight at her its malice piercing the window oh god it had seen her and now it was coming for her loping across the yard a naked engine and grinning a promise at her as it came gwen snatched amelia off the floor and hugged her close pressing the girls face against her neck maybe she wouldnt see she mustnt see the sound of its feet slapping on the wet yard got louder its shadow filled the kitchen jesus help me it was pressing at the window its body so wide that it cancelled out the light its lewd revolting face smeared on the watery pane then it was smashing through ignoring the glass that bit into its flesh it smelled childmeat it wanted childmeat it would have childmeat its teeth were spilling into view widening that smile into an obscene laugh ropes of saliva hung from its jaw as it clawed the air like a cat after a mouse in a cage pressing further and further in each swipe closer to the morsel gwen flung open the door into the hall as the thing lost patience with snatching and began to demolish the windowframe and clamber through she locked the door after her while crockery smashed and wood splintered on the other side then she began to load all the hall furniture against it tables chairs coatstand knowing even as she did it that it would be matchwood in two seconds flat amelia was kneeling on the hall floor where gwen had set her down her face was a thankful blank all right that was all she could do now upstairs she picked up her daughter who was suddenly airlight and took the stairs two at a time halfway up the noise in the kitchen below stopped utterly she suddenly had a reality crisis on the landing where she stood all was peace and calm dust gathered minutely on the windowsills flowers wilted all the infinitesimal domestic procedures went on as though nothing had happened dreaming it she said god yes dreaming it she sat down on the bed denny and she had slept in together for eight years and tried to think straight some vile menstrual nightmare thats what it was some rapefantasy out of all control she lay amelia on the pink eiderdown and stroked the girls clammy forehead dreaming it then the room darkened and she looked up knowing what shed see it was there the nightmare all over the upper windows its spidery arms spanning the width of the glass clinging like an acrobat to the frame its repellent teeth sheathing and unsheathing as it gawped at her terror in one swooping movement she snatched amelia up from the bed and dived towards the door behind her glass shattered and a gust of cold air swept into the bedroom it was coming she ran across the landing to the top of the stairs but it was after her in a hearts beat ducking through the bedroom door its mouth a tunnel it whooped as it reached to steal the mute parcel in her arms huge in the confined space of the landing she couldnt outrun it she couldnt outfight it its hands fixed on amelia with insolent ease and tugged the child screamed as it took her her fingernails raking four furrows across her mothers face as she left her arms gwen stumbled back dizzied by the unthinkable sight in front of her and lost balance at the top of the stairs as she fell backwards she saw amelias tearstained face dollstiff being fed between those rows of teeth then her head hit the banister and her neck broke she bounced down the last six steps a corpse the rainwater had drained away a little by early evening but the artificial lake at the bottom of the dip still flooded the road to a depth of several inches serenely it reflected the sky pretty but inconvenient reverend coot quietly reminded declan ewan to report the blocked drains to the county council it was the third time of asking and declar blushed at the request sorry ill all right no problem declan but we really must get them cleared a vacant look a beat a thought autumn fall always clogs them again of course coot made a roughly cyclical gesture intending a son of observation about how it really wouldnt make that much difference when or if the council cleared the drains then the thought disappeared there were more pressing issues for one the sunday sermon for a second the reason why he couldnt make much sense of sermon writing this evening there was an unease in the air today that made every reassuring word he committed to paper curdle as he wrote it coot went to the window back to declan and scratched his palms they itched maybe an attack of eczema again if he could only speak find some words to shape his distress never in his fortyfive years had he felt so incapable of communication and never in those years had it been so vital that he talk shall i go now declan asked coot shook his head a moment longer if you would he turned to the verger declan ewan was twentynine though he had the face of a much older man bland pale features his hair receding prematurely what will this eggface make of my revelation thought coot hell probably laugh thats why i cant find the words because i dont want to im afraid of looking stupid here i am a man of the cloth dedicated to the christian mysteries for the first time in forty odd years ive had a real glimpse of something a vision maybe and im scared of being laughed at stupid man coot stupid stupid man he took off his glasses declans empty features became a blur now at least he didnt have to look at the smirking declan this morning i had what i can only describe as a as a visitation declan said nothing nor did the blur move i dont quite know how to say this our vocabularys impoverished when it comes to these sorts of things but frankly ive never had such a direct such an unequivocal manifestation of coot stopped did he mean god god he said not sure that he did declan said nothing for a moment coot risked returning his glasses to their place the egg hadnt cracked can you say what it was like declan asked his equilibrium absolutely unspoiled coot shook his head hed been trying to find the words all day but the phrases all seemed so predictable what was it like declan insisted why didnt he understand that there were no words i must try thought coot i must i was at the altar after morning prayerhe began and i felt something going through me like electricity almost it made my hair stand on end literally on end coots hand was running through his shortcropped hair as he remembered the sensation the hair standing bolt upright like a field of greyginger corn and that buzzing at the temples in his lungs at his groin it had actually given him a hardon not that he was going to be able to tell declan that but hed stood there at the altar with an erection so powerful it was like discovering the joy of lust all over again i wont claim i cant claim it was our lord god i cant even claim it was christian but something happened today i felt it declans face was still impenetrable coot watched it for several seconds impatient for its disdain well he demanded well what nothing to say the egg frowned for a moment a furrow in its shell then it said god help us almost in a whisper what i felt it too not quite as you describe not quite an electric shock but something why god help us declan are you afraid of something he made no reply if you know something about these experiences that i dont please tell me i want to know to understand god i have to understand declan pursed his lips well his eyes became more indecipherable than ever and for the first time coot caught a glimpse of a ghost behind declans eyes was it despair perhaps theres a lot of history to this place you know he said a history of things on this site coot knew declan had been delving into zeals history harmless enough pastime the past was the past theres been a settlement here for centuries stretches back well before roman occupation no one knows how long theres probably always been a temple on this site nothing odd about that coot offered up a smile inviting declan to reassure him a part of him wanted to be told everything was well with his world even if it was a lie declans face darkened he had no reassurance to give andthere was a forest here huge the wild woods was it still despair behind the eyes or was it nostalgia not some tame little orchard a forest you could lose a city in full of beasts wolves you mean bears declan shook his head there were things that owned this land before christ before civilisation most of them didnt survive the destruction of their natural habitat too primitive i suppose but strong not like us not human something else altogether so what one of them survived as late as the fourteen hundreds theres a carving of it being buried its on the altar on the altar underneath the cloth i found it a while ago never thought much of it till today today i tried to touch it he produced his fist and unclenched it the flesh of his palm was blistered pus ran from the broken skin it doesnt hurt he said in fact its quite numb serves me right really i should have known coots first thought was that the man was lying his second was that there was some logical explanation his third was his fathers dictum logic is the last refuge of a coward declan was speaking again this time he was seeping excitement they called it rawhead what the beast they buried its in the history books rawhead it was called because its head was huge and the colour of the moon and raw like meat declan couldnt stop himself now he was beginning to smile it ate children he said and beamed like a baby about to receive its mothers tit it wasnt until early on the saturday morning that the atrocity at the nicholson farm was discovered mick glossop had been driving up to london and hed taken the road that ran beside the farm and nicholsons friesian herd was kicking up a row at the gate their udders distended theyd clearly not been milked in twentyfour hours glossop had stopped his jeep on the road and gone into the yard the body of denny nicholson was already crawling with flies though the sun had barely been up an hour inside the house the only remains of amelia nicholson were shreds of a dress and a casually discarded foot gwen nicholsons unmutilated body lay at the bottom of the stairs there was no sign of a wound or any sexual interference with the corpse by ninethirty zeal was swarming with police and the shock of the incident registered on every face in the street though there were conflicting reports as to the state of the bodies there was no doubt of the brutality of the murders especially the child dismembered presumably her body taken away by her killer for god knows what purpose the murder squad set up a unit at the tall man while house to house interviews were conducted throughout the village nothing came immediately to light no strangers seen in the locality no more suspicious behaviour from anyone than was normal for a poacher or a bent building merchant it was enid blatter she of the ample bust and the motherly manner who mentioned that she hadnt seen thorn garrow for over twentyfour hours they found him where his killer had left him the worse for a few hours of picking worms at his head and gulls at his legs the flesh of his shins where his trousers had slid out of his boots was pecked to the bone when he was dug up families of refugee lice scurried from his ears the atmosphere in the hotel that night was subdued in the bar detective sergeant gissing down from london to head the investigation had found a willing ear in ron milton he was glad to be conversing with a fellow londoner and milton kept them both in scotch and water for the best part of three hours twenty years in the force gissing kept repeating and ive never seen anything like it which wasnt strictly true thered been that whore hed found in a suitcase at eustons left luggage department a good decade ago and the addict whod taken it upon himself to hypnotise a polar bear at london zoo hed been a sight for sore eyes when they dredged him out of the pool hed seen a good deal had stanley gissing but this never seen anything like it he insisted fair made me want to puke ron wasnt quite sure why he listened to gissing it was just something to while the night away ron whod been a radical in his younger days had never liked policemen much and there was some quirky satisfaction to be had from getting this selfsatisfied prat pissed out of his tiny skull hes a fucking lunatic gissing said you can take my word for it well have him easy a man like that isnt in control you see doesnt bother to cover his tracks doesnt even care if he lives or dies god knows any man who can tear a sevenyearold girl to shreds like that hes on the verge of going bang seen em yes oh yes seen em weep like children blood all over em like they was just out of the abattoir and tears on their faces pathetic so youll have him like that said gissing and snapped his fingers he got to his feet a little unsteadily sure as god made little apples well have him he glanced at his watch and then at the empty glass ron made no further offers of refills well said gissing i must be getting back to town put in my report he swayed to the door and left milton to the bill rawhead watched gissings car crawl out of the village and along the north road the headlights making very little impression on the night the noise of the engine made rawhead nervous though as it overrevved up the hill past the nicholson farm it roared and coughed like no beast he had encountered before and somehow the homo sapiens had control of it if the kingdom was to be taken back from the usurpers sooner or later he would have to best one of these beasts rawhead swallowed his fear and prepared for the confrontation the moon grew teeth in the back of the car stanley was near as damnit asleep dreaming of little girls in his dreams these charming nymphettes were climbing a ladder on their way to bed and he was on duty beside the ladder watching them climb catching glimpses of their slightly soiled knickers as they disappeared into the sky it was a familiar dream one that he would never have admitted to not even drunk not that he was ashamed exactly he knew for a fact many of his colleagues entertained peccadilloes every bit as offbeatas and some a good deal less savoury than his but he was possessive of it it was his particular dream and he wasnt about to share it with anyone in the driving seat the young officer who had been chauffeuring gissing around for the best part of six months was waiting for the old man to fall well and truly asleep then and only then could he risk turning the radio on to catch up with the cricket scores australia were well down in the test a late rally seemed unlikely ah now there was a career he thought as he drove beats this routine into a cocked hat both lost in their reveries driver and passenger neither caught sight of rawhead he was stalking the car now his giants stride easily keeping pace with it as it navigated the winding unlit road all at once his anger flared and roaring he left the field for the tarmac the driver swerved to avoid the immense form that skipped into the burning headlights its mouth issuing a howl like a pack of rabid dogs the car skidded on the wet ground its left wing grazing the bushes that ran along the side of the road a tangle of branches lashing the windscreen as it careered on its way on the back seat gissing fell off the ladder he was climbing just as the car came to the end of its hedgerow tour and met an iron gate gissing was flung against the front seat winded but uninjured the impact took the driver over the wheel and through the window in two short seconds his feet now in gissings face twitched from the road rawhead watched the death of the metal box its tortured voice the howl of its wrenched flank the shattering of its face frightened him but it was dead he waited a few cautious moments before advancing up the road to sniff the crumpled body there was an aromatic smell in the air which pricked his sinuses and the cause of it the blood of the box was dribbling out of its broken torso and running away down the road certain now that it must be finished he approached there was someone alive in the box none of the sweet childflesh he savoured so much just tough malemeat it was a comical face that peered at him round wild eyes its silly mouth opened and closed like a fishs he kicked the box to make it open and when that didnt work he wrenched off the doors then he reached and drew the whimpering male out of his refuge was this one of the species that had subdued him this fearful mite with its jellylips he laughed at its pleas then turned gissing on his head and held him upside down by one foot he waited until the cries died down then reached between the twitching legs and found the mites manhood not large quite shrunk in fact by fear gissing was blathering all kinds of stuff none of it made any sense the only sound rawhead understood from the mouth of the man was this sound he was hearing now this highpitched shriek that always attended a gelding once finished he dropped gissing beside the car a fire had begun in the smashed engine he could smell it he was not so much a beast that he feared fire respected it yes but not feared fire was a tool hed used it many times to burn out enemies to cremate them in their beds now he stepped back from the car as the flame found the petrol and fire erupted into the air heat bailed towards him and he smelt the hair on the front of his body crisp but he was too entranced by the spectacle not to look the fire followed the blood of the beast consuming gissing and licking along the rivers of petrol like an eager dog after a trail of piss rawhead watched and learned a new and lethal lesson in the chaos of his study coot was unsuccessfully fighting off sleep hed spent a good deal of the evening at the altar some of it with declan tonight thered be no praying just sketching now he had a copy of the altar carving on his desk in front of him and hed spent an hour just staring at it the exercise had been fruitless either the carving was too ambiguous or his imagination lacked breadth whichever he could make very little sense of the image it pictured a burial certainly but that was about all he was able to work out maybe the body was a little bigger than that of the mourners but nothing exceptional he thought of zeals pub the tall man and smiled it might well have pleased some mediaeval wit to picture the burial of a brewer under the altar cloth in the hall the sick clock struck twelvefifteen which meant it was almost one coot got up from his desk stretched and switched off the lamp he was surprised by the brilliance of the moonlight streaming through the crack in the curtain it was a full harvest moon and the light though cold was luxuriant he put the guard in front of the fire and stepped into the darkened hallway closing the door behind him the clock ticked loudly somewhere over towards goudhurst he heard the sound of an ambulance siren whats happening he wondered and opened the front door to see what he could see there were car headlights on the hill and the distant throb of blue police lights more rhythmical than the ticking at his back accident on the north road early for ice and surely not cold enough he watched the lights set on the hill like jewels on the back of a whale winking away it was quite chilly come to think of it no weather to be standing in the he frowned something caught his eye a movement in the far corner of the churchyard underneath the trees the moonlight etched the scene in monochrome black yews grey stones a white chrysanthemum strewing its petals on a grave and black in the shadow of the yews but outlined clearly against the slab of a marble tomb beyond a giant coot stepped out of the house in slippered feet the giant was not alone somebody was kneeling in front of it a smaller more human shape its face raised and clear in the light it was declan even from a distance it was clear that he was smiling up at his master coot wanted to get closer a better look at the nightmare as he took his third step his foot crunched on a piece of gravel the giant seemed to shift in the shadows was it turning to look at him coot chewed on his heart no let it be deaf please god let it not see me make me invisible the prayer was apparently answered the giant made no sign of having seen his approach taking courage coot advanced across the pavement of gravestones dodging from tomb to tomb for cover barely daring to breathe he was within a few feet of the tableau now and he could see the way the creatures head was bowed towards declan he could hear the sound like sandpaper on stone it was making at the back of its throat but there was more to the scene declans vestments were torn and dirtied his thin chest bare moonlight caught his sternum his ribs his state and his position were unequivocal this was adoration pure and simple then coot heard the splashing he stepped closer and saw that the giant was directing a glistening rope of its urine onto declans upturned face it splashed into his slackly opened mouth it ran over his torso the gleam of joy didnt leave declans eyes for a moment as he received this baptism indeed he turned his head from side to side in his eagerness to be totally defiled the smell of the creatures discharge wafted across to coot it was acidic vile how could declan bear to have a drop of it on him much less bathe in it coot wanted to cry out stop the depravity but even in the shadow of the yew the shape of the beast was terrifying it was too tall and too broad to be human this was surely the beast of the wild woods declan had been trying to describe this was the childdevourer had declan guessed when he eulogised about this monster what power it would have over his imagination had he known all along that if the beast were to come sniffing for him hed kneel in front of it call it lord let it discharge its bladder on to him and smile yes oh yes and so let him have his moment dont risk your neck for him coot thought hes where he wants to be very slowly he backed off towards the vestry his eyes still fixed on the degradation in front of him the baptism dribbled to a halt but declans hands cupped in front of him still held a quantity of fluid he put the heels of his hands to his mouth and drank coot gagged unable to prevent himself for an instant he closed his eyes to shut out the sight and opened them again to see that the shadowy head had turned towards him and was looking at him with eyes that burned in the blackness christ almighty it saw him for certain this time it saw him it roared and its head changed shape in the shadow its mouth opened so horribly wide sweet jesus already it was charging towards him antelopelithe leaving its acolyte slumped beneath the tree coot turned and ran ran as he hadnt in many a long year hurdling the graves as he fled it was just a few yards the door some kind of safety not for long maybe but time to think to find a weapon run you old bastard christ the race christ the prize four yards run the door was open almost there a yard to go he crossed the threshold and swung round to slam the door on his pursuer but no rawhead had shot his hand through the door a hand three times the size of a human hand it was snatching at the empty air trying to find coot the roars relentless coot threw his full weight against the oak door the door stile edged with iron bit into rawheads forearm the roar became a howl venom and agony mingled in a din that was heard from one end of zeal to the other it stained the night up as far as the north road where the remains of gissing and his driver were being scraped up and parcelled in plastic it echoed round the icy walls of the chapel of rest where denny and gwen nicholson were already beginning to degenerate it was heard too in the bedrooms of zeal where living couples lay side by side maybe an arm numbed under the others body where the old lay awake working out the geography of the ceiling where children dreamt of the womb and babies mourned it it was heard again and again and again as rawhead raged at the door the howl made coots head swim his mouth babbled prayers but the much needed support from on high showed no sign of coming he felt his strength ebbing away the giant was steadily gaining access pressing the door open inch by inch coots feet slid on the toowellpolished floor his muscles were fluttering as they faltered this was a contest he had no chance of winning not if he tried to match his strength to that of the beast sinew for sinew if he was to see tomorrow morning he needed some strategy coot pressed harder against the wood his eyes darting around the hallway looking for a weapon it mustnt get in it mustnt have mastery over him a bitter smell was in his nostrils for a moment he saw himself naked and kneeling in front of the giant with its piss beating on his skull hard on the heels of that picture came another flurry of depravities it was all he could do not to let it in let the obscenities get a permanent hold its mind was working its way into his a thick wedge of filth pressing its way through his memories encouraging buried thoughts to the surface wouldnt it ask for worship just like any god and wouldnt its demands be plain and real not ambiguous like those of the lord hed served up til now that was a fine thought to give himself up to this certainty that beat on the other side of the door and lie open in front of it and let it ravage him rawhead its name was a pulse in his ear raw head in desperation knowing his fragile mental defences were within an ace of collapsing his eyes alighted on the clothes stand to the left of the door raw head raw head the name was an imperative raw head raw head it evoked a skinned head its defences peeled back a thing close to bursting no telling if it was pain or pleasure but easy to find out it almost had possession of him he knew it it was now or never he took one arm from the door and stretched towards the rack for a walkingstick there was one amongst them he wanted in particular he called it hiscrosscountry stick a yard and a half of stripped ash well used and resilient his fingers coaxed it towards him rawhead had taken advantage of the lack of force behind the door its leathery arm was working its way in indifferent to the way the door jamb scored the skin the hand its fingers strong as steel had caught the folds of coots jacket coot raised the ash stick and brought it down on rawheads elbow where the bone was vulnerably close to the surface the weapon splintered on impact but it did its job on the other side of the door the howl began again and rawheads arm was rapidly withdrawn as the fingers slid out coot slammed the door and bolted it there was a short hiatus seconds only before the attack began again this time a twofisted beating on the door the hinges began to buckle the wood groaned it would be a short time a very short time before it gained access it was strong and now it was furious too coot crossed the hall and picked up the phone police he said and began to dial how long before it put two and two together gave up on the door and moved to the windows they were leaded but that wouldnt keep it out for long he had minutes at the most probably seconds depending on its brain power his mind loosed from rawheads grasp was a chorus of fragmented prayers and demands if i die he found himself thinking will i be rewarded in heaven for dying more brutally than any country vicar might reasonably expect is there compensation in paradise for being disembowelled in the front hall of your own vestry there was only one officer left on duty at the police station the rest were up on the north road clearing up after gissings party the poor man could make very little sense of reverend coots pleas but there was no mistaking the sound of splintering wood that accompanied the babbles nor the howling in the background the officer put the phone down and radioed for help the patrol on the north road took twenty maybe twentyfive seconds to answer in that time rawhead had smashed the central panel of the vestry door and was now demolishing the rest not that the patrol knew that after the sights theyd faced up there the chauffeurs charred body gissings missing manhood they had become insolent with experience like hourold war veterans it took the officer at the station a good minute to convince them of the urgency in coots voice in that time rawhead had gained access in the hotel ron milton watched the parade of lights blinking on the hill heard the sirens and rawheads howls and was besieged by doubts was this really the quiet country village he had intended to settle himself and his family in he looked down at maggie who had been woken by the noise but was now asleep again her bottle of sleeping tablets almost empty on the bedside cabinet he felt though she would have laughed at him for it protective towards her he wanted to be her hero she was the one who took the selfdefence night classes however while he grew overweight on expense account lunches it made him inexplicably sad to watch her sleep knowing he had so little power over life and death rawhead stood in the hall of the vestry in a confetti of shattered wood his torso was pinpricked with splinters and dozens of tiny wounds bled down his heaving bulk his sour sweat permeated the hail like incense he sniffed the air for the man but he was nowhere near rawhead bared his teeth in frustration expelling a thin whistle of air from the back of his throat and loped down the hall towards the study there was warmth there his nerves could feel it at twenty yards and there was comfort too he overturned the desk and shattered two of the chairs partly to make more room for himself mostly out of sheer destructiveness then threw away the fire guard and sat down warmth surrounded him healing living warmth he luxuriated in the sensation as it embraced his face his lean belly his limbs he felt it heat his blood too and so stir memories of other fires fires hed set in fields of burgeoning wheat and he recalled another fire the memory of which his mind tried to dodge and duck but he couldnt avoid thinking about it the humiliation of that night would be with him forever theyd picked their season so carefully high summer and no rain in two months the undergrowth of the wild woods was tinder dry even the living tree caught the flame easily he had been flushed out of his fortress with streaming eyes confused and fearful to be met with spikes and nets on every side and that thing they had that sight that could subdue him of course they werent courageous enough to kill him they were too superstitious for that besides didnt they recognise his authority even as they wounded him their terror a homage to it so they buried him alive and that was worse than death wasnt that the very worst because he could live an age ages and never die not even locked in the earth just left to wait a hundred years and suffer and another hundred and another while the generations walked the ground above his head and lived and died and forgot him perhaps the women didnt forget him he could smell them even through the earth when they came close to his grave and though they might not have known it they felt anxious they persuaded their men to abandon the place altogether so he was left absolutely alone with not even a gleaner for company loneliness was their revenge on him he thought for the times he and his brothers had taken women into the woods spread them out spiked and loosed them again bleeding but fertile they would die having the children of those rapes no womans anatomy could survive the thrashing of a hybrid its teeth its anguish that was the only revenge he and his brothers ever had on the bigbellied sex rawhead stroked himself and looked up at the gilded reproduction of the light of the world that hung above coots mantelpiece the image woke no tremors of fear or remorse in him it was a picture of a sexless martyr doeeyed and woebegone no challenge there the true power the only power that could defeat him was apparently gone lost beyond recall its place usurped by a virgin shepherd he ejaculated silently his thin semen hissing on the hearth the world was his to rule unchallenged he would have warmth and food in abundance babies even yes babymeat that was the best just dropped mites still blind from the womb he stretched sighing in anticipation of that delicacy his brain awash with atrocities from his refuge in the crypt coot heard the police cars squealing to a halt outside the vestry then the sound of feet on the gravel path he judged there to be at least half a dozen it would be enough surely cautiously he moved through the darkness towards the stairs something touched him he almost yelled biting his tongue a moment before the cry escaped dont go now a voice said from behind him it was declan and he was speaking altogether too loudly for comfort the thing was above them somewhere it would hear them if he wasnt careful oh god it mustnt hear its up above us said coot in a whisper i know the voice seemed to come from his bowels not from his throat it was bubbled through filth lets have him come down here shall we he wants you you know he wants me to whats happened to you declans face was just visible in the dark it grinned lunatic i think he might want to baptise you too howd you like that like that would you he pissed on me you see him and that wasnt all oh no he wants more than that he wants everything hear me everything declan grabbed hold of coot a bearhug that stank of the creatures urine come with me he leered in coots face i put my trust in god declan laughed not a hollow laugh there was genuine compassion in it for this lost soul he is god he said he was here before this fucking shithouse was built you know that so were dogs uh doesnt mean id let them cock their legs on me clever old fucker arent you said declan the smile inverted hell show you youll change no declan let go of me the embrace was too strong come on up the stairs fuckface mustnt keep god waiting he pulled coot up the stairs arms still locked round him words all logical argument eluded coot was there nothing he could say to make the man see his degradation they made an ungainly entrance into the church and coot automatically looked towards the altar hoping for some reassurance but he got none the altar had been desecrated the cloths had been torn and smeared with excrement the cross and candlesticks were in the middle of a fire of prayerbooks that burned healthily on the altar steps smuts floated around the church the air was grimy with smoke you did this declan grunted he wants me to destroy it all take it apart stone by stone if i have to he wouldnt dare oh hed dare hes not scared of jesus hes not scared of the certainty lapsed for a telling instant and coot leapt on the hesitation theres something here he is scared of though isnt there or hed have come in here himself done it all himself declan wasnt looking at coot his eyes had glazed what is it declan what is it he doesnt like you can tell me declan spat in coots face a wad of thick phlegm that hung on his cheek like a slug none of your business in the name of christ declan look at what hes done to you i know my master when i see him declan was shaking and so will you he turned coot round to face the south door it was open and the creature was there on the threshold stooping gracefully to duck under the porch for the first time coot saw rawhead in a good light and the terrors began in earnest he had avoided thinking too much of its size its stare its origins now as it came towards him with slow even stately steps his heart conceded its mastery it was no mere beast despite its mane and its awesome array of teeth its eyes lanced him through and through gleaming with a depth of contempt no animal could ever muster its mouth opened wider and wider the teeth gliding from the gums two three inches long and still the mouth was gaping wider when there was nowhere to run declan let coot go not that coot could have moved anyway the stare was too insistent rawhead reached out and picked coot up the world turned on its head there were seven officers not six as coot had guessed three of them were armed their weapons brought down from london on the order of detective sergeant gissing the late soon to be decorated posthumously detective sergeant gissing they were led these seven good men and true by sergeant ivanhoe baker ivanhoe was not an heroic man either by inclination or education his voice which he had prayed would give the appropriate orders when the time came without betraying him came out as a strangled yelp as rawhead appeared from the interior of the church i can see it he said everybody could it was nine feet tall covered in blood and it looked like hell on legs nobody needed it pointed out the guns were raised without ivanhoes instruction and the unarmed men suddenly feeling naked kissed their truncheons and prayed one of them ran hold your ground ivanhoe shrieked if those sons of bitches turned tail hed be left on his own they hadnt issued him with a gun just authority and that was not much comfort rawhead was still holding coot up at arms length by the neck the reverends legs dangled a foot above the ground his head lolled back his eyes were closed the monster displayed the body for his enemies proof of power shall we please can we shoot the bastard one of the gunmen inquired ivanhoe swallowed before answering well hit the vicar hes dead already said the gunman we dont know that he must be dead look at him rawhead was shaking coot like an eiderdown and his stuffing was falling out much to ivanhoes intense disgust then almost lazily rawhead flung coot at the police the body hit the gravel a little way from the gate and lay still ivanhoe found his voice shoot the gunmen needed no encouragement their fingers were depressing the triggers before the syllable was out of his mouth rawhead was hit by three four five bullets in quick succession most of them in the chest they stung him and he put up an arm to protect his face covering his balls with the other hand this was a pain he hadnt anticipated the wound hed received from nicholsons rifle had been forgotten in the bliss of the bloodletting that came soon after but these barbs hurt him and they kept coming he felt a twinge of fear his instinct was to fly in the face of these popping flashing rods but the pain was too much instead he turned and made his retreat leaping over the tombs as he fled towards the safety of the hills there were copses he knew burrows and caves where he could hide and find time to think this new problem through but first he had to elude them they were after him quickly flushed with the ease of their victory leaving ivanhoe to find a vase on one of the graves empty it of chrysanthemums and be sick out of the dip there were no lights along the road and rawhead began to feel safer he could melt into the darkness into the earth hed done it a thousand times he cut across a field the barley was still unharvested and heavy with its grain he trampled it as he ran grinding seed and stalk at his back his pursuers were already losing the chase the car theyd piled into had stopped in the road he could see its lights one blue two white way behind him the enemy was shouting a confusion of orders words rawhead didnt understand no matter he knew men they were easily frightened they would not look far for him tonight theyd use the dark as an excuse to call off the search telling themselves that his wounds were probably fatal anyhow trusting children that they were he climbed to the top of the hill and looked down into the valley below the snake of the road its eyes the headlights of the enemys car the village was a wheel of warm light with flashing blues and reds at its hub beyond in every direction the impenetrable black of the hills over which the stars hung in loops and clusters by day this would seem a counterpane valley toy town small by night it was fathomless more his than theirs his enemies were already returning to their hovels as hed known they would the chase was over for the night he lay down on the earth and watched a meteor burn up as it fell to the southwest it was a brief bright streak which edgelit a cloud then went out morning was many long healing hours in the future he would soon be strong again and then then hed burn them all away coot was not dead but so close to death it scarcely made any difference eighty per cent of the bones in his body were fractured or broken his face and neck were a maze of lacerations one of his hands was crushed almost beyond recognition he would certainly die it was purely a matter of time and inclination in the village those who had glimpsed so much as a fragment of the events in the dip were already elaborating on their stories and the evidence of the naked eye lent credence to the most fantastic inventions the chaos in the churchyard the smashed door of the vestry the cordonedoff car on the north road whatever had happened that saturday night it was going to take a long time to forget there was no harvest festival service which came as no surprise to anyone maggie was insistent i want us all to go back to london a day ago you wanted us to stay here got to be part of the community that was on friday before all this this theres a maniac loose ron if we go now we wont come back what are you talking about of course well come back if we leave once the place is threatened we give up on it altogether thats ridiculous you were the one who was so keen on us being visible being seen to join in village life well well have to join in the deaths too and im going to stay see it through you can go back to london take the kids no he sighed heavily i want to see him caught whoever he is i want to know its all been cleared up see it with my own eyes thats the only way well ever feel safe here reluctantly she nodded at least lets get out of the hotel for a while mrs blatters going loopy cant we go for a drive get some air yes why not it was a balmy september day the countryside always willing to spring a surprise was gleaming with life late flowers shone in the roadside hedges birds dipped over the road as they drove the sky was azure the clouds a fantasia in cream a few miles outside the village all the horrors of the previous night began to evaporate and the sheer exuberance of the day began to raise the familys spirits with every mile they drove out of zeal rons fears diminished soon he was singing on the back seat debbie was being difficult one moment im hot daddy the next i want an orange juice daddy the next i have to pee ron stopped the car on an empty stretch of road and played the indulgent father the kids had been through a lot today they could be spoiled all right darling you can have a pee here then well go and find an icecream for you wheres the lala she said damn stupid phrase motherinlaws euphemism maggie chipped in she was better with debbie in these moods than ron you can go behind the hedge she said debbie looked horrified ron exchanged a halfsmile with ian the boy had a putupon look on his face grimacing he went back to his dogeared comic hurry up cant you he muttered then we can go somewhere proper somewhere proper thought ron he means a town hes a city kid its going to take a while to convince him that a hill with a view is somewhere proper debbie was still being difficult i cant go here mummy why not somebody might see me nobodys going to see you darling ron reassured her now do as your mummy says he turned to maggie go with her love maggie wasnt budging shes ok she cant climb over the gate on her own well you go then ron was determined not to argue he forced a smile come on he said debbie got out of the car and ron helped her over the iron gate into the field beyond it was already harvested it smelt earthy dont look she admonished him wideeyed you mustnt look she was already a manipulator at the ripe old age of nine she could play him better than the piano she was taking lessons on he knew it and so did she he smiled at her and closed his eyes all right see ive got my eyes closed now hurry up debbie please promise you wont peek i wont peek my god he thought shes certainly making a production number out of this hurry up he glanced back towards the car ian was sitting in the back still reading engrossed in some cheap heroics his face set as he stared into the adventure the boy was so serious the occasional halfsmile was all ron could ever win from him it wasnt a puton it wasnt a fake air of mystery he seemed content to leave all the performing to his sister behind the hedge debbie pulled down her sunday knickers and squatted but after all the fuss her pee wouldnt come she concentrated but that just made it worse ron looked up the field towards the horizon there were gulls up there squabbling over a titbit he watched them awhile impatience growing come on love he said he looked back at the car and ian was watching him now his face slack with boredom or something like it was there something else there a deep resignation ron thought the boy looked back to his comic book utopia without acknowledging his fathers gaze then debbie screamed an earpiercing shriek christ ron was clambering over the gate in an instant and maggie wasnt far behind him debbie ron found her standing against the hedge staring at the ground blubbering face red whats wrong for gods sake she was yabbering incoherently ron followed her eye whats happened maggie was having difficulty getting over the gate its all right its all right there was a dead mole almost buried in the tangle at the edge of the field its eyes pecked out its rotting hide crawling with flies oh god ron maggie looked at him accusingly as though hed put the damn thing there with malice aforethought its all right sweetheart she said elbowing past her husband and wrapping debbie up in her arms her sobs quietened a bit city kids thought ron theyre going to have to get used to that sort of thing if theyre going to live in the country no roadsweepers here to brush up the runover cats every morning maggie was rocking her and the worst of the tears were apparently over shell be all right ron said of course she will wont you darling maggie helped her pull up her knickers she was still snivelling her need for privacy forgotten in her unhappiness in the back of the car ian listened to his sisters caterwauling and tried to concentrate on his comic anything for attention he thought well shes welcome suddenly it went dark he looked up from the page his heart loud at his shoulder six inches away from him something stooped to peer into the car its face like hell he couldnt scream his tongue refused to move all he could do was flood the seat and kick uselessly as the long scarred arms reached through the window towards him the nails of the beast gouged his ankles tore his sock one of his new shoes fell off in the struggle now it had his foot and he was being dragged across the wet seat towards the window he found his voice not quite to voice it was a pathetic a sillysounding voice not the equal of the mortal terror he felt and all too late anyway it was dragging his legs through the window and his bottom was almost through now he looked through the back window as it hauled his torso into the open air and in a dream he saw daddy at the gate his face looking so so ridiculous he was climbing the gate coming to help coming to save him but he was far too slow ian knew he was beyond salvation from the beginning because hed died this way in his sleep on a hundred occasions and daddy never got there in time the mouth was wider even than hed dreamed it a hole which he was being delivered into head first it smelt like the dustbins at the back of the school canteen times a million he was sick down its throat as it bit the top of his head off ron had never screamed in his life the scream had always belonged to the other sex until that instant then watching the monster stand up and close its jaws around his sons head there was no sound appropriate but a scream rawhead heard the cry and turned without a trace of fear on his face to look at the source their eyes met the kings glance penetrated milton like a spike freezing him to the road and to the marrow it was maggie who broke its hold her voice a dirge oh please no ron shook rawheads look from his head and started towards the car towards his son but the hesitation had given rawhead a moments grace he scarcely needed anyway and he was already away his catch clamped between his jaws spilling out to right and left the breeze carried motes of lans blood back down the road towards ron he felt them spot his face in a gentle shower declan stood in the chancel of st peters and listened for the hum it was still there sooner or later hed have to go to the source of that sound and destroy it even if it meant as it well might his own death his new master would demand it but that was par for the course and the thought of death didnt distress him far from it in the last few days hed realised ambitions that hed nurtured for years looking up at the black bulk of the monster as it rained piss on him hed found the purest joy if that experience which would once have disgusted him could be so consummate what might death be like rarer still and if he could contrive to die by rawheads hand by that wide hand that smelt so rank wouldnt that be the rarest of the rare he looked up at the altar and at the remains of the fire the police had extinguished theyd searched for him after coots death but he had a dozen hiding places they would never find and theyd soon given up bigger fish to fry he collected a fresh armful of songs of praise and threw them down amongst the damp ashes the candlesticks were warped but still recognisable the cross had disappeared either shrivelled away or removed by some lightfingered officer of the law he tore a few handfuls of hymns from the books and lit a match the old songs caught easily ron milton was tasting tears and it was a taste hed forgotten it was many years since hed wept especially in front of other males but he didnt care any longer these bastard policemen werent human anyway they just looked at him while he poured out his story and nodded like idiots weve drafted men in from every division within fifty miles mr milton said the bland face with the understanding eyes the hills are being scoured well have it whatever it is it took my child you understand me it killed him in front of me they didnt seem to appreciate the horror of it all were doing what we can its not enough this thing its not human ivanhoe with the understanding eyes knew bloody well how unhuman it was theres people coming from the ministry of defence we cant do much more til theyve had a look at the evidence he said then added as a sop its all public money sir you fucking idiot what does it matter what it costs to kill it its not human its out of hell ivanhoes look lost compassion if it came out of hell sir he said i dont think it would have found the reverend coot such easy pickings coot that was his man why hadnt he thought of that before coot ron had never been much of a man of god but he was prepared to be openminded and now that hed seen the opposition or one of its troops he was ready to reform his opinions hed believe anything anything at all if it gave him a weapon against the devil he must get to coot what about your wife the officer called after him maggie was sitting in one of the sideoffices dumb with sedation debbie asleep beside her there was nothing he could do for them they were as safe here as anywhere he must get to coot before he died hed know whatever reverends know and hed understand the pain better than these monkeys dead sons were the crux of the church after all as he got into the car it seemed for a moment he smelt his son the boy who would have carried his name the boy who was his sperm made flesh who hed had circumcised like himself the quiet child whod looked out of the car at him with such resignation in his eyes this time the tears didnt begin this time there was just an anger that was almost wonderful it was half past eleven at night rawhead rex lay under the moon in one of the harvested fields to the southwest of the nicholson farm the stubble was darkening now and there was a tantalising smell of rotting vegetable matter off the earth beside him lay his dinner ian ronald milton face up on the field his midriff torn open occasionally the beast would lean up on one elbow and paddle its fingers in the cooling soup of the boychilds body fishing for a delicacy here under the full moon bathing in silver stretching his limbs and eating the flesh of human kind he felt irresistible his fingers drew a kidney off the plate beside him and he swallowed it whole sweet coot was awake despite the sedation he knew he was dying and the time was too precious to doze through he didnt know the name of the face that was interrogating him in the yellow gloom of his room but the voice was so politely insistent he had to listen even though it interrupted his peacemaking with god besides they had questions in common and they all circled those questions on the beast that had reduced him to this pulp it took my son the man said what do you know about the thing please tell me ill believe whatever you tell me now there was desperation just explain time and again as hed lain on that hot pillow confused thoughts had raced through coots mind declans baptism the embrace of the beast the altar his hair rising and his flesh too maybe there was something he could tell the father at his bedside in the church ron leaned closer to coot he smelt of earth already the altar its afraid the altar you mean the cross its afraid of the cross nonot not the body creaked once and stopped ron watched death come over the face the saliva dry on coots lips the iris of his remaining eye contract he watched a long while before he rang for the nurse then quietly made his escape there was somebody in the church the door which had been padlocked by the police was ajar the lock smashed ron pushed it open a few inches and slid inside there were no lights on in the church the only illumination was a bonfire on the altar steps it was being tended by a young man ron had seen on and off in the village he looked up from his firewatching but kept feeding the flames the guts of books what can i do for you he asked without interest i came to ron hesitated what to tell this man the truth no there was something wrong here i asked you a frigging question said the man what do you want as he walked down the aisle towards the fire ron began to see the questioner in more detail there were stains like mud on his clothes and his eyes had sunk in their orbits as if his brain had sucked them in youve got no right to be in here i thought anyone could come into a church said ron staring at the burning pages as they blackened not tonight you get the fuck out of here ron kept walking towards the altar you get the fuck out i said the face in front of ron was alive with leers and grimaces there was lunacy in it i came to see the altar ill go when ive seen it and not before youve been talking to coot that it coot what did the old wanker tell you its all a lie whatever it was he never told the truth in his frigging life you know that you take it from he he used to get up there he threw a prayerbook at the pulpit and tell fucking lies i want to see the altar for myself well see if he was telling lies no you wont the man threw another handful of books on to the fire and stepped down to block rons path he smelt not of mud but of shit without warning he pounced his hands seized rons neck and the two of them toppled over declans fingers reaching to gouge at rons eyes his teeth snapping at his nose ron was surprised at the weakness of his own arms why hadnt he played squash the way maggie had suggested why were his muscles so ineffectual if he wasnt careful this man was going to kill him suddenly a light so bright it could have been a midnight dawn splashed through the west window a cloud of screams followed close on it firelight dwarfing the bonfire on the altar steps dyed the air the stained glass danced declan forgot his victim for an instant and ron rallied he pushed the mans chin back and got a knee under his torso then he kicked hard the enemy went reeling and ron was up and after him a fistful of hair securing the target while the ball of his other hand hammered at the lunatics face til it broke it wasnt enough to see the bastards nose bleed or to hear the cartilage mashed ron kept beating and beating until his fist bled only then did he let declan drop outside zeal was ablaze rawhead had made fires before many fires but petrol was a new weapon and he was still getting the hang of it it didnt take him long to learn the trick was to wound the wheeled boxes that was easy open their flanks and out their blood would pour blood that made his head ache the boxes were easy prey lined up on the pavement like bullocks to be slaughtered he went amongst them demented with death splashing their blood down the high street and igniting it streams of liquid fire poured into gardens over thresholds thatches caught woodbeamed cottages went up in minutes zeal was burning from end to end in st peters ron dragged the filthied cloth off the altar trying to block out all thoughts of debbie and margaret the police would move them to a place of safety for certain the issue at hand must take precedence beneath the cloth was a large box its front panel roughly carved he took no notice of the design there were more urgent matters to attend to outside the beast was loose he could hear its triumphant roars and he felt eager yes eager to go to it to kill it or be killed but first the box it contained power no doubt about that a power that was even now raising the hairs on his head that was working at has cock giving him an aching hardon his flesh seemed to seethe with it it elated him like love hungry he put his hands on the box and a shock that seemed to cook his joints ran up both his arms he fell back and for a moment he wondered if he was going to remain conscious the pain was so bad but it subsided in moments he cast around for a tool something to get him into the box without laying flesh toil in desperation he wrapped his hand with a piece of the altar cloth and snatched one of the brass candleholders from the edge of the fire the cloth began to smoulder as the heat worked its way through to his hand he stepped back to the altar and beat at the wood like a madman until it began to splinter his hands were numb now if the heated candlesticks were burning his palms he couldnt feel it what did it matter anyhow there was a weapon here a few inches away from him if only he could get to it to wield it his erection throbbed his balls tingled come to me he found himself saying come on come on come to me come to me like he was willing it into his embrace this treasure like it was a girl he wanted his hardon wanted and he was hypnotising her into his bed come to me come to me the wood facade was breaking panting now he used the corners of the candlestick base to lever larger chunks of timber away the altar was hollow as hed known it would be and empty empty except for a ball of stone the size of a small football was this his prize he couldnt believe how insignificant it looked and yet the air was still electric around him his blood still danced he reached through the hole hed made in the altar and picked the relic up outside rawhead was jubilating images flashed before rons eyes as he weighed the stone in his deadened hand a corpse with its feet burning a flaming cot a dog running along the street a living ball of fire it was all outside waiting to unfold against the perpetrator he had this stone hed trusted god just for half a day and he got shat on it was just a stone just a fucking stone he turned the football over and over in his hand trying to make some sense of its furrows and its mounds was it meant to be something perhaps was he missing its deeper significance there was a knot of noise at the other end of the church a crash a cry from beyond the door a whoosh of flame two people staggered in followed by smoke and pleas hes burning the village said a voice ron knew it was that benign policeman who hadnt believed in hell he was trying to keep his act together perhaps for the benefit of his companion mrs blatter from the hotel the nightdress shed run into the street wearing was torn her breasts were exposed they shook with her sobs she didnt seem to know she was naked didnt even know where she was christ in heaven help us said ivanhoe theres no fucking christ in here came declans voice he was standing up and reeling towards the intruders ron couldnt see his face from where he stood but he knew it must be near as damn it unrecognisable mrs blatter avoided him as he staggered towards the door and she ran towards the altar shed been married here on the very spot hed built the fire ron stared at her body entranced she was considerably overweight her breasts sagging her belly overshadowing her cunt so he doubted if she could even see it but it was for this his cockhead throbbed for this his head reeled her image was in his hand god yes she was there in his hand she was the living equivalent of what he held a woman the stone was the statue of a woman a venus grosser than mrs blatter her belly swelling with children tits like mountains cunt a valley that began at her navel and gaped to the world all this time under the cloth and the cross theyd bowed their heads to a goddess ron stepped off the altar and began to run down the aisle pushing mrs blatter the policeman and the lunatic aside dont go out said ivanhoe its right outside ron held the venus tight feeling her weight in his hands and taking security from her behind him the verger was screeching a warning to his lord yes it was a warning for sure ron kicked open the door on every side fire a flaming cot a corpse with its feet burning a dog skinned by fire hurtling past and rawhead of course silhouetted against a panorama of flames it looked round perhaps because it heard the warnings the verger was yelling but more likely he thought because it knew knew without being told that the woman had been found here ron yelled im here im here it was coming for him now with the steady gait of a victor closing in to claim its final and absolute victory doubt surged up in ron why did it come so surely to meet him not seeming to care about the weapon he carried in his hands hadnt it seen hadnt it heard the warning unless oh god in heaven unless coot had been wrong unless it was only a stone he held in his hand a useless meaningless lump of stone then a pair of hands grabbed him around the neck the lunatic a low voice spat the word tucker in his ear ron watched rawhead approaching heard the lunatic screeching now here he is fetch him kill him here he is without warning the grip slackened and ron halfturned to see ivanhoe dragging the lunatic back against the church wall the mouth in the vergers broken face continued to screech hes here here ron looked back at rawhead the beast was almost on him and he was too slow to raise the stone in selfdefence but rawhead had no intention of taking him it was declan he was smelling and hearing ivanhoe released declan as rawheads huge hands veered past ron and fumbled for the lunatic what followed was unwatchable ron couldnt bear to see the hands take declan apart but he heard the gabble of pleas become whoops of disbelieving grief when he next looked round there was nothing recognisably human on ground or wall and rawhead was coming for him now coming to do the same or worse the huge head craned round to fix on ron its maw gaping and ron saw how the fire had wounded rawhead the beast had been careless in the enthusiasm for destruction fire had caught its face and upper torso its body hair was crisped its mane was stubble and the flesh on the left hand side of its face was black and blistered the flames had roasted its eyeballs they were swimming in a gum of mucus and tears that was why it had followed declans voice and bypassed ron it could scarcely see but it must see now it must here here said ron here i am rawhead heard he looked without seeing his eyes trying to focus here im here rawhead growled in his chest his burned face pained him he wanted to be away from here away in the cool of a birchthicket moonwashed his dimmed eyes found the stone the homo sapien was nursing it like a baby it was difficult for rawhead to see clearly but he knew it ached in his mind that image it pricked him it teased him it was just a symbol of course a sign of the power not the power itself but his mind made no such distinction to him the stone was the thing he feared most the bleeding woman her gaping hole eating seed and spitting children it was life that hole that woman it was endless fecundity it terrified him rawhead stepped back his own shit running freely down his leg the fear on his face gave ron strength he pressed home his advantage closing in after the retreating beast dimly aware that ivanhoe was rallying allies around him armed figures waiting at the corners of his vision eager to bring the fireraiser down his own strength was failing him the stone lifted high above his head so rawhead could see it plainly seemed heavier by the moment go on he said quietly to the gathering zealots go on take him take him they began to close in even before he finished speaking rawhead smelt them more than saw them his hurting eyes were fixed on the woman his teeth slid from their sheaths in preparation for the attack the stench of humanity closed in around him from every direction panic overcame his superstitions for one moment and he snatched down towards ron steeling himself against the stone the attack took ron by surprise the claws sank in his scalp blood poured down over his face then the crowd closed in human hands weak white human hands were laid on rawheads body fists beat on his spine nails raked his skin he let ron go as somebody took a knife to the backs of his legs and hamstrung him the agony made him howl the sky down or so it seemed in rawheads roasted eyes the stars reeled as he fell backwards on to the road his back cracking under him they took the advantage immediately overpowering him by sheer weight of numbers he snapped off a finger here a face there but they would not be stopped now their hatred was old in their bones did they but know it he thrashed under their assaults for as long as he could but he knew death was certain there would be no resurrection this time no waiting in the earth for an age until their descendants forgot him hed be snuffed out absolutely and there would be nothingness he became quieter at the thought and looked up as best he could to where the little father was standing their eyes met as they had on the road when hed taken the boy but now rawheads look had lost its power to transfix his face was empty and sterile as the moon defeated long before ron slammed the stone down between his eyes the skull was soft it buckled inwards and a slop of brain splattered the road the king went out it was suddenly over without ceremony or celebration out once and for all there was no cry ron left the stone where it lay half buried in the face of the beast he stood up groggily and felt his head his scalp was loose his fingertips touched his skull blood came and came but there were arms to support him and nothing to fear if he slept it went unnoticed but in death rawheads bladder was emptying a stream of urine pulsed from the corpse and ran down the road the rivulet steamed in the chilling air its scummy nose sniffing left and right as it looked for a place to drain after a few feet it found the gutter and ran along it awhile to a crack in the tarmac there it drained off into the welcoming earth confessions of a shroud he had been flesh once flesh and bone and ambition but that was an age ago or so it seemed and the memory of that blessed state was fading fast some traces of his former life remained time and exhaustion couldnt take everything from him he could picture clearly and painfully the faces of those hed loved and hated they stared through at him from the past clear and luminous he could still see the sweet goodnight expressions in his childrens eyes and the same look less sweet but no less goodnight in the eyes of the brutes he had murdered some of those memories made him want to cry except that there were no tears to be wrong out of his starched eyes besides it was far too late for regret regret was a luxury reserved for the living who still had the time the breath and the energy to act he was beyond all that he his mothers little ronnie he was almost three weeks dead too late for regrets by a long chalk hed done all he could do to correct the errors hed made hed spun out his span to its limits and beyond stealing himself precious time to sew up the loose ends of his frayed existence mothers little ronnie had always been tidy a paragon of neatness that was one of the reasons hed enjoyed accountancy the pursuit of a few misplaced pence through hundreds of figures was a game he relished and how satisfying at the end of the day to balance the books unfortunately life was not so perfectible as now too late in the day he realized still hed done his best and that as mother used to say was all anybody could hope to do there was nothing left but to confess and having confessed go to his judgement emptyhanded and contrite as he sat draped over the useshined seat in the confessional box of st mary magdalenes he fretted that the shape of his usurped body would not hold out long enough for him to unburden himself of all the sins that languished in his linen heart he concentrated trying to keep body and soul together for these last vital few minutes soon father rooney would come he would sit behind the latticedivide of the confessional and offer words of consolation of understanding of forgiveness then in the remaining minutes of his stolen existence ronnie glass would tell his story he would begin by denying that most terrible stain on his character the accusation of pornographer pornographer the thought was absurd there wasnt a pornographers bone in his body anyone who had known him in his thirtytwo years would have testified to that my christ he didnt even like sex very much that was the irony of all the people to be accused of peddling filth he was about the most unlikely when it had seemed everyone about him was parading their adulteries like third legs he had lived a blameless existence the forbidden life of the body happened like car accidents to other people not to him sex was simply a rollercoaster ride that one might indulge in once every year or so twice might be tolerable three times nauseating was it any surprise then that in nine years of marriage to a good catholic girl this good catholic boy only fathered two children but hed been a loving man in his lustless way and his wife bernadette had shared his indifference to sex so his unenthusiastic member had never been a bone of contention between them and the children were a joy samantha was already growing into a model of politeness and tidiness and imogen had her mothers smile life had been fine all in all he had almost owned a featureless semidetached house in the leafier suburbs of south london he had possessed a small garden sundaytended a soul the same it had been as far as he could judge a model life unassuming and dinfree and it would have remained so had it not been for that worm of greed in his nature greed had undone him no doubt if he hadnt been greedy he wouldnt have looked twice at the job that maguire had offered him he would have trusted his instinct taken one look around the pokey smokefilled office above the hungarian pastryshop in soho and turned tail but his itch for wealth diverted him from the plain truth that he was using all his skills as an accountant to give a gloss of credibility to an operation that stank of corruption hed known that in his heart of course known that despite maguires ceaseless talk of moral rearmament his fondness for his children his obsession with the gentlemanly art of bonsai the man was a louse the lowest of the low but hed successfully shut out that knowledge and contented himself with the job in hand balancing the books maguire was generous and that made the blindness easier to induce he even began to like the man and his associates hed got used to seeing the shambling bulk that was dennis dork luzzati a fresh cream pastry perpetually hovering at his fat lips got used too to little threefingered henry b henry with his card tricks and his patter a new routine every day they werent the most sophisticated of conversationalists and they certainly wouldnt have been welcome at the tennis club but they seemed harmless enough it was a shock then a terrible shock when he eventually drew back the veil and saw dork henry and maguire for the beasts they really were the revelation had occurred by accident one night finishing some taxwork late ronnie had caught a cab down to the warehouse planning to deliver his report to maguire by hand hed never actually visited the warehouse though hed heard it mentioned between them often enough maguire had been stockpiling his supplies of books there for some months mostly cookery books from europe or so ronnie had been told that night that last night of cleanliness he walked into the truth in all its fullcolour glory maguire was there in one of the plainbrick rooms sitting on a chair surrounded by packages and boxes an unshaded bulb threw a halo on to his thinning scalp it glistened pinkly dork was there too engrossed in a cake henry b was playing patience piled high on every side of the trio there were magazines thousand upon thousand of them their covers shining virginal and somehow fleshy maguire looked up from his calculations glassy he said he always used that nickname ronnie stared into the room guessing even from a distance what these heaped treasures were come on in said henry b good for a game dont look so serious soothed maguire this is just merchandise a kind of numb horror drew ronnie to approach one of the stacks of magazines and open the top copy climax erotica the cover read full colour pornography for the discriminating adult text in english german and french unable to prevent himself he began to look through the magazine his face stinging with embarrassment only halfhearing the barrage of jokes and threats that maguire was shooting off swarms of obscene images flew out of the pages horribly abundant hed never seen anything like it in his life every sexual act possible between consenting adults were chronicled in glorious detail the performers of these unspeakable acts smiled glassyeyed at ronnie as they swarmed up out of a grease of sex neither shame nor apology on their lustpuffed faces every slit every slot every pucker and pimple of their bodies was exposed naked beyond nakedness the pouting panting excess of it turned ronnies stomach to ash he closed the magazine and glanced at another pile beside it different faces same furious coupling every depravity was catered for somewhere the titles alone testified to the delights to be found inside bizarre women in chains one read enslaved by rubber another promised labrador lover a third portrayed in perfect focus down to the last wet whisker slowly michael maguires cigaretteworn voice filtered through into ronnies reeling brain it cajoled or tried to and worse it mocked him in its subtle way for his naivetй you had to find out sooner or later he said i suppose it may as well be sooner eh no harm in it all a bit of fun ronnie shook his head violently trying to dislodge the images that had taken root behind his eyes they were multiplying already invading a territory that had been so innocent of such possibilities in his imagination labradors scampered around in leather drinking from the bodies of bound whores it was frightening the way these pictures flowed out into his eyes each page a new abomination he felt hed choke on them unless he acted horrible was all he could say horrible horrible horrible he kicked a pile of bizarre women in chains and they toppled over the repeated images of the cover sprawling across the dirty floor dont do that said maguire very quietly horrible said ronnie theyre all horrible theres a big market for them not me he said as though maguire was suggesting he had some personal interest in them all right so you dont like them he doesnt like them dork dork was wiping cream off his short fingers with a dainty handkerchief why not too dirty for him horrible said ronnie again well youre in this up to your neck my son said maguire his voice was the devils voice wasnt it surely the devils voice you may as well grin and bear it dork guffawed grin and bare it i like it mick i like it ronnie looked up at maguire the man was fortyfive maybe fifty but his face had a fretted cracked look old before its years the charm was gone it was scarcely human the face he locked eyes with its sweat its bristles its puckered mouth made it resemble in ronnies mind the proffered backside of one of the redraw sluts in the magazines were all known villains here the organ was saying and weve got nothing to lose if were caught again nothing said dork whereas you my son youre a spitclean professional way i see it if you want to go gabbing about this dirty business youre going to lose your reputation as a nice honest accountant in fact id venture to suggest youll never work again do you take my meaning ronnie wanted to hit maguire so he did hard too there was a satisfying snap as maguires teeth met at speed and blood came quickly from between his lips it was the first time ronnie had fought since his schooldays and he was slow to avoid the inevitable retaliation the blow that maguire returned sent him sprawling bloodied amongst the bizarre women before he could clamber to his feet dork had slammed his heel into ronnies face grinding the gristle in his nose while ronnie bunked back the blood dork hoisted him to his feet and held him up as a captive target for maguire the ringed hand became a fist and for the next five minutes maguire used ronnie as a punch bag starting below the belt and working up ronnie found the pain curiously reassuring it seemed to heal his guilty psyche better than a string of hail marys when the beating was over and dork had let him out defaced into the dark there wasnt any anger left in him only a need to finish the cleansing maguire had begun he went home to bernadette that night and told her a lie about being mugged in the street she was so consoling it made him sick to be deceiving her but he had no choice that night and the night after were sleepless he lay in his own bed just a few feet from that of his trusting spouse and tried to make sense of his feelings he knew in his bones the truth would sooner or later become public knowledge better surely to go to the police come clean but that took courage and his heart had never felt weaker so he prevaricated through the thursday night and the friday letting the bruises yellow and the confusion settle then on sunday the shit hit the fan the lowest of the sunday filthsheets had his face on the front cover complete with the banner headline the sex empire of ronald glass inside were photographs snatched from innocent circumstance and construed as guilt glass appearing to look pursued glass appearing to look devious his natural hirsuteness made him seem illshaven his neat haircut suggested the prison aesthetic favoured by some of the criminal fraternity being shortsighted he squinted photographed squinting he looked like a lustful rat he stood in the newsagents staring at his own face and knew his personal armageddon was on the horizon shaking he read the terrible lies inside somebody he never exactly worked out who had told the whole story the pornography the brothels the sexshops the cinemas the secret world of smut that maguire had masterminded was here detailed in every sordid particular except that maguires name did not appear neither did dorks nor henrys it was glass glass all the way his guilt was transparent he had been framed neat as anything a corrupter of children the leader called him little boy blue grown fat and horny it was too late to deny anything by the time he got back to the house bernadette had gone with the children in tow somebody had got to her with the news probably salivating down the phone delighting in the sheer dirt of it he stood in the kitchen where the table was laid for a breakfast the family hadnt yet eaten and would now never eat and he cried not a great deal his supply of tears was strictly limited but enough to feel the duty done then having finished with his gesture of remorse he sat down like any decent man who has been deeply wronged and planned murder in many ways getting the gun was more difficult than anything that followed it required some careful thought some soft words and a good deal of hard cash it took him a day and a half to locate the weapon he wanted and to learn how to use it then in his own good time he went about his business henry b died first ronnie shot him in his own stripped pinewood kitchen in upandcoming islington he had a cup of freshlybrewed coffee in his threefingered hand and a look of almost pitiable terror on his face the first shot struck him in the side denting his shirt and causing a little blood to come far less than ronnie had been steeling himself for however more confident he fired again the second shot hit his intended in the neck and that seemed to be the killer henry b pitched forward like a comedian in a silent movie not relinquishing the coffee cup until the moment before he hit the floor the cup spun in the mingled dregs of coffee and life and rattled at last to a halt ronnie stepped over to the body and fired a third shot straight through the back of henry bs neck this last bullet was almost casual swift and accurate then he escaped easily out of the back gate almost elated by the ease of the act he felt as though hed cornered and killed a rat in his cellar an unpleasant duty that needed to be done the frisson lasted five minutes then he was profoundly sick anyway that was henry all out of tricks dorks death was rather more sensational he ran out of time at the dog track indeed he was showing ronnie his winning ticket when he felt the longbladed knife insinuate itself between his fourth and fifth ribs he could scarcely believe he was being murdered the expression on his pastryfattened face was one of complete amazement he kept looking from side to side at the punters milling around as though at any moment one of them would point and laugh and tell him that this was all a joke a premature birthday game then ronnie twisted the blade in the wound and dork realised that winning ticket or not this wasnt his lucky day his heavy body was carried along in the crush of the crowd for a good ten yards until it became wedged in the teeth of the turnstile only then did someone feel the hot gush from dork and scream by then ronnie was well away content feeling cleaner by the hour he went back to the house bernadette had been in collecting clothes and favourite ornaments he wanted to say to her take everything it means nothing to me but shed slipped in and gone again like a ghost of a housewife in the kitchen the table was still set for that final sunday breakfast there was dust on the cornflakes in the childrens bowls the rancid butter was beginning to grease the air ronnie sat through the late afternoon through the dusk through until the early hours of the following morning and tasted his new found power over life and death then he went to bed in his clothes no longer caring to be tidy and slept the sleep of the almost good it wasnt so hard for maguire to guess whod wasted dork and henry b henry though the idea of that particular worm turning was hard to swallow many of the criminal community had known ronald glass had laughed with maguire over the little deception that was being played upon the innocent but noone had believed him capable of such extreme sanctions against his enemies in some seedier quarters he was now being saluted for his sheer bloodymindedness others maguire included felt he had gone too far to be welcomed into the fold like a strayed sheep the general opinion was that he be dispatched before he did any more damage to the fragile balance of power so ronnies days became numbered they could have been counted on the three fingers of henry bs hand they came for him on the saturday afternoon and took him quickly without him having time to wield a weapon in his defence they escorted him to a salami and cooked meats warehouse and in the icy white safety of the cold storage room they hung him from a hook and tortured him anyone with any claim to dorks or henry bs affections was given an opportunity to work out their grief on him with knives with hammers with oxyacetylene torches they shattered his knees and his elbows they put out his eardrums burned the flesh off the soles of his feet finally about eleven or so they began to lose interest the clubs were just getting into their rhythm the gaming tables were beginning to simmer it was time to be done with justice and get out on the town that was when micky maguire arrived dressed to kill in his best bib and tucker ronnie knew he was there somewhere in the haze but his senses were all but out and he only halfsaw the gun levelled at his head half felt the noise of the blast bounce around the whitetiled room a single bullet immaculately placed entered his brain through the middle of his forehead as neat as even he could have wished like a third eye his body twitched on its hook a moment and died maguire took his applause like a man kissed the ladies thanked his dear friends who had seen this deed done with him and went to play the body was dumped in a black plastic bag on the edge of epping forest early on sunday morning just as the dawn chorus was tuning up in the ash trees and the sycamores and that to all intents and purposes was the end of that except that it was the beginning ronnies body was found by a jogger out before seven on the following monday in the day between his being dumped and being found his corpse had already begun to deteriorate but the pathologist had seen far far worse he watched dispassionately while the two mortuary technicians stripped the body folded the clothes and placed them in tagged plastic bags he waited patiently and attentively while the wife of the deceased was ushered into his echoing domain her face ashen her eyes swelled to bursting with too many tears she looked down at her husband without love staring at the wounds and at the marks of torture quite unflinchingly the pathologist had a whole story written behind this last confrontation between sexking and untroubled wife their loveless marriage their arguments over his despicable way of life her despair his brutality and now her relief that the torment was finally over and she was released to start a new life without him the pathologist made a mental note to look up the pretty widows address she was delicious in her indifference to mutilation it made his mouth wet to think of her ronnie knew bernadette had come and gone he could sense too the other faces that popped into the mortuary just to peer down at the sexking he was an object of fascination even in death and it was a horror he hadnt predicted buzzing around in the cool coils of his brain like a tenant who refuses to be ousted by the bailiffs still seeing the world hovering around him and not being able to act upon it in the days since his death there had been no hint of escape from this condition he had sat here in his own dead skull unable to find a way out into the living world and unwilling somehow to relinquish life entirely and leave himself to heaven there was still a will to revenge in him a part of his mind unforgiving of trespasses was prepared to postpone paradise in order to finish the job he had started the books needed balancing and until michael maguire was dead ronnie could not go to his atonement in his round bone prison he watched the curious come and go and knotted up his will the pathologist did his work on ronnies corpse with all the respect of an efficient fishgutter carelessly digging the bullet out of his cranium and nosing around in the stews of smashed bone and cartilage that had formerly been his knees and elbows ronnie didnt like the man hed leered at bernadette in a highly unprofessional way and now when he was playing the professional his callousness was positively shameful oh for a voice for a fist for a body to use for a time then hed show this meatmerchant how bodies should be treated the will was not enough though it needed a focus and a means of escape the pathologist finished his report and his rough sewing flung his juiceshiny gloves and his stained instruments on to the trolley beside the swabs and the alcohol and left the body to the assistants ronnie heard the swingdoors close behind him as the man departed water was running somewhere splashing into the sink the sound irritated him standing beside the table on which he lay the two technicians discussed their shoes of all things shoes the banality of it thought ronnie the lifedecaying banality of it you know them new heels lenny the ones i got to put on my brown suedes useless no bleeding good at all im not surprised and the price i paid for them look at that just look at that worn through in a month paperthin they are lenny theyre paperthin im going to take them back i would lam i would this mindless conversation after those hours of torture of sudden death of the postmortem that hed so recently endured was almost beyond endurance ronnies spirit began to buzz round and round in his brain like an angry bee trapped in an upturned jamjar determined to get out and start stinging round and round like the conversation paperbloodythin im not surprised bloody foreign these soles made in fucking korea korea thats why theyre paperthin it was unforgivable the trudging stupidity of these people that they should live and act and be while he buzzed on and on boiling with frustration was that fair neatshot eh lenny what the stiff old whats his name the sexking bang in the middle of the forehead see that pop goes the weasel lennys companion it seemed was still preoccupied with his paperthin sole he didnt reply lenny inquisitively inched back the shroud from ronnies forehead the lines of sawn and scalped flesh were inelegantly sewn but the bullet hole itself was neat look at it the other glanced round at the dead face the headwound had been cleaned after the probing pincers had worked at it the edges were white and puckered i thought they usually went for the heart said the solesearcher this wasnt any streetfight it was an execution formal like said lenny poking his little finger into the wound its a perfect shot bang in the middle of the forehead like he had three eyes yeah the shroud was tossed back over ronnies face the bee buzzed on round and round you hear about third eyes dont you do you stella read me something about it being the centre of the body thats your navel how can your forehead be the centre of your body well thats your navel no its more your spiritual centre the other didnt deign to respond just about where this bullethole is said lenny still lost in admiration for ronnies killer the bee listened the bullethole was just one of many holes in his life holes where his wife and children should have been holes winking up at him like sightless eyes from the pages of the magazines pink and brown and hairlipped holes to the right of him holes to the left could it be at last that he had found here a hole that he could profit by why not leave by the wound his spirit braced itself and made for his brow creeping through his cortex with a mixture of trepidation and excitement ahead he could sense the exit door like the light at the end of a long tunnel beyond the hole the warp and weft of his shroud glittered like a promised land his sense of direction was good the light grew as he crept the voices became louder without fanfare ronnies spirit spat itself into the outside world a tiny seepage of soul the motes of fluid that carried his will and his consciousness were soaked up by his shroud like tears by tissues his flesh and blood body was utterly deserted now an icy bulk fit for nothing but the flames ronnie glass existed in a new world a white linen world like no state he had lived or dreamed before ronnie glass was his shroud had ronnies pathologist not been forgetful he wouldnt have come back into the mortuary at that moment trying to locate the diary hed written the widow glass number in and had he not come in he would have lived as it was havent you started on this one yet he snapped at the technicians they murmured some apology or other he was always testy at this time of night they were used to his tantrums get on with it he said stripping the shroud off the body and flinging it to the floor in irritation before the fucker walks out of here in disgust dont want to get our little hotel a bad reputation do we yes sir i mean no sir well dont stand there parcel it up theres a widow wants him dispatched as soon as possible ive seen all i need to see of him ronnie lay on the floor in a crumpled heap slowly spreading his influence through this newfound land it felt good to have a body even if it was sterile and rectangular bringing a power of will to bear he hadnt known he possessed ronnie took full control of the shroud at first it refused life it had always been passive that was its condition it wasnt use to occupation by spirits but ronnie wasnt to be beaten now his will was an imperative against all rules of natural behaviour it stretched and knotted the sullen linen into a semblance of life the shroud rose the pathologist had located his little black book and was in the act of pocketing it when this white curtain spread itself in his path stretching like a man who has just woken from a deep sleep ronnie tried to speak but the only voice he could find was a whisper of the cloth on the air too light too insubstantial to be heard over the complaints of frightened men and frightened they were despite the pathologists call for assistance none was forthcoming lenny and his companion were sliding away towards the swingdoors gaping mouths babbling entreaties to any local god who would listen the pathologist backed off against the postmortem table quite out of gods get out of my sight he said ronnie embraced him tightly help said the pathologist almost to himself but help was gone it was running down the corridors still babbling keeping its back to the miracle that was taking place in the mortuary the pathologist was alone wrapped up in this starched embrace murmuring at the last some apologies he had found beneath his pride im sorry whoever you are whatever you are im sorry but there was an anger in ronnie that would not have any truck with late converts no pardons or reprieves were available this fisheyed bastard this son of the scalpel had cut and examined his old body as though it was a side of beef it made ronnie livid to think of this creeps ohsocool appraisal of life death and bernadette the bastard would die here amongst his remains and let that be an end to his callous profession the corners of the shroud were forming into crude arms now as ronnies memory shaped them it seemed natural to recreate his old appearance in this new medium he made hands first then digits even a rudimentary thumb he was like a morbid adam raised out of linen even as they formed the hands had the pathologist about the neck as yet they had no sense of touch in them and it was difficult to judge how hard to press on the throbbing skin so he simply used all the strength he could muster the mans face blackened and his tongue the colour of a plum stuck out from his mouth like a spearhead sharp and hard in his enthusiasm ronnie broke his neck it snapped suddenly and the head fell backwards at a horrid angle the vain apologies had long since stopped ronnie dropped him to the polished floor and stared down at the hands he had made with eyes that were still two pinpricks in a sheet of stained cloth he felt certain of himself in this body and god he was strong hed broken the bastards neck without exerting himself at all occupying this strange bloodless physique he had a new freedom from the constraints of humanity he was alive suddenly to the life of the air feeling it now fill and billow him surely he could fly like a sheet in the wind or if it suited him knot himself into a fist and beat the world into submission the prospects seemed endless and yet he sensed that this possession was at best temporary sooner or later the shroud would want to resume its former life as an idle piece of cloth and its true passive nature would be restored this body had not been given to him merely loaned it was up to him to use it to the best of his vengeful abilities he knew the priorities first and foremost to find michael maguire and dispatch him then if he still had the time left he would see the children but it wasnt wise to go visiting as a flying shroud better by far to work at this illusion of humanity and see if he could sophisticate the effect hed seen what freak creases could do making faces appear in a crumpled pillow or in the folds of a jacket hanging on the back of the door more extraordinary still there was the shroud of turin in which the face and body of jesus christ had been miraculously imprinted bernadette had been sent a postcard of the shroud with every wound of lance and nail in place why couldnt he make the same miracle by force of will wasnt he resurrected too he went to the sink in the morgue and turned off the running tap then stared into the mirror to watch his will take shape the surface of the shroud was already twitching and scurrying as he demanded new forms of it at first there was only the primitive outline of his head roughly shaped like that of a snowman two pits for eyes a lumpen nose but he concentrated willing the linen to stretch itself to the limits of its elasticity and behold it worked it really worked the threads complained but acquiesced to his demands forming in exquisite reproduction the nostrils and then the eyelids the upper up now the lower he traced from memory the contours of his lost face like an adoring lover and remade them in every detail now he began to make a column for the neck filled with air but looking deceptively solid below that the shroud swelled into a manly torso the arms were already formed the legs followed quickly on and it was done he was remade in his own image the illusion was not perfect for one thing he was pure white except for the stains and his flesh had the texture of cloth the creases of his face were perhaps too severe almost cubist in appearance and it was impossible to coax the cloth to make a semblance of either hair or nails but he was as ready for the world as any living shroud could hope to be it was time to go out and meet his public your game micky maguire seldom lost at poker he was too clever and that used face too unreadable his tired bloodshot eyes never let anything out yet despite his formidable reputation as a winner he never cheated that was his bond with himself there was no lift in winning if there was a cheat involved it was just stealing then and that was for the criminal classes he was a businessman pure and simple tonight in the space of two and a half hours hed pocketed a tidy sum life was good since the deaths of dork henry b henry and glass the police had been too concerned with murder to take much notice of the lower orders of vice besides their palms were well crossed with silver they had nothing to complain about inspector wall a drinking companion of many years standing had even offered maguire protection from the lunatic killer who was apparently on the loose the irony of the idea pleased maguire mightily it was almost three am time for bad girls and boys to be in their beds dreaming of crimes for the morrow maguire rose from the table signifying the end of the nights gambling he buttoned up his waistcoat and carefully reknotted his lemon waterice silk tie another game next week he suggested the defeated players agreed they were used to losing money to their boss but there were no hard feelings amongst the quartet there was a tinge of sadness perhaps they missed henry b and dork saturday nights had been such joyous affairs now there was a muted tone over the proceedings perlgut was the first to leave stubbing out his cheroot in the brimming ashtray night mick night frank give the kids a kiss from their uncle mick eh will do perlgut shuffled off with his stuttering brother in tow ggggoodnight night ernest the brothers clattered down the stairs norton was the last to go as always shipment tomorrow he asked tomorrows sunday said maguire he never worked on sundays it was a day for the family not todays sunday said norton not trying to be pedantic just letting it come naturally tomorrows monday yes shipment monday i hope so you going to the warehouse probably ill pick you up then we can run down together fine norton was a good man humourless but reliable night then night his threeinch heels were steeltipped they sounded like a womans stilettos on the stairs the door slammed below maguire counted his profits drained his glass of cointreau and switched out the light in the gaming room the smoke was already staling tomorrow hed have to get somebody to come up and open the window let some fresh soho smells in there salami and coffee beans commerce and sleaze he loved it loved it with a passion like a babe loves a tit as he descended the stairs into the darkened sex shop he heard the exchange of farewells in the street outside followed by the slamming of car doors and the purring departure of expensive cars a good night with good friends what more could any man reasonably ask at the bottom of the stairs he stopped for a moment the blinking streetsign lights opposite illuminated the shop sufficiently for him to make out the rows of magazines their plasticbound faces glinted siliconed breasts and spanked buttocks swelled from the covers like overripe fruit faces dripping mascara pouted at him offering every lonely satisfaction paper could promise but he was unmoved the time had long since passed when he found any of that stuff of interest it was simply currency to him he was neither disgusted nor aroused by it he was a happily married man after all with a wife whose imagination barely stretched beyond page two of the kama sutra and whose children were slapped soundly if they spoke one questionable word in the corner of the shop where the bondage and domination material was displayed something rose from the floor maguire found it hard to focus in the intermittent light red blue red blue but it wasnt norton nor one of the perlguts it was a face he knew however smiling at him against the background of roped and raped magazines now he saw it was glass clear as day and despite the coloured lights white as a sheet he didnt try to reason how a dead man could be staring at him he just dropped his coat and his jaw and ran the door was locked and the key was one of two dozen on his ring oh jesus why did he have so many keys keys to the warehouse keys to the greenhouse keys to the whorehouse and only that twitching light to see them by red blue red blue he rummaged amongst the keys and by some magical chance the first he tried slotted easily in the lock and turned like a finger in hot grease the door was open the street ahead but glass glided up behind him soundlessly and before he could step over the threshold he had thrown something around maguires face a cloth of some kind it smelt of hospitals of ether or disinfectant or both magure tried to cry out but a fist of cloth was being thrust down his throat he gagged on it the vomitreflex making his system revolt in response the assassin just tightened his grip in the street opposite a girl maguire knew only as natalie was watching the struggle in the doorway of the shop with a doped look on her vapid face shed seen murder once or twice shed seen rape aplenty and she wasnt about to get involved besides it was late and the insides of her thighs ached casually she turned away down the pinklit corridor leaving the violence to take its course maguire made a mental note to have the girls face carved up one of these days if he survived which seemed less likely by the moment the red blue red blue was unfixable now as his airless brain went colourblind and though he seemed tosnatch a grip on his wouldbe assassin the hold seemed to evaporate leaving cloth empty cloth running through his sweating hands like silk then someone spoke not behind him not the voice of his assassin but in front in the street norton it was norton hed returned for some reason god love him and he was getting out of his car ten yards down the street shouting maguires name the assassins chokehold faltered and gravity claimed maguire he fell heavily the world spinning to the pavement his face purple in the lurid light norton ran towards his boss fumbling for his gun amongst the bricabrac in his pocket the whitesuited assassin was already backing off down the street unprepared to take on another man he looked thought norton for all the world like a failed member of the klu klux klan a hood a robe a cloak norton dropped to one knee took a doublehanded aim at the man and fired the result was startling the figure seemed to balloon up his body losing its shape becoming a flapping mass of white cloth with a face loosely imprinted on it there was a noise like the snapping of mondaywashed sheets on a line a sound that was out of place in this grimy backstreet nortons confusion left him responseless for a moment and the mansheet seemed to rise in the air illusory at nortons feet maguire was coming round groaning he was trying to speak but having difficulty making himself understood through his bruised larynx and throat norton bent closer to him he smelt of vomit and fear glass he seemed to be saying it was enough norton nodded said hush that was the face of course on the sheet glass the imprudent accountant hed watched the mans feet fried watched the whole vicious ritual not to his taste at all well well ronnie glass had some friends apparently friends not above revenge norton looked up but the wind had lifted the ghost above the rooftops and away that had been a bad experience the first taste of failure ronnie remembered it still the desolation of that night hed lain heaped in a ratrun corner of a derelict factory south of the river and calmed the panic in his fibres what good was this trick hed mastered if he lost control of it the instant he was threatened he must plan more carefully and wind his will up until it would brook no resistance already he sensed that his energy was ebbing and there was a hint of difficulty in restructuring his body this second time round he had no time to waste with fumbled failures he must corner the man where he could not possibly escape police investigations at the mortuary had led round in circles for half a day and now into the night inspector wall of the yard had tried every technique he knew soft words hard words promises threats seductions surprises even blows still lenny told the same story a ridiculous story he swore would be corroborated when his fellow technician came out of the catatonic state hed now taken refuge in but there was no way the inspector could take the story seriously a shroud that walked how could he put that in his report no he wanted something concrete even if it was a lie can i have a cigarette asked lenny for the umpteenth time wall shook his head hey fresco wall addressed his righthand man al kincaid i think its time you searched the lad again lenny knew what another search implied it was a euphemism for a beating up against the wall legs spread hands on head wham his stomach jumped at the thought listen he implored what lenny i didnt do it of course you did it said wall picking his nose we just want to know why didnt you like the old fucker make dirty remarks about your ladyfriends did he he had a bit of a reputation for that i understand al fresco smirked was that why you nobbled him for gods sake said lenny you think id tell you a fucking story like that if i didnt see it with my own fucking eyes language chided fresco shrouds dont fly said wall with understandable conviction then where is the shroud eh reasoned lenny you incinerated it you ate it how the fuck should i know language said lenny quietly the phone rang before fresco could hit him he picked it up spoke and handed it to wall then he hit lenny a friendly slap that drew a little blood listen said fresco breathing with lethal proximity to lenny as if to suck the air out of his mouth we know you did it see you were the only one in the morgue alive to do it see we just want to know why thats all just why fresco wall had covered the receiver as he spoke to the muscleman yes sir its mr maguire mr maguire micky maguire fresco nodded hes very upset oh yeah whys that he thinks hes been attacked by the man in the morgue the pornographer glass said lenny ronnie glass ronald glass like the man says said wall grinning at lenny thats ridiculous said fresco well i think we ought to do our duty to an upstanding member of the community dont you duck in to the morgue will you make sure make sure that the bastards still down there oh fresco exited confused but obedient lenny didnt understand any of this but he was past caring what the hell was it to him anyway he started to play with his balls through a hole in his lefthand pocket wall watched him with disdain dont do that he said you can play with yourself as much as you like once weve got you tucked up in a nice warm cell lenny shook his head slowly and removed his hand from his pocket just wasnt his day fresco was already back from down the hall a little breathless hes there he said visibly brightened by the simplicity of the task of course he is said wall dead as a dodo said fresco whats a dodo asked lenny fresco looked blank turn of phrase he said testily wall of the yard was back on the line talking to maguire the man at the other end sounded well spooked and his reassurances seemed to do little good hes all present and correct micky you must have been mistaken maguires fear ran back through the phone line like a mild electric charge i saw him damn you well hes lying down there with a hole in the middle of his head micky so tell me how can you have seen him i dont know said maguire well then listen if you get the chance drop by will you same arrangement as usual i could put some nice work your way wall didnt like talking business on the phone it made him uneasy later micky ok call by i will promise yes wall put down the receiver and stared at the suspect lenny was back to pocket billiards again crass little animal another search was clearly called for fresco said wall in dovelike tones will you please teach lenny not to play with himself in front of police officers in his fortress in richmond maguire cried like a baby hed seen glass no doubt of it whatever wall believed about the body being at the mortuary he knew otherwise glass was out on the street footloose and fancyfree despite the fact that hed blown a hole in the bastards head maguire was a godfearing man and he believed in life after death though until now hed never questioned how it would come about this was the answer this blankfaced son of a whore stinking of ether this was the way the afterlife would be it made him weep fearing to live and fearing to die it was well past dawn now a peaceful sunday morning nothing would happen to him in the safety of the ponderosa and in full daylight this was his castle built with his hardwon thievings norton was here armed to the teeth there were dogs at every gate noone living or dead would dare challenge his supremacy in this territory here amongst the portraits of his heroes louis b mayer dillinger churchill amongst his family amidst his good taste his money his objets dan here he was his own man if the mad accountant came for him hed be blasted in his tracks ghost or no ghost finis after all wasnt he michael roscoe maguire an empire builder born with nothing hed risen by virtue of his stockbrokers face and his mavericks heart once in a while maybe and only under very controlled conditions he might let his darker appetites show as at the execution of glass hed taken genuine pleasure in that little scenario his the coup de grace his the infinite compassion of the killing stroke but his life of violence was all but behind him now now he was a bourgeois secure in his fortress raquel woke at eight and busied herself with preparing breakfast you want anything to eat she asked maguire he shook his head his throat hurt too much coffee yes you want it in here he nodded he liked sitting in front of the window that overlooked the lawn and the greenhouse the day was brightening fat fleecy clouds bucked the wind their shadows passing over the perfect green maybe hed take up painting he thought like winston commit his favourite landscapes to canvas maybe a view of the garden even a nude of raquel immortalised in oils before her tits sagged beyond all hope of support she was back purring at his side with the coffee you ok she asked dumb bitch of course he wasnt ok sure he said youve got a visitor what he sat up straight in the leather chair who she was smiling at him tracy she said she wants to come in and cuddle he expelled a hiss of air from the sides of his mouth dumb dumb bitch you want to see tracy sure the little accident as he was fond of calling her was at the door still in her dressing gown hi daddy hello sweetheart she sashayed across the room towards him her mothers walk in embryo mummy says youre ill im getting better im glad so am i shall we go out today maybe see the fair maybe she pouted fetchingly perfectly in control of the effect raquels tricks all over again he just hoped to god she wasnt going to grow up as dumb as her mother well see he said hoping to imply yes but knowing he meant no she hoisted herself on to his knee and he indulged her tales of a five year olds mischiefs for a while then sent her packing talking made his throat hurt and he didnt feel too much like the loving father today alone again he watched the shadows waltz on the lawn the dogs began to bark just after eleven then after a short while they fell silent he got up to find norton who was in the kitchen doing a jigsaw with tracy the haywain in two thousand pieces one of raquels favourites you check the dogs norton no boss well fucking do it he didnt often swear in front of the child but he felt ready to go bang norton snapped to it as he opened the back door maguire could smell the day it was tempting to step outside the house but the dogs barked in a way that set his head thumping and his palms prickling tracy had her head down to the business of the jigsaw her body tense with anticipation of her fathers anger he said nothing but went straight back into the lounge from his chair he could see norton striding across the lawn the dogs werent making a sound now norton disappeared from sight behind the greenhouse a long wait maguire was just beginning to get agitated when norton appeared again and looked up at the house shrugging at maguire and speaking maguire unlocked the sliding door opened it and stepped on to the patio the day met him balmy what are you saying he called to norton the dogs are fine norton returned maguire felt his body relax of course the dogs were ok why shouldnt they bark a bit what else were they for he was damn near making a fool of himself pissing his pants just because the dogs barked he nodded to norton and stepped off the patio on to the lawn beautiful day he thought quickening his pace he crossed the lawn to the greenhouse where his carefully nurtured bonsai trees bloomed at the door of the greenhouse norton was waiting dutifully going through his pockets looking for mints you want me here sir no sure sure he said magnanimously you go back up and play with the kid norton nodded dogs are fine he said again yeah must have been the wind stirred them up there was a wind warm but strong it stirred the line of copper beeches that bounded the garden they shimmered and showed the paler undersides of their leaves to the sky their movement reassuring in its ease and gentility maguire unlocked the greenhouse and stepped into his haven here in this artificial eden were his true loves nurtured on coos and cuttlefish manure his sargents juniper that had survived the rigours of mount ishizuchi his flowering quince his yeddo spruce his favourite dwarf that hed trained after several failed attempts to cling to a stone all beauties all minor miracles of winding trunk and cascading needles worthy of his fondest attention content mindless for a while of the outside world he pottered amongst his flora the dogs had fought over possession of ronnie as though he were a plaything theyd caught him breaching the wall and surrounded him before he could make his escape grinning as they seized him tore him and spat him out he escaped only because norton had approached and distracted them from their fury for a moment his body was torn in several places after their attack confused concentrating to try and keep his shape coherent he had narrowly avoided being spotted by norton now he crept out of hiding the fight had sapped him of energy and the shroud gaped so that the illusion of substance was spoiled his belly was torn open his left leg all but severed the stains had multiplied mucus and dogshit joining the blood but the will the will was all he had come so close this was not the time to relinquish his grip and let nature take its course he existed in mutiny against nature that was his state and for the first time in his life he felt an elation to be unnatural to be in defiance of system and sanity was that so bad he was shitty bloody dead and resurrected in a piece of stained cloth he was a nonsense yet lie was noone could deny him being as long as he had the will to be the thought was delicious like finding a new sense in a blind deaf world he saw maguire in the greenhouse and watched him awhile the enemy was totally absorbed in his hobby he was even whistling the national anthem as he tended his flowering charges ronnie moved closer to the glass and closer his voice an ohsogentle moan in the failing weave maguire didnt hear the sigh of cloth on the window until ronnies face pressed flat to the glass the features smeared and misshapen he dropped the yeddo spruce it shattered on the floor its branches broken maguire tried to yell but all he could squeeze from his vocal cords was a strangled yelp he broke for the door as the face huge with greed for revenge broke the glass maguire didnt quite comprehend what happened next the way the head and the body seemed to flow through the broken pane defying physics and reassembled in his sanctum taking on the shape of a human being no it wasnt quite human it had the look of a strokevictim its white mask and its white body sagged down the right side and it dragged its torn leg after it as it lunged at him he opened the door and retreated into the garden the thing followed speaking now arms extended towards him maguire it said his name in a voice so soft he might have imagined it but no it spoke again recognise me maguire it said and of course he did even with its strokestricken billowing features it was clearly ronnie glass glass he said yes said the ghost i dont want maguire began then faltered what didnt he want to speak with this horror certainly to know that it existed that too to die most of all i dont want to die you will said the ghost maguire felt the gust of the sheet as it flew in his face or perhaps it was the wind that caught this insubstantial monster and threw it around him whichever the embrace stank of ether and disinfectant and death arms of linen tightened around him the gaping face was pressed on to his as though the thing wanted to kiss him instinctively maguire reached round his attacker and his hands found the rent the dogs had made in the shroud his fingers gripped the open edge of the cloth and he pulled he was satisfied to hear the linen tearing along its weave and the bearhug fell away from him the shroud bucked in his hand the liquefied mouth wide in a silent scream ronnie was feeling an agony he thought hed left behind him with flesh and bone but here it was again pain pain pain he fluttered away from his mutilator letting out what cry he could while maguire stumbled away up the lawn his eyes huge the man was close to madness surely his mind was as good as broken but that wasnt enough he had to kill the bastard that was his promise to himself and he intended to keep it the pain didnt disappear but he tried to ignore it putting all his energy into pursuing maguire up the garden towards the house but he was so weak now the wind almost had mastery of him gusting through his form and catching the frayed entrails of his body he looked like a wartorn flag fouled so it was scarcely recognisable and just about ready to call it a day except except maguire maguire reached the house and slammed the door the sheet pressed itself against the window flapping ludicrously its linen hands raking the glass its almostlost face demanding vengeance let me in it said i will come in maguire stumbled backwards across the room into the hall raquel where was the woman raquel raquel she wasnt in the kitchen from the den the sound of tracys singing he peered in the little girl was alone she was sitting in the middle of the floor headphones clamped over her ears singing along to some favourite song mummy he mimed at her upstairs she replied without taking off the headphones upstairs as he climbed the stairs he heard the dogs barking down the garden what was it doing what was the fucker doing raquel his voice was so quiet he could barely hear it himself it was as though hed prematurely become a ghost in his own house there was no noise on the landing he stumbled into the browntiled bathroom and snapped on the light it was flattering and he had always liked to look at himself in it the mellow radiance dulled the edge of age but now it refused to lie his face was that of an old and haunted man he flung open the airing cupboard and fumbled amongst the warm towels there a gun nestling in scented comfort hidden away for emergencies only the contact made him salivate he snatched the gun and checked it all in working order this weapon had brought glass down once and it could do it again and again and again he opened the bedroom door raquel she was sitting on the edge of the bed with norton inserted between her legs both still dressed one of raquels sumptuous breasts teased from her bra and pressed into nortons accommodating mouth she looked round dumb as ever not knowing what shed done without thinking he fired the bullet found her openmouthed gormless as ever and blew a sizeable hole in her neck norton pulled himself out no necrophiliac he and ran towards the window quite what he intended wasnt clear flight was impossible the next bullet caught norton in the middle of the back and passed through his body puncturing the window only then with her lover dead did raquel topple back across the bed her breast spattered her legs splayed wide maguire watched her fall the domestic obscenity didnt disgust him it was quite tolerable tit and blood and mouth and lost love and all it was quite quite tolerable maybe he was becoming insensitive he dropped the gun the dogs had stopped barking he slipped out of the room on to the landing closing the door quietly so as not to disturb the child mustnt disturb the child as he walked to the top of the stairs he saw his daughters winsome face staring up at him from the bottom daddy he stared at her with a puzzled expression there was someone at the door i saw them passing the window he started to walk unsteadily down the stairs one at a time slowly does it he thought i opened the door but there was nobody there wall it must be wall he would know what to do for the best was it a tall man i didnt see him properly daddy just his face he was even whiter than you the door oh jesus the door if shed left it open too late the stranger came into the hall and his face crinkled into a kind of smile which maguire thought was about the worst thing hed ever seen it wasnt wall wall was flesh and blood the visitor was a ragdoll wall was a grim man this one smiled wall was life and law and order this thing wasnt it was glass of course maguire shook his head the child not seeing the thing wavering on the air behind her misunderstood what did i do wrong she asked ronnie sailed past her up the stairs more a shadow now than anything remotely manlike shreds of cloth trailing behind him maguire had no time to resist nor will left to do so he opened his mouth to say something in defence of his life and ronnie thrust his remaining arm wound into a rope of linen down maguires throat maguire choked on it but ronnie snaked on past his protesting epiglottis forging a rough way down his oesophagus into maguires stomach maguire felt it there a fullness that was like overeating except that it squirmed in the middle of his body raking his stomach wall and catching hold of the lining it was all so quick maguire had no time to die of suffocation in the event he might have wished to go that way horrid as it would have been instead he felt ronnies hand convulse in his belly digging deeper for a decent grip on his colon on his duodenum and when the hand had all it could hold the fuckhead pulled out his arm the exit was swift but for maguire the moment would seemingly have no end he doubled up as the disembowelling began feeling his viscera surge up his throat turning him inside out his lights went out through his throat in a welter of fluids coffee blood acid ronnie pulled on the guts and hauled maguire his emptied torso collapsing on itself towards the top of the stairs led by a length of his own entrails maguire reached the top stair and pitched forward ronnie relinquished his hold and maguire fell head swathed in gut to the bottom of the stairs where his daughter still stood she seemed by her expression not the least alarmed but then ronnie knew children could deceive so easily the job completed he began to totter down the stairs uncoiling his arm and shaking his head as he tried to recover a smidgen of human appearance the effort worked by the time he reached the child at the bottom of the stairs he was able to offer her something very like a human touch she didnt respond and all he could do was leave and hope that in time shed come to forget once hed gone tracy went upstairs to find her mother raquel was unresponsive to her questions as was the man on the carpet by the window but there was something about him that fascinated her a fat red snake pressing out from his trousers it made her laugh it was such a silly little thing the girl was still laughing when wall of the yard appeared late as usual though viewing the deathdances the house had jumped to he was on the whole glad hed been a late arrival at that particular party in the confessional of st mary magdalenes the shroud of ronnie glass was now corrupted beyond recognition he had very little feeling left in him just the desire so strong he knew he couldnt resist for very much longer to let go of this wounded body it had served him well he had no complaints to make of it but now he was out of breath he could animate the inanimate no longer he wanted to confess though wanted to confess so very badly to tell the father to tell the son to tell the holy ghost what sins hed performed dreamt longed for there was only one thing for it if father rooney wouldnt come to him then hed go to father rooney he opened the door of the confessional the church was almost empty it was evening now he guessed and who had the time for the lighting of candles when there was food to be cooked love to be bought life to be had only a greek florist praying in the aisle for his sons to be acquitted saw the shroud stagger from the confessional towards the door of the vestry it looked like some damnfool adolescent with a filthy sheet slung over his head the florist hated that kind of godless behaviour look where it had got his children he wanted to beat the kid around a bit and teach him not to play silly beggars in the house of the lord hey you he said too loudly the shroud turned to look at the florist its eyes like two holes pressed in warm dough the face of the ghost was so woebegone it froze the words on the florists lips ronnie tried the handle of the vestry door the rattling got him nowhere the door was locked from inside a breathless voice said who is it it was father rooney speaking ronnie tried to reply but no words would come all he could do was rattle like any worthy ghost who is it asked the good father again a little impatiently confess me ronnie wanted to say confess me for i have sinned the door stayed shut inside father rooney was busy he was taking photographs for his private collection his subject a favourite lady of his by the name of natalie a daughter of vice somebody had told him but he couldnt believe that she was too obliging too cherubic and she wound a rosary around her pert bosom as though she was barely out of a convent the jiggling of the handle had stopped now good thought father rooney theyd come back whoever they were nothing was that urgent father rooney grinned at the woman natalies lips pouted back in the church ronnie hauled himself to the altar and genuflected three rows back the florist rose from his prayers incensed by this desecration the boy was obviously drunk the way he was reeling the man wasnt about to be frightened by a tuppennycoloured deathmask cursing the desecrator in ripe greek he snatched at the ghost as it knelt in front of the altar there was nothing under the sheet nothing at all the florist felt the living cloth twitch in his hand and dropped it with a tiny cry then he backed off down the aisle crossing himself back and forth back and forth like a demented widow a few yards from the door of the church he turned tail and ran the shroud lay where the florist had dropped it ronnie lingering in the creases looked up from the crumpled heap at the splendour of the altar it was radiant even in the gloom of the candlelit interior and moved by its beauty he was content to put the illusion behind him unconfessed but unfearful of judgment his spirit crept away after an hour or so father rooney unbolted the vestry escorted the chaste natalie out of the church and locked the front door he peered into the confessional on his way back to check for hiding children empty the entire church was empty st mary magdalene was a forgotten woman as he meandered whistling back to the vestry he caught sight of ronnie glass shroud it lay sprawled on the altar steps a forlorn pile of shabby cloth ideal he thought picking it up there were some indiscreet stains on the vestry floor just the job to wipe them up he sniffed the cloth he loved to sniff it smelt of a thousand things ether sweat dogs entrails blood disinfectant empty rooms broken hearts flowers and loss fascinating this was the thrill of the parish of soho he thought something new every day mysteries on the doorstep on the altarstep crimes so numerous they would need an ocean of holy water to wash them out vice for sale on every corner if you knew where to look he tucked the shroud under his arm i bet youve got a tale to tell he said snuffing out the votive candles with fingers too hot to feel the flame scapegoats it wasnt a real island the tide had carried us on to it was a lifeless mound of stones calling a hunchbacked shitpile like this an island is flattery islands are oases in the sea green and abundant this is a forsaken place no seals in the water around it no birds in the air above it i can think of no use for a place like this except that you could say of it i saw the heart of nothing and survived its not on any of the charts said ray poring over the map of the inner hebrides his nail at the spot where hed calculated that we should be it was as hed said an empty space on the map just pale blue sea without the merest speck to sign the existence of this rock it wasnt just the seals and the birds that ignored it then the chartmakers had too there were one or two arrows in the vicinity of rays finger marking the currents that should have been taking us north tiny red darts on a paper ocean the rest like the world outside was deserted jonathan was jubilant of course once he discovered that the place wasnt even to be found on the map he seemed to feel instantly exonerated the blame for our being here wasnt his any longer it was the mapmakers he wasnt going to be held responsible for our being beached if the mound wasnt even marked on the charts the apologetic expression hed worn since our unscheduled arrival was replaced with a look of selfsatisfaction you cant avoid a place that doesnt exist can you he crowed i mean can you you could have used the eyes god gave you ray flung back at him but jonathan wasnt about to be cowed by reasonable criticism it was so sudden raymond he said i mean in this mist i didnt have a chance it was on top of us before i knew it it had been sudden no two ways about that id been in the galley preparing breakfast which had become my responsibility since neither angela nor jonathan showed any enthusiasm for the task when the hull of the emmanuelle grated on shingle then ploughed her way juddering up on to the stony beach there was a moments silence then the shouting began i climbed up out of the galley to find jonathan standing on deck grinning sheepishly and waving his arms around to semaphore his innocence before you ask he said i dont know how it happened one minute we were just coasting along oh jesus christ allfucking mighty ray was clambering out of the cabin hauling a pair of jeans on as he did so and looking much the worse for a night in a bunk with angela id had the questionable honour of listening to her orgasms all night she was certainly demanding jonathan began his defencespeech again from the beginning before you ask but ray silenced him with a few choice insults i retreated into the confines of the galley while the argument raged on deck it gave me no small satisfaction to hear jonathan slanged i even hoped ray would lose his cool enough to bloody that perfect hook nose the galley was a slop bucket the breakfast id been preparing was all over the floor and i left it there the yolks of the eggs the gammon and the french toasts all congealing in pools of spilt fat it was jonathans fault let him clear it up i poured myself a glass of grapefruit juice waited until the recriminations died down and went back up it was barely two hours after dawn and the mist that had shrouded this island from jonathans view still covered the sun if today was anything like the week that wed had so far by noon the deck would be too hot to step on barefoot but now with the mist still thick i felt cold wearing just the bottom of my bikini it didnt matter much sailing amongst the islands what you wore there was no one to see you id got the best all over tan id ever had but this morning the chill drove me back below to find a sweater there was no wind the cold was coming up out of the sea its still night down there i thought just a few yards off the beach limitless night i pulled on a sweater and went back on deck the maps were out and ray was bending over them his bare back was peeling from an excess of sun and i could see the bald patch he tried to hide in his dirtyyellow curls jonathan was staring at the beach and stroking his nose christ what a place i said he glanced at me trying a smile he had this illusion poor jonathan that his face could charm a tortoise out of its shell and to be fair to him there were a few women who melted if he so much as looked at them i wasnt one of them and it irritated him id always thought his jewish good looks too bland to be beautiful my indifference was a red rag to him a voice sleepy and pouting drifted up from below deck our lady of the bunk was awake at last time to make her late entrance coyly wrapping a towel around her nakedness as she emerged her face was puffed up with too much red wine and her hair needed a comb through it still she turned on the radiance eyes wide shirley temple with cleavage whats happening ray where are we ray didnt look up from his computations which earned him a frown weve got a bloody awful navigator thats all he said i dont even know what happened jonathan protested clearly hoping for a show of sympathy from angela none was forthcoming but where are we she asked again good morning angela i said i too was ignored is it an island she said of course its an island i just dont know which one yet ray replied perhaps its barra she suggested ray pulled a face were nowhere near barra he said if youll just let me retrace our steps retrace our steps in the sea just rays jesus fixation i thought looking back at the beach it was impossible to guess how big the place was the mist erased the landscape after a hundred yards perhaps somewhere in that grey wall there was human habitation ray having located the blank spot on the map where we were supposedly stranded climbed down on to the beach and took a critical look at the bow more to be out of angelas way than anything else i climbed down to join him the round stones of the beach were cold and slippery on the bare soles of my feet ray smoothed his palm down the side of the emmanuelle almost a caress then crouched to look at the damage to the bow i dont think were holed he said but i cant be sure well float off come high tide said jonathan posing on the bow hands on hips no sweat he winked at me no sweat at all will we shit float off ray snapped take a look for yourself then well get some help to haul us off jonathans confidence was unscathed and you can damn well fetch someone you asshole sure why not give it an hour or so for the fog to shift and ill take a walk find some help he sauntered away ill put on some coffee angela volunteered knowing her thatd take an hour to brew there was time for a stroll i started along the beach dont go too far love ray called no love he said easy word he meant nothing by it the sun was warmer now and as i walked i stripped off the sweater my bare breasts were already brown as two nuts and i thought about as big still you cant have everything at least id got two neurons in my head to rub together which was more than could be said for angela she had tits like melons and a brain thatd shame a mule the sun still wasnt getting through the mist properly it was filtering down on the island fitfully and its light flattened everything out draining the place of colour or weight reducing the sea and the rocks and the rubbish on the beach to one bleachedout grey the colour of overboiled meat after only a hundred yards something about the place began to depress me so i turned back on my right tiny lisping waves crept up to the shore and collapsed with a weary slopping sound on the stones no majestic rollers here just the rhythmical slop slop slop of an exhausted tide i hated the place already back at the boat ray was trying the radio but for some reason all he could get was a blanket of white noise on every frequency he cursed it awhile then gave up after half an hour breakfast was served though we had to make do with sardines tinned mushrooms and the remains of the french toast angela served this feast with her usual aplomb looking as though she was performing a second miracle with loaves and fishes it was all but impossible to enjoy the food anyway the air seemed to drain all the taste away funny isnt it began jonathan hilarious said ray theres no foghorns mist but no horns not even the sound of a motor weird he was right total silence wrapped us up a damp and smothering hush except for the apologetic slop of the waves and the sound of our voices we might as well have been deaf i sat at the stern and looked into the empty sea it was still grey but the sun was beginning to strike other colours in it now a sombre green and deeper a hint of bluepurple below the boat i could see strands of kelp and maidens hair toys to the tide swaying it looked inviting and anything was better than the sour atmosphere on the emmanuelle im going for a swim i said i wouldnt love ray replied why not the current that threw us up here must be pretty strong you dont want to get caught in it but the tides still coming in id only be swept back to the beach you dont know what crosscurrents there are out there whirlpools even theyre quite common suck you down in a flash i looked out to sea again it looked harmless enough but then id read that these were treacherous waters and thought better of it angela had started a little sulking session because nobody had finished her immaculately prepared breakfast ray was playing up to it he loved babying her letting her play damn stupid games it made me sick i went below to do the washingup tossing the slops out of the porthole into the sea they didnt sink immediately they floated in an oily patch halfeaten mushrooms and slivers of sardines bobbing around on the surface as though someone had thrown up on the sea food for crabs if any selfrespecting crab condescended to live here jonathan joined me in the galley obviously still feeling a little foolish despite the bravado he stood in the doorway trying to catch my eye while i pumped up some cold water into the bowl and halfheartedly rinsed the greasy plastic plates all he wanted was to be told i didnt think this was his fault and yes of course he was a kosher adonis i said nothing do you mind if i lend a hand he said theres not really room for two i told him trying not to sound too dismissive he flinched nevertheless this whole episode had punctured his selfesteem more badly than id realized despite his strutting around look i said gently why dont you go back on deck take in the sun before it gets too hot i feel like a shit he said it was an accident an utter shit like you said well float off with the tide he moved out of the doorway and down into the galley his proximity made me feel almost claustrophobic his body was too large for the space too tanned too assertive i said there wasnt any room jonathan he put his hand on the back of my neck and instead of shrugging it off i let it stay there gently massaging the muscles i wanted to tell him to leave me alone but the lassitude of the place seemed to have got into my system his other hand was palmdown on my belly moving up to my breast i was indifferent to these ministrations if he wanted this he could have it above deck angela was gasping in the middle of a gigglingfit almost choking on her hysteria i could see her in my minds eye throwing back her head shaking her hair loose jonathan had unbuttoned his shorts and had let them drop the gift of his foreskin to god had been neatly made his erection was so hygienic in its enthusiasm it seemed incapable of the least harm i let his mouth stick to mine let his tongue explore my gums insistent as a dentists finger he slid my bikini down far enough to get access fumbled to position himself then pressed in behind him the stair creaked and i looked over his shoulder in time to glimpse ray bending at the hatch and staring down at jonathans buttocks and at the tangle of our arms did he see i wondered that i felt nothing did he understand that i did this dispassionately and could only have felt a twinge of desire if i substituted his head his back his cock for jonathans soundlessly he withdrew from the stairway a moment passed in which jonathan said he loved me then i heard angelas laughter begin again as ray described what hed just witnessed let the bitch think whatever she pleased i didnt care jonathan was still working at me with deliberate but uninspired strokes a frown on his face like that of a schoolboy trying to solve some impossible equation discharge came without warning signalled only by a tightening of his hold on my shoulders and a deepening of his frown his thrusts slowed and stopped his eyes found mine for a flustered moment i wanted to kiss him but hed lost all interest he withdrew still hard wincing im always sensitive when ive come he murmured hauling his shorts up was it good for you i nodded it was laughable the whole thing was laughable stuck in the middle of nowhere with this little boy of twentysix and angela and a man who didnt care if i lived or died but then perhaps neither did i i thought for no reason of the slops on the sea bobbing around waiting for the next wave to catch them jonathan had already retreated up the stairs i boiled up some coffee standing staring out of the porthole and feeling his come dry to a corrugated pearliness on the inside of my thigh ray and angela had gone by the time id brewed the coffee off for a walk on the island apparently looking for help jonathan was sitting in my place at the stern gazing out at the mist more to break the silence than anything i said i think its lifted a bit has it i put a mug of black coffee beside him thanks where are the others exploring he looked round at me confusion in his eyes i still feel like a shit i noticed the bottle of gin on the deck beside him bit early for drinking isnt it want some its not even eleven who cares he pointed out to sea follow my finger he said i leaned over his shoulder and did as he asked no youre not looking at the right place follow my finger see it nothing at the edge of the mist it appears and disappears there again i did see something in the water twenty or thirty yards from the emmanuelles stern browncoloured wrinkled turning over its a seal i said i dont think so the suns warming up the sea theyre probably coming in to bask in the shallows it doesnt look like a seal it rolls in a funny way maybe a piece of flotsam could be he swigged deeply from the bottle leave some for tonight yes mother we sat in silence for a few minutes just the waves on the beach slop slop slop once in a while the seal or whatever it was broke surface rolled and disappeared again another hour i thought and the tide will begin to turn float us off this little afterthought of creation hey angelas voice from a distance hey you guys you guys she called us jonathan stood up hand up to his face against the glare of sunlit rock it was much brighter now and getting hotter all the time shes waving to us he said disinterested let her wave you guys she screeched her arms waving jonathan cupped his hands around his mouth and bawled a reply whatdoyouwant come and see she replied she wants us to come and see i heard come on he said nothing to lose i didnt want to move but he hauled me up by the arm it wasnt worth arguing his breath was inflammable it was difficult making our way up the beach the stones were not wet with seawater but covered in a slick film of greygreen algae like sweat on a skull jonathan was having even more difficulty getting across the beach than i was twice he lost his balance and fell heavily on his backside cursing the seat of his shorts was soon a filthy olive colour and there was a tear where his buttocks showed i was no ballerina but i managed to make it step by slow step trying to avoid the large rocks so that if i slipped i wouldnt have far to fall every few yards wed have to negotiate a line of stinking seaweed i was able to jump them with reasonable elegance but jonathan pissed and uncertain of his balance ploughed through them his naked feet completely buried in the stuff it wasnt just kelp there was the usual detritus washed up on any beach the broken bottles the rusting coke cans the scumstained cork globs of tar fragments of crabs paleyellow durex and crawling over these stinking piles of dross were inchlong fateyed blue flies hundreds of them clambering over the shit and over each other buzzing to be alive and alive to be buzzing it was the first life wed seen i was doing my best not to fall flat on my face as i stepped across one of these lines of seaweed when a little avalanche of pebbles began off to my left three four five stones were skipping over each other towards the sea and setting another dozen stones moving as they jumped there was no visible cause for the effect jonathan didnt even bother to look up he was having too much trouble staying vertical the avalanche stopped run out of energy then another this time between us and the sea skipping stones bigger this time than the last and gaining more height as they leapt the sequence was longer than before it knocked stone into stone until a few pebbles actually reached the sea at the end of the dance plop dead noise plop plop ray appeared from behind one of the big boulders at the height of the beach beaming like a loon theres life on mars he yelled and ducked back the way hed come a few more perilous moments and we reached him the sweat sticking our hair to our foreheads like caps jonathan looked a little sick whats the big deal he demanded look what weve found said ray and led the way beyond the boulders the first shock once we got to the height of the beach we were looking down on to the other side of the island there was more of the same drab beach and then sea no inhabitants no boats no sign of human existence the whole place couldnt have been more than half a mile across barely the back of a whale but there was some life here that was the second shock in the sheltering ring of the large bald boulders which crowned the island was a fencedin compound the posts were rotting in the salt air but a tangle of rusted barbedwire had been wound around and between them to form a primitive pen inside the pen there was a patch of coarse grass and on this pitiful lawn stood three sheep and angela she was standing in the penal colony stroking one of the inmates and cooing in its blank face sheep she said triumphantly jonathan was there before me with his snapped remark so what well its strange isnt it said ray three sheep in the middle of a little place like this they dont look well to me said angela she was right the animals were the worse for their exposure to the elements their eyes were gummy with matter and their fleeces hung off their hides in knotted clumps exposing panting flanks one of them had collapsed against the barbedwire and seemed unable to right itself again either too depleted or too sick its cruel said angela i had to agree it seemed positively sadistic locking up these creatures without more than a few blades of grass to chew on and a battered tin bath of stagnant water to quench their thirst odd isnt is said ray ive cut my foot jonathan was squatting on the top of one of the flatter boulders peering at the underside of his right foot theres glass on the beach i said exchanging a vacant stare with one of the sheep theyre so deadpan said ray natures straight men curiously they didnt look so unhappy with their condition their stares were philosophical their eyes said im just a sheep i dont expect you to like me care for me preserve me except for your stomachs sake there were no angry baas no stamping of a frustrated hoof just three grey sheep waiting to die ray had lost interest in the business he was wandering back down the beach kicking a can ahead of him it rattled and skipped reminding me of the stones we should let them free said angela i ignored her what was freedom in a place like this she persisted dont you think we should no theyll die somebody put them here for a reason but theyll die theyll die on the beach if we let them out theres no food for them well feed them french toast and gin suggested jonathan picking a sliver of glass from his sole we cant just leave them its not our business i said it was all getting boring three sheep who cared if they lived or id thought that about myself an hour earlier we had something in common the sheep and i my head was aching theyll die whined angela for the third time youre a stupid bitch jonathan told her the remark was made without malice he said it calmly as a statement of plain fact i couldnt help grinning what she looked as though shed been bitten stupid bitch he said again bitch angela flushed with anger and embarrassment and turned on him you got us stuck here she said lip curling the inevitable accusation tears in her eyes stung by his words i did it deliberately he said spitting on his fingers and rubbing saliva into the cut i wanted to see if we could leave you here youre drunk and youre stupid but ill be sober in the morning the old lines still made their mark outstripped angela started down the beach after ray trying to hold back her tears until she was out of sight i almost felt some sympathy for her she was when it came down to verbal fisticuffs easy meat youre a bastard when you want to be i told jonathan he just looked at me glassyeyed better be friends then i wont be a bastard to you you dont scare me i know the mutton was staring at me again i stared back fucking sheep he said they cant help it if they had any decency theyd slit their ugly fucking throats im going back to the boat ugly fuckers coming he took hold of my hand fast tight and held it in his hand like hed never let go eyes on me suddenly dont go its too hot up here stay the stones nice and warm lie down they wont interrupt us this time you knew i said you mean ray of course i knew i thought we put on quite a little performance he drew me close hand over hand up my arm like he was hauling in a rope the smell of him brought back the galley his frown his muttered profession the quiet retreat deja vu still what was there to do on a day like this but go round in the same dreary circle like the sheep in the pen round and round breathe sex eat shit the gin had gone to his groin he tried his best but he hadnt got a hope it was like trying to thread spaghetti exasperated he rolled off me fuck fuck fuck senseless word once it was repeated it had lost all its meaning like everything else signifying nothing it doesnt matter i said fuck off it really doesnt he didnt look at me just stared down at his cock if hed had a knife in his hand at that moment i think hed have cut it off and laid it on the warm rock a shrine to sterility i left him studying himself and walked back to the emmanuelle something odd struck me as i went something i hadnt noticed before the blue flies instead of jumping ahead of me as i approached just let themselves be trodden on positively lethargic or suicidal they sat on the hot stones and popped under my soles their gaudy little lives going out like so many lights the mist was disappearing at last and as the air warmed up the island unveiled its next disgusting trick the smell the fragrance was as wholesome as a roomful of rotting peaches thick and sickly it came in through the pores as well as the nostrils like a syrup and under the sweetness something else rather less pleasant than peaches fresh or rotten a smell like an open drain clogged with old meat like the gutters of a slaughterhouse caked with suet and black blood it was the seaweed i assumed although id never smelt anything to match the stench on any other beach i was halfway back to the emmanuelle holding my nose as i stepped over the bands of rotting weed when i heard the noise of a little murder behind me jonathans whoops of satanic glee almost drowned the pathetic voice of the sheep as it was killed but i knew instinctively what the drunken bastard had done i turned back my heel pivoting on the slime it was almost certainly too late to save one of the beasts but maybe i could prevent him massacring the other two i couldnt see the pen it was hidden behind the boulders but i could hear jonathans triumphant yells and the thud thud of his strokes i knew what id see before it came into sight the greygreen lawn had turned red jonathan was in the pen with the sheep the two survivors were charging back and forth in a rhythmical trot of panic baaing in terror while jonathan stood over the third sheep erect now the victim had partially collapsed its sticklike front legs buckled beneath it its back legs rigid with approaching death its bulk shuddered with nervous spasms and its eyes showed more white than brown the top of its skull had been almost entirely dashed to pieces and the grey hash of its brain exposed punctured by shards of its own bone and pulped by the large round stone that jonathan was still wielding even as i watched he brought the weapon down once more onto the sheeps brainpan globs of tissue flew off in every direction speckling me with hot matter and blood jonathan looked like some nightmare lunatic his naked body so recently white was stained as a butchers apron after a hard days hammering at the abattoir his face was more sheeps gore than jonathan the animal itself was dead its pathetic complaints had ceased completely it keeled over rather comically like a cartoon character one of its ears snagging the wire jonathan watched it fall his face a grin under the blood oh that grin it served so many purposes wasnt that the same smile he charmed women with the same grin that spoke lechery and love now at last it was put to its true purpose the gawping smile of the satisfied savage standing over his prey with a stone in one hand and his manhood in the other then slowly the smile decayed as his senses returned jesus he said and from his abdomen a wave of revulsion climbed up his body i could see it quite clearly the way his gut rolled as a throb of nausea threw his head forward pitching halfdigested gin and toast over the grass i didnt move i didnt want to comfort him calm him console him he was simply beyond my help i turned away frankie he said through a throat of bile i couldnt bring myself to look at him there was nothing to be done for the sheep it was dead and gone all i wanted to do was run away from that little ring of stones and put the sight out of my head frankie i began to walk as fast as i was able over such tricky terrain back down towards the beach and the relative sanity of the emmanuelle the smell was stronger now coming up out of the ground towards my face in filthy waves horrible island vile stinking insane island all i thought was hate as i stumbled across the weed and the filth the emmanuelle wasnt far off then a little pattering of pebbles like before i stopped balancing uneasily on the sleek dome of a stone and looked to my left where even now one of the pebbles was rolling to a halt as it stopped another larger pebble fully six inches across seemed to move spontaneously from its resting place and roll down the beach striking its neighbours and beginning another exodus towards the sea i frowned the frown made my head buzz was there some sort of animal a crab maybe under the beach moving the stones or was it the heat that in some way twitched them into life again a bigger stone i walked on while behind the rattle and patter continued one little sequence coming close upon another to make an almost seamless percussion i began without real focus or explanation to be afraid angela and ray were sunning themselves on the deck of the emmanuelle another couple of hours before we can start to get the bitch off her backside he said squinting as he looked up at me i thought he meant angela at first then realised he was talking about floating the boat out to sea again may as well get some sun he smiled wanly at me yeah angela was either asleep or ignoring me whichever it suited me fine i slumped down on the sundeck at rays feet and let the sun soak into me the specks of blood had dried on my skin like tiny scabs i picked them off idly and listened to the noise of the stones and the slop of the sea behind me pages were being turned i glanced round ray never able to lie still for very long was flicking through a library book on the hebrides hed brought from home i looked back at the sun my mother always said it burned a hole in the back of your eye to look straight into the sun but it was hot and alive up there i wanted to look into its face there was a chill in me i dont know where it had come from a chill in my gut and in between my legs that wouldnt go away maybe i would have to burn it away by looking at the sun some way along the beach i glimpsed jonathan tiptoeing down towards the sea from that distance the mixture of blood and white skin made him look like some piebald freak hed stripped off his shorts and he was crouching at the seas edge to wash off the sheep then rays voice very quietly oh god he said in such an understated way that i knew the news couldnt be brilliant what is it ive found out where we are good no not good why whats wrong i sat upright turning to him its here in the book theres a paragraph on this place angela opened one eye well she said its not just an island its a burial mound the chill in between my legs fed upon itself and grew gross the sun wasnt hot enough to warm me that deep where i should be hottest i looked away from ray along the beach again jonathan was still washing splashing water up on to his chest the shadows of the stones suddenly seemed very black and heavy their edges pressed down on the upturned faces of seeing me looking his way jonathan waved can it be there are corpses under those stones buried face up to the sun like holidaymakers laid out on a blackpool beach the world is monochrome sun and shadow the white tops of stones and their black underbellies life on top death underneath burial said angela what sort of burial war dead ray answered angela what you mean vikings or something world war world war soldiers from torpedoed troopships sailors washed up brought down here by the gulf stream apparently the current funnels them through the straits and washes them up on the beaches of the islands around here washes them up said angela thats what it says not any longer though im sure the occasional fisherman gets buried here still ray replied jonathan had stood up staring out to sea the blood off his body his hand shaded his eyes as he looked out over the blue grey water and i followed his gaze as i had followed his finger a hundred yards out that seal or whale or whatever it was had returned lolling in the water sometimes as it turned it threw up a fin like a swimmers arm beckoning how many people were buried asked angela nonchalantly she seemed completely unperturbed by the fact that we were sitting on a grave hundreds probably hundreds it just says many dead in the book and do they put them in coffins how should i know what else could it be this godforsaken mound but a cemetery i looked at the island with new eyes as though id just recognised it for what it was now i had a reason to despise its humpy back its sordid beach the smell of peaches i wonder if they buried them all over mused angela or just at the top of the hill where we found the sheep probably just at the top out of the way of the water yes theyd probably had too much of water their poor green faces picked by fish their uniforms rotted their dogtags encrusted with algae what deaths and worse what journeys after death in squads of fellow corpses along the gulf stream to this bleak landfall i saw them in my minds eye the bodies of the soldiers subject to every whim of the tide borne backwards and forwards in a slush of rollers until a casual limb snagged on a rock and the sea lost possession of them with each receding wave uncovered sodden and jellied brine spat out by the sea to stink a while and be stripped by gulls i had a sudden morbid desire to walk on the beach again armed with this knowledge kicking over the pebbles in the hope of turning up a bone or two as the thought formed my body made the decision for me i was standing i was climbing off the emmanuelle where are you off to said angela jonathan i murmured and set foot on the mound the stench was clearer now that was the accrued odour of the dead maybe drowned men got buried here still as ray had suggested slotted under the pile of stones the unwary yachtsman the careless swimmer their faces wiped off with water at the feet the beach flies were less sluggish than theyd been instead of waiting to be killed they jumped and buzzed ahead of my steps with a new enthusiasm for life jonathan was not to be seen his shorts were still on the stones at the waters edge but hed disappeared i looked out to sea nothing no bobbing head no lolling beckoning something i called his name my voice seemed to excite the files they rose in seething clouds jonathan didnt reply i began to walk along the margin of the sea my feet sometimes caught by an idle wave as often as not left untouched i realised i hadnt told angela and ray about the dead sheep maybe that was a secret between us four jonathan myself and the two survivors in the pen then i saw him a few yards ahead his chest white wide and clean every speck of blood washed off a secret it is then i thought where have you been i called to him walking it off he called back what off too much gin he grinned i returned the smile spontaneously hed said he loved me in the galley that counted for something behind him a rattle of skipping stones he was no more than ten yards from me now shamelessly naked as he walked his gait was sober the rattle of stones suddenly seemed rhythmical it was no longer a random series of notes as one pebble struck another it was a beat a sequence of repeated sounds a ticktap pulse no accident intention not chance purpose not stone thought behind stone with stone carrying stone jonathan now close was bright his skin was almost luminous with sun on it thrown into relief by the darkness behind him wait what darkness the stone mounted the air like a bird defying gravity a blank black stone disengaged from the earth it was the size of a baby a whistling baby and it grew behind jonathans head as it shimmered down the air towards him the beach had been flexing its muscles tossing small pebbles down to the sea all the time strengthening its will to raise this boulder off the ground and fling it at jonathan it swelled behind him murderous in its intention but my throat had no sound to make worthy of my fright was he deaf his grin broke open again he thought the horror on my face was a jibe at his nakedness i realized he doesnt understand the stone sheered off the top of his head from the middle of his nose upwards leaving his mouth still wide his tongue rooted in blood and flinging the rest of his beauty towards me in a cloud of wet red dust the upper part of his head was spilt on to the face of the stone its expression intact as it swooped towards me i half fell and it screamed past me veering off towards the sea once over the water the assassin seemed to lose its will somehow and faltered in the air before plunging into the waves at my feet blood a trail that led to where jonathans body lay the open edge of his head towards me its machinery plain for the sky to see i was still not screaming though for sanitys sake i had to unleash the terror suffocating me somebody must hear me hold me take me away and explain to me before the skipping pebbles found their rhythm again or worse before the minds below the beach unsatisfied with murder by proxy rolled away their grave stones and rose to kiss me themselves but the scream would not come all i could hear was the patter of stones to my right and left they intend to kill us all for invading their sacred ground stoned to death like heretics then a voice for christs sake a mans voice but not rays he seemed to have appeared from out of thin air a short broad man standing at the seas edge in one hand a bucket and under his arm a bundle of coarselycut hay food for the sheep i thought through a jumble of halfformed words food for sheep he stared at me then down at jonathans body his old eyes wild whats gone on he said the gaelic accent was thick in the name of christ whats gone on i shook my head it seemed loose on my neck almost as though i might shake it off maybe i pointed to the sheeppen maybe not whatever the reason he seemed to know what i was thinking and began to climb the beach towards the crown of the island dropping bucket and bundle as he went halfblind with confusion i followed but before i could reach the boulders he was out of their shadow again his face suddenly shining with panic who did that jonathan i replied i cast a hand towards the corpse not daring to look back at him the man cursed in gaelic and stumbled out of the shelter of the boulders what have you done he yelled at me my christ what have you done killing their gifts just sheep i said in my head the instant of jonathans decapitation was playing over and over again a loop of slaughter they demand it dont you see or they rise who rise i said knowing seeing the stones shift all of them put away without grief or mourning but theyve got the sea in them in their heads i knew what he was talking about it was quite plain to me suddenly the dead were here as we knew under the stones but they had the rhythm of the sea in them and they wouldnt lie down so to placate them these sheep were tethered in a pen to be offered up to their wills did the dead eat mutton no it wasnt food they wanted it was the gesture of recognition as simple as that drowned he was saying all drowned then the familiar patter began again the drumming of stones which grew without warning into an earsplitting thunder as though the entire beach was shifting and under the cacophony three other sounds splashing screaming and wholesale destruction i turned to see a wave of stones rising into the air on the other side of the island again the terrible screams wrung from a body that was being buffeted and broken they were after the emmanuelle after ray i started to run in the direction of the boat the beach rippling beneath my feet behind me i could hear the boots of the sheepfeeder on the stones as we ran the noise of the assault became louder stones danced in the air like fat birds blocking the sun before plunging down to strike at some unseen target maybe the boat maybe flesh itself angelas tormented screams had ceased i rounded the beachhead a few steps ahead of the sheepfeeder and the emmanuelle came into sight it and its human contents were beyond all hope of salvation the vessel was being bombarded by endless ranks of stones all sizes and shapes its hull was smashed its windows mast and deck shattered angela lay sprawled on the remains of the sun deck quite obviously dead the fury of the hail hadnt stopped however the stones beat a tattoo on the remaining structure of the hull and thrashed at the lifeless bulk of angelas body making it bob up and down as though a current were being passed through it ray was nowhere to be seen i screamed then and for a moment it seemed there was a lull in the thunder a brief respite in the attack then it began again wave after wave of pebbles and rocks rising off the beach and flinging themselves at their senseless targets they would not be content it seemed until the emmanuelle was reduced to flotsam and jetsam and angelas body was in small enough pieces to accommodate a shrimps palate the sheepfeeder took hold of my arm in a grip so fierce it stopped the blood flowing to my hand come on he said i heard his voice but did nothing i was waiting for rays face to appear or to hear his voice calling my name but there was nothing just the barrage of the stones he was dead in the ruins of the boat somewhere smashed to smithereens the sheepfeeder was dragging me now and i was following him back over the beach the boat he was saying we can get away in my boat the idea of escape seemed ludicrous the island had us on its back we were its objects utterly but i followed slipping and sliding over the sweaty rocks ploughing through the tangle of seaweed back the way wed come on the other side of the island was his poor hope of life a rowing boat dragged up on the shingle an inconsequential walnut shell of a boat would we go to sea in that like the three men in a sieve he dragged me unresisting towards our deliverance with every step i became more certain that the beach would suddenly rise up and stone us to death maybe make a wall of itself a tower even when we were within a single step of safety it could play any game it liked any game at all but then maybe the dead didnt like games games are about gambles and the dead had already lost maybe the dead act only with the arid certainty of mathematicians he half threw me into the boat and began to push it out into the thick tide no walls of stones rose to prevent our escape no towers appeared no slaughtering hail even the attack on the emmanuelle had ceased had they sated themselves on three victims er was it that the presence of the sheepfeeder an innocent a servant of these wilful dead would protect me from their tantrums the rowingboat was off the shingle we bobbed a little on the backs of a few limp waves until we were deep enough for the oars and then we were pulling away from the shore and my saviour was sitting opposite me rowing for all he was worth a dew of fresh sweat on his forehead multiplying with every pull the beach receded we were being set free the sheepfeeder seemed to relax a little he gazed down at the swill of dirty water in the bottom of the boat and drew in half a dozen deep breaths then he looked up at me his wasted face drained of expression one day it had to happen he said his voice low and heavy somebody would spoil the way we lived break the rhythm it was almost soporific the hauling of the oars forward and back i wanted to sleep to wrap myself up in the tarpaulin i was sitting on and forget behind us the beach was a distant line i couldnt see the emmanuelle where are we going i said back to tiree he replied well see whats to be done there find some way to make amends to help them sleep soundly again do they eat the sheep what good is food to the dead no no they have no need of mutton they take the beasts as a gesture of remembrance remembrance i nodded its our way of mourning them he stopped rowing too heartsick to finish his explanation and too exhausted to do anything but let the tide carry us home a blank moment passed then the scratching a mousenoise no more a scrabbling at the underside of the boat like a mans nails tickling the planks to be let in not one man many the sound of their entreaties multiplied the soft dragging of rotted cuticles across the wood in the boat we didnt move we didnt speak we didnt believe even as we heard the worst we didnt believe the worst a splash off to starboard i turned and he was coming towards me rigid in the water borne up by unseen puppeteers like a figurehead it was ray his body covered in killing bruises and cuts stoned to death then brought like a gleeful mascot like proof of power to spook us it was almost as though he were walking on water his feet just hidden by the swell his arms hanging loosely by his side as he was hauled towards the boat i looked at his face lacerated and broken one eye almost closed the other smashed from its orbit two yards from the boat the puppeteers let him sink back into the sea where he disappeared in a swirl of pink water your companion said the sheepfeeder i nodded he must have fallen into the sea from the stern of the emmanuelle now he was like them a drowned man theyd already claimed him as their plaything so they did like games after all they hauled him from the beach like children come to fetch a playmate eager that he should join the horseplay the scratching had stopped rays body had disappeared altogether not a murmur off the pristine sea just the slop of the waves against the boards of the boat i pulled at the oars row i screamed at the sheepfeeder row or theyll kill us he seemed resigned to whatever they had in mind to punish us with he shook his head and spat onto the water beneath his floating phlegm something moved in the deep pale forms rolled and somersaulted too far down to be clearly seen even as i watched they came floating up towards us their seacorrupted faces better defined with every fathom they rose their arms outstretched to embrace us a shoal of corpses the dead in dozens crabcleaned and fishpicked their remaining flesh scarcely sitting on their bones the boat rocked gently as their hands reached up to touch it the look of resignation on the sheepfeeders face didnt falter for a moment as the boat was shaken backwards and forwards at first gently then so violently we were beaten about like dolls they meant to capsize us and there was no help for it a moment later the boat tipped over the water was icy far colder than id anticipated and it took the breath away id always been a fairly strong swimmer my strokes were confident as i began to swim from the boat cleaving through the white water the sheepfeeder was less lucky like many men who live with the sea he apparently couldnt swim without issuing a cry or a prayer he sank like a stone what did i hope that four was enough that i could be left to thumb a current to safety whatever hopes of escape i had they were shortlived i felt a soft oh so very soft brushing of my ankles and my feet almost a caress something broke surface briefly close to my head i glimpsed a grey back as of a large fish the touch on my ankle had become a grasp a pulpy hand mushed by so long in the water had hold of me and inexorably began to claim me for the sea i gulped what i knew to be my last breath of air and as i did so rays head bobbed no more than a yard from me i saw his wounds in clinical detail the water cleansed cuts were ugly flaps of white tissue with a gleam of bone at their core the loose eye had been washed away by now his hair flattened to his skull no longer disguised the bald patch at his crown the water closed over my head my eyes were open and i saw my hardearned breath flashing past my face in a display of silver bubbles ray was beside me consoling attentive his arms floated over his head as though he were surrendering the pressure of the water distorted his face puffing his cheeks out and spilling threads of severed nerves from his empty eyesocket like the tentacles of a tiny squid i let it happen i opened my mouth and felt it fill with cold water salt burned my sinuses the cold stabbed behind my eyes i felt the brine burning down my throat a rush of eager water where water shouldnt go flushing air from my rubes and cavities til my system was overwhelmed below me two corpses their hair swaying loosely in the current hugged my legs their heads lolled and danced on rotted ropes of neckmuscle and though i pawed at their hands and their flesh came off the bone in grey laceedged pieces their loving grip didnt falter they wanted me oh how dearly they wanted me ray was holding me too wrapping me up pressing his face to mine there was no purpose in the gesture i suppose he didnt know or feel or love or care and i losing my life with every second succumbing to the sea absolutely couldnt take pleasure in the intimacy that id longed for too late for love the sunlight was already a memory was it that the world was going out darkening towards the edges as i died or that we were now so deep the sun couldnt penetrate so far panic and terror had left me my heart seemed not to beat at all my breath didnt come and go in anguished bursts as it had a kind of peace was on me now the grip of my companions relaxed and the gentle tide had its way with me a rape of the body a ravaging of skin and muscle gut eye sinus tongue brain time had no place here the days may have passed into weeks i couldnt know the keels of boats glided over and maybe we looked up from our rockhovels on occasion and watched them pass a ringed finger was trailed in the water a splashless puddle clove the sky a fishing line trailed a worm signs of life maybe the same hour as i died or maybe a year later the current sniffs me out of my rock and has some mercy i am twitched from amongst the seaanemones and given to the tide ray is with me his time too has come the seachange has occurred there is no turning back for us relentlessly the tide bears us sometimes floating bloated decks for gulls sometimes halfsunk and nibbled by fish bears us towards the island we know the surge of the shingle and hear without ears the rattle of the stones the sea has long since washed the plate clean of its leavings angela the emmanuelle and jonathan are gone only we drowned belong here face up under the stones soothed by the rhythm of tiny waves and the absurd incomprehension of sheep human remains some trades are best practised by daylight some by night gavin was a professional in the latter category in midwinter in midsummer leaning against a wall or poised in a doorway a firefly cigarette hovering at his lips he sold what sweated in his jeans to all comers sometimes to visiting widows with more money than love whod hire him for a weekend of illicit meetings sour insistent kisses and perhaps if they could forget their dead partners a dry hump on a lavenderscented bed sometimes to lost husbands hungry for their own sex and desperate for an hour of coupling with a boy who wouldnt ask their name gavin didnt much care which it was indifference was a trademark of his even a part of his attraction and it made leaving him when the deed was done and the money exchanged so much simpler to say ciao or be seeing you or nothing at all to a face that scarcely cared if you lived or died that was an easy thing and for gavin the profession was not unpalatable as professions went one night out of four it even offered him a grain of physical pleasure at worst it was a sexual abattoir all steaming skins and lifeless eyes but hed got used to that over the years it was all profit it kept him in good shoes by day he slept mostly hollowing out a warm furrow in the bed and mummifying himself in his sheets head wrapped up in a tangle of arms to keep out the light about three or so hed get up shave and shower then spend half an hour in front of the mirror inspecting himself he was meticulously selfcritical never allowing his weight to fluctuate more than a pound or two to either side of his selfelected ideal careful to feed his skin if it was dry or swab it if it was oily hunting for any pimple that might flaw his cheek strict watch was kept for the smallest sign of venereal disease the only type of lovesickness he ever suffered the occasional dose of crabs was easily dispatched but gonorrhoea which hed caught twice would keep him out of service for three weeks and that was bad for business so he policed his body obsessively hurrying to the clinic at the merest sign of a rash it seldom happened uninvited crabs aside there was little to do in that halfhour of selfappraisal but admire the collision of genes that had made him he was wonderful people told him that all the time wonderful the face oh the face they would say holding him tight as if they could steal a piece of his glamour of course there were other beauties available through the agencies even on the streets if you knew where to search but most of the hustlers gavin knew had faces that seemed beside his unmade faces that looked like the first workings of a sculptor rather than the finished article unrefined experimental whereas he was made entire all that could be done had been it was just a question of preserving the perfection inspection over gavin would dress maybe regard himself for another five minutes then take the packaged wares out to sell he worked the street less and less these days it was chancy there was always the law to avoid and the occasional psycho with an urge to clean up sodom if he was feeling really lazy he could pick up a client through the escort agency but they always creamed off a fat portion of the fee he had regulars of course clients who booked his favours month after month a widow from fort lauderdale always hired him for a few days on her annual trip to europe another woman whose face hed seen once in a glossy magazine called him now and then wanting only to dine with him and confide her marital problems there was a man gavin called rover after his car who would buy him once every few weeks for a night of kisses and confessions but on nights without a booked client he was out on his own finding a spec and hustling it was a craft he had off perfectly nobody else working the street had caught the vocabulary of invitation better the subtle blend of encouragement and detachment of putto and wanton the particular shift of weight from left foot to right that presented the groin at the best angle so never too blatant never whorish just casually promising he prided himself that there was seldom more than a few minutes between tricks and never as much as an hour if he made his play with his usual accuracy eyeing the right disgruntled wife the right regretful husband hed have them feed him bed him and bid him a satisfied goodnight all before the last tube had run on the metropolitan line to hammersmith the years of halfhour assignations three blow jobs and a fuck in one evening were over for one thing he simply didnt have the hunger for it any longer for another he was preparing for his career to change course in the coming years from street hustler to gigolo from gigolo to kept boy from kept boy to husband one of these days he knew it hed marry one of the widows maybe the matron from florida shed told him how she could picture him spread out beside her pool in fort lauderdale and it was a fantasy he kept warm for her perhaps he hadnt got there yet but hed turn the trick of it sooner or later the problem was that these rich blooms needed a lot of tending and the pity of it was that so many of them perished before they came to fruit still this year oh yes this year for certain it had to be this year something good was coming with the autumn he knew it for sure meanwhile he watched the lines deepen around his wonderful mouth and calculated the odds against him in the race between time and opportunity it was ninefifteen at night september th and it was chilly even in the foyer of the imperial hotel no indian summer to bless the streets this year autumn had london in its jaws and was shaking the city bare the chill had got to his tooth his wretched crumbling tooth if hed gone to the dentists instead of turning over in his bed and sleeping another hour he wouldnt be feeling this discomfort well too late now hed go tomorrow plenty of time tomorrow no need for an appointment hed just smile at the receptionist shed melt and tell him she could find a slot for him somewhere hed smile again shed blush and hed see the dentist then and there instead of waiting two weeks like the poor nerds who didnt have wonderful faces for tonight hed just have to put up with it all he needed was one lousy punter a husband whod pay through the nose for taking it in the mouth then he could retire to an allnight club in soho and content himself with reflections as long as he didnt find himself with a confessionfreak on his hands he could spit his stuff and be done by half ten but tonight wasnt his night there was a new face on the reception desk of the imperial a thin shotat face with a mismatched rug perched on his pate and hed been squinting at gavin for almost half an hour the usual receptionist madox was a closetcase gavin had seen prowling the bars once or twice an easy touch if you could handle that kind madox was putty in gavins hand hed even bought his company for an hour a couple of months back hed got a cheap rate too that was good politics but this new man was straight and vicious and he was on to gavins game idly gavin sauntered across to the cigarette machine his walk catching the beat of the muzack as he trod the maroon carpet lousy fucking night the receptionist was waiting for him as he turned from the machine packet of winston in hand excuse me sir it was a practised pronunciation that was clearly not natural gavin looked sweetly back at him yes are you actually a resident at this hotel sir actually if not the management would be obliged if youd vacate the premises immediately im waiting for somebody oh the receptionist didnt believe a word of it well just give me the name no need give me the name the man insisted and ill gladly check to see if your contact is in the hotel the bastard was going to try and push it which narrowed the options either gavin could choose to play it cool and leave the foyer or play the outraged customer and stare the other man down he chose more to be bloodyminded than because it was good tactics to do the latter you dont have any right he began to bluster but the receptionist wasnt moved look sonny he said i know what youre up to so dont try and get snotty with me or ill fetch the police hed lost control of his elocution it was getting further south of the river with every syllable weve got a nice clientele here and they dont want no truck with the likes of you see fucker said gavin very quietly well thats one up from a cocksucker isnt it touchй now sonny you want to mince out of here under your own steam or be carried out in cuffs by the boys in blue gavin played his last card wheres mr madox i want to see mr madox he knows me im sure he does the receptionist snorted im bloody sure he does he was dismissed for improper conduct the artificial accent was reestablishing itself so i wouldnt try dropping his name here if i were you ok on your way upper hand well and truly secured the receptionist stood back like a matador and gestured for the bull to go by the management thanks you for your patronage please dont call again game set and match to the man with the rug what the hell there were other hotels other foyers other receptionists he didnt have to take all this shit as gavin pushed the door open he threw a smiling be seeing you over his shoulder perhaps that would make the tick sweat a little one of these nights when he was walking home and he heard a young mans step on the street behind him it was a petty satisfaction but it was something the door swung closed sealing the warmth in and gavin out it was colder substantially colder than it had been when hed stepped into the foyer a thin drizzle had begun which threatened to worsen as he hurried down park lane towards south kensington there were a couple of hotels on the high street he could hole up in for a while if nothing came of that hed admit defeat the traffic surged around hyde park corner speeding to knightsbridge or victoria purposeful shining he pictured himself standing on the concrete island between the two contrary streams of cars his fingertips thrust into his jeans solitary forlorn a wave of unhappiness came up from some buried place in him he was twentyfour and five months he had hustled on and off and on again since he was seventeen promising himself that hed find a marriageable widow or a legitimate occupation before he was twentyfive but time passed and nothing came of his ambitions he just lost momentum and gained another line beneath the eye and the traffic still came in shining streams lights signalling this imperative or that cars full of people with ladders to climb and snakes to wrestle their passage isolating him from the bank from safety with its hunger for destination he was not what hed dreamed hed be or promised his secret self and youth was yesterday where was he to go now the flat would feel like a prison tonight even if he smoked a little dope to take the edge off the room he wanted no he needed to be with somebody tonight just to see his beauty through somebody elses eyes be told how perfect his proportions were be wined and dined and flattered stupid even if it was by quasimodos richer uglier brother tonight he needed a fix of affection the pickup was so damned easy it almost made him forget the episode in the foyer of the imperial a guy of fiftyfive or so wellheeled gucci shoes a very classy overcoat in a word quality gavin was standing in the doorway of a tiny arthouse cinema looking over the times of the truffaut movie they were showing when he became aware of the punter staring at him he glanced at the guy to be certain there was a pickup in the offing the direct look seemed to unnerve the punter he moved on then he seemed to change his mind muttered something to himself and retraced his steps showing patently false interest in the movie schedule obviously not too familiar with this game gavin thought a novice casually gavin took out a winston and lit it the flare of the match in his cupped hands glossing his cheekbones golden hed done it a thousand times as often as not in the mirror for his own pleasure he had the glance up from the tiny fire off pat it always did the trick this time when he met the nervous eyes of the punter the other didnt back away he drew on the cigarette flicking out the match and letting it drop he hadnt made a pickup like this in several months but he was well satisfied that he still had the knack the faultless recognition of a potential client the implicit offer in eyes and lips that could be construed as innocent friendliness if hed made an error this was no error however this was the genuine article the mans eyes were glued to gavin so enamoured of him he seemed to be hurting with it his mouth was open as though the words of introduction had failed him not much of a face but far from ugly tanned too often and too quickly maybe hed lived abroad he was assuming the man was english his prevarication suggested it against habit gavin made the opening move you like french movies the punter seemed to deflate with relief that the silence between them had been broken yes he said you going in the man pulled a face i i dont think i will bit cold yes it is bit cold for standing around i mean ohyes the punter took the bait maybe youd like a drink gavin smiled sure why not my flats not far sure i was getting a bit cheesed off you know at home i know the feeling now the other man smiled you are gavin the man offered his leathergloved hand very formal businesslike the grip as they shook was strong no trace of his earlier hesitation remaining im kenneth he said ken reynolds ken shall we get out of the cold suits me im only a short walk from here a wave of musty centrallyheated air hit them as reynolds opened the door of his apartment climbing the three flights of stairs had snatched gavins breath but reynolds wasnt slowed at all health freak maybe occupation something in the city the handshake the leather gloves maybe civil service come in come in there was money here underfoot the pile of the carpet was lush hushing their steps as they entered the hallway was almost bare a calendar hung on the wall a small table with telephone a heap of directories a coatstand its warmer in here reynolds was shrugging off his coat and hanging it up his gloves remained on as he led gavin a few yards down the hallway and into a large room lets have your jacket he said oh sure gavin took off his jacket and reynolds slipped out into the hall with it when he came in again he was working off his gloves a slick of sweat made it a difficult job the guy was still nervous even on his home ground usually they started to calm down once they were safe behind locked doors not this one he was a catalogue of fidgets can i get you a drink yeah that would be good whats your poison vodka surely anything with it just a drop of water purist eh gavin didnt quite understand the remark yeah he said man after my own heart will you give me a moment ill just fetch some ice no problem reynolds dropped the gloves on a chair by the door and left gavin to the room it like the hallway was almost stiflingly warm but there was nothing homely or welcoming about it whatever his profession reynolds was a collector the room was dominated by displays of antiquities mounted on the walls and lined up on shelves there was very little furniture and what there was seemed odd battered tubular frame chairs had no place in an apartment this expensive maybe the man was a university don or a museum governor something academic this was no stockbrokers living room gavin knew nothing about art and even less about history so the displays meant very little to him but he went to have a closer look just to show willing the guy was bound to ask him what he thought of the stuff the shelves were deadly dull bits and pieces of pottery and sculpture nothing in its entirety just fragments on some of the shards there remained a glimpse of design though age had almost washed the colours out some of the sculpture was recognisably human part of a torso or foot a face that was all but eaten away no longer male or female gavin stifled a yawn the heat the exhibits and the thought of sex made him lethargic he turned his dulled attention to the wallhung pieces they were more impressive then the stuff on the shelves but they were still far from complete he couldnt see why anyone would want to look at such broken things what was the fascination the stone reliefs mounted on the wall were pitted and eroded so that the skins of the figures looked leprous and the latin inscriptions were almost wiped out there was nothing beautiful about them too spoiled for beauty they made him feel dirty somehow as though their condition was contagious only one of the exhibits struck him as interesting a tombstone or what looked to him to be a tombstone which was larger than the other reliefs and in slightly better condition a man on a horse carrying a sword loomed over his headless enemy under the picture a few words in latin the front legs of the horse had been broken off and the pillars that bounded the design were badly defaced by age otherwise the image made sense there was even a trace of personality in the crudely made face a long nose a wide mouth an individual gavin reached to touch the inscription but withdrew his ringers as he heard reynolds enter no please touch it said his host its there to take pleasure in touch away now that hed been invited to touch the thing the desire had melted away he felt embarrassed caught in the act go on reynolds insisted gavin touched the carving cold stone gritty under his fingertips its roman said reynolds tombstone yes found near newcastle who was he his name was flavinus he was a regimental standardbearer what gavin had assumed to be a sword was on closer inspection a standard it ended in an almost erased motif maybe a bee a flower a wheel you an archaeologist then thats part of my business i research sites occasionally oversee digs but most of the time i restore artefacts like these roman britains my personal obsession he put down the glasses he was carrying and crossed to the potteryladen shelves this is stuff ive collected over the years ive never quite got over the thrill of handling objects that havent seen the light of day for centuries its like plugging into history you know what i mean yeah reynolds picked a fragment of pottery off the shelf of course all the best finds are claimed by the major collections but if ones canny one manages to keep a few pieces back they were an incredible influence the romans civil engineers roadlayers bridge builders reynolds gave a sudden laugh at his burst of enthusiasm oh hell he said reynolds is lecturing again sorry i get carried away replacing the potteryshard in its niche on the shelf he returned to the glasses and started pouring drinks with his back to gavin he managed to say are you expensive gavin hesitated the mans nervousness was catching and the sudden tilt of the conversation from the romans to the price of a blowjob took some adjustment it depends he flannelled ah said the other still busying himself with the glasses you mean what is the precise nature of my er requirement yeah of course he turned and handed gavin a healthysized glass of vodka no ice i wont be demanding of you he said i dont come cheap im sure you dont reynolds tried a smile but it wouldnt stick to his face and im prepared to pay you well will you be able to stay the night do you want me to reynolds frowned into his glass i suppose i do then yes the hosts mood seemed to change suddenly indecision was replaced by a spun of conviction cheers he said clinking his whiskyfilled glass against gavins to love and life and anything else thats worth paying for the doubleedged remark didnt escape gavin the guy was obviously tied up in knots about what he was doing ill drink to that said gavin and took a gulp of the vodka the drinks came fast after that and just about his third vodka gavin began to feel mellower than hed felt in a hell of a long time content to listen to reynolds talk of excavations and the glories of rome with only one ear his mind was drifting an easy feeling obviously he was going to be here for the night or at least until the early hours of the morning so why not drink the punters vodka and enjoy the experience for what it offered later probably much later to judge by the way the guy was rambling thered be some drinkslurred sex in a darkened room and that would be that hed had customers like this before they were lonely perhaps between lovers and usually simple to please it wasnt sex this guy was buying it was company another body to share his space awhile easy money and then the noise at first gavin thought the beating sound was in his head until reynolds stood up a twitch at his mouth the air of wellbeing had disappeared whats that asked gavin also getting up dizzy with drink its all right reynolds palms were pressing him down into his chair stay here the sound intensified a drummer in an oven beating as he burned please please stay here a moment its just somebody upstairs reynolds was lying the racket wasnt coming from upstairs it was from somewhere else in the flat a rhythmical thumping that speeded up and slowed and speeded again help yourself to a drink said reynolds at the door face flushed damn neighbours the summons for that was surely what it was was already subsiding a moment only reynolds promised and closed the door behind him gavin had experienced bad scenes before tricks whose lovers appeared at inappropriate moments guys who wanted to beat him up for a price one who got bitten by guilt in a hotel room and smashed the place to smithereens these things happened but reynolds was different nothing about him said weird at the back of his mind at the very back gavin was quietly reminding himself that the other guys hadnt seemed bad at the beginning ah hell he put the doubts away if he started to get the jitters every time he went with a new face hed soon stop working altogether somewhere along the line he had to trust to luck and his instinct and his instinct told him that this punter was not given to throwing fits taking a quick swipe from his glass he refilled it and waited the noise had stopped altogether and it became increasingly easier to rearrange the facts maybe it had been an upstairs neighbour after all certainly there was no sound of reynolds moving around in the flat his attention wandered around the room looking for something to occupy it awhile and came back to the tombstone on the wall flavinus the standardbearer there was something satisfying about the idea of having your likeness however crude carved in stone and put up on the spot where your bones lay even if some historian was going to separate bones and stone in the fullness of time gavins father had insisted on burial rather than cremation how else hed always said was he going to be remembered whod ever go to an urn in a wall and cry the irony was that nobody ever went to his grave either gavin had been perhaps twice in the years since his fathers death a plain stone bearing a name a date and a platitude he couldnt even remember the year his father died people remembered flavinus though people whod never known him or a life like his knew him now gavin stood up and touched the standardbearers name the crudely chased flavinvs that was the second word of the inscription suddenly the noise again more frenzied than ever gavin turned away from the tombstone and looked at the door halfexpecting reynolds to be standing there with a word of explanation nobody appeared damn it the noise continued a tattoo somebody somewhere was very angry and this time there could be no selfdeception the drummer was here on this floor a few yards away curiosity nibbled gavin a coaxing lover he drained his glass and went out into the hall the noise stopped as he closed the door behind him ken he ventured the word seemed to die at his lips the hallway was in darkness except for a wash of light from the far end perhaps an open door gavin found a switch to his right but it didnt work ken he said again this time the enquiry met with a response a moan and the sound of a body rolling or being rolled over had reynolds had an accident jesus he could be lying incapacitated within spitting distance from where gavin stood he must help why were his feet so reluctant to move he had the tingling in his balls that always came with nervous anticipation it reminded him of childhood hideandseek the thrill of the chase it was almost pleasurable and pleasure apart could he really leave now without knowing what had become of the punter he had to go down the corridor the first door was ajar he pushed it open and the room beyond was a booklined bedroomstudy street lights through the curtainless window fell on a jumbled desk no reynolds no thrasher more confident now hed made the first move gavin explored further down the hallway the next door the kitchen was also open there was no light from inside gavins hands had begun to sweat he thought of reynolds trying to pull his gloves off though they stuck to his palm what had he been afraid of it was more than the pickup there was somebody else in the apartment somebody with a violent temper gavins stomach turned as his eyes found the smeared handprint on the door it was blood he pushed the door but it wouldnt open any further there was something behind it he slid through the available space and into the kitchen an unemptied waste bin or a neglected vegetable rack fouled the air gavin smoothed the wall with his palm to find the light switch and the fluorescent tube spasmed into life reynolds gucci shoes poked out from behind the door gavin pushed it to and reynolds rolled out of his hiding place hed obviously crawled behind the door to take refuge there was something of the beaten animal in his tucked up body when gavin touched him he shuddered its all right its me gavin prised a bloody hand from reynolds face there was a deep gouge running from his temple to his chin and another parallel with it but not as deep across the middle of his forehead and his nose as though hed been raked by a two pronged fork reynolds opened his eyes it took him a second only to focus on gavin before he said go away youre hurt jesus sake go away quickly ive changed my mind you understand ill fetch the police the man practically spat get the fucking hell out of here will you fucking bumboy gavin stood up trying to make sense out of all this the guy was in pain it made him aggressive ignore the insults and fetch something to cover the wound that was it cover the wound and then leave him to his own devices if he didnt want the police that was his business probably he didnt want to explain the presence of a prettyboy in his hothouse just let me get you a bandage gavin went back into the hallway behind the kitchen door reynolds said dont but the bumboy didnt hear him it wouldnt have made much difference if he had gavin liked disobedience dont was an invitation reynolds put his back to the kitchen door and tried to edge his way upright using the doorhandle as purchase but his head was spinning a carousel of horrors round and round each horse uglier than the last his legs doubled up under him and he fell down like the senile fool he was damn damn damn gavin heard reynolds fall but he was too busy arming himself to hurry back into the kitchen if the intruder whod attacked reynolds was still in the flat he wanted to be ready to defend himself he rummaged through the reports on the desk in the study and alighted on a paper knife which was lying beside a pile of unopened correspondence thanking god for it he snatched it up it was light and the blade was thin and brittle but properly placed it could surely kill happier now he went back into the hall and took a moment to work out his tactics the first thing was to locate the bathroom hopefully there hed find a bandage for reynolds even a clean towel would help maybe then he could get some sense out of the guy even coax him into an explanation beyond the kitchen the hallway made a sharp left gavin turned the corner and dead ahead the door was ajar a light burned inside water shone on tiles the bathroom clamping his left hand over the right hand that held the knife gavin approached the door the muscles of his arms had become rigid with fear would that improve his strike if it was required he wondered he felt inept graceless slightly stupid there was blood on the doorjamb a palmprint that was clearly reynolds this was where it had happened reynolds had thrown out a hand to support himself as he reeled back from his assailant if the attacker was still in the flat he must be here there was nowhere else for him to hide later if there was a later hed probably analyse this situation and call himself a fool for kicking the door open for encouraging this confrontation but even as he contemplated the idiocy of the action he was performing it and the door was swinging open across tiles strewn with waterblood puddles and any moment thered be a figure there hookhanded screaming defiance no not at all the assailant wasnt here and if he wasnt here he wasnt in the flat gavin exhaled long and slow the knife sagged in his hand denied its pricking now despite the sweat the terror he was disappointed life had let him down again snuck his destiny out of the back door and left him with a mop in his hand not a medal all he could do was play nurse to the old man and go on his way the bathroom was decorated in shades of lime the blood and tiles clashed the translucent shower curtain sporting stylised fish and seaweed was partially drawn it looked like the scene of a movie murder not quite real blood too bright light too flat gavin dropped the knife in the sink and opened the mirrored cabinet it was wellstocked with mouthwashes vitamin supplements and abandoned toothpaste tubes but the only medication was a tin of elastoplasts as he closed the cabinet door he met his own features in the mirror a drained face he turned on the cold tap full and lowered his head to the sink a splash of water would clear away the vodka and put some colour in his cheeks as he cupped the water to his face something made a noise behind him he stood up his heart knocking against his ribs and turned off the tap water dripped off his chin and his eyelashes and gurgled down the waste pipe the knife was still in the sink a handslength away the sound was coming from the bath from in the bath the inoffensive slosh of water alarm had triggered flows of adrenalin and his senses distilled the air with new precision the sharp scent of lemon soap the brilliance of the turquoise angelfish flitting through lavender kelp on the shower curtain the cold droplets on his face the warmth behind his eyes all sudden experiences details his mind had passed over til now too lazy to see and smell and feel to the limits of its reach youre living in the real world his head said and if youre not very careful youre going to die there why hadnt he looked in the bath asshole why not the bath whos there he asked hoping against hope that reynolds had an otter that was taking a quiet swim ridiculous hope there was blood here for christs sake he turned from the mirror as the lapping subsided do it do it and slid back the shower curtain on its plastic hooks in his haste to unveil the mystery hed left the knife in the sink too late now the turquoise angels concertinaed and he was looking down into the water it was deep coming up to within an inch or two of the top of the bath and murky a brown scum spiralled on the surface and the smell off it was faintly animal like the wet fur of a dog nothing broke the surface of the water gavin peered in trying to work out the form at the bottom his reflection floating amid the scum he bent closer unable to puzzle out the relation of shapes in the silt until he recognised the crudelyformed fingers of a hand and he realised he was looking at a human form curled up into itself like a foetus lying absolutely still in the filthy water he passed his hand over the surface to clear away the muck his reflection shattered and the occupant of the bath came clear it was a statue carved in the shape of a sleeping figure only its head instead of being tucked up tight was cranked round to stare up out of the blur of sediment towards the surface its eyes were painted open two crude blobs on a roughly carved face its mouth was a slash its ears ridiculous handles on its bald head it was naked its anatomy no better realised than its features the work of an apprentice sculptor in places the paint had been corrupted perhaps by the soaking and was lifting off the torso in grey globular strands underneath a core of dark wood was uncovered there was nothing to be frightened of here an objet dart in a bath immersed in water to remove a crass paintjob the lapping hed heard behind him had been some bubbles rising from the thing caused by a chemical reaction there the fright was explained nothing to panic over keep beating my heart as the barman at the ambassador used to say when a new beauty appeared on the scene gavin smiled at the irony this was no adonis forget you ever saw it reynolds was at the door the bleeding had stopped staunched by an unsavoury rag of a handkerchief pressed to the side of his face the light of the tiles made his skin bilious his pallor would have shamed a corpse are you all right you dont look it ill be fine just go please what happened i slipped water on the floor i slipped thats all but the noise gavin was looking back into the bath something about the statue fascinated him maybe its nakedness and that second strip it was slowly performing underwater the ultimate strip off with the skin neighbours thats all what is this gavin asked still looking at the unfetching dollface in the water its nothing to do with you whys it all curled up hike that is he dying gavin looked back to reynolds to see the response to that question the sourest of smiles fading youll want money no damn you youre in business arent you theres notes beside the bed take whatever you feel you deserve for your wasted time he was appraising gavin and your silence again the statue gavin couldnt keep his eyes off it in all its crudity his own face puzzled floated on the skin of the water shaming the hand of the artist with its proportions dont wonder said reynolds cant help it this is nothing to do with you you stole it is that right this is worth a mint and you stole it reynolds pondered the question and seemed at last too tired to start lying yes i stole it and tonight somebody came back for it reynolds shrugged is that it somebody came back for it thats right i stole it reynolds was saying the lines by rote and somebody came back for it thats all i wanted to know dont come back here gavin whoeveryouare and dont try anything clever because i wont be here you mean extortion said gavin im no thief reynolds look of appraisal rotted into contempt thief or not be thankful if its in you reynolds stepped away from the door to let gavin pass gavin didnt move thankful for what he demanded there was an itch of anger in him he felt absurdly rejected as though he was being foisted off with a halftruth because he wasnt worthy enough to share this secret reynolds had no more strength left for explanation he was slumped against the doorframe exhausted go he said gavin nodded and left the guy at the door as he passed from bathroom into hallway a glob of paint must have been loosened from the statue he heard it break surface heard the lapping at the edge of the bath could see in his head the way the ripples made the body shimmer goodnight said reynolds calling after him gavin didnt reply nor did he pick up any money on his way out let him have his tombstones and his secrets on his way to the front door he stepped into the main room to pick up his jacket the face of flavinus the standardbearer looked down at him from the wall the man must have been a hero gavin thought only a hero would have been commemorated in such a fashion hed get no remembrance like that no stone face to mark his passage he closed the front door behind him aware once more that his tooth was aching and as he did so the noise began again the beating of a fist against a wall or worse the sudden fury of a woken heart the toothache was really biting the following day and he went to the dentist midmorning expecting to coax the girl on the desk into giving him an instant appointment but his charm was at a low ebb his eyes werent sparkling quite as luxuriantly as usual she told him hed have to wait until the following friday unless it was an emergency he told her it was she told him it wasnt it was going to be a bad day an aching tooth a lesbian dentist receptionist ice on the puddles nattering women on every street corner ugly children ugly sky that was the day the pursuit began gavin had been chased by admirers before but never quite like this never so subtle so surreptitious hed had people follow him round for days from bar to bar from street to street so doglike it almost drove him mad seeing the same longing face night after night screwing up the courage to buy him a drink perhaps offering him a watch cocaine a week in tunisia whatever hed rapidly come to loathe that sticky adoration that went bad as quickly as milk and stank to high heaven once it had one of his most ardent admirers a knighted actor hed been told never actually came near him just followed him around looking and looking at first the attention had been flattering but the pleasure soon became irritation and eventually hed cornered the guy in a bar and threatened him with a broken head hed been so wound up that night so sick of being devoured by looks hed have done some serious harm if the pitiful bastard hadnt taken the hint he never saw the guy again half thought hed probably gone home and hanged himself but this pursuit was nowhere near as obvious it was scarcely more than a feeling there was no hard evidence that he had somebody on his tail just a prickly sense every time he glanced round that someone was slotting themselves into the shadows or that on a night street a walker was keeping pace with him matching every click of his heel every hesitation in his step it was like paranoia except that he wasnt paranoid if he was paranoid he reasoned somebody would tell him besides there were incidents one morning the cat woman who lived on the landing below him idly enquired who his visitor was the funny one who came in late at night and waited on the stairs hour after hour watching his room hed had no such visitor and knew noone who fitted the description another day on a busy street hed ducked out of the throng into the doorway of an empty shop and was in the act of lighting a cigarette when somebodys reflection distorted through the grime on the window caught his eye the match burned his finger he looked down as he dropped it and when he looked up again the crowd had closed round the watcher like an eager sea it was a bad bad feeling and there was more where that came from gavin had never spoken with preetorius though theyd exchanged an occasional nod on the street and each asked after the other in the company of mutual acquaintances as though they were dear friends preetorius was a black somewhere between fortyfive and assassination a glorified pimp who claimed to be descended from napoleon hed been running a circle of women and three or four boys for the best part of a decade and doing well from the business when he first began work gavin had been strongly advised to ask for preetorius patronage but hed always been too much of a maverick to want that kind of help as a result hed never been looked upon kindly by preetorius or his clan nevertheless once he became a fixture on the scene noone challenged his right to be his own man the word was that preetorius even admitted a grudging admiration for gavins greed admiration or no it was a chilly day in hell when preetorius actually broke the silence and spoke to him white boy it was towards eleven and gavin was on his way from a bar off st martins lane to a club in covent garden the street still buzzed there were potential punters amongst the theatre and moviegoers but he hadnt got the appetite for it tonight he had a hundred in his pocket which hed made the day before and hadnt bothered to bank plenty to keep him going his first thought when he saw preetorius and his piebald goons blocking his path was they want my money white boy then he recognised the flat shining face preetorius was no street thief never had been never would be white boy id like a word with you preetorius took a nut from his pocket shelled it in his palm and popped the kernel into his ample mouth you dont mind do you what do you want like i said just a word not too much to ask is it ok what not here gavin looked at preetorius cohorts they werent gorillas that wasnt the blacks style at all but nor were they ninetyeight pound weaklings this scene didnt look on the whole too healthy thanks but no thanks gavin said and began to walk with as even a pace as he could muster away from the trio they followed he prayed they wouldnt but they followed preetorius talked at his back listen i hear bad things about you he said oh yes im afraid so im told you attacked one of my boys gavin took six paces before he answered not me youve got the wrong man he recognised you trash you did him some serious mischief i told you not me youre a lunatic you know that you should be put behind fucking bars preetorius was raising his voice people were crossing the street to avoid the escalating argument without thinking gavin turned off st martins lane into long acre and rapidly realised hed made a tactical error the crowds thinned substantially here and it was a long trek through the streets of convent garden before he reached another centre of activity he should have turned right instead of left and hed have stepped onto charing cross road there would have been some safety there damn it he couldnt turn round not and walk straight into them all he could do was walk and hope he could keep the conversation on an even keel preetorius youve cost me a lot of money i dont see you put some of my prime boymeat out of commission its going to be a long time til i get that kid back on the market hes shit scared see look i didnt do anything to anybody why do you fucking lie to me trash what have i ever done to you you treat me like this preetorius picked up his pace a little and came up level with gavin leaving his associates a few steps behind look he whispered to gavin kids like that can be tempting right thats cool i can get into that you put a little boypussy on my plate im not going to turn my nose up at it but you hurt him and when you hurt one of my kids i bleed too if id done this like you say you think id be walking the street maybe youre not a well man you know were not talking about a couple of bruises here man im talking about you taking a shower in a kids blood thats what im saying hanging him up and cutting him everywhere then leaving him on my fuckin stairs wearing a pair of fucking socks you getting my message now white boy you read my message genuine rage had flared as preetorius described the alleged crimes and gavin wasnt sure how to handle it he kept his silence and walked on that kid idolised you you know thought you were essential reading for an aspirant bumboy howd you like that not much you should be fuckin flattered man cause thats about as much as youll ever amount to thanks youve had a good career pity its over gavin felt iced lead in his belly hed hoped preetorius was going to be content with a warning apparently not they were here to damage him jesus they were going to hurt him and for something he hadnt done didnt even know anything about were going to take you off the street white boy permanently i did nothing the kid knew you even with a stocking over your head he knew you the voice was the same the clothes were the same face it you were recognised now take the consequences fuck you gavin broke into a run as an eighteen year old hed sprinted for his county he needed that speed again now behind him preetorius laughed and two sets of feet pounded the pavement in pursuit they were close closer and gavin was badly out of condition his thighs were aching after a few dozen yards and his jeans were too tight to run in easily the chase was lost before it began the man didnt tell you to leave the white goon scolded his bitten fingers digging into gavins biceps nice try preetorius smiled sauntering towards the dogs and the panting hare he nodded almost imperceptibly to the other goon christian he asked at the invitation christian delivered a fist to gavins kidneys the blow doubled him up spitting curses christian said over there preetorius said make it snappy and suddenly they were dragging him out of the light into an alley his shirt and his jacket tore his expensive shoes were dragged through dirt before he was pulled upright groaning the alley was dark and preetorius eyes hung in the air in front of him dislocated here we are again he said happy as can be i didnt touch him gavin gasped the unnamed cohort notchristian put a ham hand in the middle of gavins chest and pushed him back against the end wall of the alley his heel slid in muck and though he tried to stay upright his legs had turned to water his ego too this was no time to be courageous hed beg he fall down on his knees and lick their soles if need be anything to stop them doing a job on him anything to stop them spoiling his face that was preetorius favourite pastime or so the street talk went the spoiling of beauty he had a rare way with him could maim beyond hope of redemption in three strokes of his razor and have the victim pocket his lips as a keepsake gavin stumbled forward palms slapping the wet ground something rottensoft slid out of its skin beneath his hand notchristian exchanged a grin with preetorius doesnt he look delightful he said preetorius was crunching a nut seems to me he said the mans finally found his place in life i didnt touch him gavin begged there was nothing to do but deny and deny and even then it was a lost cause youre guilty as hell said notchristian please id really like to get this over with as soon as possible said preetorius glancing at his watch ive got appointments to keep people to pleasure gavin looked up at his tormentors the sodiumlit street was a twentyfiveyard dash away if he could break through the cordon of their bodies allow me to rearrange your face for you a little crime of fashion preetorius had a knife in his hand notchristian had taken a rope from his pocket with a ball on it the ball goes in the mouth the rope goes round the head you couldnt scream if your life depended on it this was it go gavin broke from his grovelling position like a sprinter from his block but the slops greased his heels and threw him off balance instead of making a clean dash for safety he stumbled sideways and fell against christian who in turn fell back there was a breathless scrambling before preetorius stepped in dirtying his hands on the white trash and hauling him to his feet no way out fucker he said pressing the point of the blade against gavins chin the jut of the bone was clearest there and he began the cut without further debate tracing the jaw line too hot for the act to care if the trash was gagged or not gavin howled as blood washed down his neck but his cries were cut short as somebodys fat fingers grappled with his tongue and held it fast his pulse began to thud in his temples and windows one behind the other opened and opened in front of him and he was falling through them into unconsciousness better to die better to die theyd destroy his face better to die then he was screaming again except that he wasnt aware of making the sound in his throat through the slush in his ears he tried to focus on the voice and realised it was preetorius scream he was hearing not his own his tongue was released and he was spontaneously sick he staggered back puking from a mess of struggling figures in front of him a person or persons unknown had stepped in and prevented the completion of his spoiling there was a body sprawled on the floor face up notchristian eyes open life shut god someone had killed for him for him gingerly he put his hand up to his face to feel the damage the flesh was deeply lacerated along his jawbone from the middle of his chin to within an inch of his ear it was bad but preetorius ever organised had left the best delights to the last and had been interrupted before hed slit gavins nostrils or taken off his lips a scar along his jawbone wouldnt be pretty but it wasnt disastrous somebody was staggering out of the mкlйe towards him preetorius tears on his face eyes like golfballs beyond him christian his arms useless was staggering towards the street preetorius wasnt following why his mouth opened an elastic filament of saliva strung with pearls depended from his lower lip help me he appealed as though his life was in gavins power one large hand was raised to squeeze a drop of mercy out of the air but instead came the swoop of another arm reaching over his shoulder and thrusting a weapon a crude blade into the blacks mouth he gargled it a moment his throat trying to accommodate its edge its width before his attacker dragged the blade up and back holding preetorius neck to steady him against the force of the stroke the startled face divided and heat bloomed from preetorius interior warming gavin in a cloud the weapon hit the alley floor a dull clank gavin glanced at it a short widebladed sword he looked back at the dead man preetorius stood upright in front of him supported now only by his executioners arm his gushing head fell forward and the executioner took the bow as a sign neatly dropping preetorius body at gavins feet no longer eclipsed by the corpse gavin met his saviour face to face it took him only a moment to place those crude features the startled lifeless eyes the gash of a mouth the jughandle ears it was reynolds statue it grinned its teeth too small for its head milkteeth still to be shed before the adult form there was however some improvement in its appearance he could see that even in the gloom the brow seemed to have swelled the face was altogether better proportioned it remained a painted doll but it was a doll with aspirations the statue gave a stiff bow its joints unmistakably creaking and the absurdity the sheer absurdity of this situation welled up in gavin it bowed damn it it smiled it murdered and yet it couldnt possibly be alive could it later he would disbelieve he promised himself later hed find a thousand reasons not to accept the reality in front of him blame his bloodstarved brain his confusion his panic one way or another hed argue himself out of this fantastic vision and it would be as though it had never happened if he could just live with it a few minutes longer the vision reached across and touched gavins jaw lightly running its crudely carved fingers along the lips of the wound preetorius had made a ring on its smallest finger caught the light a ring identical to his own were going to have a scar it said gavin knew its voice dear me pity it said it was speaking with his voice still it could be worse his voice god his his his gavin shook his head yes it said understanding that hed understood not me yes why it transferred its touch from gavins jawbone to its own marking out the place where the wound should be and even as it made the gesture its surface opened and it grew a scar on the spot no blood welled up it had no blood yet wasnt that his own even brow it was emulating and the piercing eyes werent they becoming his and the wonderful mouth the boy said gavin fitting the pieces together oh the boy it threw its unfinished glance to heaven what a treasure he was and how he snarled you washed in his blood i need it it knelt to the body of preetorius and put its fingers in the split head this bloods old but itll do the boy was better it daubed preetorius blood on its cheek like warpaint gavin couldnt hide his disgust is he such a loss the effigy demanded the answer was no of course it was no loss at all that preetorius was dead no loss that some drugged cocksucking kid had given up some blood and sleep because this painted miracle needed to feed its growth there were worse things than this every day somewhere huge horrors and yet you cant condone me it prompted its not in your nature is it soon it wont be in mine either ill reject my life as a tormentor of children because ill see through your eyes share your humanity it stood up its movements still lacking flexibility meanwhile i must behave as i think fit on its cheek where preetorius blood had been smeared the skin was already waxier less like painted wood i am a thing without a proper name it pronounced i am a wound in the flank of the world but i am also that perfect stranger you always prayed for as a child to come and take you call you beauty lift you naked out of the street and through heavens window arent i arent i how did it know the dreams of his childhood how could it have guessed that particular emblem of being hoisted out of a street full of plague into a house that was heaven because i am yourself it said in reply to the unspoken question made perfectible gavin gestured towards the corpses you cant be me id never have done this it seemed ungracious to condemn it for its intervention but the point stood wouldnt you said the other i think you would gavin heard preetorius voice in his ear a crime of fashion felt again the knife at his chin the nausea the helplessness of course hed have done it a dozen times over hed have done it and called it justice it didnt need to hear his accession it was plain ill come and see you again said the painted face meanwhile if i were you it laughed id be going gavin locked eyes with it a beat probing it for doubt then started towards the road not that way this it was pointing towards a door in the wall almost hidden behind festering bags of refuse that was how it had come so quickly so quietly avoid the main streets and keep yourself out of sight ill find you again when im ready gavin needed no further encouragement to leave whatever the explanations of the nights events the deeds were done now wasnt the time for questions he slipped through the doorway without looking behind him but he could hear enough to turn his stomach the thud of fluid on the ground the pleasurable moan of the miscreant the sounds were enough for him to be able to picture its toilet nothing of the night before made any more sense the morning after there was no sudden insight into the nature of the waking dream hed dreamt there was just a series of stark facts in the mirror the fact of the cut on his jaw gummed up and aching more badly than his rotted tooth in the newspapers the reports of two bodies found in the covent garden area known criminals viciously murdered in what the police described as a gangland slaughter in his head the inescapable knowledge that he would be found out sooner or later somebody would surely have seen him with preetorius and spill the beans to the police maybe even christian if he was so inclined and theyd be there on his step with cuffs and warrants then what could he tell them in reply to their accusations that the man who did it was not a man at all but an effigy of some kind that was by degrees becoming a replica of himself the question was not whether hed be incarcerated but which hole theyd lock him in prison or asylum juggling despair with disbelief he went to the casualty department to have his face seen to where he waited patiently for three and a half hours with dozens of similar walking wounded the doctor was unsympathetic there was no use in stitches now he said the damage was done the wound could and would be cleaned and covered but a bad scar was now unavoidable why didnt you come last night when it happened the nurse asked he shrugged what the hell did they care artificial compassion didnt help him an iota as he turned the corner with his street he saw the cars outside the house the blue light the cluster of neighbours grinning their gossip too late to claim anything of his previous life by now they had possession of his clothes his combs his perfumes his letters and theyd be searching through them like apes after lice hed seen how thoroughgoing these bastards could be when it suited them how completely they could seize and parcel up a mans identity eat it up suck it up they could erase you as surely as a shot but leave you a living blank there was nothing to be done his life was theirs now to sneer at and salivate over even have a nervous moment one or two of them when they saw his photographs and wondered if perhaps theyd paid for this boy themselves some horny night let them have it all they were welcome from now on he would be lawless because laws protect possessions and he had none theyd wiped him clean or as good as he had no place to live nor anything to call his own he didnt even have fear that was the strangest thing he turned his back on the street and the house hed lived in for four years and he felt something akin to relief happy that his life had been stolen from him in its squalid entirety he was the lighter for it two hours later and miles away he took time to check his pockets he was carrying a bankers card almost a hundred pounds in cash a small collection of photographs some of his parents and sister mostly of himself a watch a ring and a gold chain round his neck using the card might be dangerous theyd surely have warned his bank by now the best thing might be to pawn the ring and the chain then hitch north he had friends in aberdeen whod hide him awhile but first reynolds it took gavin an hour to find the house where ken reynolds lived it was the best part of twentyfour hours since hed eaten and his belly complained as he stood outside livingstone mansions he told it to keep its peace and slipped into the building the interior looked less impressive by daylight the tread of the stair carpet was worn and the paint on the balustrade filthied with use taking his time he climbed the three flights to reynolds apartment and knocked nobody answered nor was there any sound of movement from inside reynolds had told him of course dont come back i wont be here had he somehow guessed the consequences of sicking that thing into the world gavin rapped on the door again and this time he was certain he heard somebody breathing on the other side of the door reynolds he said pressing to the door i can hear you nobody replied but there was somebody in there he was sure of it gavin slapped his palm on the door come on open up open up you bastard a short silence then a muffled voice go away i want to speak to you go away i told you go away ive nothing to say to you you owe me an explanation for gods sake if you dont open this fucking door ill fetch someone who will an empty threat but reynolds responded no wait wait there was the sound of a key in the lock and the door was opened a few paltry inches the flat was in darkness beyond the scabby face that peered out at gavin it was reynolds sure enough but unshaven and wretched he smelt unwashed even through the crack in the door and he was wearing only a stained shirt and a pair of pants hitched up with a knotted belt i cant help you go away if youll let me explain gavin pressed the door and reynolds was either too weak or too befuddled to stop him opening it he stumbled back into the darkened hallway what the fucks going on in here the place stank of rotten food the air was evil with it reynolds let gavin slam the door behind him before producing a knife from the pocket of his stained trousers you dont fool me reynolds gleamed i know what youve done very fine very clever you mean the murders it wasnt me reynolds poked the knife towards gavin how many bloodbaths did it take he asked tears in his eyes six ten i didnt kill anybody monster the knife in reynolds hand was the paper knife gavin himself had wielded he approached gavin with it there was no doubt he had every intention of using it gavin flinched and reynolds seemed to take hope from his fear had you forgotten what it was like being flesh and blood the man had lost his marbles look i just came here to talk you came here to kill me i could reveal youso you came to kill me do you know who i am gavin said reynolds sneered youre not the queer boy you look like him but youre not for pitys sake im gavin gavin the words to explain to prevent the knife pressing any closer wouldnt come gavin you remember was all he could say reynolds faltered a moment staring at gavins face youre sweating he said the dangerous stare fading in his eyes gavins mouth had gone so dry he could only nod i can see said reynolds youre sweating he dropped the point of the knife it could never sweat he said never had never would have the knack of it youre the boy not it the boy his face slackened its flesh a sack which was almost emptied i need help said gavin his voice hoarse youve got to tell me whats going on you want an explanation reynolds replied you can have whatever you can find he led the way into the main room the curtains were drawn but even in the gloom gavin could see that every antiquity it had contained had been smashed beyond repair the pottery shards had been reduced to smaller shards and those shards to dust the stone reliefs were destroyed the tombstone of flavinus the standardbearer was rubble who did this i did said reynolds why reynolds sluggishly picked his way through the destruction to the window and peered through a slit in the velvet curtains itll come back you see he said ignoring the question gavin insisted why destroy it all its a sickness reynolds replied needing to live in the past he turned from the window i stole most of these pieces he said over a period of many years i was put in a position of trust and i misused it he kicked over a sizeable chunk of rubble dust rose flavinus lived and died thats all there is to tell knowing his name means nothing or next to nothing it doesnt make flavinus real again hes dead and happy the statue in the bath reynolds stopped breathing for a moment his inner eye meeting the painted face you i thought i was it didnt you when i came to the door yes i thought it hadfinished its business it imitates reynolds nodded as far as i understand its nature he said yes it imitates where did you find it near carlisle i was in charge of the excavation there we found it lying in the bathhouse a statue curled up into a ball beside the remains of an adult male it was a riddle a dead man and a statue lying together in a bathhouse dont ask me what drew me to the thing i dont know perhaps it works its will through the mind as well as the physique i stole it brought it back here and you fed it reynolds stiffened dont ask i am asking you fed it yes you intended to bleed me didnt you thats why you brought me here to kill me and let it wash itself gavin remembered the noise of the creatures fists on the sides of the bath that angry demand for food like a child beating on its cot hed been so close to being taken by it lamblike why didnt it attack me the way it did you why didnt it just jump out of the bath and feed on me reynolds wiped his mouth with the palm of his hand it saw your face of course of course it saw my face and wanted it for itself and it couldnt steal the face of a dead man so it let me be the rationale for its behaviour was fascinating now it was revealed gavin felt a taste of reynolds passion unveiling mysteries the man in the bathhouse the one you uncovered yes he stopped it doing the same thing to him is that right thats probably why his body was never moved just sealed up noone understood that hed died fighting a creature that was stealing his life the picture was near as damn it complete just anger remaining to be answered this man had come close to murdering him to feed the effigy gavins fury broke surface he took hold of reynolds by shirt and skin and shook him was it his bones or teeth that rattled its almost got my face he stared into reynolds bloodshot eyes what happens when it finally has the trick off pat i dont know you tell me the worst tell me its all guesswork reynolds replied guess then when its perfected its physical imitation i think itll steal the one thing it cant imitate your soul reynolds was past fearing gavin his voice had sweetened as though he was talking to a condemned man he even smiled fucker gavin hauled reynolds face yet closer to his white spittle dotted the old mans cheek you dont care you dont give a shit do you he hit reynolds across the face once twice then again and again until he was breathless the old man took the beating in absolute silence turning his face up from one blow to receive another brushing the blood out of his swelling eyes only to have them fill again finally the punches faltered reynolds on his knees picked pieces of tooth off his tongue i deserved that he murmured how do i stop it said gavin reynolds shook his head impossible he whispered plucking at gavins hand please he said and taking the fist opened it and kissed the lines gavin left reynolds in the ruins of rome and went into the street the interview with reynolds had told him little he hadnt guessed the only thing he could do now was find this beast that had his beauty and best it if he failed he failed attempting to secure his only certain attribute a face that was wonderful talk of souls and humanity was for him so much wasted air he wanted his face there was rare purpose in his step as he crossed kensington after years of being the victim of circumstance he saw circumstance embodied at last he would shake sense from it or die trying in his flat reynolds drew aside the curtain to watch a picture of evening fall on a picture of a city no night he would live through no city hed walk in again out of sighs he let the curtain drop and picked up the short stabbing sword the point he put to his chest come on he told himself and the sword and pressed the hilt but the pain as the blade entered his body a mere half inch was enough to make his head reel he knew hed faint before the job was halfdone so he crossed to the wall steadied the hilt against it and let his own bodyweight impale him that did the trick he wasnt sure if the sword had skewered him through entirely but by the amount of blood hed surely killed himself though he tried to arrange to turn and so drive the blade all the way home as he fell on it he fluffed the gesture and instead fell on his side the impact made him aware of the sword in his body a stiff uncharitable presence transfixing him utterly it took him well over ten minutes to die but in that time pain apart he was content whatever the flaws of his fiftyseven years and they were many he felt he was perishing in a way his beloved flavinus would not have been ashamed of towards the end it began to rain and the noise on the roof made him believe god was burying the house sealing him up forever and as the moment came so did a splendid delusion a hand carrying a light and escorted by voices seemed to break through the wall ghosts of the future come to excavate his history he smiled to greet them and was about to ask what year this was when he realised he was dead the creature was far better at avoiding gavin than hed been at avoiding it three days passed without its pursuer snatching sight of hide or hair of it but the fact of its presence close but never too close was indisputable in a bar someone would say saw you last night on the edgware road when hed not been near the place or howd you make out with that arab then or dont you speak to your friends any longer and god he soon got to like the feeling the distress gave way to a pleasure hed not known since the age of two ease so what if someone else was working his patch dodging the law and the streetwise alike so what if his friends were being cut by this supercilious copy so what if his life had been taken from him and was being worn to its length and its breadth in lieu of him he could sleep and know that he or something so like him it made no difference was awake in the night and being adored he began to see the creature not as a monster terrorising him but as his tool his public persona almost it was substance he shadow he woke dreaming it was fourfifteen in the afternoon and the whine of traffic was loud from the street below a twilight room the air breathed and rebreathed and breathed again so it smelt of his lungs it was over a week since hed left reynolds to the ruins and in that time hed only ventured out from his new digs three times sleep was more important now than food or exercise he had enough dope to keep him happy when sleep wouldnt come which was seldom and hed grown to like the staleness of the air the flux of light through the curtainless window the sense of a world elsewhere which he had no part of or place in today hed told himself he ought to go out and get some fresh air but he hadnt been able to raise the enthusiasm maybe later much later when the bars were emptying and he wouldnt be noticed then hed slip out of his cocoon and see what could be seen for now there were dreams water hed dreamt water sitting beside a pool in fort lauderdale a pool full of fish and the splash of their leaps and dives was continuing an overflow from sleep or was it the other way round yes he had been hearing running water in his sleep and his dreaming mind had made an illustration to accompany the sound now awake the sound continued it was coming from the adjacent bathroom no longer running but lapping somebody had obviously broken in while he was asleep and was now taking a bath he ran down the short list of possible intruders the few who knew he was here there was paul a nascent hustler whod bedded down on the floor two nights before there was chink the dope dealer and a girl from downstairs he thought was called michelle who was he kidding none of these people would have broken the lock on the door to get in he knew very well who it must be he was just playing a game with himself enjoying the process of elimination before he narrowed the options to one keen for reunion he slid out from his skin of sheet and duvet his body turned to a column of gooseflesh as the cold air encased him his sleeperection hid its head as he crossed the room to where his dressing gown hung on the back of the door he caught sight of himself in the mirror a freeze frame from an atrocity film a wisp of a man shrunk by cold and lit by a rainwater light his reflection almost flickered he was so insubstantial wrapping the dressing gown his only freshly purchased garment around him he went to the bathroom door there was no noise of water now he pushed the door open the warped linoleum was icy beneath his feet and all he wanted to do was to see his friend then crawl back into bed but he owed the tatters of his curiosity more than that he had questions the light through the frosted glass had deteriorated rapidly in the three minutes since hed woken the onset of night and a rainstorm congealing the gloom in front of him the bath was almost filled to overflowing the water was oilslick calm and dark as before nothing broke surface it was lying deep hidden how long was it since hed approached a limegreen bath in a limegreen bathroom and peered into the water it could have been yesterday his life between then and now had become one long night he looked down it was there tucked up as before and asleep still wearing all its clothes as though it had had no time to undress before it hid itself where it had been bald it now sprouted a luxuriant head of hair and its features were quite complete no trace of a painted face remained it had a plastic beauty that was his own absolutely down to the last mole its perfectly finished hands were crossed on its chest the night deepened there was nothing to do but watch it sleep and he became bored with that it had traced him here it wasnt likely to run away again he could go back to bed outside the rain had slowed the commuters homeward journey to a crawl there were accidents some fatal engines overheated hearts too he listened to the chase sleep came and went it was the middle of the evening when thirst woke him again he was dreaming water and there was the sound as it had been before the creature was hauling itself out of the bath was putting its hand to the door opening it there it stood the only light in the bedroom was coming from the street below it barely began to illuminate the visitor gavin are you awake yes he said will you help me it asked there was no trace of threat in its voice it asked as a man might ask his brother for kinships sake what do you want time to heal heal put on the light gavin switched on the lamp beside the bed and looked at the figure at the door it no longer had its arms crossed on its chest and gavin saw that the position had been covering an appalling shotgun wound the flesh of its chest had been blown open exposing its colourless innards there was of course no blood that it would never have nor from this distance could gavin see anything in its interior that faintly resembled human anatomy god almighty he said preetorius had friends said the other and its ringers touched the edge of the wound the gesture recalled apicture of the wall of his mothers house christ in glory the sacred heart floating inside the saviour while his fingers pointing to the agony hed suffered said this was for you why arent you dead because im not yet alive it said not yet remember that gavin thought it has intimations of mortality are you in pain no it said sadly as though it craved the experience i feel nothing all the signs of life are cosmetic but im learning it smiled ive got the knack of the yawn and the fart the idea was both absurd and touching that it would aspire to farting that a farcical failure in the digestive system was for it a precious sign of humanity and the wound is healing will heal completely in time gavin said nothing do i disgust you it asked without inflection no it was staring at gavin with perfect eyes his perfect eyes what did reynolds tell you it asked gavin shrugged very little that im a monster that i suck out the human spirit not exactly more or less more or less gavin conceded it nodded hes right it said in his way hes right i need blood that makes me monstrous in my youth a month ago i bathed in it its touch gave wood the appearance of flesh but i dont need it now the process is almost finished all i need now it faltered not gavin thought because it intended to lie but because the words to describe its condition wouldnt come what do you need gavin pressed it it shook its head looking down at the carpet ive lived several times you know sometimes ive stolen lives and got away with it lived a natural span then shrugged off that face and found another sometimes like the last time ive been challenged and lost are you some kind of machine no what then i am what i am i know of no others like me though why should i be the only one perhaps there are others many others i simply dont know of them yet so i live and die and live again and learn nothing the word was bitterly pronounced of myself understand you know what you are because you see others like you if you were alone on earth what would you know what the mirror told you thats all the rest would be myth and conjecture the summary was made without sentiment may i lie down it asked it began to walk towards him and gavin could see more clearly the fluttering in its chestcavity the restless incoherent forms that were mushrooming there in place of the heart signing it sank facedown on the bed its clothes sodden and closed its eyes well heal it said just give us time gavin went to the door of the flat and bolted it then he dragged a table over and wedged it under the handle nobody could get in and attack it in sleep they would stay here together in safety he and it he and himself the fortress secured he brewed some coffee and sat in the chair across the room from the bed and watched the creature sleep the rain rushed against the window heavily one hour lightly the next wind threw sodden leaves against the glass and they clung there like inquisitive moths he watched them sometimes when he tired of watching himself but before long hed want to look again and hed be back staring at the casual beauty of his outstretched arm the light flicking the wristbone the lashes he fell asleep in the chair about midnight with an ambulance complaining in the street outside and the rain coming again it wasnt comfortable in the chair and hed surface from sleep every few minutes his eyes opening a fraction the creature was up it was standing by the window now in front of the mirror now in the kitchen water ran he dreamt water the creature undressed he dreamt sex it stood over him its chest whole and he was reassured by its presence he dreamt it was for a moment only himself lifted out of a street through a window into heaven it dressed in his clothes he murmured his assent to the theft in his sleep it was whistling and there was a threat of day through the window but he was too dozy to stir just yet and quite content to have the whistling young man in his clothes live for him at last it leaned over the chair and kissed him on the lips a brothers kiss and left he heard the door close behind it after that there were days he wasnt sure how many when he stayed in the room and did nothing but drink water this thirst had become unquenchable drinking and sleeping drinking and sleeping twin moons the bed he slept on was damp at the beginning from where the creature had laid and he had no wish to change the sheets on the contrary he enjoyed the wet linen which his body dried out too soon when it did he took a bath himself in the water the thing had lain in and returned to the bed dripping wet his skin crawling with cold and the scent of mildew all around later too indifferent to move he allowed his bladder free rein while he lay on the bed and that water in time became cold until he dried it with his dwindling bodyheat but for some reason despite the icy room his nakedness his hunger he couldnt die he got up in the middle of the night of the sixth or seventh day and sat on the edge of the bed to find the flaw in his resolve when the solution didnt come he began to shamble around the room much as the creature had a week earlier standing in front of the mirror to survey his pitifully changed body watching the snow shimmer down and melt on the sill eventually by chance he found a picture of his parents he remembered the creature staring at or had he dreamt that he thought not he had a distinct idea that it had picked up this picture and looked at it that was of course the bar to his suicide that picture there were respects to be paid until then how could he hope to die he walked to the cemetery through the slush wearing only a pair of slacks and a teeshirt the remarks of middleaged women and schoolchildren went unheard whose business but his own was it if going barefoot was the death of him the rain came and went sometimes thickening towards snow but never quite achieving its ambition there was a service going on at the church itself a line of brittle coloured cars parked at the front he slipped down the side into the churchyard it boasted a good view much spoiled today by the smoky veil of sleet but he could see the trains and the highrise flats the endless rows of roofs he ambled amongst the headstones by no means certain of where to find his fathers grave it had been sixteen years and the day hadnt been that memorable nobody had said anything illuminating about death in general or his fathers death specifically there wasnt even a social gaff or two to mark the day no aunt broke wind at the buffet table no cousin took him aside to expose herself he wondered if the rest of the family ever came here whether indeed they were still in the country his sister had always threatened to move out go to new zealand begin again his mother was probably getting through her fourth husband by now poor sod though perhaps she was the pitiable one with her endless chatter barely concealing the panic here was the stone and yes there were fresh flowers in the marble urn that rested amongst the green marble chips the old bugger had not lain here enjoying the view unnoticed obviously somebody he guessed his sister had come here seeking a little comfort from father gavin ran his fingers over the name the date the platitude nothing exceptional which was only right and proper because thered been nothing exceptional about him staring at the stone words came spilling out as though father was sitting on the edge of the grave dangling his feet raking his hair across his gleaming scalp pretending as he always pretended to care what do you think eh father wasnt impressed not much am i gavin confessed you said it son well i was always careful like you told me there arent any bastards out there going to come looking for me damn pleased i wouldnt be much to find would i father blew his nose wiped it three times once from left to right again left to right finishing right to left never failed then he slipped away old shithouse a toy train let out a long blast on its horn as it passed and gavin looked up there he was himself standing absolutely still a few yards away he was wearing the same clothes hed put on a week ago when hed left the flat they looked creased and shabby from constant wear but the flesh oh the flesh was more radiant than his own had ever been it almost shone in the drizzling light and the tears on the doppelgangers cheeks only made the features more exquisite whats wrong said gavin it always makes me cry coming here it stepped over the graves towards him its feet crunching on gravel soft on grass so real youve been here before oh yes many times over the years over the years what did it mean over the years had it mourned here for people it had killed as if in answer i come to visit father twice maybe three times a year this isnt your father said gavin almost amused by the delusion its mine i dont see any tears on your face said the other i feel nothing his face told him you feel nothing at all if youre honest that was the truth whereas i the tears began to flow again its nose ran i will miss him until i die it was surely playacting but if so why was there such grief in its eyes and why were its features crumpled into ugliness as it wept gavin had seldom given in to tears theyd always made him feel weak and ridiculous but this thing was proud of tears it gloried in them they were its triumph and even then knowing it had overtaken him gavin could find nothing in him that approximated grief have it he said have the snots youre welcome the creature was hardly listening why is it all so painful it asked after a pause why is it loss that makes me human gavin shrugged what did he know or care about the fine art of being human the creature wiped its nose with its sleeve sniffed and tried to smile through its unhappiness im sorry it said im making a damn fool of myself please forgive me it inhaled deeply trying to compose itself thats all right said gavin the display embarrassed him and he was glad to be leaving your flowers he asked as he turned from the grave it nodded he hated flowers the thing flinched ah still what does he know he didnt even look at the effigy again just turned and started up the path that ran beside the church a few yards on the thing called after him can you recommend a dentist gavin grinned and kept walking it was almost the commuter hour the arterial road that ran by the church was already thick with speeding traffic perhaps it was friday early escapees hurrying home lights blazed brilliantly horns blared gavin stepped into the middle of the flow without looking to right or left ignoring the squeals of brakes and the curses and began to walk amongst the traffic as if he were idling in an open field the wing of a speeding car grazed his leg as it passed another almost collided with him their eagerness to get somewhere to arrive at a place they would presently be itching to depart from again was comical let them rage at him loathe him let them glimpse his featureless face and go home haunted if the circumstances were right maybe one of them would panic swerve and run him down whatever from now on he belonged to chance whose standardbearer he would surely be
