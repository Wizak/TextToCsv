john mortimer rumpole on trial sometimes when i have nothing better to occupy my mind when i am sitting in the bath for instance or in the doctors surgery having exhausted the entertainment value of last years country life or when i am in the corner of pommeroys wine bar waiting for some generous spirit in chambers and there arent many of them left to come in and say care for a glass of chateau fleet street rumpole i wonder what i would have done if i had been god i mean if i had been responsible for creating the world in the first place would i have cobbled up a globe totally without the minus quantities we have grown used to a place with no fatal diseases or traffic jams or mr justice graves and one or two others i could mention above all would i have created a world entirely without evil and when i came to think rather further along these lines it seems to me that a world without evil might possibly be a damned dull world or an undamned dull world perhaps i should say and it would certainly be a world which would leave rumpole without an occupation it would also put the old bill and most of her majestys judges prosecutors prison officers and screws on the breadline so perhaps a world where everyone rushes about doing good to each other and everyone including the aforesaid graves is filled with brotherly love is not such a marvellous idea after all brooding a little further on this business of evil it occurs to me that the world is fairly equally divided between those who see it everywhere because they are always looking for it and those who hardly notice it at all of course the mere fact that some people recognize devilment in the most everyday matters doesnt mean that it isnt there i have known the first indication that evil was present in various cases that i have been concerned with to be a missing library ticket a car tyre punctured or the wrong overcoat taken from the cloakroom of an expensive restaurant at other times the signs of evil are so blatant that they are impossible to ignore as in the dramatic start to the case which i have come to think of as concerning the children of the devil they led to a serious and at times painful inquiry into the machinations of satan in the borough of crockthorpe crockthorpe is a large sprawling in many parts dejected in others rather too cosy for comfort area south of the thames its inhabitants include people speaking many languages many without jobs many gainfully employed in legal and not so legal businesses and the huge timson clan which must by now account for a sizeable chunk of the population the timsons as those of you who have followed my legal career in detail will know provide not only the bread and marge the vim and brasso but quite often the beef and butter of our life in froxbury mansions gloucester road a proportion of my intake of chateau thames embankment and my wife hildas gin and tonic comes thanks to the tireless activities of the timson family they are such a large group their crime rate is so high and their success rate so comparatively low that they are perfect clients for an old bailey hack they go in for theft shopbreaking and receiving stolen property but they have never produced a master crook if you are looking for sensational crimes the timsons wont provide them or it would be more accurate to say they didnt until the day that tracy timson apparently made a pact with the devil the story began in the playground of crockthorpes stafford cripps junior school the building had not been much repaired since it was built in the heady days of the first postwar labour government and the playground had been kicked to pieces by generations of scuffling undertwelves it was during the midmorning break when the children were out fighting ganging up on each other or unhappy because they had no one to play with among the most active and about to pick a fight with a far larger black boy was dominic molloy angelfaced and irish who will figure in this narrative when evil appeared well as i say it was halfway through break and the headmistress a certain miss appleyard a woman in her early forties who would have been beautiful had not the stress of life in the stafford cripps junior aged her prematurely was walking across the playground trying to work out how to make fifty copies of the little green reading book go round two hundred pupils when she heard the sound of concerted eerie and highpitched screaming coming from one of the doors that led on to the playground turning towards the sound of the outcry miss appleyard saw a strange sight a small posse of children about nine of them all girls and all screaming came rushing out like a charge of miniature cavalry who they were was at this moment a mystery to the headmistress for each child wore a similar mask above the dresses and the jeans and pullovers hung the scarlet and black grimacing and evil faces of nine devils at this sight even the bravest and most unruly children in the playground were taken aback many retreated some of the younger ones adding to the chorus of screams only young dominic molloy it has to be said stood his ground and viewed the scene that followed with amusement and contempt he saw miss appleyard step forward fearlessly and when the charge halted she plucked off the devils mask and revealed the small heartshaped face of the eightyearold tracy almost the youngest and now apparently the most devilish of the timson family events thereafter took an even more sinister turn at first the headmistress looked grim confiscated the masks and ordered the children back to the classroom but didnt speak to them again about the extraordinary demonstration unfortunately she laid the matter before the proper authority which in this case was the social services and welfare department of the crockthorpe council so the wheels were set in motion that would end up with young tracy timson being taken into what is laughingly known as care this being the punishment meted out to children who fail to conform to a conventional and rational society childhood has i regret to say like much else got worse since i was a boy we had school bullies we had headmasters who were apparently direct descendants of captain bligh of the bounty we had cold baths inedible food and long hours in chapel on sundays but there was one compensation no one had invented social workers now british children it seems can expect the treatment we once thought was only meted out to the political opponents of the late unlamented joseph stalin they must learn to dread the knock at the door the tramp of the old bill up the stairs and being snatched from their nearest and dearest by a member of the alleged caring professions the dreaded knock was to be heard at sixthirty one morning on the door of the semi in morrison close where that young couple cary and rosemary timson lived with tracy their only child there was a police car flashing its blue light outside the house and a woman police constable in uniform on the step the knock was administered by a social worker named mirabelle jones of whom well hear considerably more later she was a perfectly pleasantlooking girl with welltended hair who wore whenever i saw her a linen jacket and a calflength skirt of some ethnic material when she spoke she modulated her naturally posh tones into some semblance of a workingclass accent and she always referred to the parents of the children who came into her possession as mum and dad and spoke with friendliness and deep concern when the knock sounded tracy was asleep in the company of someone known as barbie doll which i have since discovered to be a miniature american person with a beehive hairdo and a large wardrobe cary timson was pounding down the stairs in his pyjamas unhappily convinced that the knock was in some way connected with the breakin at a shop in gunston avenue about which he had been repeatedly called in for questioning although he had made it clear on each occasion that he knew absolutely bugger all about it by the time he had pulled open the door his wife roz had appeared on the stairs behind him so she was able to hear mirabelle telling her husband after the parties had identified each other that she had come about young tracy from the statements which i was able to read later it appears that the dialogue then went something like this it began with a panicstricken cry from roz of tracy what about our tracy shes asleep upstairs isnt she asleep upstairs are you mum mirabelle then asked what you mean am i mum course im tracys mum what do you want roz clearly spoke with rising hysteria and mirabelles reply sounded as always reasonable we want to look after your tracy mum we feel she needs rather special care im sure youre both going to help us we do rely on mum and dad to be very sensible roz was not deceived by the soothing tones and concerned smile she got the awful message and the shock of it brought her coldly to her senses you come to take tracy away havent you and before the question was answered she shouted youre not bloody taking her away we just want to do the very best for your little girl thats all mum at which mirabelle detached a dreaded and officiallooking document from the clipboard she was carrying we do have a court order now shall we go and wake tracy up ever so gently it would be unnecessarily painful to dwell on the scene that followed roz fought like a tigress for her young and had to be restrained at first by her husband who had learned as a juvenile the penalty for assaulting the powers of justice and then by the uniformed officer who was called in from the car the timsons were told that they would be able to argue the case in court eventually the woman police officer helped pack a few clothes for tracy in a small case and as the child was removed from the house mirabelle took the barbie doll from her explaining that it was bad for children in such circumstances to have too many things that reminded them of i home so young tracy timson was taken into custody and her parents came nearer to heartbreak than they ever had in their lives even when cary got a totally unexpected two years for the theft of a clappedout volvo estate from safeways car park throughout it all its fair to say that miss mirabelle jones behaved with the tact and consideration which made her such a star of the social services and such a dangerous witness in the juvenile court tracy timson was removed to a gloomy victorian villa now known as the lilacs crockthorpe council childrens home where she will stay for the remainder of this story and mirabelle set out to interview what she called tracys peers by which she meant the other kids tracy was at school with and in the course of her activities she called at another house in morrison close this one being occupied by the father and mother of young dominic molloy now anyone who knows anything about the world we live in anyone who keeps his or i her ear to the ground and picks up as much information as possible about family rivalry in the crockthorpe area will know that the molloys and the timsons are chalk and cheese and as deadly rivals as the montagues and the capulets the guelphs and the ghibellines or york and lancaster the molloys are an extended family they are also villains but of a more purposeful and efficient variety to the timsons record of smalltime thieving the molloys added wounding grievous bodily harm and an occasional murder now mirabelle called on the eightyearold dominic molloy and after a preliminary consultation with him and his parents he agreed to help her with her inquiries this in turn led to a further interview in an office at the school with young dominic which was immortalized on videotape i remember my first conference with tracys parents because on that morning hilda and i had a slight difference of opinion on the subject of the scales of justice ball this somewhat grizzly occasion is announced annually on a heavily embossed card which arrived with the gas bill and various invitations to insure my life and go on mediterranean cruises on the rumpole breakfast table i had launched this invitation towards the tidy bin to join the tea leaves and the eggshells when hilda whose eagle eye misses nothing immediately retrieved it shook various particles of food off it and challenged me with and why are you throwing this away rumpole you dont want to go hilda i did my best to persuade her disgusting sight her majestys judges creaking round in the fox trot at the savoy hotel you wouldnt enjoy it i suppose not rumpole not in the circumstances not in what circumstances its too humiliating i quite agree i saw her point at once when mr justice graves breaks into the valeta i hang my head in shame its humiliating for me rumpole when other chaps in chambers lead their wives out on to the floor not a pretty sight i have to agree the waltzing bollards the pirouetting erskinebrowns why do you never lead me out on to the dance floor nowadays rumpole she asked me the question direct i sometimes dream about it were at the scales of justice ball at the savoy hotel and you lead me out on to the floor as the first lady in chambers you are hilda i hastened to agree with her youre quite definitely the senior but you never lead me out rumpole we have to sit there staring at each other across the table while all around us couples are dancing the night away hilda i decided to disclose my defence i have as you know many talents but im not nijinsky anyway we dont get much practice at dancing down the old bailey oh it doesnt matter when is the ball marigold featherstone told me but i cant quite remember i saw with a sort of dread that she was checking the foodstained invitation to answer her question november the ith it just happens to be my birthday well well stay at home as usual at least i wont have to sit and watch other happy people dancing together and now she applied the corner of a handkerchief to her eye please hilda i begged not the waterworks at which she sniffed bravely and dismissed me from her presence no of course not go along now youve got to get to work works the only thing that matters to you youd rather defend a murderer than dance with your wife well yes perhaps i had to admit look do cheer up old thing please she gave me her last lament as i moved towards the door old yes i suppose were both too old for a party and ill just have to get used to the fact that i didnt marry a dancer sorry hilda so i left she who must be obeyed sitting alone in the kitchen and looking as i thought genuinely unhappy i had seen her miffed before i had seen her outraged i had seen her all too frequently intensely displeased at some item of rumpoles behaviour which fell short of perfection but i was unprepared for the sadness which seemed to have engulfed her had she spent her life imagining she was ginger rogers and was she at last reconciled to the fact that i had neither the figure nor the top hat to play whatever his name was astaire for a moment a sensation to which i am quite unused came over me i felt inadequate however i pulled myself together and pointed myself in the direction of my chambers in the temple where i knew i had a conference with a couple of timsons in what i imagined would be no more than a routine case of petty thievery i had acted for cary before in a little matter of lead removed from the roof of crockthorpe methodist church he was tall and thin and usually spoke in a slow mocking way as though he found the whole of life slightly amusing he didnt look amused now his wife roz was a solid girl in her late twenties with broad cheekbones and capable hands in attendance was the faithful mr bernard who from time immemorial has acted as the solicitorgeneral to the timson family they wouldnt let tracy take even a doll not one of her barbies how do you think people could do that to a child roz asked me when mr bernard had outlined the facts of the case her eyes were red and swollen and as she sat in my clients chair nervously twisting her wedding ring she looked not much older than a child herself nicking your kid thats what its come to well ill allow us timsons may have done a fair bit of mischief in our time but no one in the familys ever stooped to that mr rumpole and cary timson added for greater emphasis people what nick kids get boiling cocoa poured on their heads when theyre inside like cary worships that girl mr rumpole roz told me no matter what they say take a look at these her husband was already pulling out his wallet and youll see the reason why so the brightly coloured snaps were laid proudly on my desk and i saw the three of them on a spanish beach at a theme park or on days out in the country the mother and father held their child aloft in the manner of successful athletes with a golden prize triumphantly and with unmistakable delight bloody marvellous isnt it garys gentle mocking hadturned to genuine anger eight years old and our trace needs a brief youll get tracy back for us wont you mr rumpole i thought roz must have given birth to this muchloved daughter when she was about seventeen shell be that unhappy you seen the photos mr rumpole and cary asked does she have the look of a villain id say not a hardened criminal i had to admit whats her crime mr rumpole thats what roz and i wants to know its not as though she nicked things ever well not really and roz admitted shell take a jaffa cake when im not looking or a few sweets occasionally our tracys too young for any serious nicking her father was sure of it what you reckon she done mr rumpole what they got on her chargesheet childhood itself seems a crime to some people its a point that has often struck me bloody marvellous isnt it garys gentle mocking hadturned to genuine anger eight years old and our trace needs a brief youll get tracy back for us wont you mr rumpole i thought roz must have given birth to this muchloved daughter when she was about seventeen shell be that unhappy you seen the photos mr rumpole and cary asked does she have the look of a villain id say not a hardened criminal i had to admit whats her crime mr rumpole thats what roz and i wants to know its not as though she nicked things ever well not really and roz admitted shell take a jaffa cake when im not looking or a few sweets occasionally our tracys too young for any serious nicking her father was sure of it what you reckon she done mr rumpole what they got on her chargesheet childhood itself seems a crime to some people its a point that has often struck me we cant seem to get any sense out of that miss jones roz looked helpless jones officer in charge of case tracys social worker one of the caring community i was sure of it all shell say is that shes making further inquiries mr bernard told me i never discovered what id done when they banged me up in a draughty great boardingschool at the age of eight i looked back down the long corridor of years and began to reminisce hear that roz cary turned to his wife they banged up mr rumpole when he was a kid did they mr rumpole did they really but before i could give them further and better particulars of the bird i had done at linklaters that downmarket public school i attended on the norfolk coast mr bernard brought us back to the fantastic facts of the case and the nature of the charges against tracy ive been talking to the solicitor for the local authority he reported and their case is that the juvenile timson has been indulging in devil worship hellish rituals and satanic rights it might be convenient if i were to give you an account of that filmed interview with dominic molloy which as i have told you we finally saw at the trial before that mr bernard had acquired a transcript of this dramatic scene so we were by bits and pieces made aware of the bizarre charges against young tracy a case which began to look as though it should be transferred from crockthorpe juvenile court to seville to be decided by hooded inquisitors in the darkest days of the spanish inquisition the scene was set in the headmistresss office in stafford cripps junior mirabelle jones at her most reassuring sat smiling on one side of the desk while young dominic molloy beaming with selfimportance played the starring role on the other you remember the children wearing those horrid masks at school do you dominic mirabelle kicked off the proceedings they scared me dominic gave a realistic shudder im sure they did the social worker made a note gave the camera no doubt installed in the corner of the room the benefit of her smile and then returned to the work in hand did you see who was leading those children in the end i did who was it trace tracy timson yes your mum said you went round to tracy timsons a few times after school was that yes after school like and then you said you went somewhere else where else exactly where they put people a churchyard was it a churchyard mirabelle gave us a classic example of a leading question dominic nodded approval and she made a note the one in crockthorpe road the church past the roundabout st elphicks mirabelle suggested and dominic nodded again it was the churchyard was it dark dominic nodded so eagerly that his whole body seemed to rock backwards and forwards and he was in danger of falling off his chair after school and late a month ago so it was dark did a grownup come with you a man perhaps did a man come with you he said we was to play a game now dominic had resorted to a kind of throaty whisper guaranteed to make the flesh creep what sort of game he put something on his face mask red and horns on it a devils mask mirabelle was scribbling enthusiastically is that right dominic he wanted you to play at devils this man did he said he was the devil yes he was to be the devil and what were you supposed to be dominic didnt answer that but sat as if afraid to move perhaps you were the devils children at this point dominics silence was more effective than any answer what was the game you had to play mirabelle tried another approach dance around the answer came in a whisper dance around now i want you to tell me dominic when did you meet this man at tracy timsons house is that where you met him more silence from dominic so mirabelle tried again do you know who he was dominic at which dominic nodded and looked round fearfully who was he dominic youve been such a help to me so far cant you tell me who he was tracys dad everything changes and with everincreasing rapidity human beings no longer sell tickets at the temple tube station machines and not disillusioned waitresses dispense the socalled coffee in the old bailey canteen and when i became aware that dianne our longtime typist and close personal friend to henry our clerk had left the service i feared and expected that she might be replaced by a robot however what i found behind the typewriter when i blew into the clerks room after a hard days work on an actual bodily harm in acton a few weeks after my conference with tracys parents was nothing more mechanical than an unusually pretty and very young woman wearing a skirt as short as a suspended sentence and a smile so ready that it seemed never to leave her features entirely but to be waiting around for the next opportunity to beam henry introduced her as miss clapton taken over from dianne mr rumpole who has just got herself married i dont know if youve heard the news married henry im sorry to a junior clerk in a bankruptcy set he spoke with considerable disgust i told her shed live to regret it welcome to equity court miss clapton i said if you behave really well you might get parole in about ten years she gave me the smile at full strength but my attention was diverted by the sight of mizz liz probert who had just picked up a brief from the mantelpiece and was looking at it with every sign of rapture liz the daughter of red ron probert labour leader on the crockthorpe council is the most radical member of our chambers i greeted her with soft you now the fair mizz probert what are you fondling there old thing or words to that effect what does it look like rumpole it looks suspiciously like a brief got it in one mizz liz was in a perky mood that morning time marches on my expupil has begun to acquire briefs what is it bad case of nonrenewed dog licence a bit more serious than that im for the crockthorpe local authority rumpole i am suitably overawed i didnt ask whether the presence of red ron on the council had anything to do with this manna from heaven and mizz liz went on to tell a familiar story a little girl had to be taken into care shes in terrible danger in the home you know what it is the fathers got a criminal record as a matter of fact its a name that might be familiar to you timson so they took away a timson child because the fathers got form i asked innocently hoping for further information not just that something rather awful was going on devil worship the family were deeply into it quite seriously its a shocking case is it really tell me do you believe in the devil of course i dont rumpole dont be so ridiculous anyway thats hardly the point isnt it it interests me though you see im likely to be against you in the juvenile court you rumpole on the side of the devil mizz probert seemed genuinely shocked why not they tell me he has the best lines defending devilworshippers in a childrens case thats really not on is it rumpole i really cant think of anyone i wouldnt defend thats what i believe in i was just on my way to pommeroys mizz liz old thing will you join me in a stiffener i dont really think we should be seen drinking together not now im appearing for the local authority for the local authority of course i gave her a respectful bow on leaving a great power in the land even if they do rather interfere with the joy of living no sooner had i got to pommeroys wine bar and chalked up the first glass of jack pommeroys very ordinary when claude erskinebrown of our chambers came into view in a state of considerable excitement about the new typist an enormous asset dont you think dot will bring a flood of spring sunshine into our clerks room dot i was puzzled what are you babbling about her names dot rumpole she told me that i said it was a beautiful name i didnt need to tell the fellow he was making a complete ass of himself this was a fact too obvious to mention ive told her she must come to me if she has any problems workwise claude is of course married to phillida erskinebrown qc the attractive and highly competent portia of our chambers perhaps its because he has to play second fiddle to this powerful advocate that claude is for ever on the lookout for alternative company a pursuit which brings little but embarrassment to himself and those around him i saw nothing but trouble arising from the appearance of this dot upon the erskinebrown horizon but now the fellow completely changed the subject and said you know charlie wisbeach ive never heard of him wisbeach bottomley perkins amp harris erskinebrown spoke in an awestruck whisper as though repeating a magic formula good god are they all here i rather think claudes talking about my dads firm this came from a plumpish but fairly personable young man who was in the offing holding a bottle of champagne and a glass which he now refilled and also gave a shower of bubbles to erskinebrown just the best firm in the city rumpole quality work and charlie heres come to the bar he wants a seat in chambers erskinebrown sounded remarkably keen on the idea no doubt hoping for work from the firm of wisbeach bottomley perkins amp harris oh yes i sniffed danger and where would he like it there might be an inch or two available in the downstairs loo didnt we decide we were full up at the last chambers meeting i say you must be old rumpole young wisbeach was looking at me as though i were some extinct species still on show in the natural history museum im afraid ive got very little choice in the matter i had to admit youre not still practising are you charlie wisbeach had the gall to ask not really i suppose ive learned how to do it by now oh but claude erskinebrown told me youd soon be retiring did you claude did you tell young charlie that i turned upon the treacherous erskinebrown the searchlight eyes and spoke in the pained tones of the born crossexaminer well no not exactly rumpole the man fumbled for words well of course i just assumed youd be retiring some time dont count on it erskinebrown dont you ever count on it and claude told me that when you retired old chap there might be a bit of space in your chambers the usurper wisbeach apparently found the situation amusing a pretty enormous space is what i think he said didnt you claude well no charlie no not quite erskinebrowns embarrassment proved his guilt it sounds like an extremely humorous conversation i gave them both the look contemptuous charlie has a pretty impressive cv rumpole erskinebrown tried to change the subject as his newfound friend gave him another slurp see what curriculum vitae eton oh good at that as well is he i thought it was mainly drinkin claudes probably referring to the old school wisbeach could not of course grasp the rumpole joke oh eton well ive no doubt youll rise above the handicaps of a deprived childhood in somebody elses chambers as a matter of fact claude showed me your room wisbeach gave the damning evidence very attractive accommodation you did what claude charlie and i well we called in to see you but you were doing that long arson in snaresbrook historic spot your room wisbeach told me as though id never seen the place before fine views over the churchyard dont you look straight down at dr johnsons tomb its oliver goldsmiths as it so happens eton seemed to have done little for the mans store of essential knowledge no johnsons you cant tell an old etonian anything goldsmith i repeated with the last of my patience want to bet not particularly your old room needs a good deal of decorating of course and some decent furniture but the idea is we might share while youre still practising rumpole thats not an idea its a bad dream i directed my rejection of the offer at erskinebrown who started up a babble of rumpole think of the work that wisbeach could send us and i would like to let it be known that i still have work of my own to do and i do it best alone as a free spirit wrongs are still to be righted here i drained my plonk to the dregs and stood up umbrella in hand mr justice graves is still putting the boot in chief inspector brush is still referring to his unreliable notebook and an eightyearold timson has been banged up against her will not in eton college like you master charlie but in the tender care of the crockthorpe local authority the child is suspected of devilworship can you believe it an offence which i thought went out with the burning of witches is that your case rumpole erskinebrown looked deeply interested indeed yes and i have a formidable opponent none other than mizz liz probert with the full might of the local authority behind her so while there are such challenges to be overcome let me tell you claude and you charlie whatsit rumpole shall never sheath the sword never so i left the bar with my umbrella held aloft like the weapon of a crusader and the effect of this exit was only slightly marred by my colliding with a couple of trainee solicitors who were blocking the fairway as i apologized and lowered the umbrella i could distinctly hear the appalling wisbeach say funny old buffer in all my long experience down the bailey and in lesser courts i have not known a villain as slithery and treacherous as claude erskinebrown proved on that occasion as soon as he could liberate himself from the cuckoo he intended to place in my nest he dashed up to equity court in search of our head of chambers samuel ballard qc henry who was working late on longdelayed fee notes told him that soapy sam was at a service with his peer group the lawyers as christians society in the temple church undeterred claude set off to disturb the holy and devoutly religious soapy at prayer it was he told a mystified henry as he departed just the place to communicate the news he had in mind i am accustomed to mix with all sorts of dubious characters in pursuit of evidence and when i bought a glass of pommeroys for a lac i received an astonishing account of claudes entry into evensong pushing his way down the pew he arrived beside our head of chambers who had risen to his feet to an organ accompaniment and was about to give vent to a hymn attending worshippers were able to hear dialogue along the following lines erskinebrown have you joined us ballard was surprised of course ive joined lacs subscriptions in the post but i had to tell you about rumpole as a matter of urgency please erskinebrown this is no place to be talking about such matters as rumpole devilworshippers rumpoles in with devilworshippers claude said in a voice calculated to make our leaders flesh creep however at this moment the hymnsinging began and ballard burst out with god moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform he plants his footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm betraying a certain talent for improvisation my informant told me that he distinctly heard claude erskinebrown join in with rumpole in his mischievous way has taken on a case about some devilworshippers hes had them in your place your chambers i mean at which point ballard apparently turned and looked at the conniving claude with deep and horrified concern it was a time when everyone seemed intent on investigating the alleged satanic cult mirabelle jones continued to make films for showing before the juvenile court and this time she interviewed tracy timson in a room also equipped with a camera and recording apparatus in the childrens home rumpole and the children of the devil mirabelle arrived equipped with dolls not glamorous pinup girls but a somewhat drab and unsexy family consisting of a mum and dad grandpa and grandma who looked like solemn new england farmworkers tracy was ordered to play with this group and when without any real interest in the matter she managed to get grandpa lying on top of mum miss jones sucked in her breath and made a note which she underlined heavily later tracy was shown a book in which there was a picture of a devil with a forked tail who looked like an opera singer about to undertake mephistopheles in faust the questioning as recorded in the transcript then went along these lines you know who he is dont you tracy mirabelle was being particularly compassionate as she asked this no hes the devil you know about devils dont you and she added still smiling you put on a devils mask at school didnt you tracy i might have done tracy made an admission so what do you think of the devil then he looks funny tracy was smiling which i thought in all the circumstances was remarkably brave other funny hes got a tail the tails funny who first told you about the devil tracy i dont know the child answered but the persistent inquisitor was not to be put off so easily oh you must know did you hear about the devil at home was that it did dad tell you about the devil tracy shook her head mirabelle jones sighed and tried again does that picture of the devil remind you of anyone tracy still getting no answer mirabelle resorted to a leading question as was her way in these interviews do you think it looks like your dad at all in search of an answer to miss joness unanswered question i summoned cary and roz to my presence once again when they arrived escorted by the faithful bernard i put the matter as bluntly as i knew how at the mention of evil tracys mother merely looked puzzled the devil tracy dont know nothing about the devil of course not garys denial was immediate its not as if we went to church mr rumpole youve never heard of such a suggestion before i looked hard at tracys father the devil satan beelzebub are you saying the timson family knows nothing of such matters nothing at all mr rumpole when they came that morning when they came to get our tracy rozs eyes filled with tears as she relived the moment yes when they came for that what did you think was going on exactly i asked cary the question i thought they come about that shop that got done over wedges down gunston avenue theyve had me down the nick time and time again about it and it wasnt you straight up mr rumpole would i deceive you it has been known but ill believe you do you know who did it i asked cary no mr rumpole no i wont grass that i wont do ive had enough trouble being accused of grassing on gareth molloy when he was sent down for the tobler road supermarket job the timsons and the molloys are deadly enemies how could you know what they were up to my mate barry peacock was driving for them on that occasion they thought i knew something and grassed to chief inspector brush would i do a thing like that no i dont suppose you would so you thought the old bill were just there about ordinary legitimate crime you had no worries about tracy shes a good girl mr rumpole always has been roz was quick to remind me always cheerful isnt she roz her husband added to the evidence of character i enjoys her company so where the devil do these ideas come from sorry perhaps i shouldntve said that you know dominic molloy told the social worker you taught a lot of children satanic rituals you ever believed a molloy have you mr rumpole in court or out of it cary timson had a good point there but i rather doubted if i could convince the juvenile court of the wisdom learned at the old bailey when our conference was over i showed my visitors out and i thought i saw peering from a slightly open doorway at the end of the corridor the face of erskinebrown as horrified and intent as a passerby who suddenly notices that on the other side of the street a witches coven is holding its annual beano the door shut as soon as i clocked him and claude vanished within twenty minutes later i received a visit from soapy sam ballard qc our socalled head of chambers i dont believe that these events were unconnected as soon as he got in ballard sniffed the air as though detecting the scent of brimstone and said youve had them in here rumpole had who in here bollard those who owe allegiance to the evil one you mean the mr justice graves fan club no they havent been near the place y rumpole you know perfectly well who i mean oh yes of course i decided to humour the fellow they were all here lucifer beelzebub belial all present and correct high on a throne of royal state which far outshone the wealth of ormus and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat by merit raised to that bad eminence and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope grow up bollard i am representing an eightyearold child whos been torn from the bosom of her family and banged up without trial you see here rumpole the protector of the innocent the protector of devilworshippers ballard said those too if necessary i sat down at the desk and picked up the papers in a somewhat tedious affray rumpole every decent chambers has to draw the line somewhere does it there are certain cases certain clients even which are simply well not acceptable oh i do agree do you oh yes i agree entirely well then im glad to hear it soapy sam looked as gratified as a cleric hearing a deathbed confession from a lifelong heathen didnt i catch sight of you prosecuting an accountant for unpaid vat i asked the puzzled qc some cases are simply unacceptable far too dull to be touched by a decent barrister with a bargepole dont you agree old darling rumpole theres something i meant to raise with you the saintly sam was growing distinctly ratty then buck up and raise it im busy i returned to the affray young charlie wisbeach wants to come into these chambers hed bring us a great deal of highclass commercial work from his fathers firm unfortunately we have no room for him at the moment has he thought of a cardboard box in middle temple lane i thought this a helpful suggestion bollard didnt agree this is neither the time nor the place for one of your jokes rumpole you have a tenancy here and tenancies can be brought to an end especially if the tenant in question is carrying on a practice not in the best traditions of equity court there is something in this room which makes me feel uneasy oh i do so agree perhaps youll be leaving shortly im giving you fair warning rumpole i expect you to think it over at which our leader made for the door and i called after him oh before you go bollard why dont you look up exorcism in the yellow pages i believe theres an unfrocked bishop in stepney wholl quote you a very reasonable price and if you call again dont forget the holy water but the man had gone and i was left alone to wonder exactly what devilment cary timson had been up to i have or at a proper moment i will have a confession to make at this time i was presenting she who must be obeyed with a mystery which she no doubt found baffling although im afraid a probable solution presented itself to her mind far too soon i had reason to telephone a miss tatiana fern and not wishing to do so with hildas knowledge and as the lady in question left her house early i called when i thought she was still asleep i now suspect hilda was listening in on the bedroom extension although she lay motionless and with her eyes closed when i came back to bed later i discovered that when hilda went off to shop in harrods she spotted me coming out of knightsbridge tube station a place far removed from the temple and the old bailey and sleuthed me to a house in mowbray crescent which she saw me enter when the front door was opened by the aforesaid tatiana fern so it came about that she met marigold mr justice peatherstones outspoken wife and together they formed the opinion that rumpole was up to no good whatsoever of course she didnt tackle me openly about this but i could sense what was in the wind when she started up a conversation about the male libido at breakfast one morning it followed from something she had read in her daily telegraph theyre doing it again rumpole who are then ah causing trouble in the workplace yes i suppose so brushing up against their secretaries unnecessarily i suppose thats something you approve of rumpole i havent got a secretary hilda ive got a clerk called henry ive never felt the slightest temptation to brush up against henry and that answer you might have thought would finish the matter but hilda had more information from the telegraph to impart they put it all down to glands menve got too much something in their glands thats a fine excuse isnt it never tried it but i thought it over i suppose i might my client intends to rely on the glandular defence my lord it wouldnt wash hilda was positive when i was a child we were taught to believe in the devil im sure you were he tempts people particularly men i thought it was eve what i thought it was eve he tempted first thats you all over rumpole is it blame it all on a woman thats men all over hilda theres nothing id like more than to sit here with you all day discussing theology but ive got to get to work i was making my preparation for departure when she said darkly enjoy your lunchhour what did you say i said i hope you enjoy your lunchhour rumpole well i probably shall its thursday steak pie day at the pub in ludgate circus i shall look forward to that and a few other little treats besides i should imagine hilda was immersed in her newspaper again when i left her i knew then that no matter what explanation i had given she who must be obeyed had come to the firm conclusion that i was up to something devilish its a strange fact that it was not until nearly the end of the three score years and ten allotted to me by the psalmist that i was first called upon to perform in a juvenile court it was as i was soon to discover a place in which the law as we know and occasionally love it had very little place it was also a soulless chamber in crockthorpes already chipped and crumbling glass and concrete courthouse complex tracys three judges a large motherlylooking magistrate as chairwoman flanked by a small brighteyed sikh justice in a sari and a lean and anxious headmaster sat with their clerk young officious and bespectacled to keep them in order the defence team rumpole and the indispensable bernard together with the prosecutor mizz liz probert and a person from the council solicitors office sat at another long table opposite the justices miss mirabelle jones armed with a ponderous file was comfortably ensconced in the witness chair and a large television set was playing that hit video the interview with dominic molloy we had got to the familiar dialogue which started with mirabelles question he wanted you to play at devils this man did he said he was the devil yes the picture of the boy dominic alleged he was to be the devil and what were you supposed to be perhaps you were the devils children at which point rumpole ruined the entertainment by rearing to his hind legs and making an objection a process which in this court seemed as unusual and unwelcome as a guest lifting his soup plate to his mouth and slurping the contents at a state banquet at buckingham palace when i said i was objecting the clerk switched off the telly with obvious reluctance that was a leading question by the social worker i said although the fact would have been obvious to the most superficial reader of potted rules of evidence it and the answer are entirely inadmissable as your clerk will no doubt tell you and i added in an extremely audible whisper to bernard if he knows his business mr rumpole the chairwoman gave me her most motherly smile miss mirabelle jones is an extremely experienced social worker we think we can rely on her to put her questions in the proper manner i was just venturing to point out that on this occasion she put her question in an entirely improper manner i told her madam my bench will see the film out to the end mr rumpole youll have a chance to make any points later the clerk gave his decision in a manner which caused me to whisper to mr bernard her masters voice i hope they all heard but to make myself clear i said to madam chair my point is that you shouldnt be seeing this film at all we are going to continue with it now mr rumpole the learned clerk switched on the video again miss jones appeared to ask what was the game you had to play and dominic answered dance around dance around mirabelle joness shadow repeated in case we had missed the point now i want you to tell me dominic when did you meet this man at tracy timsons house is that where you met him its a leading question i said aloud but the performance continued and mirabelle asked do you know who he was and on the screen dominic nodded politely who was he mirabelle asked and dominic replied tracys dad as the video was switched off i was on my feet again youre not going to allow that evidence i couldnt believe it pure hearsay what a child who isnt called as a witness said to miss jones here a child weve had no opportunity of crossexamining said is nothing but hearsay absolutely worthless madam chairwoman mizz probert rose politely beside me yes miss probert liz got an even more motherly smile she was the favourite child and rumpole the black sheep of the family mr rumpole is used to practising at the old bailey and has managed to acquire a nodding acquaintance of the law of evidence i added and of course this court is not bound by strict rules of evidence where the welfare of a child is concerned youre not tied down by a lot of legal quibbles about hearsay quibbles mizz probert did i hear you say quibbles my righteous indignation was only half simulated you are free liz told the tribunal with the able assistance of miss mirabelle jones to get at the truth of this matter my learned friend was my pupil i was i must confess more than a little hurt i spent months a year of my life in bringing her up with some rudimentary knowledge of the law and when she says that the rule against hearsay is a legal quibble mr rumpole i dont think my bench wants to waste time on a legal argument the clerk of the court breathed heavily on his glasses and polished them briskly do they not indeed i was launched on an impassioned protest and no one was going to stop me so does it come to this down at the old bailey that backward and primitive place no villain can be sent down to chokey as a result of a leading question or a bit of gossip in the saloon bar or what a child said to a social worker and wasnt even crossexamined but little tracy timson eight years old can be banged up for an indefinite period snatched from the family that loves her without the protection the law affords to the most violent bank robber is that the proposition that mizz liz probert is putting before the court and which apparently finds favour in the socalled legal mind of the court official who keeps jumping up like a jackinthebox to tell you what to do even as i spoke the clerk having shined up his spectacles to his total satisfaction was whispering to his wellupholstered chair mr rumpole my bench would like to get on with the evidence speeches will come later the chairwoman handed down her clerks decision they will madam they most certainly will i promised and then as i sat down profoundly discontented liz presumed to teach me my business let me give you a tip rumpole she whispered i should keep off the law if i were you they dont like it around here while i was recovering from this lesson given to me by my expupil our chairwoman was addressing mirabelle as though she were a mixture of mother teresa and princess anne miss jones she purred were grateful for the thoroughness with which youve gone into this difficult case on behalf of the local authority oh thank you so much madam chair and weve seen the interview you carried out with tracy on the video film was there anything about that interview which you thought especially significant it was when i showed her the picture of the devil mirabelle answered she wasnt frightened at all in fact she laughed i thought is there any point in my telling you that what this witness thought isnt evidence i sent up a cry of protest carry on miss jones if youd be so kind madam chair decided to ignore the rumpole interruption i thought it was because it reminded her of someone she knew pretty well someone like dad mirabelle put in the boot with considerable delicacy someone like dad yes our chair was now making a careful note likely to be fatal to tracys hopes of liberty have you any questions mr rumpole so i rose to crossexamine its no easy task to attack a personable young woman from one of the caring professions but this mirabelle jones was so far as my case was concerned a killer i decided that there was only one way to approach her and that was to go in with all guns firing miss jones i loosed the first salvo you are i take it against cruelty to children of course that goes without saying does it can you think of a more cruel act to a little child than coming at dawn with the old bill and snatching it away from its mother and father without even a barbara doll for consolation barbie doll mr rumpole roz whispered urgently what its a barbie doll mrs timson says mr bernard instructed me on what didnt seem to be the most vital point in the case very well barbie doll and i returned to the attack on mirabelle without that or a single toy we dont want the children to be distracted by thoughts of home well yes you wanted tracy to concentrate on your dotty idea of devilworship i put it bluntly it wasnt a dotty idea mr rumpole and i had to act quickly tracy had to be removed from the presence of evil evil what do you mean by that exactly the witness hesitated momentarily at a loss for a suitable definition in a rational age and mizz liz probert rose to the rescue you ought to know mr rumpole havent you had plenty of experience of that down at the old bailey oh well played mizz probert i congratulated her loudly your pupilling days are over now miss mirabelle jones i returned to my real opponent lets come down if we may from the world of legend and hearsay and gossip and fantasy to what we call down at the old bailey hard facts you know that my client mr cary timson is a smalltime thief and a minor villain i have given the bench the list of dads criminal convictions yes mirabelle looked obligingly into her file its not the sort of record is it mr rumpole that you might expect a good father to have the chair smiled as she invited me to agree but i declined to do so oh i dont know i said are only the most lawabiding citizens meant to have children are we about to remove their offspring from sharepushers insider dealers and politicians who dont tell the truth if we did even this tireless local authority would run out of childrens homes to bang them up in speeches come later mr rumpole the loquacious clerk could keep silent no longer they will i promised him cary timson is a humble member of the clan timson that vast family of south london villains now remind us of the name of that imaginative little boy you interviewed on primetime television dominic molloy mirabelle knew it by heart molloy yes and as weve been told so often you are an extremely experienced social worker i think so with a vast knowledge of the social life in this part of south london i get to know a good deal yes of course i do of course so it will come as no surprise to you if i suggest a that the molloys are a large family of villains of a slightly more dangerous nature than the timsons i didnt know that but if you say so oh i do say so did you meet dominics mother mrs peggy molloy oh yes i had a good old chat with mum over a cuppa the bench and mirabelle exchanged smiles i and over a cuppa did she tell you that her husband gareth dominics dad was in wandsworth as a result of the tobler road supermarket affair mr rumpole my bench is wondering if this is entirely relevant the clerk had been whispering to the chair and handed the words down from on high then let your bench keep quiet and listen i told him itll soon find out so whats the answer miss jones did you know that i didnt know that dominics dad was in prison miss jones adopted something of a light insouciant tone and that he suspected tracys dad as you would call him cary timson of having been the police informer who put him there did he the witness seemed to find all this talk of adult crime somewhat tedious oh yes and i shall be calling hearsay evidence to prove it miss jones are you telling this bench that you an experienced social worker didnt bother to find out about the deep hatred that exists between the molloys and the timsons stretching back over generations of villainy to the dark days when crockthorpe was a village and the local villains swung at the crossroads i have nothing about that in my file mirabelle told us as though that made all such evidence completely unimportant nothing in your file and your file hasnt considered the possibility that young dominic molloy might have been encouraged to put an innocent little girl of a rival family in the frame as were inclined to call it down the old bailey it seems rather farfetched to me mirabelle gave me her most superior smile farfetched miss jones to you who believe in devilworship i believe in evil influences on children mirabelle chose her words carefully yes then let us just examine that your superstitions were first excited by the fact that a number of children appeared in the playground of crockthorpe junior wearing masks devils masks yes yet the only one you took into socalled care was tracy timson she was the ringleader i discovered that tracy had brought the masks to school in the kitbag with her lunch and her reading books did you ask her where she got them from i did of course she wouldnt tell me mirabelle smiled and i knew a possible reason for tracys silence even if cary had been indulging in satanic rituals his daughter would never have grassed on him i assumed it was from her father mirabelle inserted her elegant boot once more miss mirabelle jones lets hope that at some point well get to a little reliable evidence and that this case doesnt rely entirely on your assumptions the lunchbreak came none too soon and mr bernard and i went in search of a convenient wateringhole the jolly grocer was to pommeroys wine bar what the crockthorpe court was to the old bailey it was a large bleak pub and the lounge bar was resonant with the bleeping of computer games and the sound of muzak pommeroys claret may be at the bottom end of the market but i suspected that the jolly grocers red would be pure paint stripper i refreshed myself on a couple of bottles of guinness and a pork pie which was only a little better than minced rubber encased in cardboard and then we started the short walk back to the crockthorpe palais de justice on the way i let bernard know my view of the proceedings so far its all very well to accuse the deeply caring miss mirabelle jones of guessing i told him but weve got to tell the old darlings on the bench bonny bernard where the hell the masks came from our client mr cary timson you mean dad yes he denies all knowledge does he and then quite suddenly i came to a halt i found myself outside a shop called wedges carnival and novelty stores the window was full of games fancydress hats crackers halloween costumes father christmas costumes masks and other equipment for parties and general merrymaking it was while i was gazing with a wild surmise at these goods on display that i said to mr bernard in the somewhat awestruck tone of a watcher of the skies when a new planet swims into his ken well he would wouldnt he the honour of the timsons what do you mean mr rumpole whats the name of this street is it by any chance it was my instructing solicitor looking up at a street sign said gunston avenue who robbed wedges we had arrived back at the courthouse with ten minutes in hand and i found cary timson smoking a last fag on the gravel outside the main entrance his wife was with him and i lost no time in asking the vital question mr rumpole tracys dad looked round and lowered his voice you know i cant grass its the code of the timsons isnt it well let me tell you cary theres something even more important than your precious code i dont know it then oh yes you do you know it perfectly well get that wallet out why dont you look at the photographs you were so pleased to show me look at them cary cary took out his wallet and looked obediently at the pictures of the muchloved tracy is she less important than honour among thieves i asked them both roz looked at her husband her jaw set and her eyes full of determination i knew then what the answer to my question would have to be the afternoons proceedings dragged on without any new drama and although cary had told me what i needed to know i hadnt yet got his leave to use the information the extended timson family would have to be consulted when the days work was done i took the tube back to the temple and with my alcohol content having sunk to a dangerous low i went at once to pommeroys for first aid then i was unfortunate enough to meet my proposed cuckoo the old etonian charlie wisbeach who being not entirely responsible for his actions was administering champagne to a toothy and sloaney girl solicitor called if i can bring myself to remember the occasion when she instructed me in a robbery and forgot to summon the vital witness miss arabella munday wisbeach greeted me with a raucous cry of rumpole old man glass of bolly why what are you celebrating i did my best to sound icy all the same i possessed myself of a glass which he filled unsteadily ballard asked me in for a chat it seems there may be a vacancy in your chambers rumpole wherever ballard is theres always a vacancy what do you mean exactly pity you blotted your copybook my what not very clever of you was it defending devilworshippers with such a remarkably devout head of chambers it seems i may soon be occupying your room old man looking down on the temple church and oliver goldsmiths tomb i looked at the slightly swaying wisbeach for a long time and then as i sized up the enemy a kind of plot began to form itself in my mind dr johnsons i corrected the man again you told me it was oliver goldsmiths no i told you it was dr johnsons goldsmiths johnsons you want to bet charlie wisbeachs face moved uncomfortably close to mine does old rolypoly rumpole want to put his money where his mouth is does he ten quid says its johnson im going to give you odds charlie was clearly an experienced gambler three to one against johnson oily goldsmith evens twenty to one the field since im taking over the room well check on it tomorrow why not now i challenged him what why not check on it now i repeated thirty quid in my pocket and i can take a taxi home ten quid down and youll walk all right then come on arabella bring the bottle old girl as they left pommeroys i hung behind and then went to the telephone on the wall by the gents i had seen the light in ballards window when i came up from temple station he usually worked late partly because he was a slow study so far as even the simplest brief was concerned and partly i believe because of a natural reluctance to go home to his wife marguerite a trained nurse who had once been the old baileys merciless matron i put in a quick telephone call to soapy sam and advised him to look out of his window in about five minutes time and pay particular attention to any goings on in the temple churchyard then i went to view the proceedings from a safe distance what i saw and what sam ballard saw from his grandstand view was charlie wisbeach holding a bottle and a blonde he gave a triumphant cry of oliver goldsmith and then mounted the tomb as though it were a hunter and alternately swigging from the bottle and kissing miss arabella munday he laughed loudly at his triumph over rumpole it was a satanic sound so far as our head of chambers was concerned and this appalling graveyard ritual convinced him that charlie wisbeach who no doubt spent his spare moments reciting the lords prayer backwards was a quite unsuitable candidate for a place in a christian chambers such as equity court that night important events were also taking place in my clients home in morrison close crockthorpe numerous timsons were assembled in the front room assisted by minor villains and their wives garys uncle fred the undisputed head of the family was there as was uncle dennis who should long ago have retired from a life of crime to his holiday home on the costa del sol i have done my best to reconstruct the debate from the account given to me by roz after a general family discussion and exchange of news uncle fred gave his opinion of the wedges job bloody joke shop i always said it was a bad idea robbing a joke shop there was always money left in the till overnight our info told us that and the security was hopeless through the back door like uncle dennis explained the thinking behind the enterprise what you want to leave the stuff round my place for cary was naturally aggrieved because the booty had it transpired included a box of satanic masks to which as they were left in her fathers garage young tracy had easy access you should have known how dangerous them things were what with young kids and social workers about well freds was under constant surveillance uncle dennis explained as was mine and seeing as you and roz was away on monday oh thank you very much cary was sarcastic and den knowing where you kept your garage key uncle fred was doing his best to protect uncle dennis from charges of carelessness lucky the bill never thought of looking there gary pointed out i meant to come back for the stuff some time it was a bit of a trivial matter it slipped my memory quite honestly uncle dennis was notoriously forgetful once having left his fishermans diary containing his name and address at the scene of a crime well it wasnt no trivial matter for our tracy no i knows roz sorry about that look den cary started were not asking you to put your hands up to chief inspector brush yes we are cary roz was in deadly earnest thats just what were asking you got to do it for our tracy hang about a bit uncle dennis looked alarmed who says we got to and then roz told him mr rumpole so the next morning dennis timson gave evidence in the juvenile court although i had been careful to explain his criminal record he looked in his comfortable tweed jacket and cavalry twill trousers the sort of chap that might star on gardeners question time and i could see that madam chair took quite a shine to him after some preliminaries we got to the heart of the matter i was after the money really dennis told the bench but i suppose i got a bit greedy like i just shoved a few of those boxes in the back of the vehicle then i didnt want to take them round to my place so i left them in garys garage why did you do that i asked well young cary didnt have anything to do with the wedges job so i thought theyd be safe enough there of course i was under considerable pressure of work at that time and it slipped my mind to tell cary and roz about it did you see what was in any of those cases i had a little lookin seemed like a lot of carnival masks that sort of rubbish so young tracy getting hold of the devils masks was just the usual timson cockup was it what did you say mr rumpole the chairwoman wasnt quite sure she could believe her ears it was a stockup for christmas madam chair i explained oh one more thing mr dennis timson do you know why young dominic molloy has accused tracy and her father of fiendish rituals in a churchyard course i do uncle den had no doubt peggy molloy told barry peacocks wife and barrys wife told my doreen down the needle arms last thursday we cant possibly have this evidence liz probert rose to object perhaps shed caught the habit from me oh really miss probert i looked at her in amazement and why ever not what barrys wife told mrs timson is pure hearsay mizz probert was certain of it of course it is and i gave her back her own argument and pure hearsay is totally acceptable in the juvenile court where the interest of the child is at stake we are not bound by legal quibbles i agree madam chair with every word which has fallen from your respected and highly learned clerk now then mr timson what did you hear exactly gareth thought cary had grassed on him over the tobler road supermarket job so they got young dominic to put the frame round tracy and her dad so what you are telling us mr timson is that this little boys evidence was a pure invention at last madam chair seemed to have got the message uncle dennis gave her the most charming and friendliest of smiles as he said well you cant trust the molloys can you my lady everyone knows theyre a right family of villains there comes a time in many cases when the wind changes the tide turns and youre either blown on to the rocks or make safe harbour uncle denniss evidence changed the weather and after it i noticed that madam chair no longer returned miss mirabelle joness increasingly anxious smile mizz proberts final address was listened to in stony silence and i was startled to hear a distinct thank you from the bench as i sat down after a short period of retirement the powers that were to shape young tracy timsons future announced that they were dissatisfied by the evidence of any satanic rituals and she was accordingly to be released from custody forthwith before this judgment was over the tears which roz had fought to control since the dawn raid were released and at her moment of joy she cried helplessly i couldnt resist it i got into mr bernards car and followed the timson cortina to the childrens home we waited until we saw the mother and father emerge from that gaunt building each holding one of their daughters hands as they came down the steps to the street they swung her in the air between them and when they got into the car they were laughing miss mirabelle jones who had brought the order for release stood in the doorway of the lilacs and watched without expression and then tracys legal team drove away to do other cases with less gratifying results when i got home after a conference in an obtaining credit by fraud and a modest celebration at pommeroys wine bar hilda was not in the best of moods when i told her that i brought glad tidings all she said was you seem full of yourself rumpole been having a good time have you a great time managed to extricate young tracy timson from the clutches of the caring society and shes back in the bosom of her family and ill be getting another brief defending dennis timson on a charge of stealing from wedges carnival novelties well i expect ill think of something i poured myself a glass of wine to lighten the atmosphere and hilda said somewhat darkly you never wanted to be a judge did you rumpole judging people condemning them no thats not my line exactly anyway judges are meant to keep quiet in court and theyre much more restricted arent they it may have sounded an innocent question on a matter of general interest but her voice was full of menace restricted i repeated playing for time stuck in court all day in the public eye and on their best behaviour they have far less scope than you to indulge in other activitiesactivities hilda oh yes perhaps its about time we really talked for once rumpole is there something that you feel you ought to tell me well yes hilda yes as a matter of fact there is i had in fact done something which i found it strangely embarrassing to mention i suppose youve had time to think up some ridiculous defence oh no i plead guilty there are no mitigating circumstances rumpole how could you the court was clearly not going to be moved by any plea for clemency temporary insanity but i did it at enormous expense you had to pay it would scarcely be an exaggeration to say that hilda snorted well they dont give these things away for nothing i imagine not one hundred smackers but it is your birthday next week rumpole i cant think what my birthdays got to do with it at least i had managed to puzzle her a little everything hilda ive just bought us two tickets for the scales of justice ball now what was it you wanted us to talk about all i can say is that hilda looked extremely confused it was as though mr injustice graves was just about to pass a stiff sentence of chokey and had received a message that as it was the queens birthday there would be a general amnesty for all prisoners well she said not at the moment perhaps some other time and she rescued the lamb chops from the oven with the air of a woman suddenly and unexpectedly deprived of a welljustified and satisfactory outburst of rage matters were not altogether resolved when we found ourselves at a table by the dance floor in the savoy hotel in the company of sam ballard and his wife marguerite who always even in a ball gown seemed to carry with her a slight odour of antiseptic and sensible soap also present were marigold featherstone wifeof a judge whose foot was never far from his mouth claude erskinebrown and liz probert with her partner comortgagee and fellow member of equity court young dave inchcape too bad guthries sitting at newcastle claude commiserated with marigold featherstone on the absence of her husband and told her phillys in swansea prosecuting the leisure centre murder never mind claude and marguerite ballard added menacingly ill dance with you oh yes erskinebrown her husband was smiling you have my full permission to shake a foot with my wife oh well yes thank you very much i say i thought charlie wisbeach and his girlfriend were going to join us claude seemed unreasonably disappointed no erskinebrown the ballard lips were even more pursed than usual young wisbeach wont be joining us not at the ball and certainly not in chambers oh really i thought it was more or less fixed i think claude its become more or less unstuck i disillusioned him in the ensuing chatter i could hear marigold featherstone indulging in some whispered dialogue with my wife which went something like this have you faced him with it yet hilda i was just going to do it when he told me we were coming here he behaved well for once they do that occasionally dont let it put you off further whispers were drowned as erskinebrown said to ballard in a loud and challenging tone may i ask you why charlie wisbeach isnt joining us after all not on this otherwise happy occasion erskinebrown i can only say practices well of course he practises in the commercial court and claude turned to me full of suspicion do you know anything about this rumpole the know anything nothing whatever i certainly wasnt prepared to incriminate myself i have told wisbeach we simply have no accommodation i do not regard him as a suitable candidate to share rumpoles room it will be far better for everyone if we never refer to the matter again so our head of chambers disposed of the case of rumpole v wisbeach and the band played an old number from the days of my youth called smoke gets in your eyes now as head of chambers ballard claimed his alleged rights i think i should lead my wife out on to the floor no no ballard with all due respect i rose to my feet as the longestserving chambers wife she that is mrs rumpole should be led out first care for a dance hilda rumpole are you sure you can manage it hilda was astonished perfectly confident thank you and without a moments hesitation i applied one hand to her waist seized her hand with the other and steered her fearlessly out on to the parquet where though i say it myself i propelled my partner for life in strict time to the music i even indulged in a little fancy footwork as we cornered in front of a table full of solicitors youre chasseing rumpole she was astounded oh yes i do that quite a lot nowadays wherever did you learn to be quite honest with you if youre capable of such a thing she had not been altogether won over prom a miss tatiana fern i looked her up in the yellow pages onetime southern counties ballroom champion i took a few lessons where did you take lessons place called mowbray crescent somewhere off sloane street hilda you knew oh dont ever think you can do anything i dont know about at which point the ballards passed us not dancing in perfect harmony youre really quite nippy on your feet rumpole marguerite ballards looking absolutely green with envy and then after a long period of severity she actually smiled at me you are an old devil rumpole she said beauty is truth and truth beauty thats surely one of the silliest statements ever written by a great poet i have known perfectly reliable witnesses men and women of honour who were certainly no oil paintings and i have known as many unreliable ones of the sort that would make the susceptible claude erskinebrown pant and tremble and come out with urgent invitations to das rheingold if they happened to be of the female persuasion there are of course no certainties in the matter and a beautiful woman may yet be extremely truthful and follow all the rules laid down by john keats although this may not be all you need to know on earth i am accustomed to treat women with considerable respect not to say caution my wife hilda known to me only as she who must be obeyed not only rules the roost at our socalled mansion flat in the gloucester road but keeps a check on my conduct in court and on my few leisure hours in pommeroys wine bar mrs phillida erskinebrown qc the undoubted portia of our chambers is a prosecutor of deadly charm she is held by many perhaps most hacks down the old bailey to be beautiful but does the truth always emerge as a result of her sharp crossexamination and charming closing speeches mizz liz probert is a young radical who sees me alternately as a hero of the class war and as a contemptible puppet of the ancien regime her views entirely depending on the poverty or wealth of the client i happen to be defending at the time these are the women in whose company i pass my days my clients are less frequently female as oldfashioned villains like the timsons take the view that a womans place is in the home where she should be cooking the dinner and minding the children and not out robbing banks which is a mans job in their opinion it is true that certain notable women have figured in some of the trials i have conducted and i still cannot think of kathy trelawny a young person much given to ethnic clothing and dangerous substances without a slight catch of the breath and a quickening of the pulse during my military service with the raf groundstaff i had similar feelings about an airforcewoman of great vivacity called bobby but she became hitched to pilot officer three fingers dogherty and sank below my particular horizon but attractive as these characters undoubtedly were they couldnt be classed as what sherlock holmes called the woman the undoubted winner of this title was elizabeth casterini whose coppercoloured hair and blue eyes i will always remember as she put her hand affectionately on mine or drew the most soulful music from her violin when at work with the casterini trio there was also the fact that from the very start of this story she had clearly taken a considerable shine to me when hilda told me that erskinebrown had invited us to a concert and she had accepted the engagement i was less than delighted young claude had recently shown himself to be extremely treacherous in trying to prise me out of my room and i thought it but a poor recompense to ask me to submit myself to what for all i knew might be seven hours of unadulterated wagner when we were installed in the wigmore hall however i was relieved to notice that there were only three musicians on the stage the casterini trio looked to be in their thirties the pianist was what you might expect a thin longhaired man who played the loud notes as though they sent an electric tremor through his body and the soft ones as though he was stroking a muchloved cat by contrast the cello player was redfaced and burly he sawed away at the instrument between his knees with large see rumpole and the alternative society in rumpole of the bailey penguin books competent hands and looked more like an amateur rugby football player than a musician the woman of the trio was straightbacked sitting forward on a spindly gilt chair and i suppose i had realized she was goodlooking before the music had its usual soporific effect on me and i closed my eyes my sleep was disturbed by what i thought was a wireless playing but when i called out to hilda in that twilight state of half awakening to turn the damn thing off she dug me in the ribs and reminded me that we were at a concert so my eyes opened and sitting there as i was in the front row with nothing between us but a few potted ferns and a couple of yards of stage i saw the violinist smiling at me as i have said her hair was a reddish gold her face heartshaped and her smile was half nervous half amused but generally assuming that we shared some secret and when the music stopped and she stood up very straight between the two men wearing some sort of loose dress which gave her a medieval appearance she seemed to be bowing and smiling for me alone after the show i discovered that chamber music leaves you with a terrible thirst and i led my party to a pub down a side street many of the concertgoers had felt the same need and the place was packed hilda was full of gratitude to erskinebrown who had as he was at pains to tell us only invited the rumpoles because his wife phillida was doing a long fraud in swansea and her mother enjoyed only the music of andrew lloyd webber hilda was saying she found that schubert who it seemed i had slept through took her right out of herself can you get back inside yourself to receive a large gin and tonic i asked her and then fought my way to the bar i think i knew as i stood trying to catch the eye of the overworked young man with the cropped head and the earring an enthusiast whose ambition in life seemed to be to pour a drink for everyone except rumpole that someone was watching me even before i heard a soft and unexpected voice i was sure it was you i saw that the violinist had detached herself from her fellow musicians who were standing clutching pints further up the bar and then as i must have looked w a trifle bewildered she added elizabeth casterini now surely you remember of course i had no recollection of ever having seen her before but i felt i couldnt offend her by admitting as much id love to see you again she said if you ever had time for me could we meet somewhere quieter than this could we i had been chugging along as usual round the criminal courts and pommeroys wine bar did i really want to be blown offcourse by this siren voice does you want serving or doesnt you the fellow with the earring gave me his attention at the most inconvenient moment at the same time the cellist having finished his pint was calling come on elizabeth weve got to go please ring me she was smiling as she moved away the numbers im there most mornings and then she was gone i made my way back to hilda with my fists full of assorted drinks and it was clear that she hadnt noticed my encounter at the bar when she and claude had claimed their glasses i pulled out a pencil and made a note on my programme what are you writing rumpole she who must be obeyed misses very little oh i wanted to remember the name of the tune they were playing what was it again erskinebrown schuberts piano trio in b flat major but its on the programme already maybe it was but i had written when i knew i had succeeded in remembering the number i said thank you claude ive got it it was a week later a long dull week doing a post office fraud in acton that i felt driven for the sake of adding a little colour to my life to dial the number on my programme elizabeth casterini answered at once in the soft outofbreath voice i kept remembering the other members of the trio were practising in the background she said i was going to ring you if you hadnt rung me oh good what about a spot of lunch then of course id love to we fixed on rules for the next thursday a day we were having off so a juryman could attend his motherinlaws funeral rules in maiden lane is one of the few places where you can still find steak and kidney pudding and a total absence of kiwi fruit on the morning of the assignation i called in at alfredos barber shop in fetter lane to smarten up the rumpole appearance just a little touch off the moustache mr rumpole and the hair combed forward in the modern manner that knocks years off your life will you have a little fragrancy on that now sir alfred crooks is a small birdlike man who has cut my hair and trimmed my moustache since the days of the penge bungalow murders we grew old together and as he is a cockney from bermondsey i have no idea why he gave his shop its italianate title i was doubtful about the fragrancy which would be a new departure for me i asked what he was suggesting machismo for men mr rumpole he told me just a light manly sort of perfume and very you if i may say so our younger customers say it does wonders for the quality of life may i waft a little on you sir oh waft away then if youre really sure it was a day when all rules were to be broken we have a truly distinguished head of hair now the man said as he wafted seems a shame to put that old hat of yours on it sir i am ashamed to say that i stopped at the savoy tailors on my way down the strand and stung by alfreds comment invested in a new hat so there it was hanging up in rules and there was i clipped and perfumed waiting in a crimson recess under an alabaster statue of a naked goddess in a glass dome crumbling bread and wondering if the encounter the invitation and its acceptance hadnt been part of a curious dream but then she was there in front of me smiling a breathless apology dressed in a suede jacket a cream silk shirt and velvet trousers and smelling of fresh fields while i had the uneasy feeling that i was giving off the odour of a cutprice dance hall in buenos aires well now i hoisted up a menu as soon as she had settled down i dont know what youd like steak and kidney or rare beef or irish stew you dont eat meat do you elizabeth looked as amazed as she would have been if id confessed to robbing church poorboxes or raping traffic wardens well it has been known oh how longs that been going on well i suppose i must have put away a herd or two of cows over the years a few flocks of sheep mr rumpole she didnt sound strict only as though she wanted to reason with me please horace horace im afraid so you dont believe in killing animals do you she started her gentle persuasion well animals do spend quite a lot of time killing each other perhaps you should have more respect for them than they have for themselves she smiled reasonably well of course naturally every time i pass a sheep i raise my hat i say ive got an enormous amount of respect for you especially for your kidneys youre making a joke she was still smiling its a bad habit ive got into i was saved from further apologies by the waiter appearing with his order pad meanwhile elizabeth was surveying our fellow guests who in rules at lunchtime were largely of the masculine persuasion look at all these men around us eating meat pink faces selfsatisfied accountants probably you dont want to look like them do you so what about a selection of fresh vegetables well if you really think i had after all come to see her and not the roast pheasant perhaps some cheese afterwards dont lets go mad just vegetables for you sir the waiter asked in the sort of voice you use when talking to the terminally ill yes yes of course and i asked the man do you think i want to look like an accountant you look very nice elizabeth told me when the waiter had left us so do you in fact you look beautiful all sort of silvery you mean knocking on a bit oh i dont think age matters in the least im sure youre right not when it comes to love did you say love i could hardly believe my ears but elizabeth somewhat dashed my hopes by saying in fact i can love most people cant you horace you strike me as being someone full of love well yes i suppose so i suppose i can love people with a few exceptions mr justice oliphant for instance or sam ballard hes the head of my chambers whats the matter with him horace isnt he lovable well i wouldnt say that being lovable was one of soapy sams most obvious qualities love him thats what he probably needs most whats your birth sign so we went on to a discussion of the heavens and i was learning that venus was moving into the path of sagittarius my star sign when the waiter appeared with the wine list i was just about to choose a better than usual claret to ginger up the vegetables when she said meeting yous quite enough stimulation for me horace isnt it for you well yes more than enough so im sure we dont need wine whats their water like i had to confess that i had never tasted the water in rules or anywhere else come to that after the waiter had been dispatched to fetch a jug full of this unusual tipple i asked her why shed wanted to have lunch with me does there have to be a reason there usually is you say that because youre a lawyer she leant forward confidentially i just admired you so much when you were doing billys case and then i saw you looking at me during the schubert i thought id like to get to know you better billys case a boy i was at college with he was put on trial and you defended him brilliantly i used to come and watch you from the public gallery every day you must remember what could i say that billy rang no bell with me or i must have been too busy in court to pay the attention to the public gallery it clearly deserved i took the line of maximum politeness and said of course i remember at which point the waiter returned and asked me if id like to taste the water when the joke was over and the man had withdrawn elizabeth pushed back her hair looked down at the tablecloth and confessed ive been so lonely lately i dont believe that i mean youre part of a trio we still play marvellously together she agreed but tom cant seem to realize i am married to desmond so she began to tell me about her life with the musicians desmond casterini was the pianist and her husband tom randall was the hefty athlete astride the cello he it seemed was terribly jealous of desmond and desmond was inexcusably suspicious of tom the men quarrelled over elizabeth and their jealousy she told me became a sort of unlovely bond between them in this welter of masculine emotion she felt left out unconsidered no more than an object they were both fighting over and desmond made her nervous because he had this wild blood in him what do you mean his fathers half italian half irish very passionate apparently when he was young and then she took me completely by surprise as she said its his fathers gun his whatr an old revolver desmond keeps it as a sort of memento also he says he needs it for our protection i suppose his father had enemies you mean it works i hated to think of her in such a household hes got ammunition she nodded and i advised her to tell him to hand it in to the police i thought it must be an unnerving thing to have about especially for a vegetarian were together so much we three she sighed again and began to make little indented tramlines with her fork on the tablecloth sometimes i feel i want to get miles away from both of them it would help so much if you and i could meet just occasionally so i could have someone to talk to i dont see why that couldnt be arranged i get this feeling that something awfuls going to happen she said very quietly dont ask me what exactly then i looked down and saw a strange sight her hand was on mine it felt cool and comforting and as if there was no weight to it at all she kept it there for a little while and then i turned to the vegetables which were no substitute for this brief contact we talked of other things their strange rehearsal room in an old block of studios near warren street station and my triumphs in various cases when we parted in maiden lane she kissed my cheek swiftly and ran off to greet a dawdling taxi i didnt see her again until after the events which seemed to confirm all her most terrible fears im not sure how much truth there was around us legal hacks at that period but there was certainly a good deal of beauty i have already told you about miss dorothy generally known as dot clapton who was now installed behind the typewriter in the clerks room getting on with her job while turning the head of claude erskinebrown a part of his body which at the sight of any reasonably attractive young woman spins round like a teetotum dot it appeared to me was very young very pretty extremely sensible and had her head screwed on firmly of one thing i am sure the relationship between claude erskinebrown and dot never reached the sultry f temperature which he hoped for she treated him politely and ignored all his attempts to impress her as an important barrister or to flirt with her as a dashing young opera buff now it appeared that on his way into the clerks room one quiet afternoon when most of the numbers of chambers had better things to do claude heard through the door which had been left open a crack the voice of henry our clerk addressing dot in a manner most lascivious i have since verified the words used and henry undoubtedly referred to the deep pools of your eyes the suggestion of soft breasts beneath that modest white shirt and the whisper your stockings make when you cross your legs to which dot was heard to reply you mustnt say those things you know you mustnt thus displaying her good taste in english prose as well as much sensible caution at the end of it all henry suggested they get far away from the grey little people they worked with to a place where he hoped that their bodies might mingle unable to contain himself any longer claude burst into the clerks room where he saw henry on his knees and dot looking becomingly modest when he asked what had been going on henry rose in a dignified manner and said he and our typist had been sending out fee notes so you and the other ladies and gentlemen in chambers all get your creature comforts im also trying to fix your civil at romford county court now is there any other information you was requiring sir the first i heard of this remarkable scene was when i was walking back from the old bailey in the company of soapy sam ballard qc the alleged head of our chambers we had been codefending and i had managed to get his client out as well as my own so he was in a fairly sunny mood until claude came panting up to him with the tale of dire deeds and desperate misconduct in the clerks room at equity court just the man i wanted erskinebrown addressed our head he didnt seem to want me particularly were in deep trouble ballard i have every reason to believe theres a serious case of harassing in our midst what on earths harassing ballard was puzzled well harassing then but people call it harassing nowadays because americans do i dont understand that erskinebrown youre not american i told him anyway im always being harassed by solicitors who want their papers the day before yesterday and by henry who wants me in two places at once and by mr injustice graves who frequently interrupts my crossexamination this is sexual harassing claude was clearly not interested in the less sensual variety someone is trying to force their amorous advances on a defenceless and innocent young woman did you say sexual ballards nose quivered slightly im afraid so that makes a difference indeed it does whos the guilty party ballard asked but claude didnt want to hand over the leading role in such a dramatic inquiry just yet someone of importance to us all he merely dropped a hint someone weve known for a long time it cant be rumpole soapy sam looked at me with deep suspicion no of course it cant erskinebrown reassured him look i just thought id warn you of whats in the wind ill report further when ive got a full statement from the complainant the who ballard as usual found events travelling a little too fast for him the girl in question erskinebrown was prepared to handle her whoever she might be in my view we must get her cooperation before we move an inch further its the most delicate situation oh yes of course ballard was persuaded clearly harassing indeed we cant possibly have that at equity court my lunch at rules with elizabeth casterini had a strange effect on me i couldnt forget it and at odd and inappropriate moments during the day waiting outside court for instance or listening to the speeches of learned friends i would remember the look in her eyes the faint somehow apologetic smile as she laid her hand on mine i felt that there was something a little gross about my existence compared to the purity of hers it was this thought that led me to surprise she who must be obeyed as we sat down to dinner in the kitchen offroxbury mansions by saying no chops hilda what did you say rumpole she looked startled i said no chops thank you as a matter of fact im giving up meat youre what people who eat meat start to look like chartered accountants well youve eaten enough of it you ought to be much better at sums by now are you feeling quite well rumpole i feel wonderfully well thank you hilda ill just take a selection of vegetables boiled potatoes and cabbage thats the only selection weve got will that be quite all right for you rumpole what on earth are you putting into that glass i was as it so happened filling the usual repository of pommeroys plonk at the tap water hilda anything wrong no nothing wrong i suppose nothing wrong with water so far as it goes its just that its well so unlike you rumpole people should be sufficiently intoxicated with each other why should we need artificial stimulants it was no doubt an indulgence to repeat elizabeths words but hilda was delighted by them why indeed its very nice of you to say that rumpole and then as she sat beside me and helped herself to chops she gave a doubtful sniff do you notice a rather peculiar smell rumpole not particularly perhaps its the new washingup liquid the tropical fruits detergent i really dont know why i bought it no hilda its not the washingup liquid it is machismo for men i acquired a bottle from alfredos in fetter lane when i popped in for a haircut a haircut and there seems to be less of your moustache i have also got a new hat the old one was getting a bit frayed round the edges and then i must say she surprised me by saying rumpole you did all this for me what did you say hilda just as you learned to dance especially for me and came to the concert to get a bit more civilized and gave yourself a new and powerful fragrance it was i must say an unusual evening in the mansion flat for as we sat opposite each other at the kitchen table i felt hildas hand upon mine and she was looking into my eyes with quite unusual affection i should perhaps if im to make clear to you how the matter of the chambers harassment developed explain to you the geography of our clerks room it is a nondescript fairly illorganized and often overcrowded office space where henry and dot clapton carry on their business and where members search hopefully for briefs and consult henrys diary in order to get their marching orders a smaller room leads off it which houses the coffee machine and a set of all england law reports which i occasionally feel called upon to consult i was pursuing a bit of elusive law which was relevant to a case of receiving stolen fish when i heard erskinebrown accost our typist who i knew to be reading hello magazine and eating her lunchtime sandwiches im not ashamed to say that i earwigged the conversation and this is roughly what i heard starting with erskinebrown saying how glad he was to find miss clapton alone are you mr erskinebrown dot sounded less than astonished would you like to and here erskinebrown gave a cautious cough come into my room well not really sir you see im on telephone duty its henrys lunchhour then there was a silence broken by erskinebrowns dot is there anything youd like to tell me what would you like to know i could tell you the time dot suggested brightly its precisely youre young dot erskinebrown clearly wanted to talk of more serious matters and im sure this is very embarrassing for you but nowadays well girls of your age are much more open about sex and all that do you mind if i go on with my sandwiches was dots rather discouraging reply not if it makes this easier for you im sure you realize that men do get these well these urges that come over them from time to time ill take your word for it mr erskinebrown and you are of course desperately fanciable i mean to say youre an extraordinarily attractive young lady i do my best im sure you do im absolutely sure you do the thing is that no man is entitled to show his feelings in the workplace i agree with that quite honestly dots answer sounded as though it came through a fairsized bite of sandwich we get a short enough lunchhour anyway dot erskinebrown adopted the gentle reassuring tones of the father confessor id like you to feel that we dont have any secrets from each other you can trust me and i want you to succeed in equity court perhaps rising from typist to junior clerk and then who knows but for your own sake tell me what youre really feeling i mean if you dont cooperate we cant do anything about it there was an interruption then as i heard young dave inchcape come in and ask dot to type out an urgent statement of claim she agreed to do so with a vivacity and enthusiasm altogether absent from her voice when dealing with the concerned claude as soon as they were alone once more i heard him say we really cant talk here you seem to be managing i heard dot put paper into her typewriter in a businesslike manner i mean we cant talk properly why dont you just come into my room for a moment and look at your etchings now miss clapton was sounding distinctly sharp no of course not claude laughed uneasily anyway i dont have etchings english watercolours actually shall we go i dont think so mr erskinebrown quite honestly i must get on with mr inchcapes statement of claim he seemed quite desperate for it didnt he poor man and then her typewriter started to clatter energetically and claude must have retreated when i emerged with the relevant volume of the all england law reports under my arm dot was alone and looking as though something had happened which she had not expected in a respectable barristers chambers while these events were unfolding in our chambers at equity court a more serious and terrible drama was involving elizabeth casterini whom i had come to look on as my newfound friend the best thing i can do is to give you the facts as they emerged in the case in which i appeared the casterini trios rehearsal room was in butterworth buildings which was as elizabeth had said a rundown poorly decorated and underheated block near warren street station on each floor reached by an antique lift which the passengers had to start by pulling on a rope there were a number of rooms from which the sound of music was constantly emerging these could be rented by the hour but the casterinis had a permanent lien on theirs which was on the fifth floor on the floor below a room was often rented by peter matheson a horn player who had been at college with elizabeth and was to be an important witness at the trial at about a quarter past six on the evening in question matheson was unlocking his room when desmond casterini came down from the floor above using the stairs as the lift was out of order he seemed extremely agitated and said that something had happened to tom randall the cello player at that stage matheson noticed blood on desmond casterinis cuff they went upstairs together and into the casterinis rehearsal room there matheson saw randall lying on the floor his clothes bloodstained and his face drained of all colour he had been shot through the heart matheson used the phone on the wall to make a call and the police arrived on the scene at twentyfive minutes to seven the body was removed to the mortuary and the room was searched photographed and dusted for fingerprints these proceedings were in the control of detective inspector baker and detective sergeant straw it was ds straw who found in a space between the wall and the piano an old colt revolver from which one shot had recently been fired and with two bullets left in the chamber so the trio was reduced to a duet elizabeth casterini and her husband were playing a brahms sonata at the purcell room when the police officers appeared in the audience during the interval di baker arrested desmond casterini and told him that he would be charged with the murder of thomas paul randall and that anything he said would be taken down in writing and might be used in evidence at his trial after i had read of casterinis arrest in the times i tried to speak to elizabeth but there was the sound of ringing in what i imagined to be an empty room and no reply three weeks went by and then she rang me at chambers she wanted to see me urgently she was due at a recording session in soho and before that she had to call at the festival hall could we meet but not please in an office somewhere by the river in the fresh air she didnt want to feel she was meeting a lawyer but seeing a friend she needed a friend now of all times when what she had feared for so long seemed at last to have happened i had been wondering when i would see her again and i was ashamed to find myself grateful to a murder for bringing us together i did as i was told and took a taxi across waterloo bridge to the festival hall i was waiting by the river looking on a misty morning towards st pauls when i heard a hoot and elizabeth emerged from a brightred sports car which she left by a sign marked no parking she was wearing jeans and a big white sweater hadnt slept but otherwise calm looking pale as though sher ups and asked she took my arm brushy if id been waiting long is morning hardly at all but i an e g randalls death and her and then she told me admirable lucidity and courhusbands arrest briefly a g g e ended and all absolute age its such a nightie desmond you will look after him nonsense of course abov g out y and the marvellous wont you ive told him way you did billys case im you mean he wants n we both want you to gg f invaluable mr bernard to i told her that id arra g ed instruct me visit her husband in pns ygy never mind about the legal i wanted to see you gt business ive felt so alon im sure ave you on our side now i know and its wonderful tt right desmonds going to be a ill do my best yoked at her watch but i suppose its ridiculous she g music session for a corn life has to go on im f always springtime thats mercial under your y what im playing for not schubert god they havent ruined schubert mendelssohn thanlj ed down at the river and said for me and then she ways calling they keep asking miserably the police me for statements nyp have you given them g anything that wont help dont worry i a rse shall i see you soon desmond and you of g she had made a statement i felt a wave of disapt witnesses better not and barristers arent ntil the trials over ill leave you to bernard again and then shall we lu lt id like that very mw cheek more purposeful than so i got another kis the first and then she walked quickly to her car g t in and started the engine she didnt drive away at once however i saw her lift the car phone she was still talking to it when i walked away towards the old bailey and a isss sensational trial with no beautiful witnesses it was not only the ghastly case of harassment reported by erskinebrown that persuaded soapy sam ballaid that moral standards were breaking down all over he world and particularly in equity court liz and her comortgagee managed to produce another sensational scandal young david inchcape was off doing a long arson in birmingham and liz wanted to talk to him urgently about a divorce case in which he was for the husband and she for the wife the matter was called singleton v singleton and i izs client was an ex miss broadstairs who was dissatisfied with the payoff of twenty thousand smackers offered to her by the filthy rich garage proprietor who she was now divorcing so liz put a call through to dave in the birmingham robing room as they discussed the case as barristers often do they identified so closely with their clients that they adopted their characters as their own well you know perfectly well im having baby dave liz was saying as ballard entered her room in search of his missing archbold on criminal law which he suspected everyone in chambers of halfinching our head of chambers stood in amazement as liz ignoring him completely continued her call reconstructing it as best i can from her recollection of it it must have gone something like this of course the babys yours theres not a scrap of evidence its not yours the chairman of the council ive never even been out with the chairman of the council he boasted about it in the golf club all men boast dont they an right if thats your case ill demand a blood test and take you for every penny of course you can afford it i know exactly how much youre drawing in cash out of that garage b inc ballard was i have no doubt even more shocked at the talk of a commercial garage than he had been at the news of the expected child he was to hear little more because liz was nearing the end of her diatribe right i know youve got to go but think about it dave weve got to get this settled once and for all of course i miss you so she put down the phone and left the room saying theni theyre totally irresponsible as she passed our head of chambers and he was so astonished that he even forgot to ask about his archbold as he always took a long time to make up his mind on any subject ballard took no action on the lizinchcape scandal for a while however when dave got back from the midlands and met our head coming out as he was going into chambers a curious conversation took place ballard opened with oh inchcape a quick word with you of a preliminary nature there may be more to come at a later stage much more but as your head of chambers im bound to advise you to get rid of your garage but we havent got a garage in islington young dave was totally mystified we have to keep the deux chevaux in the street thats why we can never get it to start on cold mornings im not talking of islington inchcape forget islington remember a barrister does not engage in trade get rid of the business but ballard what business inchcape asked helplessly youve got to choose soapy sam was remorseless i tell you that quite frankly its either the petrol pumps and video tapes and bunches of flowers and all that sort of thing or chambers well go into the other side of it later but at the moment forget all about garages do i make myself clear so ballard went about his business and dave inchcape was left saying after him not in the least a always mr bernard played his part with admirable ef tx ficiency and i soon found myself briefed and in the interview room at brixton with desmond casterini who looked as he had done at the piano as though he were wandering vaguely in a twilight world and would only return to ours with considerable reluctance it was with difficulty that i persuaded him to give factual answers to simple questions but at last i led him to deal with the message on the answering machine in the flat he shared with his wife elizabeth it was from the dead man and no doubt left on the day of the murder for the police had found it there when they took desmond home and made a search of his premises the message was from tom randall i reminded him he wanted to meet you and said it was to discuss your lives since dreams of youth did you know what that meant i suppose from the time we three started together and you made a note on the pad by the machine tom at the room six oclock did you think he might be going to tell you that he and your wife were lovers dear god mr rumpole it didnt cross my mind casterini shivered as though the thought chilled him to the marrow i never had a single moment of doubt or suspicion about elizabeth not a shadow i can assure you did you not the prosecution are going to suggest that you shot tom randall in a fit of jealous rage i gave you my oath mr rumpole by the great musicians i hold most dear mozart haydn schubert he started on a litany which i thought would strike few notes down the old bailey just a simple no will do we might hit a judge who thinks those chaps are runners in the at kempton park this rehearsal room did you rent it permanently we did yes we liked to use it whenever we pleased wasnt that rather expensive oh elizabeth has money you know comfortably off she started to make it at college she opened a boutique to sell wonderful clothes secondhand vintage model dresses she was able to help tom out when we started so he didnt have to take so many other jobs were lucky in that respect very fortunate i felt that among all this information there was a nugget of great importance i sat in silence for a while trying to identify it then i asked about something that had been on my mind for a long time apparently there was a trial when your wife was at college she told me about that casterini answered without hesitation theyd got to know a man called hoffman hed left the college and become a musicians agent it seems he was also an agent for hard drugs there was a boy in college called billy munn accused of being in the ring he was a friend of elizabeths hoffman went down for ten years but elizabeths friend billy was acquitted must have had a brilliant barrister i didnt want to boast of course i didnt know her in those days you werent at college together i dont know why that fact surprised me no i went to guildhall i met the other two later and we started playing together then we formed the casterini trio elizabeths money helped i bet it did and then i turned to a more dangerous subject now the colt revolver you kept it and ammunition my old father bless him always slept with it loaded under his pillow in our house in lissmaglen casterini seemed quite prepared to talk about the murder weapon he was a poet by profession but some of the bad boys were after his blood have you any idea how that old family heirloom got behind the piano no idea in the world i swear to you sir by never mind about all that you got the message around midday did you stay at home after you got it no i went to lunch with my sister siobhan she doesnt come over from dublin often we went to a film together and had tea you arrived at the building just after six the news had started on the car radio thats exactly right what happened then well the lift was stuck its always stuck its a kind of prehistoric conveyance mr rumpole and then i started to walk up the stairs did you see anyone on your way up not a solitary soul i swear it the place is usually empty at that time people are away at concerts and so on when you got up to your room was the door open it was closed not locked of course his recollection seemed surprisingly clear and then you found mr randall he was lying on the floor i knelt down and felt his heart thats how i got blood yes of course that will be our defence our defence our whole defence and nothing but our defence i was silent again and then i said as i felt i had to mr casterini in a matter as serious as this some people might want a qc to defend them a what the pianist was clearly a child as far as the law was concerned a qc queens counsel queer customer im not saying hed do it any better probably worse but im sure you realize its a difficult case ill rely on you mr rumpole he was quite sure about it elizabeth told me you were a wonderful man did she really it was ridiculous how pleased i was did she say that as we were leaving brixton where prisoners not yet convicted are now kept in conditions that are considerably worse than those enjoyed there a hundred years ago when we were out in the free world away from the stench of chamberpots and the jangle of warders keys i asked my instructing solicitor what i had come to think of as the thousanddollar question in all your long experience mr bernard have you ever known a villain leave his weapon at the scene of the crime casterini might have thought hed hidden it and hed come back for it later i mean he couldnt walk out of the building with it then could he seeing as he met the trumpet blower on the stairs what colourful lives these musicians lead and then i said i want you to find out everything you can about the hoffman drug case it was on at the old bailey about ten years ago newspaper reports everything hows all that going to help us i dont know yet i dont honestly know at all but were acting for mr casterini and remember hes liable to get potted unless we can think of some alternative explanation so bonny bernard let us get to work we set about to prepare our defence we visited butterworth buildings and found the porter who cowering behind a closed door and over a gasfire was unlikely to keep any check on the arrivals and departures as apparently was often the case the lift was stuck on the sixth floor so we slogged up a dusty and illlit staircase on the fourth floor we heard the horns of elfland faintly blowing and i assumed that mr peter matheson was in residence and at work on the fifth we went into the casterini rehearsal room and saw only a few chairs music stands an upright piano shelves for music a table with paraphernalia to make coffee and a scrubbed patch of floor which had once been bloodstained on the sixth floor we found the lift had stuck because the gate hadnt been shut properly i saw a passage and a door marked fire exit something made me push the bar which opened it and we found a platform which led to a rusty iron fireescape with stairs down to the street a long way below before we left butterworth buildings i gave mr bernard a further list of my requirements ask your friends in the crown prosecution service to let you see the dead mans bank accounts far back as you can go and id like a copy of his birth certificate then the bill took a load of documents out of the casterinis flat go through them with a finetooth comb whatre you looking for mr rumpole bernard sounded resigned to my excessive demands money dealings telephone bills tell me what you find i think particularly telephone bills there is one thing to be said in favour of the decline of civilization as we know it the slide into the abyss can provide some extremely comic moments one such came when soapy sam ballard called me into his presence as he had an appointment with claude i want you there as an observer rumpole we are not yet ready to sit in judgment but its only fair that anything erskinebrown may have to say is said in front of witnesses you mean taken down and used in evidence against him i asked hopefully it may not come to that ballard sounded gloomy i pray to god it may not come to that so i sat in ballards room and very soon there came a knock at the door and erskinebrown was with us and sprawled in ballards clients chair apparently exhausted the investigation into the harassment affair isnt proving all that easy im getting nowhere with dot are you not erskinebrown ballard looked at him sadly well im sure its not for want of trying she is of course the young lady you had in mind oh yes indeed im absolutely certain shes being harassed in the workplace but i simply cant get her to lodge a formal complaint can you not once more ballard spoke more in sorrow than in anger well shes made a formal complaint now to me has she claude seemed to cheer up considerably oh good good you think its good i dont think its good at all she says shes been harassed harassed ballard claude corrected him i told you thats how they say it nowadays harassed or harassed it comes to exactly the same thing in the end the fact is that miss clapton who seems a perfectly respectable girl is extremely worried im not at all surprised henrys behaviour was unforgivable claude told him henry ballard sounded surprised she didnt say a word about henry she didnt whos she complaining about then you what she said you pressed her to come into your room on the pretext of showing her your watercolours and ballard weighed up the evidence it sounds a pretty flimsy excuse to me but ballard erskinebrown rose to his feet clearly alarmed at the unexpected turn of events she said you talked to her about terrible urges soapy sam went on remorselessly i said i could understand them we all have them thats what i said speak for yourself erskinebrown ballard rejected the imputation vigorously and it seems you said you found her extremely fanciable an expression new to me but im afraid i can guess its meaning and you promised to get her promoted to a junior clerkship no doubt for a certain consideration ballard this is a totally unjustified accusation you never said that well i may have said something like that but what i meant was no ballard held up his hand to stop further selfincrimination i want to be perfectly fair to you erskinebrown i want to give you ample time to consider your defence my defence of course ballard gave his interim judgment this will have to be decided together with other rather disturbing matters at a full chambers meeting until then i hope you will have no further conversations with miss clapton she of course will be a vital witness i would only give you one word of advice at this time erskinebrown make a clean breast of it to your wife rumpole erskinebrown turned to me as the voice of sanity do you honestly believe i believe nothing claude i said i havent made up my mind im here purely as a witness a witness to what to your answer to the charge ballard told him what we have here is moral decay soapy sam said to me after claude had left in a state of indignation and dismay you know what caused the decline and fall of the roman empire i had to confess i wasnt entirely clear lust rumpole flagrant immorality has reared its head all over this building oh yes i will have to call on everyone to pull themselves together according to you isnt that rather what theyre doing already i really dont know what youre talking about rumpole i looked at the man he was undoubtedly a pompous blinkered humourless prig who seemed to confuse the headship of a small mainly criminal set of chambers with the archbishopric of canterbury and yet i remembered what elizabeth had told me i should feel about him i tried it out i love you ballard i said what was that the poor fellow clearly couldnt believe his ears so i repeated i love you with all my heart he was looking at me and his very worst suspicions seemed to be confirmed rumpole he asked nervously do i detect a curious odour in this room perhaps the odour of sanctity i dont think so its a heavy sweet smell cloying tell me honestly are you perfumed rumpole as i was saying i ignored his question i believe its our duty to love everything and because of that well i can only say i love you ballard i had clearly gone too far and taken elizabeths advice too literally the man got up extremely alarmed another time perhaps ive got a case starting over the road and as he hurried to the door he was muttering think about it very carefully rumpole moral decay getting in everywhere so two causes came to trial the great harassment inquiry in chambers and the case of r v casterini at the old bailey the second greatly to my regret was held before judge sir oliver or oilie oliphant who came as he was never tired of reminding us from the north of england in fact he regarded everyone who lived south of leeds as idle dreamers who spent their time lying in the sun peeling grapes and strumming guitars he was firmly of the opinion that all cases could be decided by good old north country common sense which so far as he was concerned at least often proved a somewhat unreliable test the proceedings began in a routine manner with the medical evidence and then detective sergeant straw produced the revolver which he had found in the rehearsal room it was not very well concealed i asked the officer not particularly and no fingerprints were found on the weapon that is right did that surprise you lets use our common sense about this mr rumpole mr justice oliphant entered the arena no doubt whoever did it removed the fingerprints so as to avoid detection does that make sense to you members of the jury i know it does to me so is this your lordships theory i asked politely my client was careful to leave his gun behind although it could easily be traced to him but took a lot of trouble clearing off the fingerprints or else wore gloves the ds suggested or else wore gloves the judge wrote a note thats a possibility isnt it members of the jury ignoring this interruption i asked the witness mr casterini has agreed that it was his gun he must have been mad to leave it at the scene of the crime mustnt he mr rumpole oilie oliphant answered you know we have a saying up in the north where i come from theres nowt so queer as folks do you really my lord down here in the deep south i suppose were more inclined to look for some sort of logical explanation thats what i shall invite the jury to do and i shall be inviting them to use their common sense the judge repeated his creed what an excellent idea i bowed politely i do so thoroughly agree with your lordship after this preliminary skirmish my opponent hilary peek a big beefy qc with an unnervingly high voice called peter matheson the horn player he gave the account i have outlined about seeing desmond and finding the body but perhaps more interestingly he spoke of a previous conversation he had heard between elizabeth and tom randall they came down for the lift which had chosen to be stuck on that occasion on the fourth floor mathesons door was open a little and he put down his horn long enough to hear tom say ill have to tell him before everyone else knows ill have to tell him the judge was writing it down with pleasure no doubt that means mr casterini the ladys husband my lord there is no evidence of that i reminded him but we can use our common sense cant we mr rumpole isnt this just another of those cases about the eternal triangle at the moment i said all we know is that they were a trio not long after that i rose to crossexamine mr matheson who was a nondescript nervous young man who only came entirely to life i imagined when playing his horn did you hear a shot was my first question no i didnt and did mr casterini tell you straightaway that he had found mr randall dead and he had no idea who did it he told me that yes matheson agreed you said you were at college with the members of the trio just tom and elizabeth desmond casterini met them later you said you knew elizabeth casterini well i suppose i was a bit in love with her most men were you can understand that you mustnt ask me questions i told him firmly but i never got to know her well no matheson conceded just help me about something did she start a shop a boutique i suppose youd call it for the sale of model dresses yes she did i think it did rather well do you remember what the shop was called it was called dreams of youth as far as i can remember mr justice oliphant grew restless mr rumpole what on earth have dreams of youth got to do with the case im not quite sure my lord perhaps theyre just things we all like to have occasionally this was greeted by a stir of laughter from the jury who seemed easily amused and his lordship rebuked them members of the jury if we want a good laugh we can all tune into the television set tonight i believe theyre giving us coronation street we all thoroughly enjoy that dont we shall we say tenthirty tomorrow and then use your common sense and take this case seriously in spite of mr rumpoles performance or yours your lordship was what i might have said tenthirty the next morning brought a surprise which if i have to be honest i had been as i thought long and hard about the case half expecting my opponent announced that he was going to call elizabeth casterini as a witness for the prosecution i went through the protests expected of me i told him that i had been quite prepared to agree her statements but hilary peek said that the jury might like to see her in person and as usual oilie agreed with the prosecution when she entered the witnessbox the jury cant have been disappointed she looked as beautiful as ever and was dressed i thought as though for a concert in a loosefitting patterned dress which again gave her the appearance of having stepped out of some medieval legend as a concession to the time of day she was wearing boots and her hair was tied back in a way which left her pale forehead exposed when she entered the witnessbox she smiled at her husband in the dock and he smiled back confident im sure that she had come there to help him but if that was her purpose the evidence she gave was in fact no help at all she stuck in the main to the facts in her statements she identified the revolver as looking like the one her husband kept in a drawer in their flat but she told the jury as she had told me that her husband seemed terribly jealous of her and tom randall for no earthly reason that frightened her considerably because of course he had the gun this was an answer oilie oliphant repeated and wrote down with considerable relish so i rose to talk to elizabeth not over a lunch table but across a crowded courtroom and now my purpose wasnt to establish our friendship but to destroy her credibility i spoke to her quietly with tenderness i had decided this was the best technique and i also found it extremely easy to do when you were at college did you own a boutique called dreams of youth yes i did mr rumpole oilie intruded into the conversation are we going back to these dreams of yours dont worry my lord they may lead us to wake up to the truth and then i turned to the witness you did well out of the shop didnt you yes i sold it when i left college and invested the profits elizabeth sounded unexpectedly businesslike and have lived quite comfortably ever since with our fees for playing yes let me just remind you of what the dead mans last message to your husband was heres the police note of it i want to discuss our lives since dreams of youth was he referring to your shop i i dont think so she had hesitated for the first time let us suppose he was when you were at college a musicians agent was tried for dealing in hard drugs some of your fellow students were said to be involved you know that dont you she gave me a secret smile and i had to tell her i may do but the jury dont you attended the trial didnt you yes a friend of mine was in the dock you got him off brilliantly i well take that for granted i got another easy stir of laughter for this and a growling mr rumpole from the judge so i went on quickly during the course of the trial there were a number of references to people meeting at the dreams of youth boutique i cant remember all the details elizabeth now looked beautifully vague but you were never charged you know i wasnt she was still smiling there was nothing i could have been charged with my lord if mr rumpole is suggesting the witness has committed some offence she should be warned hilary peek arose in all his glory the judge somewhat miffed said thank you mr peek i do know my business and with exaggerated courtesy to elizabeth mrs casterini i have to warn you that you neednt answer any question that might incriminate you im quite prepared to answer all mr rumpoles questions my lord and then the witness turned to me as though she trusted me entirely thank you and i went on one of the students gave evidence for the prosecution and he wasnt charged either he looked a bit different then perhaps he had a beard and another name tom cogswill ive got a photograph of him here printed in the news of the world at the time who is that a picture of she looked at the cutting the usher handed up to her and agreed tom cogswill so far as i can remember later to become tom randall beardless and a member of your trio the murdered man her yes to this was almost inaudible he gave evidence for the prosecution in the hoffman trial i asked her yes he did and gave no evidence implicating you in this musical drug ring mr rumpole are those all the questions you have on this ancient trial oilie put his oar in again it seems miles away from the issue in this case c for the moment my lord and then i looked at elizabeth mrs casterini your husband will say he was never jealous of you and tom cogswill otherwise known as randall you know he was dont you mr rumpole she smiled as though tolerant of my sudden forgetfulness no i dont i still did my best to sound like a kindly confidant and the jury dont know we only know what youve told us and perhaps we dont know whether to believe you lets assume for a moment that this wasnt a quarrel between two men over a beautiful woman now what other explanation is there for tom randall getting shot i have no idea suppose you tell me mr rumpole even at that point we still sounded like friends indeed i will after a few more questions i picked up the bundle of bank statements we had from the prosecution did you ever pay money to tom randall money no i dont think so she was still calm and smiling just try and help us mrs casterini when the trio was formed didnt you tell your husband youd given tom some of your plentiful store of money so he could turn down other work and concentrate on playing with you i said id helped tom out yes now she was hesitating and did you go on paying him money from time to time what are you looking at she made the mistake of asking me the question the dead mans bank accounts he got a regular payment in from a certain source was that source you perhaps sometimes is that what it says the answer to that question was no so i ignored it and asked another was he blackmailing you mrs casterini blackmailing whatever for threatening to tell your husband and then the police all he knew about your part in the hoffman drug ring if you didnt go on paying no no of course not she turned her smile on the jury but now i noticed they didnt smile back you remember what mr matheson heard tom randall say to you one day by the lift ill have to tell him before everyone else knows did that mean he was going to tell your husband that your nice little lump of capital came from drugs no her denial was too loud too vehement what did it mean then perhaps that he loved me i dont really know i let that answer hang in the air for a moment and then i changed the subject what were you doing on the day that tom randall died i went out in the morning i had a doctors appointment then i went to a lunchtime concert in portland place i went to buy a dress oh i had to have a drink with our agent at six before that you popped back home and saw what your husband had written on the pad by the answering machine tom at the room six oclock no mrs casterini it didnt take you from lunchtime to six oclock to buy a dress were you carrying it all the afternoon walking about london no i did just call at the flat to put the dress away and you didnt look at the message pad i never saw that i could tell by the way the jury was looking at her that they found it hard to believe in a woman who would come home and not bother to look at the messages did you telephone tom randall from your car and arrange to meet him at the rehearsal room at fivethirty before he spoke to your husband no no of course i didnt as she said that i picked up another document and reminded her bills from car telephones have a nasty habit of showing the numbers called you telephoned tom randall that day didnt you no no im sure i didnt and then she changed it to i i cant remember didnt you go to the rehearsal room some time before six e oclock taking your husbands gun in case tom couldnt be dissuaded no i had to meet the agent at six at the warren hotel i told you that plenty of time to do the deed hide the gun somewhere the police could find it then go up the stairs out to the fireescape and down to the street no doubt you arranged for the lift to be stuck at the top floor how far from the rehearsal room to the warren hotel just around the corner not very far away so i put it to her quietly lets get back to the vital question who else had a motive for killing tom randall might it be someone who wanted to stop paying him blackmail and also shut his mouth not me it wasnt she was stumbling but hilary peek rose to her rescue my lord mr rumpole is putting a whole string of suppositions to this witness hes accusing her of the very crime for which his client is on trial how can these questions be relevant because my lord if the jury thinks someone else might be guilty my client cant be convicted i supplied oilie with the answer im fully entitled to put these suppositions to the witness or does your lordship want me to argue the matter in the court of appeal at the mention of this dreaded court oilie looked shaken and poured a great deal of north country oil on our troubled water lets use our common sense about this mr rumpole no need to bother the court of appeal is there theyve got quite enough on their plates nowadays you go on at your own risk accusing this lady may not exactly endear your client to the jury and remember i shall be watching you like a hawk so mind tha step lad as we say where i come from so i turned to elizabeth and asked her the single most important question why did you come here as a witness mrs casterini the police asked me you know you couldnt be compelled to give evidence against your husband they must have told you that so you came here of your own free will why to tell you the truth as i know it or to make sure your husband gets convicted for a crime you committed she didnt answer that but stood in silence for a moment she looked suddenly older harder and when she spoke i knew she hated me is there anything else wicked im supposed to have done mr rumpole oh yes i told her you recommended your husband to brief a barrister you hoped wouldnt attack you im sorry to have disappointed you mrs casterini there is often a moment in a trial when you know for certain that the case is decided r v casterini was won when i had finished my crossexamination and my short unreasonably happy and misguided friendship with elizabeth she left the witnessbox and the court and i never saw her or spoke to her again three days later her husband also left the court sad confused but acquitted i dont know when they met or what they said to each other in any event their time together was short not long after the jurys verdict d i baker and d s straw called at the butterworth buildings rehearsal room there they found elizabeth playing a violin solo and charged her with the murder of thomas randall in spite of her high opinion of my brilliance she didnt call upon me to defend her after the casterini trial my life returned to normal which meant another chambers meeting this one was to reach a final verdict on the matter of the alleged harassment of dot clapton erskinebrown who was as i thought unwisely conducting his own defence addressed us in a plaintive fashion its totally unfair he submitted i never intended to harass dot that is miss clapton i heard henry approaching her in the most outrageous manner and i asked her to tell me about it so we could make a proper complaint well she must have misunderstood me what outrageous manner was that i asked well he was going on about the swishing sound made by her stockings and her modestly hidden breasts oh and he said just you and i annabelle two will become one when our bodies mingle is that all rumpole just because you happen to have won in casterini dont feel youre entitled to take over this important inquiry ballard objected to my stealing his thunder but i was in possession of the facts i have investigated the matter bollard i told him as no one else seems to have bothered to do may i just ask a simple question with your lordships permission im grateful to your lordship erskinebrown is miss claptons name annabelle i i dont think so claude had to admit it certainly isnt her name is dot short all too short im afraid for dorothy have you forgotten that henry is a thespian a mummer a star of the bexleyheath amateurs dot clapton is also a native of bexleyheath with a taste for the stage that ghastly dialogue was not henrys but the product of the fevered brain of a miss mildred hannay a local author who has written a play especially for the group what you had the misfortune to hear erskinebrown was a rehearsal any further questions there was a silence which mizz probert broke by asking yes why are we wasting our time with this meeting its not all a waste of time probert ballard spoke to her severely theres the matter of your baby her what dave asked angrily and your garage inchcape ballard fired off the most serious allegation with all that money youre earning how could you refuse to maintain proberts child are we to have a public scandal and a paternity suit in chambers what have you got into your head about me and garages dave inchcape was running out of patience liz probert started to laugh i know what it was what soapy sam ballard sounded not a little put out you came into the room during my telephone call about singleton v singleton liz told him i wasnt talking about me and dave we were talking about our clients its hilarious no it isnt i corrected her its quite serious really you all think sex is the explanation for everything that happens but quite often its something else entirely is there another chop hilda i was sitting at supper with she who must be obeyed and having poured the remains of my bottle of machismo for men down the lavatory i was reverting to my old ways youve given up being a vegetarian then she asked as she dropped one on my plate oh yes the last vegetarian i met was a murderer and a teetotaller what came over you rumpole when you started to smell so exotic i met a lady in the meads full beautiful a faerys child her hair was long her foot was light and her eyes were wild i suppose youre talking about that mrs casterini when i think we sat and listened to her fiddling if idve known what she was like i wouldnt have stayed ah but we didnt know did we la belle dame sans merci had us in her thrall there are actually two chops going begging rumpole and she rewarded me with the other thank you hilda thank you very much you were never a faerys child were you thats one thing to be said in your favour old darling the most surprising thing about miscarriages of justice is that they should surprise everyone so much if justice emerged as the result of an immaculate conception and miraculous birth perfection might reasonably be expected if judicial decisions were arrived at by some puzzled girl playing the keys of a computer i suppose they might be more reliable although computers appear to become hysterical and absentminded at times the machinery of the law has to be operated by fallible human beings some of whom such as mr injustice graves mr justice oilie oliphant soapy sam ballard qc you will have met in these pages and you can decide whether they might on certain rare occasions of course fall into error juries i believe do their best but have to contend with the soporific effects of many summingsup and the speeches of the learned friends the old bill i am afraid has been known to be only too anxious to achieve a quick result and hasnt always worried too much about injustice and what of rumpole i suppose my job has been to prevent the huge sometimes illdirected legal machine totally flattening my client so perhaps my concern has been less with legal principles than with ways of escape for all these reasons its dangerous to expect any trial to produce a result fit to be engraved on tablets of stone and stand unchallenged for all time it is always as well to remember the conduct of that somewhat accidentprone old darling mr justice guthrie featherstone in the pinhead morgan trial the buttercup meadows estate occupies a desolate area to the southeast of london its lifts are dangerous to enter many of its windows are broken its concrete walkways and balconies are cracked and its walls are smeared with graffiti and worse there is also little employment for the young men of the area so they turn their hands to the exciting work of stealing cars racing them at high speed round the estate and finally crashing them or setting them alight these sporting events are usually accompanied by fights knifings and the throwing of petrol bombs those elderly citizens of buttercup meadows who havent resigned themselves to sleepless nights often telephone the police who with commendable courage often arrive on one such night when buttercup meadows was resounding with screaming tyres and lit with flaming volvos and bmws p c yeomans a courageous and undoubtedly straight young officer with a wife and two children arrived on the scene to keep the peace he left his car with a fellow copper but turned alone down a passage between two buildings perhaps because he saw a fight or other incident taking place there in the shadows he was stabbed in the throat and died almost immediately tinhead morgan was so unkindly called by his contemporaries because although past twenty he had the mental age of a child he seemed to have come to the car racing purely as a spectator as other officers discovered p c yeomanss fallen body pinhead was caught running some way from the scene of the crime he was arrested and taken into custody the officer in charge of the case was detective superintendent gannon an apparently dependable and avuncular man who was nearing retirement age he was assisted in his work by detective inspector farraday and detective sergeant chesney lane pinhead was kept in custody for lt three days after applications to the magistrates for the first two he was uncooperative and used as an officer later testified foul and abusive language to his interrogators on the third day he told detective inspector farraday that he was prepared to make a statement about his involvement this fact was reported to detective superintendent gannon who later wrote out a full confession he said at pinheads dictation which the young man signed so pinhead was charged with murder this clearly came as a most satisfactory outcome to the detective superintendent whod had the miserable task of waking betty yeomans up in the middle of the night and telling her that her husband had been murdered all he could offer her were a few words of praise for the dead man and the promise that his killer would be convicted with pinheads confession signed it seemed that detective superintendent gannon could keep his word the case came on before that master of indecision mr justice guthrie featherstone guthrie as regular readers of these chronicles will remember had once been a middleoftheroad mp a fairly middleoftheroad qc and the head of our chambers at equity court before he was elevated on the bench guthrie found it hard not to open his mouth without putting his foot in it but the words he used when sentencing pinhead to life imprisonment with a recommendation that he serve at least twentyfive years must have appeared perfectly safe at the time morgan he said you have been convicted out of your own mouth and by your own words every minute this trial has lasted has made me surer and surer of your guilt pinhead replied by calling the judge a stupid wanker whether or not the allegation was true it had no effect on the result and he was taken down to enter the forgotten world of those who receive life sentences after court that day i found myself standing behind the learned judge in a ludgate circus bus queue he noticed with apparent satisfaction the fact that i was reading the evening standard i expect you saw my face plastered all over the front page guthrie said modestly when one sentences a sensational murderer one does rather tend to hit the headlines he clearly felt that he should stop enjoying the publicity as he went on in grave judicial tones morgan was a most serious case and you did it extraordinarily skilfully if i may say so my dear old rumpole one is grateful for tributes from one of your age and experience of course i mean you managed to persuade the old darlings on the jury to pot pinhead without any real evidence to go on what do you mean rumpole no blood on his clothing no evidence that the knife was his no witness saw him anywhere near where p c yeomans was found my darling old lordship anyone can get a conviction on evidence it takes a legal genius to secure one without it but rumpole guthrie played his ace of trumps the accused morgan had made a confession a full and frank admission of his guilt and he signed it knew how to write did he i wasnt too sure he could read the learned judge was so intent on proving his case again that his bus had come and gone as he watched it drive away he naturally blamed me ill be late and marigolds got people coming he stepped out into the road waving desperately at a taxi i shouldnt have stood here chattering to you rumpole i must be a complete idiot i dont think he heard when i asked his retreating back is that a confession that we can accept as the truth my lord in fact pinhead morgan was not altogether forgotten the questions i had asked guthrie at the bus stop began to be taken up by others interested in detecting and denouncing miscarriages of justice there was an article in the guardian and a dramatized reconstruction on television in which pinhead was played by an extremely intelligent young actor who gave a moving performance as a subnormal youth the bishop of worsfield the cardinal archbishop of westminster and the chairman of the arts council called on mr timothy bunting the home secretary to express their deep concern and then the campaign to reopen pinheads case was given a final boost by a machine known as the electrostatic detective apparatus or esda for short its findings were made the t more impressive as it was operated in investigations carried out by the old bill in person chief superintendent belmont was the officer in charge of the section which included the buttercup meadows estate when the campaign suggesting that pinhead had not received altogether satisfactory treatment at the hands of the law had gathered momentum belmont summoned detective inspector farraday and detective sergeant chesney lane to a demonstration belmont had found he said a pile of blank confession sheets in detective superintendent gannons office when submitted to the esda machine this cunning device found indentations of gannons handwriting on the top twelve pages the document he had been writing was that which was put before the jury as page two of pinheads alleged confession now this page two was the only page which recorded his admission of guilt as it contained such telling phrases as i came tooled up im sorry i cut the copper i was all excited what with the car racing and that im sorry for what i did its a relief now ive told you detective superintendent gannon said in court that he had written both pages of the confession in the interview room in pinheads presence and at his dictation furthermore he said that he had written it on pages which he had laid flat down on the table in front of him with no page or paper underneath the esda machine told a different story that of page two being written by gannon on a pile of blank sheets in his office the clear inference was that the original page two didnt provide clear evidence against pinhead so gannon had written out an alternative and incriminating page and substituted it later when this demonstration apparently so clear and convincing was over detective inspector farraday had to admit that he couldnt exactly remember what pinhead had said at the time but he had always assumed that it was as it appeared in the confession statement moreover mr gannon had taken away the written pages after the accused had signed them and the two officers had no opportunity of checking their accuracy he seemed prepared to agree that a new and altered page two must have been written later detective sergeant chesney lane was rather more puzzled by the demonstration but his questions were met by chief superintendent belmont saying theres something that stinks to high heaven about this case of morgan and ill make it my business to find out exactly what it is this and his subsequent actions led to high praise of chief superintendent belmont in all the caring newspapers as being a refreshingly honest officer who made no attempt to hide the rotten apples in his force there is only one other matter about this distressing scene which should be recorded the original confession had of course been lodged in the court when belmont was conducting the demonstration he showed the two officers a photostat of page two written out in gannons handwriting d s chesney lane was asked to return this document among others to the filing officer before he did so he felt the back of the photostat after doing so he failed in one important respect to carry out his orders for a while guthrie dwelt in happy ignorance of this final attack on his conduct in the buttercup meadows case one day however when he had called in at the sheridan club to celebrate a case that settled early with a delightful lunch among his friends and admirers he was told by the porter that lord justice parsloe a senior judge of the court of appeal was in the bar and wanted a word with him so guthrie mounted the stairs alight with hope that his service to the state was about to be recognized by some promotion i have done my best to reconstruct the conversation which in fact took place from my knowledge of the characters involved and with considerable help from a member of the sheridan named toby harringay an appalling old gossip who plays bridge with hilda and who earwigged a great deal of the conversation it seems that guthrie had just ordered himself his usual modest gin and tonic at the bar when lord parsloe a small rubicund deceptively cheerfullooking man came up with hallo there guthrie drowning your sorrows simon why should i have sorrows guthrie was puzzled bit of a hard time for you im afraid my heart goes out to you old fellow and he looked at the judge of first instance as though he were suffering from some threatening disease keeping well are you apart from the usual ailments of a trial judge guthrie replied i know piles and sleeping sickness the lord justice still sounded sympathetic and im looking forward to joining you lord justices in the peace and comfort of the court of appeal guthrie was ever hopeful well perhaps some day who knows these things do get forgotten in time things simon panic stirred as it so often did in guthries breast what things are you talking about well lets say things like pinhead morgan i sent him down with a recommendation of twentyfive years and the judge sounded proud of the fact i know you did guthrie how many has he done now i suppose the question we have to decide is has he done enough enough for stabbing a police officer ah but can we be sure he did that i know theres been a bit of agitation by copperhating lefties simon professional dogooders members of the howard league for penal reform youre not going to take any notice of their nonsense are you tim bunting referred the matter to us im not sure the home secretarys a copperhating leftie as you call it so elegantly look lets go over there where its not quite so public so guthrie followed the lord justice to a couple of crumbling leather chairs in a corner of the bar out of earshot of the gossiping toby harringay and it was in that corner that the judge realized the full seriousness of his plight as parsloe said with chilling gentleness guthrie i know youll be very brave about this it may not be entirely nonsense it may be just one more of these cases where the trial judge ends up with egg on his face and god knows theres been enough egg lately to keep the entire howard league for penal reform in omelettes for the rest of their natural lives but it was an open and shut case simon by now the judge was sounding plaintive reopened and not yet shut unfortunately oh my dear old fellow if only you hadnt said every minute this trial has lasted has made me surer and surer of your guilt did i say that guthries memory was mercifully short oh yes nailed your colours to the mast didnt you silence is golden old fellow particularly when passing possibly dubious life sentences possibly dubious you mean youve made up your minds not at all i have no idea what conclusion i and my brother lords justices may come to we might find the conviction is still safe i just thought i should warn you keep your head down guthrie the flak may be coming over and after this dire warning mr justice guthrie featherstone had very little appetite for his lunch on the last day of pinhead morgans appeal there was a demonstration of sorts outside the main entrance to the law courts by a number of mps prison reformers television crews and pinheads family and friends some bore placards with such legends as free pinhead morgan liars in blue dont leave justice to the judges pinheads innocent and the laws an ass when detective superintendent gannon and his detective inspector arrived they were roundly booed by the contingent from the buttercup meadows estate that morning guthrie was sitting as a judge down the old bailey at the other end of fleet street as he was being robed by his ancient clerk wilfred he expressed considerable concern at the possible result in the court of appeal my learned judge wilfred told me later was all of a dither to be honest i never saw anything like it in anyone who has risen to the bench are they giving judgment this morning are we sure of that wilfred guthrie asked as though the jury were out and he was on trial so i understand my lord from lord justice parsloes clerk gladys wilfred told him its a troublesome business im afraid wilfred an extremely troublesome business pity they got rid of the rope my lord those were my very words to gladys wilfreds view of the law was as antiquated as himself i was perfectly entitled to say what i did say we had watertight evidence guthrie argued his case and if that young man had been strung up with all due respect hed never have come popping up in the court of appeal causing us all this trouble and anxiety the point is ive got to know the result just as soon as possible now you come into my court at what time do you think twelvethirty sir it should be all over by then according to gladys and gladys is very reliable thats the lord justices clerk my lord and we have become firm friends over the years oh do stop going on about gladys and hanging too come to that guthrie wasnt in the best of tempers just concentrate on coming in and giving me a signal lets say thumbs up if pinhead goes back to prison and were in the clear otherwise thumbs down if i may make a suggestion im afraid wilfred and here his lordship sank into a deep gloom there may be a terrible miscarriage of justice but the miscarriage of justice according to the court of appeal was due in almost equal parts to the detective superintendent and guthrie featherstone what follows is an extract from the judgment of the court of appeal lord justice parsloe presiding the officer in charge of the case he said must bear the heavy responsibility of obtaining this worthless confession we as judges of the court of appeal can only apologize to the public and to mr morgan the unfortunate victim of this miscarriage for the somewhat unwise remarks of the learned trial judge who was reckless enough to say and i quote every minute this trial has lasted has made me surer and surer of your guilt down the road guthrie was listening with very little attention to a legal argument from claude erskinebrown when the door of the court swung open and there stood wilfred with his thumb like that of a merciless roman emperor pointed towards the ground so pinhead was released to the cheers of his supporters and the detective superintendent had to pay another call on betty yeomans to comfort her once again i had an opportunity of meeting mrs yeomans later and i found her to be a young woman of considerable spirit i know how the conversation went with betty leading off on the apparently absurd result that no one had been guilty of her husbands murder so pinhead never stabbed ted she said never cut him so who did then would they mind telling me that im sorry betty i know its hard gannon was as distressed as the widow or did ted just pull out a knife and do himself was it all a mistake like that trial of pinhead is that what theyre telling us i dont know betty and gannon told her they seem to have lost interest in what pinhead did its what i did what the judge did where we went wrong thats all their lordships is concerned about someone killed ted thats all i know someones got to suffer the most likely person to suffer is going to be me gannon looked grimly into his future not you roy not after all youve done for us im not going to let that happen betty yeomans gave him her promise if the detective superintendent thought he was the most likely person to suffer by the change in pinheads fortunes he had at least mr justice featherstone as a companion in misfortune of course the two never met until but that time was still in the future on the night of the appeal judgment guthrie was alone his wife the handsome but sometimes ruthless marigold was away on a visit to her sister in coventry guthrie hoped that they would be too busy exchanging family news to watch the television but he knew that she would learn of the public rebuke in due course and she was unlikely to comfort him and bind up his wounds he dined alone at the sheridan club no one he knew was in that night and those he didnt know took pains he imagined to ignore him after dinner he sat alone in the bar drinking port and when that occupation began to pall he drank brandy he was still doing this when the bar had emptied and denver the barman was cleaning up and looking forward to going home to bed guthrie however seemed to be a fixture unburdening his soul in words that denver quite failed to keep to himself justice the judge said bitterly ive had no justice whatsoever im sorry about that sir truly sorry the sheridan barman had a kindly heart no one to represent me denver no chance to put my case engaged in another court as it so happened while the court of appeal rubbished me rubbished me denver the trial judge was reckless enough to say reckless denver you tell me quite honestly would you say that i was reckless no sir guthrie but you are my last gentleman sir your last gentleman thats probably it too much of a gentleman to answer back not so many of us about nowadays are there i was just about to pack up denver had polished the last glass and was about to hang up his white jacket is that what youre advising me to do denver guthrie looked more stricken than ever jack it in hang up the scarlet dressinggown take to golf a very goodnight to you sir guthrie was the barmans firm reply so guthrie came down the steps of the sheridan club unsteadily not quite drunk but still not as sober as a judge and in the street he bumped into someone who appeared to be leading a group of revellers and whom he recognized after protests and apologies as henry who had been his clerk when he was head of our chambers out on the town are you and guthrie looking round at the clerks friends added i say are you all in the law please accept my profound sympathy not exactly sir guthrie henry told him not all of us is in the law what you see here is the cream of the bexley heath thespians up in town for our annual outing and pissup added a male thespian who was carrying a theatre programme that was not the purpose of the evening sir guthrie henry maintained his dignity the purpose of the evening was to witness miss diana rigg performing in the living theatre id like to play opposite her i honestly would the thespian with the programme said longingly hedda gabled not many laughs in it was there this came from dot clapton who as you will remember was also a member of the acting group never any of those not in that henry gibson said another star of bexleyheath and dot explained so we was all off to blokes for a bit of a bop a bit of a bop eh guthrie seemed overcome by sadness there was a time when i could indulge myself in a bit of a bop before the pressures of life in the law became too much for me where is this blokes you go to leicester square just round the corner and dot extended an invitation feel like a raveup do you speaking for all the assembled thespians here sir guthrie henry told him we should be honoured if you would join us just for a drink thats very kind of you but he no doubt became aware of dots considerable attractions that would be quite impossible like other judicial decisions this one was almost immediately reversed and guthrie found himself a quarter of an hour and a couple of rum and cokes later standing under flashing lights and moving vaguely in time to some very loud music in what he fondly imagined to be an offhandedly seductive manner while dot danced expertly and appealingly around him and even then according to dots subsequent account he was still bemoaning his lot what was i meant to do quite honestly go down the cells keep a fatherly eye on pinhead morgan make sure the old bill didnt fit him up see he had tea and biscuits and a clever solicitor i cant do that you know i simply havent got the time if the judges are going to carry on weve got to trust the police debby dotty what did you call me my names dot dotty not deb debby im sorry it seems im always making mistakes dont you worry judge youre an excellent mover the next morning when i came into chambers dot had just received a large bunch of flowers and erskinebrown with his usual nose for a scandal was reading out the inscription on the card which accompanied the tribute from a judicial admirer thanks for the bop i dont read your correspondence mr erskinebrown dot was entitled to say so id be glad if you kept your eyes off mine only taking a friendly interest dot is it serious whens the engagement ive seen enough of married men mr erskinebrown not to want one of my own thank you very much at which point henry who had been engaged on the telephone said weve been waiting for you to come in mr rumpole youve got a police officer up in your room sir there you are rumpole erskinebrown was clearly delighted they fingered your collar at last i did i must confess go through a moment of extreme unease was it something to do with my income tax when i got up to my room the clients armchair was occupied by a large comfortable greyhaired man who looked as i have said less like a bent copper than everyones favourite uncle also there was the indispensable mr bernard who effected the introduction i told superintendent gannon he couldnt have a better brief mr rumpole not one with your talent for acquittals he saw my point didnt you roy acquittals thats whats caused all this mess the way you lawyers let pinhead out laughing his words were bitter but his voice was low and reasonable one of the mildestmannered men i thought who ever faked a confession you blame the lawyers for that i added in fairness to our muchabused profession that it wasnt a lawyer who rewrote the dubious page two gannon didnt answer me directly but said i gave betty yeomans my solemn oath id get her a conviction thats whats kept betty going my promise to her someone had to pay for ted yeomanss life even someone who hadnt killed him i asked pinhead was guilty all right beyond reasonable doubt i started to look at the proof of my clients evidence prepared by mr bernard while gannon gave his views on the presumption of innocence lawyers language again the contempt was deep but the voice was gentle you dont believe me do you mr rumpole i can see that nobody believes a copper nowadays the world was a whole lot better when people had faith in us thats what i think about it all right i didnt argue about who had caused the loss of faith as i was anxious to get down to the facts of the matter pinhead was arrested on the night of the incident the night he killed ted yeomans gannon insisted he was someone known to the police hed packed a lot in common assault affray take and drive away possession of an offensive weapon so you thought right from the start pinhead morgan was a likely suspect ms seemed probable you were busy on the morning he confessed i asked i went to see someone in hospital when i got back to the station i was met by d i farraday who told me that pinhead was ready to talk thats right theyd had a short interview with him on the morning when you were away according to farradays note all pinhead said was whens the guvnor back i feel id now like to tell him about my involvement something like that so what made him change his mind they need to talk mr rumpole they need to tell someone about it they cant keep it bottled up any longer then the truth comes out and you lawyers wont believe it hes said to have the mental age of a child did he use all the words in this confession statement as far as im concerned he said exactly what i wrote down you wrote on single sheets of paper loose sheets yes im sure i did d i farraday and d s lane saw that no paper between the sheet you were writing on and the table no im sure there wasnt you know the esda machine thinks differently you cant rely on a machine i thought well he would say that wouldnt he i got up and went to the window then i turned back to look at the solid man filling my armchair superintendent gannon you do understand the case against you i wrote down what pinhead said he insisted youre sure you didnt improve on it later so you could keep your promise to an unhappy woman i hope i made it sound as though i could understand the temptation but he shook his head and simply answered im sure claude erskinebrown had two overriding ambitions he wanted to bring a little extra romance into his life and he wanted to become one of her majestys counsel learned in the law the fact that his wife phillida could write the magic letters qc after her name was for him a matter of continual disquiet his efforts to achieve his two great objectives were not at that time wholly successful his pursuit of young women and his efforts to get them to accompany him to the opera led as often as not to embarrassment for all concerned in search of the elusive silk gown he got himself elected to the sheridan club where he hoped to make friends with judges and old keith from the lord chancellors office who would further his career so far his membership hadnt brought him the great reward it did however lead him to invite me to lunch at a time when the criminal community had apparently gone off on holiday and business was slack i accepted with reluctance not being greatly attracted to the sight of a lot of judges and publishers sitting together drinking brown windsor soup however i went along for the claret and there in the bar before lunch we met guthrie featherstone and had a conversation with him which was to add greatly to his difficulties im so sorry judge erskinebrown started to commiserate with his lordship as i thought tactlessly on the reverse hed received in r v pinhead morgan you must be suffering a great deal suffering guthrie smiled recklessly no im not suffering im feeling well on top of the world really youre being brave about it and then claude told the judge even more tactlessly of course anyone can make mistakes mistakes guthrie looked puzzled what are you talking about whos been making mistakes have you heard about anyone making mistakes rumpole oh no one absolutely no one at all i tried to reassure him mistakes simply dont occur in the law i summed up in that case absolutely fairly on the evidence before me are you suggesting that was some kind of a mistake god forbid i said fervently well anyway you look well claude was anxious to change the subject hed introduced im so glad youre feeling well guthrie top of the world guthrie smiled with boyish enthusiasm there is more to life than stuffy courtrooms and summingsup claude life has better things to offer greater pleasures and thank god im still young enough to enjoy them of course you are claude encouraged the judge at least im still young enough to indulge in a bit of a bop occasionally a bit of a what i was puzzled a bop rumpole that means a danceup erskinebrown translated for me a danceup a modern idiom which you might be too square to understand guthrie said and claude was unwise enough to make a joke at which he laughed prodigiously rumpoles not square hes round oh i can see this is going to be a hilarious luncheon by this time i was feeling quite gloomy but then guthrie decided to make his confession as a matter of fact marigold was away he began confidentially and i didnt fancy spending the evening here among a lot of dusty old lawyers so i took a young lady out bopping claude takes them to wagner i said i suppose it lasts longer a judicial bop erskinebrown thought the matter over good heavens id never have imagined it what i do find interesting to be absolutely honest with you fellows guthrie seemed to be enjoying his confession is how many people today well lets say young women girls if you like how many girls rather prefer the older man as a partner in every sense of the word gerontophilia is that the inthing nowadays i asked as innocently as possible i mean not really old not in your class rumpole guthrie said as i thought unnecessarily but the slightly older judge i supplied the word even judges are human guthrie spoke as though letting us into a closely guarded secret so you mean you actually struck lucky with your bopee erskinebrown could hardly believe his ears oh yes guthrie answered us with some satisfaction beyond all reasonable doubt successful in every way claude in every possible way it was an evening to look back on with joy when ones bopping days are over he looked at his watch sorry you chaps lunching with a couple of the younger members at that time i didnt know toby harringay nor did i realize exactly who he was until he was identified as one of her partners at the pentium bridge school by she who must be obeyed however i had been conscious of him in the offing a moisteyed perpetually smiling fellow with suspiciously jetblack hair and a sheridan club bowtie as soon as guthrie had left he showed us how much he had been enjoying the conversation by saying what exotic lives judges lead nowadays dont they he had quite clearly heard everything erskinebrown smiled in a noncommittal manner and led me in the general direction of the soup as we went i quoted robbie burns there was a chield amang us taking notes rather unfortunate that toby harringay was not the sort to let a good bit of gossip waste its sweetness on the desert air only a few afternoons later he was seated at the green baize opposite hilda with another couple of senior citizens who occupied the afternoons in polishing up their bidding at the pentium school in sloane street it was while the cards were being shuffled she told me that toby began to spread the story which he couldnt possibly keep to himself hankypanky he said and this will come as a shock to you mrs rumpole among the judiciary bedhopping im afraid thats what it comes to like those dreadful young people that go on package holidays to menorca you wouldnt believe it of judges would you but oh my you should hear them talking about it in the sheridan club oh the dear old sheridan hilda as yet knew nothing of the shock in store rumpole must get round to joining it toby started to deal out the cards and the information there was a judge holding forth in the bar the other day what do you think he was on about points of law reform of the jury system not at all it was all about how hed taken some young bopper to a discotheque and how girls prefer the older man as a partner in every sense of the word honestly ladies it was quite shocking to an old gentleman like me you probably know the judge im talking about mrs rumpole oh probably hilda said casually rumpoles friends with so many judges tall chap always looks terribly nervous fotheringay no feather something toby was now sorting out his hand not hilda was almost afraid to ask featherstone thats it mr justice featherstone wouldnt like to be hauled up before him would you not after hes spent a hard night of hankypanky in the discotheque your shout mrs rumpole guthrie featherstone oh dear hilda could hardly bring herself to count her points she was already beginning to wonder if it were not her clear duty to see that marigold knew the more i thought about the defence of detective superintendent roy gannon the less i gave for our prospects neither the judges nor the police were having a good time that year and they seemed to have sunk in the public estimation to the level of traffic wardens and income tax inspectors the electrostatic detective apparatus was enjoying a period of considerable success it had proved a number of confession statements unacceptable and a jury would be unlikely to prefer the evidence of a senior copper out to avenge the death of one of his men to that of an independent machine i couldnt see any way out of this impasse and didnt do so until i met betty yeomans the murder victims widow which i did in an unexpected way i was setting out to do an uninteresting robbery in acton crown court and on leaving my chambers and walking up middle temple lane i heard someone calling mr rumpole i turned and saw a youngish dark and fairly attractive woman leaning her head out of the window of a battered motor car of indeterminate age im betty yeomans she said as i approached her ive been meaning to have a word with you mr rumpole you going anywhere i told her my destination and she said jump in the minicab ill give you a free ride no problems i thought this remarkably kind of her and indeed she drove me to acton very quickly and with a good deal of expertise but our conversation was frequently interrupted as she shouted abuse at other road users as she kept all the windows shut after we started the only person to be affected by these outbursts was me friend of roy gannons got this mini business so he offered me a job parttime suits me i do the hours and i can look after the kids as well do you want to tell me something the worlds full of wankers she shouted suddenly have a bit of bloody courage mate this was directed at a car waiting to turn into the fleet street traffic we cant all wait while you says your prayers and then in more conversational tones roys been wonderful to me and the kids mr rumpole since we lost ted come on madam the lights gone green are you colour blind or something i dont think she can hear you i know but it makes me feel better just like roy made me feel better when he got our conviction but was it the right one isnt that the point do you think he lied mr rumpole just to give me the satisfaction hes not like that roy isnt mind yourself whatre you doing driving on your television licence a straight copper roys not the one ted used to talk about ted was talking about someone i was becoming interested oh i know he was only a uniformed man ted was never that ambitious but his friend the one he was at school with hes the highflier went straight in the cid and got detective sergeant we used to see a lot of them though him and doreen our kids was the same age mrs yeomans what are you trying to tell me why dont you go home and take driving lessons sorry mr rumpole thats all right im getting used to it it was after mr pertwee got convicted there was someone else teds friend was worried about but it wasnt roy he always said superintendent gannons clean as a whistle not like some others i could mention who said that my interest was increasing oh didnt i tell you it was chesney of course oh get a move on what do you think this is a funeral procession over the sound of her furious hooting i repeated chesney yes we all got on so well together havent seen much of them though not since ted went neither him nor doreen lane now i remembered detective sergeant chesney lane was one of those present when pinhead morgan was supposed to have signed the dubious confession after mrs yeomans had vented her wrath on a taxi driver who had apparently cut her up i asked her to tell me more after my exciting ride with betty yeomans i met the indispensable mr bernard in the acton court during the lunch adjournment we went round the corner for a guinness and a slice of pie bernard in his line of business had to associate fairly closely with the old bill he attended their dinner dances bumped into them at the rotary club evenings and was on christian name terms with the officers of that section which included buttercup meadows relying on his fund of knowledge i asked him what he knew about the pertwee business oh dear my instructing solicitor looked a little shifty we never got instructed in that case otherwise youdve had the brief mr rumpole quite definitely what was it all about a superintendent pertwee some people wanted to get rid of him i never discovered who or why exactly it started with all sorts of minor persecutions they actually did him for speeding when he was out with his family then he was said to be friends with a big local villain finally they got jim pertwee on a charge of perverting the course of justice planting dope on a suspect although i was never sure who did the planting got two years and hes still at it you interest me strangely now bonny bernard i have work for you you usually have mr rumpole detective sergeant chesney lane cultivate his friendship there might be something hed like to tell us so the industrious bernard got to know a good deal about the life and habits of detective sergeant lane his firm had as it so happened helped the lanes over a mortgage and as he knew other parents at the school the lane children attended he called on the lanes one sunday afternoon to discuss a sponsored marathon to raise money for books he was told by mrs lane that her husband had taken their boys to the skateboard rink in the local park so as the young lanes slid and trundled around bernard and chesney lane in their weekend uniforms of jeans and chunky patterned sweaters with bernard leading his elderly spaniel discussed my encounter with mrs yeomans betty doesnt want roy to go down for this bernard began ted wouldnt have wanted it either of course you were pretty close to ted werent you chesney ted was an honest policeman perhaps thats why he stayed in uniform ted would have wanted justice done whats justice when its at home d s lane sounded bitter i mean has pinhead got justice or betty with no one nicked after all this time and roys the only one left to take the blame i know that ive lost sleep over it you might sleep better after youve told someone bernard spoke quietly doreen doesnt think so doreen thinks i ought to keep my head down what do you think for a while bernard told me chesney lane said nothing then he called the protesting boys away from their skateboards as it was time to go home to tea and he extended a welcome invitation to my solicitor you want to come with us i might have something to show you as events moved towards the trial of detective superintendent gannon which was also to become in more ways than one the trial of mr justice featherstone a further conversation took place between the judge and lord justice parsloe in the bar of the sheridan it started to the surprise of my informants by parsloe saying well guthrie your ears should be burning ive been having a little chat with the lord chief about you nothing about dancing was it the judge was never at a loss for something to feel guilty about well hardly i mean i dont suppose the lord chief dances much nowadays do you dance guthrie dance of course not well hardly at all well only when im particularly depressed which of course is almost never then why are we talking about it i dont know its probably quite irrelevant yes it is totally irrelevant shall we take our drinks over to the fire away from the audience i cant even give hearsay evidence of what was then discussed but ill lay a small bet that the appeal judge told guthrie that having made an absolute pigs breakfast of the morgan affair he was to have a chance of redeeming himself by conducting the trial of detective superintendent gannon who had apparently misled the court and forged a confession to this the judge agreed enthusiastically of course he said rotten apples must be plucked out of the police barrel and destroyed the last words of the lord justice overheard by a passing member were thats settled then and by the way guthrie i would advise you to give up dancing youre probably far too old for it in spite of this grave warning guthrie no doubt felt cheered by this conversation and the trust the powers that be were putting in him however his happiness was not longlasting when people talk about doing things in the interests of justice i have found it usually means that the act they are about to perform will be extremely unpleasant hilda felt that it would be fair to marigold to tell her about the illfated bop and the admissions of guilt attested to by the earwigger harringay as i have said marigold lady featherstone is a handsome and stylish woman much given to shopping in harrods who has very little time for the weakness of the male sex in general and her husband in particular hilda told me how marigold had passed judgment on the judge look youre not the greatest catch in the world guthrie she told him and little miss whatsit is perfectly welcome to you as far as im concerned but why couldnt you keep quiet about it how do you think i felt having hilda rumpole being sorry for me in the silver grill lets face it youve got absolutely no judgement guthrie that must come as something of a drawback in your profession i also gather from hilda that the judge asked if his wife intended to leave or forgive him to this marigold replied im not going to do either leaving would make things far too easy for you im going to stay here and not forgive you now run along and try that bent copper and please guthrie do try not to make another cockup so it was not an entirely happy mr justice featherstone who took his place on the bench as the trial of detective superintendent gannon started at the old bailey miles crudgington qc was a tall willowy fellow with a carefully cultivated classless accent he specialized in civil rights cases those involving free speech the liberty of the subject and miscarriages of justice as a general rule he would not have been called on to appear for the crown but prosecuting the police was no doubt a worthy occupation for a radical lawyer so there was the learned miles leading for the queen in her suit against my unfortunate detective superintendent fairly early in the proceedings my opponent was calling di farraday a squareshouldered squareheaded officer who answered all questions in a voice like machinegun fire and whose face it would be hard to imagine lit up with a smile so superintendent gannon was the only one writing down what morgan was saying he was without the help of that socalled written confession could you remember exactly what morgan said not exactly thinking back to that time are you absolutely sure he said im sorry i cut the copper are you sure he said that there was a silence and then the witnesss answer came rattling out no sir im not sure he said that at all so miles crudgington drew the ponderous deduction it appears that detective superintendent gannon was writing down words that morgan didnt say completely ignoring that young mans human rights is that the situation perhaps i could remind my learned friend i clambered to my feet that detective superintendents have human rights also and one is that hostile witnesses shouldnt be asked leading questions mr crudgington was just drawing the obvious conclusion guthrie came to the aid of the prosecution and ignoring all other possibilities as is the way with those who talk about human rights for a carefully selected minority my lord im quite prepared to play the game by mr rumpoles somewhat outdated rules crudgington tried to earn brownie points not my rules the rules of evidence have they gone out of fashion among radical barristers rotten apples must be plucked out of the police barrel and destroyed the last words of the lord justice overheard by a passing member were thats settled then and by the way guthrie i would advise you to give up dancing youre probably far too old for it in spite of this grave warning guthrie no doubt felt cheered by this conversation and the

im content to leave the matter to the jury and the great defender of the oppressed no doubt having forgotten what his question was sat down not apparently discouraged by what i thought was a particularly shrewd attack detective inspector farraday you gave evidence at the trial of pinhead morgan i said as i rose to crossexamine i did yes at the time you had no doubt that pinhead had said whats written in the confession i couldnt recall exactly what he said but had no reason to doubt what mr gannon had written the answer came out like automatic fire and you have now since chief superintendent belmont showed us the test he proved page two had been written later was mr gannon asked to attend that demonstration i tried to sound as though it were a matter of casual importance not so far as i know were you and your sergeant being asked to gang up on mr gannon my lord the radical qc rose in his wrath thats an outrageous suggestion chief superintendent belmont hasnt had a chance of answering that very serious accusation you mean chief superintendent belmont has human rights even though hes a policeman i asked politely he has a right to answer these charges so i shall be calling him as a witness my lord this was excellent news as i was anxious to crossexamine the top man so i looked worried and only reluctantly agreed to belmont being added to the list of prosecution witnesses when that was settled i turned back to the di with just one other matter pinhead had refused to talk during his first three days in custody yes then you saw him without superintendent gannon being there detective sergeant lane was present on that occasion i know he was and then i put the questions i owed to mr bernards industry did you tell him that unless he made a confession youd hand him over to ted yeomanss mates and theyd do him over in a way he wasnt likely to forget there was another unusual pause but finally the answer shot out as loudly as ever no i didnt tell him that but by a remarkable coincidence the next day he talked at length to the superintendent and did so the minute mr gannon arrived at the station yes but i dont think it was exactly the statement thats been produced in court not exactly the statement produced in court guthrie noted down the answer carefully and then said have you any more questions mr rumpole not at the moment my lord then i shall rise for a few minutes the judge told us all public business my lord i asked because that was the excuse given for all his lordships absences whether caused by the need to visit the gents place a bet or on one famous occasion to help organize industrial action by the judiciary on this occasion he said no mr rumpole its an entirely private matter and he went off to telephone his wife and appeal to her once more to forgive him the hardhearted marigold later told hilda what her answer was im sorry guthrie youve lost your appeal she then put down the telephone the operator of the esda machine gave evidence as to the results of the test and now the man i had been waiting for chief superintendent belmont stood in the witnessbox and answered miles crudgingtons questions more in sorrow than in anger he said he had always regarded roy gannon as a competent and honest officer until the esda test proved otherwise he had arranged the test because of questions that were being asked about morgans competence to make a confession he had hoped that the result would exonerate his force and was deeply disappointed when it did not do so there was no question of ganging up on mr gannon but he wanted to test the recollection of the other officers without any prompting from their superior he would be pleased to stay in the box and answer any questions mr rumpole might care to ask you took a pile of blank confession forms out of superintendent gannons office for the purpose of your test did you do that surreptitiously i dont think he knew about it he was on holiday and was he on holiday when you demonstrated what you assumed to be his guilt to inspector farraday and sergeant chesney lane i dont think so but you didnt tell him what you were doing behind his back at that stage i didnt trust mr gannon altogether the deadly answer was given with a smile to the judge who nodded back his total understanding of the position i pressed on undiscouraged so what did you do i made a report about the information id obtained that was communicated to the director of public prosecutions and then to mr morgans solicitors so he was set free by the court of appeal yes and superintendent gannons left to face the music if he orchestrated it yes you had another officer didnt you convicted for perverting the course of justice superintendent pertwee you do get the occasional rotten apple mr rumpole your particular barrel seems to be unusually full of rotten apples doesnt it chief superintendent may i suggest where the corruption starts where at the top with you the chief superintendent didnt seem in the least startled he went on smiling politely and said thats a very interesting suggestion mr rumpole im sure you understand youre taking a great risk in making these accusations against the chief superintendent guthrie was affecting deep concern as though trying to save the mad old rumpole from committing forensic suicide a risk oh we all have to live dangerously from time to time dont we my lord and i continued my attack on the charming belmont i dont know what you were up to exactly i told him i dont suppose many of the cid officers knew either but superintendent pertwee rumbled you so he had to be persecuted accused of associating with criminals and then have a false charge of planting dope trumped up against him tertwee was convicted after a trial by jury belmonts voice was only a little harsher only slightly less reasonable oh yes chief superintendent and so was pinhead morgan did my client mr gannon come to you and say he thought pertwee might have been framed i dont remember that and was that why you had to get rid of gannon also and was that why you had to make it look as though hed forged a confession so far as i was concerned he had forged a confession so far as you were concerned it may interest the jury to know just how far that was just look at that document will you by now the usher had reached chief superintendent belmont with my trump card and prize exhibit he glanced at it with an apparent lack of interest is that a photostat copy of page two of morgans confession i asked his alleged confession we wont argue about that for the moment the handwriting is mr gannons it would seem to be peel it with your finger chief superintendent look at it very closely has someone gone over every letter with a pencil pressing down hard belmont went through the operation halfheartedly and then in a silent courtroom he said i cant tell oh yes you can i suggest someone did that so the impression of the letters would appear on the blank pages under it then it would look to the machine as if that page had been written later youre not suggesting that mr gannon manufactured this evidence against himself are you at last the witness was at a loss for words but his lordship asked me where the document in question had come from from the chief superintendents office i was able to tell him i suppose i hadnt totally obliterated the once entirely confident belmont he hadnt fainted or burst into tears or begged the judge to release my client without a stain on his character or confessed to perverting the course of justice but as crossexaminations go i felt it rated at least nine out of ten and i went down to the cells with the attendant bernard expecting a word or two of gratitude what i got was something entirely different i might have been an uncooperative murder suspect gannon had to interview as he greeted me with what the hell are you doing mr rumpole defending you and rather well though i say it myself all that you put to the chief superintendent whats the public going to think whats the jury going to think thats what interests me but roy gannon was thinking of wider issues and they clearly worried him if thats going on at chief superintendent level whove they going to trust come on mr gannon i tried to bring him back to the business in hand you had your suspicions about pertwees conviction that was why belmont was out to get you you cant prove that weve got a witness roy bernard told him who chesney lane we werent certain hed come out with it in the witnessbox theyve been trying to shut him up apparently i dont blame them roy gannon nodded understanding his enemies let young chesney blow the whole division the chief superintendent and geoff farraday thats really going to take the tin lid off it i imagine hes going to tell the truth i had never had a less selfinterested client do you think thats going to make it any better the detective superintendent looked doubtful better for you we might even get you off i mean better for the police it was time i realized to make my position clear so i gave him half a minute of the rumpole creed listen to me mr gannon listen the police the judges the public interest the interests of justice all those big words those big ideas theyre too much for me altogether too much ive got a job to do maybe its a small job but to me it seems important im here to see that no one gets banged up for a crime they probably didnt do thats quite likely to happen to you unless you help me but gannon still looked doubtful and shook his head i dont want young chesney saying all that out in public think about it roy mr bernard told him youve got until tomorrow to think about it the next morning miles crudgington was in a particularly confident mood he no doubt thought that id shot my bolt with belmont and had no evidence to support the attack so he told the judge that detective sergeant lane could corroborate di farradays evidence he would therefore tender him as a witness in case mr rumpole had any questions mr rumpole had plenty of questions but would his client let them be asked i turned to take instructions and saw mr bernard standing by the dock muttering to our client have i any questions i asked in a resonant whisper to my relief it seemed that good sense and bernard had prevailed so i turned in the friendliest manner towards the witness detective sergeant lane since you made your original statement have you thought further about the matter yes i have and now now i want to tell the truth the answer riveted the attention of the jury and took the judge by surprise my opponent seemed about to rise and object but then thought better of it so i ploughed on steadily when you and detective inspector farraday were alone with pinhead did mr farraday say something to him he said hed get ted yeomanss mate to do him over did mr gannon know anything about that threat not that i know of but the next day pinhead morgan made a confession to the superintendent yes he did he said im sorry i cut the copper i was all excited what with the car racing and that you heard pinhead say that yes i did can you tell whether he said it because d i farraday had threatened him or because it was true how can he possibly answer that my opponent could no longer keep still thank you mr crudgington im grateful to my learned friend for giving the answer i wanted having disposed of the interruption i turned back to the witness mr lane is that a photostat of page two of the confession mr gannon wrote out once again the usher took the trump card back to the witnessbox yes it is what can you tell us about it chesney lane picked up the page and felt it with his finger and discovered the secret of the case like a blind man reading braille someones gone over every letter with a pencil pressed hard down on the paper i imagine that was done to show indentations on the sheets under it dont lets have what he imagines the radical lawyer was up again i quite agree lets only have what he knows to be true where did you find that document and then detective sergeant lane told us it was in a file i brought from chief superintendent belmonts office it no looked as though someone was trying to frame roy gannon so i decided to keep hold of it thank you very much mr chesney lane and i was in fact exceedingly grateful just wait there will you in case my learned friend can now think of something to ask you after this evidence despite miles crudgingtons heroic efforts to discredit another copper the jurys verdict was a foregone conclusion when it had been delivered i parted with my client who still looked saddened by the way id won his case at the old bailey entrance its a funny thing he said when pinhead was found innocent there was cameras and crowds and cheering supporters its very quiet now isnt it i thought on the whole this was how he wanted it in spite of my clients doubts and reservations i had had what i thought of modestly as a bit of a triumph in court and before i got back to my chambers in equity court i was able to solve another mystery coming up fleet street i saw our new secretary miss dot clapton coming out of the takeabreak sandwich bar with her lunch in a paper bag she was clearly hungry as she withdrew a sandwich took a furtive bite and then popped it back into the bag as she heard me call dot just a word if youd be so kind been buying your sandwiches have you is that what you wanted to ask me no not exactly been dancing with any more judges lately you heard about that dot smiled engagingly poor old chap he was looking that miserable and he danced so funny the way my dad used to so you danced well i can understand that even judges may feel the need to dance occasionally but dot and then i tried to frame a question as difficult as any id had to ask in even the most delicate case youll have to help me after the ball was over was there anything any sort of dot was quick to come to my assistance did we knock it off is that what you mean in yes well it probably is do me a favour mr rumpole you have to be joking yes well yes i probably am dot clapton was still laughing as i left her to her sandwiches she was if anyone ever was a reliable witness i dont often play bridge but when i heard that hilda was going to sit down to cards with marigold featherstone and a woman called josephine tasker who couldnt count her points i decided in the absence of any more serious crime to join them i partnered hilda and at the end of one game she who must be obeyed and i were six down when she accused me of overbidding in the most ridiculous manner i had to agree i was boasting i told them and when josephine tasker left the table to order tea i repeated boasting without a word of truth just like poor old guthrie guthrie marigold featherstone pricked up her ears why do you say like poor old guthrie he had no points but he bid high hed only gone for a drink with our clerk and the amateur actors but he boasted of some great amorous conquest of course no one could ever be foolish enough to believe him you mean nothing happened marigold seemed never to have considered the possibility nothing whatsoever when i inquired of the young lady concerned she burst into laughter at the mere idea laughter i really dont see that guthries as funny as all that lady featherstone looked a little miffed i think what so upset marigold rumpole hilda explained was that guthrie should have discussed it in the sheridan club yes marigold agreed why on earth should he do that dont you know i asked them both because the poor chap was terribly unhappy unhappy marigold was incredulous what on earths guthrie got to be unhappy about well hed been pissed on from a great height rumpole hilda warned me you are in my bridge club sorry hilda i mean hes had a considerable amount of dirty water thrown over him by the court of appeal and then the one woman hes ever really loved was far away and he was missing her dreadfully so he tried to cheer himself up perhaps he danced a step out of time to the music nothing more but he confessed theres no evidence more unreliable than a confession dont imagine people tell the truth about themselves theyll say all sorts of things because theyre afraid or vain or want to boast about things they never did and to impress a few chaps in the club guthries confession would never have got past the court of appeal really is that what you think quite honestly sure of it and whos this only woman hes ever really loved in your opinion someone not a million miles away from this table marigold only one other thing marigold had been sleeping behind a locked door in the matrimonial bedroom while guthrie passed unhappy nights in the spare room after our afternoons bridge she later told hilda she at last opened the door to his lordships tentative knock you may come in now guthrie his wife told him but for heavens sake dont boast about it in the sheridan club my daily round doesnt often bring me into contact with the upper crust those who figure in debrett and fill the gossip columns i dont imagine they are any more lawabiding than the rest of society but their crimes drug abuse for the young hopefuls and city frauds for the dads seldom come rumpoles way as they tend to hire the most expensive and not necessarily the best legal hacks available in froxbury mansions the blueblooded didnt appear nor were they much discussed until she who must be obeyed began to take in coronet magazine a glossy publication given to chronicling the goingson in stately homes we were seated at breakfast one morning and i was reading the papers in a committal i was doing in thames magistrates court when hilda suddenly said how extraordinary the frenchuffingtons are together again his romance with lady fiona armstead is apparently over as i could make nothing of this i gave her even more startling news from my brief walter the wally wilkinson walked into beddoes road nick uninvited and confessed to the southwark triple murder isnt that even more extraordinary totally uninterested in this curious event hilda continued to read the news from her copy of coronet and heres harry ffrenchuffington enjoying a joke with his lovely wife myrtle during the save the starving ball at the dorchester hotel a sixtyyearold man of no fixed address the old bill washed him down thanked him very much and locked him up i interrupted her and then let her into the past life of the wally form drunk in charge numerous theft numerous also fraud on the social services pretty downmarket stuff for a triple murderer lord luxters put on weight was hildas news dont you remember him when he was so slim and handsome on the polo field please hilda do you know any of these people you can read all about them in debbys diary in coronet magazine you can read all about them ive never heard of them well you should rumpole then you might learn about gracious living you might get out of the habit of blowing on your tea to cool it down im in a hurry i explained what do you expect me to do fan it with my hat ah there it is hilda turned a page and cried triumphantly thats what i was looking for sackbut castle whatre you going to do with it hilda now youve found it seat of the sackbut family since the fourteenth century she read out romantic setting near welldyke on the yorkshire moors the iyth baron sackbut occupies the private wing with his young second wife rosemary nee wystan you see rumpole its not all about people youve never heard of you mean this rosemary sackbut whatever nee vystan rumpole it doesnt ring a bell i had to confess oh really whats my name rumpole she who must i mean hilda i corrected myself hastily hilda what hilda rumpole of course during the above exchange i was darting into the hall and back to the kitchen and collecting the hat and mac while polishing off the remnants of my breakfast oh well done she congratulated me ironically now then hilda rumpole nee whaty oh i see nee wystan uncle freddies son was hungerford wystan who went into assorted chemicals and rosemarys his youngest shes my first cousin once removed hilda explained once removed to a castle so thats why i take in coronet i knew rosemaryd turn up in it sooner or later section committal i muttered as i packed the brief away in my bag well try and get the wallys conviction chucked out in the magistrates court oh rumpole hilda was looking at me with disapproval i bet you that no one at sackbut castle eats breakfast with his hat on no wonder they didnt ask us to the wedding i duly arrived at thames magistrates court where i found that my opponent was mizz liz probert radical member of our chambers who was looking far from happy youre not going to object to being sent for trial are you she more or less snapped at me ask not what i am going to do mizz liz watch me in court if im on my feet im probably being objectionable i shall be led by sam ballard at the trial she warned me if hes prosecuting there must be some hope for the defence oh please dont try to be funny rumpole quite honestly i just dont feel like it today so i left her and went to ask a police officer if my client had arrived i was surprised to find that he was delighted to have the wally wilkinson on the premises you mean our triple mr rumpole were all feeling just that little bit chuffed about having his case its not every day you get a triple murderer walk in with his hands up your solicitors there already know your way down sir do you i knew my way down and found my client and mr bernard in a police cell the wally wilkinson was a small chirpy man with wispy hair and an unreliable look in his eyes despite his age he seemed wiry and energetic the prison officer ushered me in saying your briefs arrived walter got all you want have you there was an unexpected note of obsequious respect in the official voice which the wally who was smoking a fag and holding a mug seemed to think was no more than his due this tea he said i wouldnt call it tea pour it back in the horse were just putting on another brew want a couple of biscuits with that do you walter i wouldnt say no i see youre all right for smokes the prison officer seemed relieved mr bernard obliged the wally told him oh by the way perce anything in the paper about my case is there just general background the house victims all that todays courtll be in the standard save us one would you no probs you seem to be getting the fourstar treatment i said when the turnkey had left us well im on a triple arent i mr rumpole the wally looked modestly pleased something out of the ordinary a very serious crime indeed naturally they respects you for it the very serious crime occurred on the night of february in a doneup victorian house near southwark cathedral it was shared by a merchant banker and his friend who was also something in the city the third and younger victim was a social worker named gerald vulmay who was apparently a guest staying the night that gerald the wally told us he was the one who let me into the house you were on your way home i consulted the wallys proof of evidence and you asked him for money and told him you couldnt find a place to sleep all the hostel beds were taken because of the cold weather even the warm spots over the hotel kitchens round the savoy and the regent palace they were all booked up so he just looked at me and said all right theres a spare bed in here im sure theyll let you stay did you meet all three of them i asked oh yes they give me a meal after theyd run a hot bath for me kitted me out in a pair of pyjamas some sort of greek stuff they was eating i had to pretend i liked it then what happened can you remember thats the terrible thing mr rumpole its like my mind went a total blank on the subject they put words into my mouth like when i made the confession all right do you remember walking into the beddoes road nick sort of what made you do that i dunno mr rumpole the wally looked vague did they say you could see a lawyer no they never and them two officers what interviewed me they were very aggressive the prison officer returned with refreshments and said there you are walter bit of a better brew and a few ginger nuts well save you that evening standard thanks perce i call that very kind and as he drank his tea the wally smiled at me i tell you mr rumpole this beats sleeping in a cardboard box any day of the week i fought that committal for three days in the magistrates court and did my best to exclude the confession i knew it was a hopeless case and after the wally who didnt seem particularly disappointed was sent for trial i came out of court to find liz probert sitting on a bench in the entrance hall looking more disconsolate than ever i tried to cheer her up by saying you won the day next step the old bailey i wonder if we can find twelve sleepers in cardboard boxes to sit on the jury by the way have you seen young david inchcape lately were codefending in an affray no i havent seen young inchcape as you call him youd better find him for yourself mizz probert liz what on earths the matter absolutely nothings the matter you dont usually burst into tears when you win cases i could see with embarrassment distinct signs of the waterworks im not bursting into tears at all why should you assume that ive burst into tears just because im a woman she sniffed unhappily it musrbe my contact lenses someone in chambers upset your contact lenses and then i hazarded a guess anything wrong between you and young inchcape isnt that you all over rumpole its just stereotypical male vanity im a woman so if im upset it must be about a man men are the only things women have got to be upset about arent they she searched in vain for a tissue in her handbag and i offered her a stereotypical male handkerchief no thanks oh all right it is about bloody dave inchcape im sorry whats he done its not what hes done its what he is what hes been in secret all these years and hes never had the guts to tell me about it secretly married i wondered i could cope with that no its something well its really unmentionable ugh she shuddered awful hes not worth worrying about naturally i was eager to hear more but an officer came up to tell me that my wife was on the phone and i could take it in the police room when i heard her news told in a voice of almost uncontainable excitement i didnt know if i could take it the distant cousin rosemary it seemed had come through at last we were invited for a weekend at the castle by lord and lady sackbut when i came out of the police room i saw my red and white spotted handkerchief on the bench and liz gone i left thames court and out in the street a press photographer snapped me just as i was blowing my nose sackbut castle near the small town of welldyke was built to defend a large area of north yorkshire it had been besieged three times during the wars of the roses other great historical events had taken place there but when richard the lyth baron brought home his young second wife it was a peaceful enough place and so it remained until shortly before the rumpole visit when jonathan sackbut thirteen years old and on holiday from eton was taking monty the family labrador for an early run by the lake on approaching the water the dog barked and then stood on the edge whining when the hon jonathan joined the labrador he saw indeed they must have both seen the body of an elderly woman facedown in the water she was wearing a drenched rabbity furcoat and the big plastic shopping bag she still clutched was floating like waterwings it became clear when she was fished out that she was some kind of a bag lady a female tramp photographs taken later showed a large broadcheeked face which might once have been pretty the boy ran home to tell his father and stepmother for jonathan was the son of lord sackbut by his first and divorced wife in due course the police the ambulance the pathologist dr matthew malkin and lord sackbut himself gathered by the lake they were joined by dr hugo swabey the local coroner and mr pringle the coroners officer swabey as i got to know him was a selfimportant and officious man in his sixties dressed as though anxious to give the impression that he was a local squire or country landowner although his clothes were far too new for the role pringle the officer who accompanied him was a stout and elderly expoliceman with a yorkshire accent and a perpetual inappropriate smile the coroner welcomed the pathologist told the police he wanted the deceaseds personal effects sent over to his office as soon as possible and spoke with careful politeness to the castle owner good morning my lord i thought it right to get my inquiries going as soon as possible i must ask you have you seen the body yes of course richard sackbut told him my boy found it can you help us then anyone you can recognize no no of course not lord sackbut told him no one ive ever set eyes on and with this he got into his range rover and drove back to the castle for our weekend visit hilda seemed to have packed a wardrobe that would have seen us through a long summer holiday our taxi from the station dropped us outside the main entrance at the west gate as i staggered in with our suitcases the attendant told us to leave our luggage with him and said the rest of youve gone up hurry along so we climbed the wide stone staircase and found ourselves in a great hall with narrow windows bare of furniture except for suits of armour and brutallooking weapons arranged in great circles on the walls in the distance we saw a group of people and a man in a dark suit who was signalling to us and calling out over here my party why does he call it his party rumpole hilda was puzzled and i let her wonder on as the man showed us the view from a window from here you get a good view of the east tower see that narrow window up at the top there thats what they called my ladys boudoir little room where they say the yth baron sackbut locked up his lady wife on account as shed got overly familiar with the steward not a very comfortable boudoir by all accounts is the family about hilda cut him short by asking lord and lady sackbut are in residence he told her yes they occupy the east wing which was built as a family mansion in the year we will now go down to the moat and the formal gardens come along my party but hilda had seen a door beside which a notice read private apartments no admission in here rumpole she gave the order as she led the way through it madam the tour guide said thats not open to the public we are not the public hilda said as she swept out of view i followed murmuring an apologetic she who must to the outraged guide through the magic doorway we found ourselves in a long passage which led to the open door of a drawingroom when we reached it we found it comfortably furnished with chairs and sofas a big fireplace and family pictures on the walls a line of sackbut faces predominantly male high windows opened on to the terrace of the castle sitting in a window seat a pale boy was alone reading a book he looked up and peered through his glasses as hilda approached we are the rumpoles we have been invited for the weekend said hilda the boy stared at hilda silently is your mother i mean is rosemary theyre not back yet im afraid theres only me oh well im hilda rumpole this is my husband said hilda jonathan put down his book carefully having turned down the page and advanced on rumpole with his hand stretched out good afternoon sir im jonathan sackbut horace rumpole we shook hands im rosemarys cousin you know hilda made her position clear once removed i added really rumpole dont lets go into all that at this moment a young woman came in and called from the doorway auntie hilda she had a rather solemn sad face and floating brown hair her youth made her attractive in middle age her looks might harden she talked in a brisk manner with the brightness of youth oh rosemary there you are at last hilda was relieved im sorry richards driving the lorry back from welldyke show i took the car i was terrified of keeping you waiting and rosemary told me you must be uncle horace ive got no alternative jonathan rosemary spoke to the boy for the first time i hope youve been entertaining the rumpoles not really he picked up his book and went out on to the terrace rosemary looked after him theirs i thought was not an easy relationship stepmothers have a difficult time lets see if we can rustle up some tea rosemary pushed a bell near the fireplace richard was so disappointed you couldnt come to the wedding were we asked i wondered of course well im sure you were we sent out so many invitations perhaps you were away were hardly ever away are we rumpole oh hardly ever i confirmed hildas evidence you know rosemary dear it was so funny when we arrived they treated us like members of the public wasnt it funny rumpole oh hilarious i agreed you would like a cup of tea wouldnt you uncle horace rosemary was clearly trying to make up for the absence of a wedding invitation well if you have got anything in the nature of a bottle of red nothing of any particular distinction peasants claret would be perfectly acceptable rumpole she who must be obeyed was not pleased no auntie hilda let uncle horace have what he wants were going to spoil him do sit down uncle horace you must be exhausted after all those absolutely splendid court cases you do rosemary put her hand on my arm and guided me to a chair splendid cases and hilda said with some contempt like walter the wally wilkinson but rosemary continued to look at me with admiration my dad she said saw you in action in some case at the old bailey he said you were absolutely super had the jury eating out of your hand i remember what he told us in the courtroom nobody dares say boo to rumpole well i told her modestly i can be rather magnificent at times and didnt you do one hugely famous case oh yonks and yonks ago something about a bungalow you might possibly be thinking of the penge bungalow murders thats right i say you must tell us all about it it sounds riveting i know richard cant wait to meet you a melancholylooking manservant did bring us tea and i had a bottle of chateau chateau but rosemarys husband had not returned by the time we went upstairs to change of course hilda had told me theyll dress for dinner at the castle so she had brought a long ball gown and encased in a heavy silver breastplate she looked armoured and ready to take on allcomers i managed to button up a dinner jacket which seemed to have shrunk over the years as hilda told me that rosemary had said that old lord plunger plumstead was expected for dinner why plunger does he dive he used to gamble terribly really rumpole you ought to keep up with debbys diary so we went down to our first castle dinner and found that all our guests and the sackbuts had this in common none of them were in eveningdress the men were without ties in sweaters or tweed jackets worn with cord trousers plunger plumstead whose head was sunk like that of an aged tortoise into a collar several sizes too large for him sported an ancient black velvet jacket and a silk scarf the women were dressed casually but no one commented on what now seemed our eccentric attire richard sackbut had finally appeared and turned out to be a man perhaps in his late forties whose long chin gingery hair and blue eyes were echoed in all the family portraits we had seen for some reason which i could not fathom he seemed extremely glad to see me and kept saying it was jolly sporting of you to come all the way to north yorkshire for a weekend this was an opinion with which i had to agree as i looked round the dinner table that night there was plungers wife mercia a stately woman who looked embalmed and so far as i can remember never spoke there was a young couple called the yarrowbys tarquin and helen who talked in very loud voices about people i didnt know and sports and pastimes of which i had no experience pippa and gavin bastion were older i suppose in their early fifties and more sophisticated gavin made cynical remarks in quiet amused tones and pippa a collapsing beauty drank a good deal and smoked between courses towards the end of dinner they began to discuss dr hugh swabey the local coroner he clearly wasnt a favourite with the upper crust of course hes enjoying every minute of your business richard gavin bastion said best thing thats happened to him since he had coach lamps put round his poolside area wheres all the money come from helen yarrowby asked expensive nose jobs in leeds and other sorts of jobs no doubt pippa bastion suggested youve seen him out hunting havent you plunger helen asked the lord who turned to me and said absolutely everything wrong about the chap rumbold he comes out like a dogs dinner that should give him a deep understanding of foxes i said but nobody laughed dont expect swabeys ever got near enough to see a fox he comes out with a string on his top hat pippa said it as though the unfortunate coroner had committed rape on the hunting field and a red coat when no ones asked him to wear such a thing gavin added to the indictment no darling thats not the point the point is a red coat with flat buttons and pippa turned to hilda for support imagine that mrs rumpole oh dear of course flat buttons how very extraordinary my wife did her best to sound appalled while i asked in all innocence you mean youd prefer them round flat shiny buttons without a hunt crest on them gavin explained means he just got the thing off the peg at moss bros is that a serious offence i suppose it depends on what you think is serious in this world plunger looked as though i were prepared to excuse any crime however heinous oh im only used to murder and robbery i told him suchlike trivialities id never heard of the crime of flat buttons before there was a silence then broken by richard sackbut we had rather a nasty accident here rumpole some old tramp woman managed to drown herself in the castle lake is swabey going to be a pain in the neck about it richard gavin bastion asked oh you know what he is he wants to get his name in the papers make a sensational trial of it he thinks hes going to discover all sorts of things that arent there to be discovered its just a bore quite honestly well i dont see that youre responsible for anything plunger assured our host most people have got a lake of some sort havent they rumbold well we have to make do with rather a small one in the gloucester road this was another joke which went down like a lead balloon but rosemary came to my rescue talking of sensational trials darling uncle horace was telling me about that one he did yonks ago in a bungalow wasnt it uncle horace then i lent back and prepared to enjoy myself for the first time since we arrived in the castle it was an extraordinary case i was a young man then a white wig really and i won it alone and without a leader it raised some most interesting questions about bruising and the time of death i mean it should be relatively simple to discover if a bruise were pre or postmortem of course a careless pathologist could cause bruising when removing the tongue during an autopsy thats what happened in the penge bungalow murders there was a somewhat embarrassed pause and i felt that neither my jokes nor my tales from the morgue were greatly appreciated pippa said where is penge actually isnt it somewhere near bognor tarquin yarrowby guessed but richard gave a signal to his wife at the other end of the table at which she rose saying oh yes well shall we leave the men to their postmortems apparently gavin finished her sentence for her gloomily after the ladies had left us the masculine conversation flowed like cement nobody told improper jokes and after a while plunger plumstead who had been staring at me balefully growled i say rumbold can you get your gamekeepers to eat rook well now you mention it ive never really tried when i was a boy gamekeepers pretty well lived on rook their wives used to make it up into pies you wont find a woman wholl do that now tell the truth i dont have any gamekeepers or rooks either come to that odd i thought you said you had a place in gloucester i was saved further embarrassment as richard moved from his place at the head of the table to sit next to me then as gavin bastion started a long story about some local adultery our host said confidentially mr rumpole rosemary was telling me youve had a great deal of success in your cases i suppose i have acquired a certain reputation round the brixton cells i told him i never knew i was famous in castles and a good many of your cases he went on have concerned well dead people dead people yes ive always found contrary to popular belief that they can tell you a lot i wonder if youd have time for a bit of a chat tomorrow he asked tentatively im yours for the weekend youre still available for business always always available good thats very good he seemed relieved and for the first time i saw him smile well now shall we join the ladies why not lets join them i tried a final joke and make one huge enormous lady lord sackbut was still smiling politely but he didnt laugh he was a man i was later to discover who sometimes missed the point as i was tearing off the stiff collar in a large and drafty bedroom i told hilda that i need never have gone through that blunt execution i thought they were slackly dressed for a castle she said never mind we looked smart rumpole we wore the wrong things but they never referred to it you noticed that they never said a word it was sweet of them to ask us wasnt it why do you suppose they did well were family arent we not because were family and not even because they never asked us to the wedding my lord richard sackbuts in trouble hilda at least hes got that in common with walter the wally wilkinson he needs a good brief the next morning there didnt seem to be very much to do but look around the house at the end of the row of family portraits i saw a man who looked so like our host that he could only have been richards father a longchinned blueeyed gingeryhaired man in army uniform under the picture the legend was captain the lord sackbut mp dso born died by the drawingroom fireplace rosemary was taking hilda through a number of volumes of family photographs leading up to an extensive record of the wedding which we had unfortunately missed as i couldnt gasp at the length of the brides train or the good looks of the bridegroom i returned down the passage to the part of the castle thrown open to the public with whom i had decided to mingle i had hardly entered the great hall or heard much of the guides monologue when a man in assertive tweeds emerged from the hoi polloi and introduced himself as dr hugo swabey we met briefly mr rumpole he said when you came up to leeds on that stabbing in the old peoples home of course and you gave some rather novel evidence on the direction of knife wounds well thank you thank you very much i hadnt meant it as a compliment and in fact swabeys evidence was generally ignored one is sometimes able to throw a new light in dark corners you know given a sound medical knowledge and the sort of mind that asks the occasional awkward question i suppose thats why they landed me with the coroners job i hear youre enjoying it yes well seeing the sights of north yorkshire are you no as a matter of fact were guests of the sackbuts youre privileged ive never been invited on to the other side of that door into the holy of holies strange as it may seem though i go out with the hunt and im pretty well known in the neighbourhood his lordship invited you did he oh i think it was his wife it must have been his lordship women dont make many decisions in the sackbut clan come to think of it it may have been rather an intelligent move with the inquest coming up i heard about that some poor old lady tumbled into the lake one of the homeless homeless is that whiat she was or was she looking for a home my officers downstairs now taking statements who was she when was she killed how did she die these are the questions my court will have to answer meanwhile i thought id just wander around and soak up the castle atmosphere all these suits of armour for instance maximum protection and nothing much inside them typical sackbut have you come to see my client i asked him oh is his lordship that already dr swabey seemed delighted that will be fun i think well be able to offer you a few surprises good i shall look forward to it i promised i hope his lordship will too just one thing you might be asking your client to explain among others whats that i had the dead womans possessions sent over to my office the police like to hang on to their things but i insisted well she had a big plastic bag full of old clothes and rotting food and a gin bottle almost empty but there was a sort of plastic purse pretty well waterproof you might be interested in its contents might i there was a return coach ticket to victoria so she wasnt a local tramp nothing like that but more interestingly a photograph taken on the terrace of this castle an old photograph shows a woman holding a baby and a man in uniform no doubt who the man was absolutely no mistaking the family features it was lord sackbuts father now how do you imagine a homeless old bag lady got hold of that mr rumpole there was i thought a certain amount of triumph in his voice as he asked me the question i really have no idea i wonder if your client has im telling you all this for your assistance of course as he said it i thought that the welldyke coroner had absolutely no intention of helping lord sackbut who had never invited him beyond the door marked private im very grateful dr swabey was looking down to the far end of the great hall where the conducted tour was filing out under the command of their giaide i mustnt miss my chance of another look around the grounds and the lake that morning i also inspected the lake i took a turn round the gardens and the found my host in the stables talking to a girl in jodhpurs bout the lameness of one of the horses whose solemn faces peering over their stable doors put me in mind of the portrait the sackbut family at my request he drove me down to the lake in his range rover and took me to the spot where tfr drowned bag lady had been pulled out of the water it had been a wet summer in north yorkshire and there were plenty of marks on the grass path richard told me he drove past there often on his way to a field where he had horses out so i looked dowt to the weedy muddy water from the top of a steep slippery bank and at the odd branches and tree stumps on the way down i stooped to look at a branch freshly broken an d tnen i t my client that id met the local coroner didnt seem to like his lordship very much the feelings mutual it was a heavy f y with a low sky which seemed darker than the bright fields and green trees there were insects buzzing and a part y f ducks on the lake floated lethargically as though half asl p i looked at my client and wondered what secrets he wa s keeping from me what on earth are you worrying about i asked him what do you mea why call on th expert services of rumpole of the bailey who has studied death by crossexamining the great professor andrew ackerman king of the morgues an old bag lady slipped and drowned herself in your grounds sad but hardly a threat to your peace of mind i might have thought were open to the public he tried to explain i mean they might say were not safe nonsense youre not responsible for tramps in the nighttime whats the real problem and whats making the grand inquisitor of welldyke so excited perhaps but if he were about to tell me something he changed his mind its entirely a family matter wed better be getting back tell me i asked him again im used to hearing about family matters murders a family matter nine times out of ten murder he seemed surprised who said anything about murder nothing yet but dear old dr swabey looks as though hes longing to come out with it i didnt get any more from my client and he drove me back to the castle promising a treat for the afternoon a dog show bowling for a pig a tombola and other delights in the castle grounds it sounded like a fete worse than death a comment i kept to myself when i entered the drawingroom in search of she who must be obeyed i thought at first that the room was empty then i heard a boys voice only just audible repeating words which were well known to me jonathan was alone sitting on his windowseat with a book but he wasnt reading he was reciting only occasionally reminding himself of the lines so through the darkness and the cold we flew and not a voice was idle with the din meanwhile the precipices rang aloud the leafless trees and every icy crag tinkled like iron while the distant hills into the tumult sent an alien sound jonathan continued to recite quietly and i joined in with of melancholy not unnoticed while the stars eastward were sparkling clear and in the west the orange sky of evening died away the boy closed the book as soon as he heard my voice and now he looked embarrassed you like that i asked him well yes the sound of it he admitted reluctantly so do i i like the sound of it very much i went to sit at the fireside in front of a big coffee table piled with the family photograph albums hilda and rosemary had been looking at i began to turn the pages idly you live here with your father in the holidays i asked with father yes see much of your mother do you not really whys that perhaps he wouldnt have answered my question if we hadnt recited wordsworth together but he said i went once or twice now it seems easier if i dont go i didnt enjoy it much really then there was a silence while i turned more pages of the albums fascinating i said at last these old family photographs i found a page with jonathan aged about five sitting on a shetland pony is that you when you were really small and insignificant he got up and stood beside me thats me on mouse any pictures of your mother no i dont think so but perhaps there had been there were blank spaces and small traces of paper having been torn out shall we take a dive back into history i found a volume dated and after turning a number of pages i found snaps of the man who looked so like richard thats your grandfather i recognize him from his portrait everyone says he looks just like my father jonathan said i dont seem to look like them at all dont apologize heres grandad on a horse and playing tennis and opening something and oh in uniform that must have been in the last war is there anything like a wedding photograph there wasnt what i found were the same blank spaces the same traces of pictures torn out the signs of a memory someone wanted to obliterate isnt that rather odd i asked jonathan your grandmother doesnt seem to be here either the sky remained dark but the rain held off that afternoon the castle walls were illuminated by a low shaft of sunlight directed from under gunmetal clouds the stalls and tents were set out on a patch of grass under the east tower hilda had gone off to buy what seemed when i had to carry them back to london a huge selection of jams and i was chatting to rosemary who was in charge of an old clothesstall which was being eagerly searched by the mothers and wives of the village got anything suitable for wearing in a cardboard box i asked her you going to take up residence uncle horace rosemary asked ive got a client who may have to go back to one that is if i manage to spring him from the nick i had an interesting talk to jonathan he doesnt see much of his mother does he quite honestly richard thinks it best not she made this ghastly second marriage to somebody ghastly to a chap who sold her a car they live in pinner or somewhere quite impossible can you imagine that after richard and the castle and then the loudspeakers announced that the contest for the dog who looked most like its owner was about to start hilda came hurrying up saying we mustnt miss this extraordinary entertainment and as we hurried towards the judging ring she said just look at the castle towering over us doesnt it make you feel weve been in the middle ages lucky for you were not it must have been so romantic not that id ever have locked you up in the east tower hilda id never have dreamt of doing anything like that not being a lord oh really rumpole i hope you werent talking that sort of nonsense to rosemary not quite we were talking about richards first wife not that it could have been her of course shes much too young besides which shes alive and wed and living in pinner i was following a private train of thought and hilda had stopped listening for we had arrived at the dog ring where owners were assembling with their fourfooted lookalikes there was a fat woman with a pekinese a hatchetfaced man with a lurcher and a man who had taken off his shirt and was holding his grey longhaired yorkshire terrier against the grey hairs on his chest richard stood proudly beside monty the labrador and old plunger plumstead was there with an ancient wateryeyed and evillooking bullterrier to whom he might have been closely related hilda had wandered off to talk to the yarrowbys whom she had greeted as lifelong friends and i stood alone watching as pippa bastion the judge announced that the first prize went to plungers dog the prize was presented by the coroner who stood in another suit of brilliant checks at the judges table when he had been rewarded i went up to congratulate plunger oh bosun and i win it every year god knows what im going to do when the filthy dog snuffs it bottle of cherry bounce presented by dr swabey revolting cant drink the stuff i told him i had spotted a beer tent where we might find something more acceptable oh very good he said good idea of yours rumbold you have these sort of dos in your part of gloucester when we were in the tent coping with large plastic i tumblers full of north yorkshire bitter i said perhaps dogs grow to look like their masters in the way that men grow up to be reproductions of their dads reproductions oh richard certainly is spitting image of old robert fine man robert had a bloody good war peace didnt treat him quite so kindly came back home found all sorts of things wrong lot of pheasant covers cut rooks out of control labour government something seriously dicky about the roof things not so marvellous on the domestic front either not too long afterward his wife bolted off did you know richards mother depends what you mean by know not in the biblical sense old chap he laughed gulped his beer and went on so i was probably in a minority but she always seemed a perfectly nice woman to me a bit affected i remember she always called richard riccardo with a sort of funny italian accent or was it riccardino of course he hated it what was her name margaret maggie was what we called her and what happened to her in the end in the end oh in the end she died that evening we were only four at dinner but with due formality hilda and rosemary left us men to our port and i began to ask richard about his childhood it was then he told me something that had occurred at his prep school a story i shall never forget i suppose i was about nine he said just nine and the message came the headmaster wants to see you in his study after prayers well you know what that meant you got that awful sort of feeling in the pit of your stomach and sweaty hands all the usual symptoms of terror i suppose anyway i knocked on the study door and there he was snowy slocombe a hard man but just perfectly just ive got no complaints about that big tall fellow with snowwhite hair and he told me to close the door and come up to the desk and then he said sackbut i know youre going to take this like a man and then of course i thought i knew exactly what i was in for but he said ive just had your father on the telephone sackbut and hes asked me to let you know im afraid your mothers dead and do you know what i felt rumpole i felt a kind of enormous relief because he wasnt going to beat me we were silent for a little then i asked did your father tell you how she died not really when i came home for the holidays he said i suppose slocombe gave you the message and i told him yes i dont think we discussed it much after that do you know how or where i heard vaguely i think she left home after id gone back to school she must have died soon after that i suppose abroad somewhere ive an idea it might have been italy france or italy but didnt you make any sort of inquiries i found it hard to believe no he sounded quite matter of fact why not i dont think my father would have wanted me to you believed your father of course on so little evidence i wouldnt have doubted him do you have any idea i asked how old shed be now if shed lived i mean i suppose late sixties it never occurred to you that she might try to get in touch with you you mean come back from the dead he was smiling yes something like that i suppose our new friends the sackbuts invited us to the opera where the bastions had taken a box not to be caught out a second time i arrived in a blazer and grey flannels to find the rest of the party in eveningdress theyre so secretive she complained to me in the interval they never let you know what theyre going to wear but richard did give me some interesting information over the champagne and sandwiches after telling me that the fellow on the stage looked a great deal too fat to be accepted into the egyptian army he said i say rumpole i think ive got a young relative in your chambers david luxter his grandfather was lord chancellor and his fathers my cousin you mean the present lord luxter hilda has debrett ever at her fingertips no i had to disappoint hilda im afraid weve got no luxter in our stable oh he did an odd thing richard told us didnt want to rely on his family name cant think why so the luxter boy went into the law under an alias he found a name in some poem or other harry luxter told me something about a bell and a rock the vessel strikes with a shivering shock i told him oh christ it is the inchcape rock not a great poet southey but i suppose young david found him useful thats the name inchcape born the son of a lord and i thought i knew the reason for mizz proberts sorrow i wondered if she would ever forgive him when the opera was over hilda woke me with a sharp nudge and we set off to walk down to the savoy where the sackbuts were standing us dinner we took a short cut down the narrow street behind the strand palace hotel and there men and women young and old were settling down for the night as near as possible to the grilles where a certain amount of hot air came streaming up from the hotels kitchen as our rather grand procession swept by a voice called my name from a doorway and i turned to see a small dosser with a bobble hat pulled down over his eyes holding out a tattered copy of the evening standard which had formed part of his bedding mr rumpole i recognize you sir he handed up the snap of me blowing my nose i see your picture in this old paper as you was defending walter the wally in the big murder case i have got some info for you on that one sir as i loitered to speak further to the man i heard richard say whats happened to your husband i im afraid hes met a friend hilda told him so they walked on sure i suppose that id catch them up i didnt do so immediately as i wanted to hear the story old arnie as hed introduced himself had to tell he would not speak of it however until id bought him a cup of tea and a couple of ham rolls in a rather affected caff dressed up as a parisian bar in the os in the covent garden piazza those patrons sitting down wind of arnie moved to other tables as he munched contentedly i was with the wally that night mr rumpole he told me we was all down under hungerford bridge and he got into a bit of an argument like with bronco billington always a bit of a pain up the bum bronco in a manner of speaking nick never seen anything like it well he had wallys drop of gin and his pie off him and a punchup started and a bit of manual strangulation wallys strong like when hes roused up and he left bronco flattened so we went off sharpish round centrepoint where there was still spaces and next day we read in the papers about the triple murder but the wally was with me all that night straight up he was only thing he reckoned hed done in poor old bronco who was never in good health at the best of times cough his bloody guts out soon as you touch him and had he done in bronco bless you no bronco was in the cut waterloo thursday midnight singing his head off on a bottle of meths idve told the wally only i didnt know where they got him banged up youll be seeing him will you not just yet i told him im defending a lord oh wonderful mr rumpole going up in the world are we you couldnt spare of course i could i handed him a couple of crisp tenners and told him not to waste it all on tea then i wondered if i could recover my outlay from the legal aid fund as the inquest drew near i began to make my preparations cursitor amp carlill of welldyke were the family solicitors and i saw the prim and elderly mr cursitor at my chambers on one of his visits to london i suggested that he must have been sure that richards mother had died because if she were alive she might have had some claim against the estate on his fathers death not really mr rumpole mr cursitor actually put the tips of his fingers together when he spoke something he must have seen family solicitors doing in old movies richards father had started divorce proceedings before his wife left england she never appeared again and the case went through undefended she was no longer married to the late lord sackbut so she would have had no claim did richard know that i dont think we ever discussed it with him im sure his father didnt and who was the man she ran off with an italian prisonerofwar i believe shed met him when he was working on one of the farms i suppose she misconducted herself and joined him somewhere in italy she left no address before i parted from mr cursitor i gave him a number of jobs to do and asked him to put an advertisement in the daily telegraph personal column it was a long shot a very long shot indeed but then i had very little ammunition for someone who has had in the course of a long life a great deal to do with sudden and violent death i have only rarely appeared in coroners courts the proceedings are directed by the coroner who calls for witnesses and asks the questions the legal hack is usually limited to putting a few supplementaries the welldyke court was a dark and stately victorian affair set in a crumbling municipal building for the inquest on the unknown bag lady the place was packed with friends of the sackbuts and i suppose some enemies interested members of the press and some who found an inquest a welcome addition to the pleasures of a holiday in north yorkshire there was a jury of local men and women a shorthand writer and mr pringle the coroners officer acting as the court usher dr swabey sat his face and glasses shining thoroughly enjoying putting the greyhaired pathologist through his paces dr malkin he said in his most patronizing manner please use laymans language not all of us understand the complexities of forensic medicine including you old darling i whispered to no one in particular but the coroner apparently heard me may i remind everyone in court he pontificated this is a solemn proceeding mine is the ancient office of custos placitorum the keeper of the decisions we have the solemn duty you and i members of the jury to inquire into the mysteries of death i hope we may do so without interruption just as soon as you stop interrupting i tried another whisper which the coroner wisely ignored and asked malkin to continue his evidence she was a woman in her late sixties or early seventies in poor general health i came to the conclusion that death was probably caused by a blow to the head with some blunt instrument before the body entered the water i didnt think it was a case of death by drowning because there was no water in the lungs might death have been caused by a deliberate attack swabey asked eagerly a blow to the head by some assailant i thought it might as the pathologist said this there was a buzz of interest in court but i sat expressionless struck before the body was put into the lake swabey asked yes which would make this an unlawful killing or to use a word with which the jury might be more familiar murder the coroner was delighted to say this for the first time in the proceedings i couldnt rule out that possibility no mr rumpole do you wish to apply to ask the pathologist a question swabey asked with a cheerless smile in my direction yes i rose purposefully to my hind legs a good many questions then i shall grant your application very generous sir dr malkin in a case of drowning its possible for death to occur immediately due to a sudden cardiac arrest is that not so its happened in the case of sailors falling off ships for instance it has happened and in such a case there might be no water in the lungs there might not be such deaths have often occurred with drunken sailors they fall off the deck and alcohol produces a state of hypersensitivity to sudden and unexpected contact with water it may do so the pathologist was reluctant to admit it dr malkin you have read the great professor ackermans work the causes of death im sure of course ive read it dr malkin was running out of patience before i ran out of questions professor who mr rumpole the coroner was foolish enough to ask ackerman sir required reading i should have thought for any keeper of the decisions after that enjoyable interruption i returned to dr malkin and the business in hand the professor quotes many such cases i believe he does and we know that this old lady had an almost empty gin bottle in her possession you found a high level of alcohol in her blood didnt you fairly high fairly high so it remains a possibility does it not that this unfortunate lady met her death by drowning there was a long pause before dr malkin with the utmost reluctance said its a possibility yes dealing with the blow to the head this was a particularly steep bit of bank was it not it was fairly steep with a number of branches and tree stumps on some of which traces of blood were found yes can you rule out the possibility that this old lady having drunk rather more gin than was good for her slipped and fell into the lake striking her head on one of those tree stumps as she fell i cant rule that out altogether clearly dr malkin hated to have to say it murder was a far more exciting alternative thank you doctor it seems we may have reached a sensible interpretation of the facts and one that should be obvious even to those who havent read professor ackermans great work as i sat down i looked meaningfully at swabey but he was busy trying to repair the damage i had done to his witness dr malkin he said we gather from your evidence that this blow to the head might have been accidental or it might have been deliberate is that right quite right sir you of course didnt go into the circumstances in which someone might have had a motive for causing the death of this old lady no malkin started but it was time for rumpole to rise in at least wellsimulated fury i object to that question how can dr malkin possibly answer it he cant mr rumpole swabey again smiled unconvincingly that will be the subject of the next part of my investigation i know you will wish to help me with it thank you dr malkin we would now like to ask mr saggers a few questions mr saggers turned out to be the attendant at the west gate who took charge of our luggage when we first visited the castle he was a solid yorkshireman clearly reliable and turned out to be a devastating witness as soon as he was in the box and sworn in pringle the coroners officer showed him the mortuary photograph of the dead bag lady and in particular a closeup of her large but possibly once pretty face mr saggers the coroner said can you recognize the lady in that photograph the lady in the lake i whispered and swabey again made a public pronouncement for those of us unused to courtroom practice i should say that silence is kept while a witness is giving evidence wonder who his grandmother is i asked cursitor and can she suck eggs but now saggers was telling a story i had to listen to it was the day before they found her he said she came up to the castle entrance and wanted to go in she wasnt with any of the groups thatd paid already so i asked her for two pounds she said she hadnt got it but she wanted to see his lordship i told her that wouldnt be possible i didnt think she was anyone hed want to see so well she sort of wandered off what time was that swabey asked just before four because i was going off for my teabreak then as i was passing the formal gardens you know where the long border the white border they call it runs down to the statue well i saw them there you saw who mr saggers the old lady and his lordship i whispered to his lordship urgently taking instructions but richard shook his head and firmly denied the suggestion this added considerably to my worries what were they doing swabey asked just talking together i saw them and then i went on for my tea have you any questions mr rumpole the coroner was looking more cheerful than i felt as i rose to do my best with saggers before you went on for your tea how long did you see these two together perhaps half a minute i didnt stop to look at them and how far away were they down at the end of the border fifty yards about that it was afternoon was the sun behind them i think it was mind you id seen the woman close to at the gate so you said but you couldnt see lord sackbuts face clearly in the garden i made sure it was his lordship how was he dressed a tweed cap and his jersey and cord trousers like he does hed been doing something with the horses he was dressed like many other men who might have been about the garden and the statues that day mr saggers when you say you think it was his lordship will you accept the possibility that you might have been mistaken i did my best as you can see but it didnt get very far saggers the reliable witness answered i know what i saw mr rumpole to be quite honest with you i got no doubt about it when we were getting ready for bed in the castle i told hilda my worries richards going to tell a lie he spoke to the old lady and now hes going to deny it oh richard wouldnt do a thing like that she was sure of it why not because hes a lord because he lives in a castle i tell you hilda people have been lying here since the wars of the roses lying and locking up their wives or tearing their wives photographs out of family albums behaving like that and as i said it i felt i had reached close to the heart of the case because their fathers did it the next day lord sackbut went into the witnessbox at the coroners request and dr swabey examined him in the manner of one whod never been invited into the private apartments and wasnt going to let his lordship forget it to the thousanddollar question richard answered the first time i saw the old lady was when her body was found in our lake i had never set eyes on her before that my lord i remember you told me that at the time and no doubt others heard you but you have heard mr saggerss evidence is he lying im not saying that im saying mr saggers is mistaken i didnt speak to the old lady that afternoon very well the jury will have to make up their minds whos telling the truth swabey gave the jury a trusting look and then turned to another subject lord sackbut when you were a boy your mother left your father i fail to see what thats got to do with this case bear with me my lord i think it may have a great deal to do with it at that time did your father tell you that your mother was dead she was dead yes but how did you know that because my father said so richard was clearly keeping his temper with difficulty he told my school and you believed him of course did it ever occur to you that your father was so angry with your mother that he pretended she had died he didnt want you to try to see her again it never occurred to me that my father would tell a lie dr swabey to me or anyone do you not know that there have been many rumours in your family and in the town that your mother didnt die as your father said but was alive many years later and living in italy i never heard such rumours anyway they would have been untrue this is becoming intolerable i gave another exhibition of the rumpole wrath lord sackbuts here to give evidence not to deal with tittletattle please mr rumpole dont excite yourself you have reached an age when that might be injurious to your health mr pringle the photograph please now i pass to another matter pringle was handing the photograph of richards father in uniform sitting on the castle terrace with a woman and a baby as richard looked at it swabey went purring on we have heard evidence that that photograph was found in the old ladys possession lets look at it shall we is that the terrace of sackbut castle yes and is the man in it your father as he was at the end of the last war it is my father yes oh i am so very much obliged now there is also a woman with a baby is that woman your mother i really cant say richard hesitated you mean you cant remember what your own mother looked like swabey spoke more in sorrow than in anger but the jury looked at richard with distinct disapproval not altogether clearly i suggest to you that it is a family group your father your mother and yourself as a very young child i suppose thats a possibility the witness had to admit or a probability now can you tell the jury why this old lady had that photograph in her possession when she came visiting sackbut castle how on earth can my client know that i was up and fuming again then let me suggest an answer to assist lord sackbut and swabey made a suggestion which was no help at all to richard could it be because she was the lady your father in a fit of wounded pride had given out as dead i object to that i furled on is this an inquest or a lesson in writing pulp fiction there is not a scrap of evidence oh yes there is mr rumpole there is a photograph nowyou shall have your opportunity to ask questions later let me just put this final point to you my lord so i sat down reluctantly and th coroner concluded if this old lady was the dowager lady sackbut fallen on evil days shed hardly be a welcome visitor at the castle would she after all that time shed come no doubt with a claim for money didnt it occur to you m lord that she might be better dead as your father had wished so many many years ago his lordship rejected the suggestion entirely and i took him through it all again nd he denied it again but during the rest of the day i had the strong feeling that the jury didnt like lord sackbut the mafl who couldnt remember what his mother looked like in the middle of the afternoon however mr cursitor who had been out f court came back and whispered in my ear bs had a piece of news that gave us a hope of restoring the sackbut name and putting dr swabey in his place for ever as soon as i heard it i asked swabey to adjourn the case until the next morning he was about to make some trouble over this until i reminded him that there was a writ of mandamus almost as old as coroners courts by which i could haul him up to the lord chief justice i might even have been right about the w anyway we took an early bath and returned the next morning to further good news from mr cursitor i thought it t ght to keep the latest developments from the sackbut family and when we were back in court i passed a note of my further application up to the coroner mr rumpole he s in his most official voice youve asked me to take the evidence of this witness mrs v petronelli sir mrs petronelli and i have no idea what light she can throw on this dark subjet then let me help you out shes here now sir let her come in and be sworn the door of the courtroom opened and mr cursitor appeared standing aside he let in a woman dressed in black she must have been almost seventy but she was still elegant smiling with fair hair touched with grey mr pringle led her to the witnessbox where she took the oath quietly i started my questions before the coroner quite understood what was happening what was your name madam i asked before you married signer petronelli it was lady sackbut and your son is she looked at my client for the first time and said richard he had lowered his eyes and sat with his arms folded mr rumpole do i understand that this lady is your clients his mother sir i still dont know what evidence she can give then perhaps it would be better if i carried on i think the story will become quite clear to everyone very well mr rumpole carry on for the moment if you please the coroner was suffering from a sudden lack of energy as he saw his carefully builtup case of doubt and suspicion collapsing its many years since you saw your son i asked the witness im afraid its a great many years when signer petronelli was alive i think you lived in como yes my husband had a hotel there when he died i decided to sell it and come back to england to where in england to london i live in southwark then i summoned pringle who took the witness the photograph of the dead bag lady look at that photograph will you since you have lived there have you become interested in a charity dealing with homeless people i there seem to be so many sleeping in the street in london we give them meals try to find them beds even invite them home sometimes she looked at the photograph of the dead woman thats bertha bertha when i first met her she was sleeping at the back of waterloo station i let her stay with me one night when we couldnt find her a bed anywhere else we began to talk she told me about her husband whod been a builder and gone bankrupt and been sent to prison for some reason and i dont know why i told her about sackbut castle and my son i never talked much about it to anyone else but with bertha it seemed it wouldnt matter so she stayed the night in your house did she leave the next morning yes i never saw her again was anything missing when she left well yes a photograph id shown her when we were talking i kept it in a desk not on display or anything and when bertha went that went with her i was very angry with her for stealing it pringle handed the witness another photograph the group on the castle terrace is that the photograph you lost yes it is who are the people in that group my first husband myself and richard when he was a baby one final question did your son richard ever hit you over the head with a blunt instrument and push you into a lake no no he never did that to me even if he thought i deserved it and now the witness was looking at her son half smiling he looked up at her after that even dr swabey for all his ingenuity couldnt think of much to ask signora petronelli the inquest was virtually over and the verdict inevitable as soon as it was given the court rose the room emptied and lord sackbut was left alone in it with the woman who had been dead to him so long i knew we should get away early and we had packed our bags and taken them to the court mr cursitors clerk found us a taxi and we drove straight to the station the jury in the sackbut castle inquest returned a verdict of accidental death blah blah we were at breakfast again in the kitchen at home and i was reading the times and hilda had her daily telegraph rumpole she sounded worried you said richard was lying in court oh yes bertha waylaid him in the garden told him she had some news for him probably asked for money he sent her away and wouldnt listen she hung around welldyke until the evening and then went back to the castle full of gin and unsteady on her pins it really was an accident i dont know hilda perhaps he had a secret fear that bertha was his mother he hadnt seen the real one for thirty years but recognizing his mother would mean his father was a liar the father who could do no wrong so he pretended that he didnt have the faintest idea who she was that wasnt very nice of him people arent always nice especially if theyre lords luckily his real mother reads the daily telegraph why luckily oh didnt i tell you i got old mr dryasdust cursitor to put an advertisement in the personal column riccardino wants to see his mother very urgent phone the solicitors and the sackbuts read the times the phone on the wall was ringing i went to answer it as hilda was saying poor woman poor poor woman the call was from mizz liz probert she was off to court early and wanted to let me know that the prosecution was offering no evidence against walter the wally wilkinson the man who really did it apparently was the social workers lover and he had made a confession and there was enough forensic evidence to make it stick apparently they were all in a rather complicated emotional situation that seemed a considerable understatement to me before she rang off i offered to buy mizz liz a drink in pommeroys that evening when i returned to my cooling tea and toast i told hilda another tale of social distinctions you know why the wally confessed to that triple murder i said snobbery hilda pure snobbery he thought hed done in an old dosser called bronco billington but he didnt want to be potted for anything so downmarket so he put his hands up to a smart triple murder that way hed join the upper crust in chokey and be treated like a lord by all the screws rumpole she said thoughtfully i dont think well go to sackbut castle again i dont think well be asked i told her that evening at a corner table in pommeroys and over a couple of glasses of chateau fleet street i broached a delicate subject with mizz probert liz i wanted to tell you that i know all about the honourable david luxter otherwise known as inchcape the hon david liz spat out the title its disgusting instead of a decent upbringing in a oneparent family in camden he was cursed with exlord chancellor luxter as a grandad he was a deprived child a what liz sounded puzzled they all are mizz liz the lot of them the lords and ladies and marquises of whatnot that figure in debbys diary in coronet magazine they turn their sons out of the home at a tender age they put them into the care of some sort of young offenders secure home like eton they lie to them and tell them that their mothers are dead the dice are loaded against the young of the upper crust then we drank in silence when she had thought it over liz said i suppose they are what dave needs is counselling he needs a supportive figure in a secure oneonone situation he needs the confidencebuilding skills that you alone can bring him does he i suppose he has been discriminated against really one of societys outcasts id saw i shouldnt have withdrawn my support replace it liz prop the poor fellow up she took another gulp of the ordinary red and came to a sensible conclusion its a bloody unjust world rumpole she said youve been all these years in the law liz and youve only just found that out rumpole own trial considerable understatement to me before she rang off i offered to b buy mizz liz a drink in pommeroys that evening when i returned to my cooling tea and toast i told hilda another tal lie of social distinctions you know why the wally confessed to that triple murder i said snobbery hilda pure snobbbery he thought hed done

rumpole she said youve been all these years in the law liz and youve only just found that out ii however forwardlooking we may all pretend to be humanity is far more interested in its past than the future tell a man like claude erskinebrown that the planet earth will be burnt to a cinder around a hundred years after his death and his eyes will glaze over and hell change the subject to his past triumphs in motoring cases at acton tell him that mizz liz probert our young radical lawyer was seen in pommeroys wine bar a month ago holding hands with someone other than dave inchcape her regular cohabitee and the fellow will prick up his ears his nostrils will flare and he will show an endless appetite for further and better particulars down at the bailey we spend days and weeks delving into the past trying to discover exactly who it was who was seen loitering outside the eldorado building society in surbiton on the day the molloys did it over or what precise form of words tony timson used in the police car to indicate he was prepared to accept responsibility for the streatham video centre breakin but when it comes to the future its usually dismissed in a brief sentence like you will go to prison for five years by and large as i say the future is a closed book which few people care to open the exception to this rule was a client of mine a somewhat odd bird called roderick arengosmythe whose eyes were firmly fixed on the time ahead the future was a subject on which he claimed to have a good deal of inside information derived from his acquaintances among dead people arengosmythe didnt burst into my life in the way some clients do as the result of a robbery or sudden death his approach was more circumspect as i suppose might be expected of a man who spent such a lot of time whispering to the defunct i got my first whiff of arengosmythe in an oblique manner when i went into the clerks room and discovered soapy sam ballard qc the man who by the workings of blind fate became the head of our chambers cancelling the arrangements for some muchneeded repairs and refurbishments to our downstairs loo set for december of that year weve had all this trouble arranging the builders sir why does it have to be put off henry our clerk protested considering the downstairs loo now resembles nothing so much as the black hole of calcutta in a poor state of repair i supported henrys objection why not get on with it not soapy sam ballard was adamant on the ith of december i cant take the responsibility for that what on earths wrong with the ith of december is it the ides of march or something many a true word rumpole is spoken in jest please ballard dont babble just give us some idea of what youre talking about no time to explain ive got a vat fraud starting before mr justice graves and he added darkly as he departed why dont you ask your wife after the fleeting thought by no means new that our head of chambers no longer had control of his marbles i forgot our strange conversation that evening hilda and i sat on either side of the glowing gasfire in gloucester road i was defending ronnie rabbits timson at the time on matters arising out of the affray in the needle arms stockwell we were halfway through the trial i had got a number of witnesses to contradict themselves on the question of identity and earned a few good laughs at the expense of the police officers notebooks should i rest my case or should i put rabbits into the witnessbox the next day to deny the charges whats the matter rumpole woolgathering she who must be obeyed demanded my attention no no of course not the problem is if i call rabbits timson to give evidence tomorrow hell probably convict himself out of his own mouth and if i dont the jury think hes guilty anyway dont you know what sort of a witness the rabbits person is going to make not exactly i cant see into the future well then you should ring marguerite ballard mrs soapy sam the head of our chambers has taken it into his head to marry the exmatron down at the bailey has she got some sort of crystal ball not that shes got a little man who can tell her about the future she said it as though mrs ballard had rather a clever dressmaker round the corner hes a fellow called arengosmythe it seems she goes to him for readings the works of dickens no the future and shes taken sam to him once or twice why is ballard particularly interested in the future of course since old tubby mathias dropped off the twig hilda always called her majestys judges by their more or less affectionate nicknames sams been hoping for a job on the high court bench so hes been going to a soothsayer to discover if the lord chancellors going to reward his complete lack of forensic skill with a scarlet and ermine dressinggown something like that hilda looked disapproving as well she might and does arengosmythe tell him when hes going to get his bottom on the high court bench marguerite didnt tell me that but she did tell me that sam was terribly worried about something else he said what was that that there was a great black cloud over the ith of december and as she said that a small part of the future jigsaw fell into place one of the bestknown facts about the world is that it is exceedingly small so it came as no particular surprise to me to be told by henry that my old friend mr bernard the faithful solicitor who goes out into the highways and byways and brings me back criminal work to enrich our lives in gloucester road was coming with a new client a certain roderick arengosmythe who was about to face trial at the old bailey so i was to be privileged to meet sam ballards soothsayer arengosmythe turned out to be a large man but his bulk as he sat in my clients chair was curiously illdefined and he seemed blurred at the edges he looked ageless and his plump features were drained of colour as if he had already as hilda would say dropped off the twig his hands were large damp and looked soft as though his fingers were made of putty he spoke in a high piercing north country accent as though he were playing the dame in a principal pantomime standing with his hands clasped over his stomach and calling wheres that naughty boy aladdin now this was the customer to whom it was my clear duty to put the indictment when he had heard the charge against him his voice rose to a raucous protest fraud and false deception mr rumpole do you honestly think my spirit people would descend to that well some of them might i suppose i mean theyre not all saints are they there must be quite a few villains among dead people con men forgers threecard tricksters theres no reason to suppose that theyre not all kicking about the other side as you call it they may be there mr rumpole but white owl would spot them a mile away he can separate the wheat from the chaff can white owl he would never allow threecard tricksters in my front room even dead ones particularly dead ones just remind me i searched through the open brief on my desk who is white owl an ancient chief of the sioux indians mr rumpole mr bernard my instructing solicitor was used to repeating impossible defences in a deadpan manner he copped it apparently at the battle of little big horn not copped it mr bernard if you dont mind the spirit people do not cop it they pass over what is alleged is a perfectly simple con trick i brought the meeting back to reality you charged your customers no less than pounds a session summoning up the spirit people can be very draining you persuaded the punters that they were hearing the voice of this fellow white fowl white owl please mr rumpole the sioux people are extremely sensitive i beg his pardon white owl you said could foretell the future all the spirit people can mr rumpole youll be able to as well when youve passed over really i cant wait its further suggested i refreshed my memory from the prosecution statements that woman police constable battley who attended a seance pretending to be a member of the public i could tell her sort at once mr rumpole blood red that was the colour of her aura all the same you took her fifty quid and allowed her a punt at the passed over white owl apparently came through after a good deal of delay white owl can be a naughty boy on occasions mr rumpole he doesnt always want to come when hes sent for later she left the room under the protest of needing the lavatory lying bitch youll trip her up on that one wont you when it comes to my day in court she went into the door of the next room and discovered your sister harriet crouched over a microphone harriets hobby is electricity mr rumpole it always has been ever since we were nippers together the wpc immediately summoned the help of detectivesergeant webster who was waiting outside the front door armed with a searchwarrant on entering your flat he found the microphone connected to a small and unobtrusive speaker taped under the table where your seance was going on are they suggesting that my sister and i were cheating mr rumpole be quiet now white owl he said this to some unseen presence apparently hovering near his left shoulder and flapped at it with a large white hand in the manner of a man trying to deter a mosquito dont interrupt when im trying to talk to mr rumpole white owl is getting a bit aerated sir he feels this case is a personal insult to him quite honestly dont worry about white owl hes safely outside the jurisdiction its you mr arengosmith they might put in the slammer arengosmythe my client looked pained whichever was your sister harriet connected to your livingroom yes of course she rigged that up so we could chat when we were working in different rooms were working on a history of the occult we carry on a great tradition mr rumpole which goes back to merlin and he was by appointment at the court of king arthur a fellow who ended up entangled in a thorn bush from what i can remember well now whats your defence mr arengosmythe understandably my client was at a loss for an answer then he said you know mr samuel ballard dont you he will vouch for me that may not of itself be enough to establish your innocence and then i looked at him filled with curiosity what exactly did you tell my notsolearned head of chambers i told him what white owl had seen when he came for a sitting with his wife and what was that a terrible black cloud hanging over the ith of december a day of extraordinary danger what will you be doing on that precise date yourself mr rumpole defending you down the old bailey i tried to say it as cheerfully as possible by the way when youre next chatting to white owl ask him to have a few words with the late sir edward marshallhall it will need a brilliant stroke of advocacy to save you old darling as i walked down fleet street to ludgate circus to start with no especial enthusiasm or hope of success the case of r v arengosmythe i happened to catch up with soapy sam on his way to one of the lengthy tax prosecutions in which he is used to lulling the jury to sleep i hailed the man and told him i was defending his soothsayer i know you are rumpole i recommended you to him by the way i was very impressed by arengosmythe and so was marguerite he seemed to have an uncanny power of seeing into the future youll get him off wont you perhaps if the judge and the jury have all passed over he gets on extremely well with the dead ballard digested this and then asked what i thought was a somewhat naive question hes not bent is he of course not straight as a corkscrew oh i forgot he no doubt brought you tidings of great joy about your future as mr justice ballard the terror of the queens bench he told me something in confidence rumpole that was why i didnt think it would be proper to act for him myself i told him that for some reason you had a remarkable record in securing acquittals didnt he also tell you to beware the ith of december he did say he saw a black cloud hanging over that date yes thats why i thought it unwise to get the workmen into chambers particularly as weve got a remarkably superstitious downstairs loo when i was robed and wigged and ready for the fray i glanced at the date on the old bailey noticeboard announcing our case as that days attraction it was december and it was set down for two days our trial judge was mr justice teasdale a small highly opinionated and usually bumptious person who was unmarried lived in surbiton with a persian cat and had once achieved the considerable feat of standing as a conservative candidate for westonsupermare north and losing the trial turning as it did on matters arcane and communication with the dead seemed to affect his nerves he looked jumpy and seemed anxious to find a simple scientific explanation for arengosmythes alleged gift of secondsight his lordship was therefore greatly relieved at the police evidence and the description of the wire which stretched from a microphone in one room to the little speaker taped under the table next door sister harriet who was found with this device had conveniently taken refuge in a complete nervous breakdown before the trial and a doctor had certified that she was quite unfit to give evidence for either the defence or the prosecution however the wpc told us what she had seen and detective sergeant webster produced the mechanism a microphone and a speaker connected by yards of discreet darkly coated wire did you take this electrical equipment from my clients flat straight to the police station i asked the detective sergeant more to kill time than because i had hit upon any brilliant line of defence yes sir i did and has anyone made any alteration or adjustments to it since you took it im sure they havent sir just let me look at it will you the usher came round with the exhibit in a plastic bag i took the microphone out and looked at it trying to seem knowledgeable on the subject of sound systems i undid the long coil of flex and started to follow it to its connection with the small speaker and then i saw something which seemed to offer arengosmythe an unexpected and perhaps undeserved escape from his troubles the wire divided at the speaker it looked old and rusted and one of the small screws had dropped out and only one strand was connected with no talent for science even i knew that this was a serious fault when the contraption was handed round the jury a collection of amateur electricians and do it yourself enthusiasts it was clear that on the night of the visit of wpc battley the date of the charge against my client the hotline to harriet arengosmythe couldnt possibly have been working the device was out of order well of course i knew that it hadnt worked for years arengosmythe was in the witnessbox answering my questions did your sister know it too oh no i let her carry on she thought she was helping the spirits come through you see shed done that since we started our work with the occult that was before we charged for sittings of course he was familiar enough with worldly matters to add the last sentence calculated to save him from the charge of attempted fraud so when the woman police constable came to your seance there was no voice coming down the wire certainly not then where was it coming from the judge asked with considerable trepidation my client his large head turned as he looked over his shoulder carried on an inaudible conversation with someone unseen mr arengosmythe the judge was becoming testy who on earth do you think youre talking to no one on earth my lord its white owl he always wants to have his say theres no keeping him quiet who is this white owl the judge glared accusingly at me from behind his rimless spectacles do you know mr rumpole oh yes my lord white owl is a sioux indian who unhappily lost his life at the battle of little big horn well tell your client to get rid of him at once im not having him here this is a court of law mr rumpole not a darkened sittingroom in earls court now then whats your case where do you say the voice came from ever ready with a familiar quotation i was able to intone there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy this thought made his lordship extremely uneasy members of the jury the question you have to answer is did mr arengosmythe have the intention to deceive its clear now that the prosecution case of deception has broken down like that old and useless line between the two rooms my client has told you that he knew it was broken but the voice of the deceased white owl was coming from somewhere from where members of the jury that is the question you have to ask yourselves is it just possible that the restless and talkative sioux had entered that little sittingroom or is it possible that my client genuinely believed that he had either way members of the jury the prosecution wouldnt have proved its case and mr arengosmythe would be entitled to be acquitted i made the best speech possible in the circumstances and the judge summed up nervously as though half expecting an outraged and uncontrollable interruption from white owl someone he pointed out had spoken in the darkened sittingroom if it was not the microphone as now seemed certain was it the defendant disguising his voice or performing some act of ventriloquism if it were his voice did he honestly believe that he was possessed by some spirit who had died many years ago in montana territory or was it possible that some sort of paranormal manifestation had indeed taken place the jury must remember that even mr rumpole had not suggested that any of white owls predictions had proved correct his lordship then left the matter in their hands with some relief and popped out of court for a cup of tea and a breath of fresh air whether the credit should go to me or white owl our day was crowned with success after a long retirement the jury having tussled with the mystery were not convinced of my clients guilt sometimes a thousand wangling instruments will hum about thine ears and sometime voices that if i then had waked after long sleep will make me sleep again lets hope hilda was silenced by shakespeare but a few seconds later she was at it again you know who it is dont you how would i know who it is so you admit its someone a great crossexaminer was lost when hilda didnt take to the bar no doubt its one of your business associates what on earth do you mean its some burglar or other i tried to reason with her i asked her why any halfway intelligent burglar would break into our flat for the sake of a few bottles of pommeroys plonk a rented television set and her old friend dodo mackintoshs watercolour of a rainy afternoon in lamorna cove i dont know rumpole hilda thought the matter over why dont you go and see the bed was warm id had a hard day in front of the recorder at the bailey and was due for a harder one in the morning i opted for the line of least resistance and said unwisely no need to make trouble for the fellow so you admit its someone she spotted the weakness of my defence are you afraid to find out who it is dont be ridiculous but are you im well known as an entirely fearless advocate i dont mind what i say to judges i dont believe its a judge in there rumpole poking about among our things the point is are you afraid of burglars its not a burglar hilda i shut my eyes and yawned as positively as i could its a figment of your imagination all right then prove it i cant im asleep or is that another job youd rather leave to a woman if it hadnt been dark i would have seen im sure that hildas glance was withering she climbed out of bed and went off to battle well there are limits even to the rumpole reluctance to interrupt burglars about their business i was shamed into putting on a dressinggown and when i entered our sittingroom i found hilda armed with an umbrella prepared to repel invaders the room seemed to be burglarfree the television set was still with us and dodos view of lamorna cove had found no takers however the window was open and the night air was stirring the curtain above the table where i had left a brief you see rumpole the windows open she thought it proved her case didnt we leave it open im not sure wed make the most terrible witnesses but this is rather odd i was looking at my brief in the case of the queen against joby jonson accused of the robbery with violence of a seventyfiveyearold lady in the euston area working on the papers before we went to bed i had left them as i usually do scattered over the table and in no particular order now they had been put together and neatly tied up i undid the pink tape and started to check meanwhile hilda was going through the drawers in the bureau money chequebook mrs othingummys wages still in her envelope she said nothings missing something is what ill the proof of evidence of joby jonson the sixteenyearold robber of oldage pensioners his defence such as it is has melted into air into thin air so somebody was here hilda was triumphant she was also right she usually is at that period when the rising wave of crime finally engulfed froxbury mansions claude erskinebrown was waiting poised unhappily between elation and despair to discover whether the lord chancellor had awarded him a silk gown and permitted him to write the letters qc after his name if you want to become of her majestys counsel learned in the law you have to apply with the support of a few judges and await the outcome with bated breath so on the morning after our burglary the erskinebrowns were at breakfast in their tartedup islington house as phillida the portia of our chambers was reading the times the conversation i should guess from my knowledge of subsequent events went something like this any sort of news in the paper today philly claude would have asked as he poured skimmed milk on his muesli some sort of news yes his wife told him danger of war in bulgaria earthquakes in south america renewed threat of global warming no i mean important news the list of the new qcs for instance look for yourself phillida offered him the times but sudden fear overcame him no philly im not brave enough to look for myself i dont think i could put up with another disappointment the truth of the matter is that the unfortunate claude had applied for silk five years running and his name had not yet appeared on the magic list now phillida read out some slightly more relevant news the list of queens counsel will be announced by the lord chancellor next month its expected to include tabitha merryweather the brilliant ghanaian woman civilrights lawyer from miles crudgingtons radical chambers in the edgware road nothing to say ill get it claude was downcast nothing to say you wont i mean youve asked often enough theyll probably give it to you for persistence we all know you got it first time his tone may have become somewhat bitter rather a fluke actually it wasnt a fluke claude gave voice to a longheld grievance it was because youre a woman i mean i know im not a woman but its a bit hard being discriminated against all the time for reasons of sex i know what the lord chancellor thinks just because im a man i go about with my head in the clouds dreaming but im perfectly capable of coming to firm decisions now then what do you think id like best the organic apple juice or the mixedberry health drink i cant help you there claude phillida could be merciless you make up your mind on that one old chap when he arrived at the old bailey for his days work claudes hopes received a severe setback he went for a cup of coffee in the canteen and there saw soapy sam ballard the alleged head of our chambers relaxing over a cup of tea and the yorkie bar he indulged in when his wife the exold bailey matron was not in view claude took a seat beside him and his attention was riveted when ballard told him that his name cropped up when i was talking to old keith from the lord chancellors office did it ballard did it really he naturally wanted to hear my views as head of chambers on your application for silk oh ballard was he really interested claude must have been overcome with emotion i mean theyre taking my application seriously naturally theyre taking it seriously keith was saying it has become a sort of annual event like christmas you mean they look forward to it lets say they give it serious consideration i was able to let keith have my views fairly fully oh thank you ballard thank you very much i said wed worked closely together over the years yes we have havent we ballard worked extremely closely and that on the whole youd matured considerably well none of us is getting any younger i meant ballard was unkind enough to explain that i didnt think there would be any repetition of the incidents in which youd been involved in the past incidents claude felt outraged and innocent what incidents incidents such as the complaint i had to deal with lodged by our new typist miss clapham clapton yes of course dorothy clapton dot is that what you call her ballard looked suspiciously at the everhopeful claude thats what you call her do you you told keith from the lord chancellors department about dot claude was deeply shocked i felt it was my duty it was some evidence which the lord chancellor would have to consider of your lack ofgravitas my lack of what bottom ballard explained it might be some indication that you are not fundamentally sound thank you ballard that was extremely kind of you the erskinebrown heavy sarcasm was quite lost on soapy sam i also pointed out that your elevation would mean we had three silks in chambers in my opinion too many cowboys and not enough indians indians now claude was losing whatever coolness he had possessed im not an indian ballard unfortunately if only i were an indian and a woman id get silk at the drop of a hat and there wouldnt be enough really important work for three leaders you are far better off in the second eleven claude one of the backroom boys we can always rely on you said that to keith from the lord chancellors office i did so in your own best interests you pompous prick in my opinion claude put the matter extremely well and with unusual brevity it was a phrase bollard would long remember particularly as a party consisting of two or three solicitors a client and an elderly lady barrister at the next table looked up with interest i dont think i heard that erskinebrown ballard did his best to appear unmoved but the charge was repeated i said you are a pompous prick and if you dont know what that means i suggest you ask dot clapton its a view of your character quite commonly held in equity court so claude left ballard to what was left of his yorkie bar and went off to suffer in a long postoffice fraud seeing his silk gown still eluding him sixteenyearold joby jonson was in custody he was on remand awaiting trial a person still presumed to be innocent and he was banged up with adult offenders in a place which through no particular fault of the prison staff had become a university of crime its overcrowded unsanitary and prisoners on remand enjoy worse conditions than they did in the last century as we sat in the interview room awaiting his arrival a wellfed screw on the point of retirement told mr bernard and me that joby wasnt exactly a happy boy it seemed he was in a cell with a couple of lads only a little older than him there had been some disagreement and a burning fag end had been stubbed out under jobys eye what can we do about it mr rumpole weve got no time quite honestly id like to give those lads a bit of g and s if time allowed gin and soda i wasnt following the mans drift gilbert and sullivan sir we did a great mikado years ago when i was in the canterbury nick get joby into a kimono and thatd be the answer to all his problems absolutely certain of it mr rumpole g and s worked wonders for all of us when we had the time for it i was the possessor of a reasonable bass baritone when the prisons was still a bit civilized i cant do it now all the same he went off with a gentle rendering of the one about making the punishment fit the crime having ushered in a sullen and scarred joby jonson our client was a short stubby gingerhaired youth who sat with his arms crossed and an unfriendly expression on his face when he spoke he pointed a stubby finger in my direction and called me yo a word i was eventually to translate as you the events which led up to our meeting can be summarized as follows one morning in the previous october a mrs louisa parsons aged seventyfive living at pondicherry avenue somewhere behind euston station answered a ring at her front door on the morning of ith october the youth who was there said you still living here mrs parsons and ran off later that day a person she identified as the same youth although his face was partially covered again rang her doorbell and when she answered it forced his way in attacked her punched her in the face and stomach tied her up with some cloths from the kitchen kicked her and having broken up most of the crockery and some of the furniture in the house left with mrs parsonss postoffice savings book in which there was a balance of she later identified joby at an identification parade in the euston nick first time i ever see the old bat my client told me when i had outlined the case against him was at the id parade it might be as well when you come to give your evidence if you could resist the temptation to call the victim an old bat i gave him a word of warning it might not endear you to the jury and then i asked the attendant bernard for a copy of our clients statement the document which had mysteriously walked out of proxbury mansions in the middle of the night our defence if you could call it that was an alibi the statement started in a fairly unpromising way with so far as i can remember at the time mrs parsons was attacked i was hanging out near the superloo in euston station with three girls down from manchester i found singing and dancing a bit i think one of their names might have been tina i am unable to supply the full names and addresses of any of these persons not exactly what id call a castiron alibi i had to be honest about it mr bernard says as yo was a brilliant brief like cant yo get me off on that i may well be a brilliant brief joby but i cant perform miracles i am unable to walk on water or turn base metal into gold and i cant make much use of a socalled alibi which fails to explain the most important piece of evidence in this case whats that meant to be then your palm print i had to tell him on the inside of mrs parsonss front door how did that get there how would i know think about it i advised him its a question youll have to answer some time by the way what happened to your face looks as though youve been using it as an ashtray something like that shall we help you complain to the governor leave it out mr rumpole yo want to get me killed no as a matter of fact i want to get you off so think about that palm print why dont you yo think about it mr rumpoles going to do his very best for you mr bernard was always reassuring although i had clearly not impressed our client as a legal wizard you just listen to him joby and yo listen to me jobys finger stabbed the air in my direction im not putting my hands up in court i dont care what anyone says yo get that into your heads both of yo as we were waiting to be sprung from the prison gates mr bernard who rarely expresses an opinion on a client went so far as to say that he hadnt found our latest customer a particularly likeable lad it was i thought the understatement of the year the characters of young offenders have clearly deteriorated since the good old days where have all the artful dodgers the cheerful cockney pickpockets sticking their thumbs in their waistcoat pockets and saying watcher me old cock sparrer gone it was a sad day for england when john dawkins turned into joby jonson and then one event occurred which took our chambers at equity court completely by surprise and caused as much consternation as rights of audience in the higher courts being given to lay preachers and disc jockeys or the abolition of the wig and judges listening to arguments from counsel in tshirts and jeans it was something neither their legal training nor their admittedly limited knowledge of the world about them had equipped the learned friends to deal with miss dot clapton appeared at work with a diamond in her nose her appearance wasnt entirely oriental otherwise she was dressed as usual in black tights an abbreviated black skirt and some sort of reasonable jacket i dare say the diamond had never seen amsterdam no doubt it was a serviceable imitation but fixed in some way which the members of chambers preferred not to think about it flashed and glittered in miss claptons delicately moulded nostril like a rich jewel in an ethiops ear and its presence could not be disregarded two issues of fundamental importance and great difficulty were immediately raised by this ornament the first was whether it is proper or professional for a barristers chambers to employ persons who bedeck their noses in this particular way and the second was how the matter was to be put delicately to miss clapton i happened to be loitering around the clerks room when the diamond made its first impact and henry tried with no particular success an indirect approach to the subject a senior clerk couldnt want for more efficient staff than you dot he started off with some embarrassment or more pleasant i have done my very best to make you feel at home here im sure but a barristers chambers is well a barristers chambers you got some criticism of my typing henry dot clapton was giving him no sort of encouragement quite frankly dot your typing has been little short of perfection henry had to admit or the speed at which i gets the fee notes out you get the fee notes out dot at the speed of light but what i wanted to say is well some of our barristers are what i suppose youd call oldfashioned oldfashioned id call them museum pieces still in yfronts and braces if anyone cared to look now why dont you be a good boy and let me get on with my work at this dot clattered away on her typewriter and only spoke again when claude came in looked for a brief failed to find one had his eye caught by the sparkle in our typists nose and gave a convincing imitation of a bottle of fizzy lemonade exploding on a school picnic something amusing you mr erskinebrown dot asked coldly no certainly not nothing in particular and claude did his best to explain its just that i havent had much to laugh at lately happily for him this speech was cut short by the arrival of mizz liz probert who took one look at dot and congratulated her its what chambers needs she told us someone whos not afraid to make a statement were not male clones are we dot were not imitation men in pinstripes were the great sisterhood of free spirits during this stirring political address miss claptons fingers were dancing on the typewriter and my attention was diverted by henry telling me with his hand over the telephone receiver that he had the home office on the line and the undersecretary would greatly appreciate it if i managed to drop in for a brief chat its not often that im called in to discuss affairs of state and we were arranging a convenient time when young david inchcape blew in went straight up to dot and asked her to type out his particulars of negligence although she turned her face up to him smiled and gave him a full view of its landscape he seemed to notice nothing unusual at all the same could not be said for the head of our chambers when soapy sam ballard came in he stood transfixed as though he had caught us lounging around smoking hookahs and watching the semifinals of the inns of court bellydancing contest he stared at dot and then did his best to say in calm and confidential tones to our clerk i shall have to call a chambers meeting on the serious situation which has just arisen henry i sincerely hope all members will make it their business to attend as a matter of urgency i shall rely on you rumpole he avoided another glance at dot and noticed my existence as a senior member to see everyone gets the message oh dont rely on me i had to warn him im rather overworked at the moment government business i had never been inside the home office before i knew it only as a threatening institution which had managed whether by illluck or bad judgement to turn prisons into slums and raise us to the proud position of number one of the european league for incarcerating our fellow citizens i discovered a daunting concrete erection near st jamess park tube station inside this lubyanka i was courteously met by a young lady civil servant and sat on a sofa in an anteroom with several back numbers of the illustrated london news and the police gazette after a prolonged study of these publications i was admitted into a large room full of sunlight and abstract paintings and into the presence of a plump pinkish aggressively healthylooking person who introduced himself as tom mottram undersecretary for home affairs with special responsibility for prisons im the fellow who tries to keep your clients in horace rumpole i told him im the fellow who tries to keep them out oh good very good mr mottram seemed to be easily amused and he called on a pale neat little man with outsized spectacles to join in the fun isnt that good gladwyn this is gladwyn dodds parliamentary private secretary i say rumpole sit yourself down you may have wondered why i asked you to drop in i was shown to another sofa and tom mottram plumped himself down beside me its about a young man called he paused as though to search his memory for the name and then came out with joby jonson really im a constituency mp i hope a good one tom mottram told me you can be more use on your own patch than in some great unwieldy place like the home office well ive had joby jonsons mother round at my surgery week in week out poor woman shes really quite distracted i expect she is i told the old girl id make sure he was properly defended of course i was delighted to hear you were appearing for him so i can tell my constituent hes being looked after hes having the time of his young life banged up twentythree hours a day in a sevenfoot cell with a couple of sworn enemies and their chamber pots they pass the time by stubbing cigarettes out in his face and hes entirely innocent innocent the undersecretary looked startled is that your view of the matter innocent as we all are i reminded him until twelve fellow citizens come back into court and find us guilty oh youre giving us your courtroom performance mottram smiled its very good isnt it gladwyn very good indeed the little man behind the desk was less than enthusiastic i was just trying to point out the condition of prisoners on remand worse than they were a hundred years ago we know that dont we gladwyn mottram agreed with an unexpected enthusiasm only too well im afraid mr rumpole and our minister would be the first to agree with you gladwyn chimed in so why doesnt your minister do something about it i made so bold as to ask the great british voter the undersecretary sounded weary terribly keen on seeing people banged up and terribly against them being let out you know our prisons are bursting at the seams you know they dont do anyone the slightest good halve the prison population and you might halve crime gladwyn and i know it our minister knows it unfortunately we live in a democracy and we have to obey the instructions of our masters with votes so we find it better to leave these things to the private sector people like you of course and seb pilgrim and who the name meant nothing to me you dont know seb he runs yert i beg your pardon youth enterprise reform trust gladwyn explained you must have heard of sir sebastian pilgrim an absolutely splendid super chap tom mottram was almost breathless with admiration he carried his bat for england and does wonderful things for hopeless cases like joby jonson he teaches young lads cricket gives them a bit of pride in themselves reforms their characters you two should get together do you really think so i was doubtful i never carried my bat for anywhere never you mind mr rumpole you and seb pilgrim have your hearts in the right place then the telephone rang on gladwyns desk and he said the minister would like a word with his undersecretary excuse us wont you tom mottram moved to the instrument our masters voice many thanks for dropping in im sure youll see young jonson doesnt do anything stupid in court stupid i asked as i heaved myself up from the sofa make things even worse for himself putting up some sort of idiotic defence ive told his poor old mother youve got enormous experience in these sorts of cases and please keep hammering on about our ghastly prisons while you keep up your masterly inactivity i asked but the undersecretary was now murmuring respectfully down the telephone and the audience was over when i opened the front door of the mansion flat that night after only half a bottle at the most of pommeroys per cent chateau thames embankment i suffered a severe nervous shock the air was torn by a terrible banshee wailing such a sound as i havent heard since the nights of the blitz when the germans were overhead i was thinking of bolting down to the cellar or anywhere away from the bombardment when hilda appeared pressed a number of buttons on some device fixed in our hallway and we had the all clear if thats going off every night i told her ill get a campbed put up in chambers dont be so ridiculous rumpole its a perfectly simple burglar alarm an absolutely essential precaution since the night of the crime you just press seven six nine oh two three one eight and the yellow button twice then itll be quiet immediately what else have you installed hilda death rays man traps are you going to sit up all night in the kitchen with a loaded shotgun come on old girl weve got to give the criminal classes a decent chance to earn a living in fact we had even greater protection for a member of the old bill emerged from the sitting room at that moment and introduced himself as detective sergeant appleby of the kensington force he had been called in by she who must be obeyed in the great brief burglary case a very thorough investigator your good lady d s appleby didnt need to tell me seems to know my job better than i do tells me we must look for fingerprints whats the matter mr rumpole have the villains turned against you you been losing their cases lately still recovering from the shock of the alarm i was in no mood for a jokey ds i dont imagine youll find any prints i told him rather sharply he must have been a pro probably wore gloves and he didnt take anything of value as i understand it sir just some papers out of one of your cases now i wonder who can have been interested in that yes sergeant ive been wondering that too the case of joby jonson was attracting wide attention from the criminals to the corridors of power a couple of evenings later i got a telephone call from none other than that absolutely super chap sir sebastian pilgrim he would simply love me to come down to the club and see the sort of work he was doing for lost sheep like young joby and if id be good enough to agree hed send his driver for me a few evenings later a sedate rolls appeared in the gloucester road and i was driven in an easterly direction by a chunky cropheaded man who introduced himself as fred bry sir sebastians driver as we travelled along the marylebone road towards euston station it was clear he was proud of his position and he spoke of his employer as a great gentleman with a true understanding of delinquent lads never talks down to them if you know what i mean always speaks to them on their own level and they appreciates that of course ive seen lads come to our club what you wouldnt think fit for anywhere but an oldfashioned borstal and theyve ended up not saints im not saying that exactly but reasonable human beings and pretty useful opening bats fred wore no chauffeurs uniform but was dressed like a pt instructor in a highnecked sweater and trainers there was a heart and a set of initials tattooed on the back on his hand the youth enterprise reform trust or yert as the undersecretary at the home office had called it occupied a delapidated building in eversholt street near to the station i was led down a stone staircase and then into a space like a huge echoing gymnasium there was a coffee bar on our side of the room and a pool table and pingpong and at the far end a net had been fixed up and a line of boys were bowling at a tall goodlooking man with dark hair touched with grey who plied his cricket bat with what i assumed to be considerable skill sebs what we all call him no side to him you see absolutely no side at all fred the driver assured me and as we approached the net a ball came bouncing in my direction by some mischance i put out my hand and caught it something i couldnt have believed myself capable of doing and seb came out to greet me with his bat under his arm applauding so far as i could see without mockery well done mr rumpole you want to have a go in the net not in the least i assured him im allergic to any form of sport except teasing her majestys judges youre a famous man to all my lads you know now youre not allergic to a drink i hope i thought youd never ask seb handed his bat to a delinquent lad and we went over to the bar where another delinquent was serving his fellows my hopes were dashed when my host uttered the dread words tea coffee hot soup sevenup or froojucella i thought you were offering me a drink im afraid i showed my disappointment so i was froojucella might seriously damage my health as my alcohol level has sunk to a dangerous low now if you have a glass of humble claret chateau boys brigade if its available im afraid it isnt he was still smiling and made no apology or you might send over to the station for a bottle of british rail rouge ill get you a coffee and lets find ourselves a table so as you may imagine i wasnt in the cheeriest of moods as i sat and looked round the gym fred the driver was now seated in the middle of a circle of delinquents to whom he seemed to be giving some sort of peptalk or seminar all the youths in the room i noticed were wearing dark sweaters jeans and trainers so they looked as though they were in a kind of uniformed group i was about to seek the company of a small cigar and had the packet open when seb came back with two plastic cups and told me that the lads had voted the place a smokefree zone i said goodbye to the small cigar whatre you running here a monastery delightful wit seb seemed to be out to flatter me thats what old tom mottram told me about you no i dont make the rules the boys do selfdiscipline thats the name of the game i thought it was cricket this was clearly not up to the standard of rumpole repartee and seb ignored it no alcohol he told me no smoking and of course if we catch one of their number dropping an e a what ecstasy anyone indulging in any sort of a drug gets a hard time from the other fellows a very hard time indeed so you rely on these young men to police each other i looked round at the uniformed squad too right we do well its the only way no good imposing rules on them from above they wouldnt take a blind bit of notice hows the coffee is it coffee i had been genuinely puzzling over the brew i beg its pardon i thought it was the soup im afraid were not quite up to your gastronomic standards mr rumpole weve got more important things to think about joby jonson for instance i brought him to the subject which was in so many minds well yes to be quite honest with you im worried about joby what we find here is that the first step to reform is to admit your guilt if only to your mates plead guilty i was doubtful thats often as dangerous as froojucella well at least admit it to yourself look over there in what we call our quiet corner the circle round fred had grown even more attentive and he was addressing them with frowning sincerity what is it a prayer meeting i asked something like that seb was still smiling the young lads there are coming out with all their crimes and villainies they talk them through and then fred bry tells them where that sort of conduct leads to your driver tells them fred should know hed just come out of six years for robbery when i found a job for him so i looked again at the group one of the youths was talking pouring his heart out and fred was listening patiently his head on one side nodding encouragement from time to time you think confessions good for the soul i asked seb dont you perhaps but its not particularly good for keeping you out of the nick oh come on mr rumpole you cant believe jobys innocent is he going to try and put up some sort of defence i mean apart from that alibi which alibi exactly seb it seemed followed the case histories of all his delinquents three strange girls from manchester at the railway station dancing and singing songs outside the lavatory you know thats his story of course the lads all talk about each others cases but its not highly probable is it one thing i have learned after almost half a century down the old bailey is that the improbable is perfectly likely to happen perhaps your view of life is coloured by rather too much chateau whatever it is better than seeing it through a glass of froojucella or soup otherwise known as coffee im sure you want to help joby now seb had become more serious so i gave him a serious answer its my job to help him not to decide his case i might even manage to get him off but sebs ideas of helping clients were a little different from mine if you could get him to admit what hes done even to himself if you could get him to face up to it and not tell silly lies that would really help him on his way back to reality and to about six years in the nick i had to point out the downside of the confessional he came here often over the last two years he had sessions in the quiet corner with fred and the other lands im not about to write him off as one of my failures im sure we both want to do our best for him tell me how i can help i suppose i could call you as a character witness i told him that might be more impressive than a shrink or the local vicar i call sir sebastian pilgrim who carried his bat for england count on me mr rumpole he seemed delighted to offer his services you can count on me thank you very much now if youll forgive me ive got an urgent appointment with a bottle of claret so fred bry was asked to break off his healing session and the rolls was pointed in the direction of froxbury mansions and a muchneeded bottle of chateau thames embankment that joby jonsons been a terrible disappointment to all of us the driver said as we were passing the albert memorial i knew he was going wrong when i heard he was hanging round the station he wasnt trainspotting hardly mr rumpole its where they pick up the drugs what kids brings down from the north it leads them to do terrible inhuman things we did our best with joby seb and i we both tried hard its over to you now mr rumpole get the lad to face up to what hes done its the only way it was as you will have gathered a time when confessions were much in fashion i suppose the learned friends in chambers would have liked dot clapton to confess that the jewel in her nose was a terrible error of judgement and throw herself on the mercy of equity court promising to keep her nose out of trouble in the future however no one was quite sure of how to bring about this desirable result so the matter was brought up for discussion at a chambers meeting presided over by that pillar of respectability soapy sam ballard qc also present were my good self claude erskinebrown liz probert and dave inchape who was once her partner but whom she now called her significant other although i dont know if the title meant any further degree of intimacy there were other assorted barristers and barristerettes and phillida erskinebrown qc the wife who had achieved that place on the front bench which her husband so longed for had also made a point of attending claude had told her about ballards unhelpful attitude to his application for silk and the fact that he had called our head of chambers a pompous prick a verdict to which our portia assented and had nothing to add had i known this at the time i shouldnt have been so surprised by the curious manner in which she treated sam ballard at our chambers meeting certain basic standards of civilization have to be maintained at equity court ballard was completing his peroration i mean we couldnt have people turning up here in warpaint no we couldnt sam youre utterly right as always phillida was gazing at him with something not far off admiration ive said her attitude to our soapy leader was distinctly curious he thanked her and looked suitably gratified until i said i dont know why they shouldnt turn up in warpaint really rumpole im in favour of anything likely to add a touch of drama to the surroundings i told the meeting now if only youd show up in the clerks room in warpaint ballard maybe waving an assegai on your way to a particularly bloodthirsty summons under the rent acts rumpole said ballard we are at something of a crisis in the history of equity court if this sort of thing goes unchecked we may be down a slippery slope towards what exactly they tell me there are men in miles crudgingtons set who go into chambers wearing suede shoes hoskins the greyish father of four daughters put in gloomily there you are ballard was triumphant you see what this sort of thing leads to i agree with you ballard per cent dot was making an unacceptable statement of female submission mizz liz probert seemed to have changed her tune since she congratulated our typist on her nostril but when i saw her looking warningly at her significant other i thought i could guess why she had done so it was nothing more than a harem signal to any wouldbe sheikh foolish enough to take her up on her offer liz passed judgement dots nostril is not to put too fine a point on it politically incorrect so then were all agreed the ornament is totally unacceptable ballard was delighted do you have a view on this matter erskinebrown oh i dont suppose ive got enough gravitas to express an opinion claude spoke with some bitterness enough what i was puzzled gravitas ballard doesnt think ive got enough of it really i thought you had it for breakfast every morning with a little skimmed milk and sugar substitute having said this i pulled out my watch and hinted that i had better things to do than spend the day discussing our typists jewellery before i went the flattering phillida suggested we leave all further action in the capable and tactful hands of our head of chambers im sure she added giving ballard her smile at full beam he can be trusted to have an appropriate word in the right quarter at this point soapy sam seemed quite overcome and thanked our portia for her wonderful loyalty and support as i should have known he was already hooked and all she had to do was wind him in there was one curious thing about that meeting dave the significant other inchcape had said nothing about the controversial diamond when i asked him about it afterwards he told me that quite frankly he hadnt noticed the thing and had no views about it one way or the other when i was in the clerks room a day or so later and found myself alone with dot i thought this muchdebated subject was about to be reopened when she said that she wanted to ask my advice please dont i told her i have absolutely no objection to it as a matter of fact i think it adds a touch of colour to chambers what adds a touch of colour oh nothing i had no wish to pursue the matter and dot had other worries its about my dad he lives not far from here actually does he really i thought you and henry hailed from bexleyheath thats where my mum lives her and dad split up when i was about seven im sorry to hear that dont worry it wasnt a great tragedy my dads an awkward sort of customer call him bloodyminded and youd be paying him a compliment the thing is they wants to do some new building down his street but he wont sell his house he says hes too old to move now anyway and tells them to sod off if youll pardon my french what he wants to know is is there any way they can get him out legally i mean i had to confess that property law wasnt exactly my forte but id make inquiries and let her know then i asked her exactly where mr clapton lived macglinky terrace she said off eversholt street behind euston station do you know the area i did and i had a feeling that what dot had just told me added something to my knowledge when i got home i found hilda reading the daily telegraph by the gasfire and she was delighted to tell me that there was a long profile in it of my friend really which friend is that well not one of the criminal classes certainly not one of your beloved catburglars who enter by way of the fireescape to rob us someone you ought to be proud of you might invite him round to dinner so i could meet him invite who round to dinner hilda sir sebastian pilgrim onetime allrounder for england he spends his time trying to reform young criminals you dont spend much time trying to reform them do you rumpole that wouldnt be your sort of thing at all neither is cricket i assured her exactly and it seems that seb everyone calls him seb is a brilliant businessman as well chairman of something called maiden over holdings i dont know why youre not chairman of anything rumpole maiden over whats that exactly some sort of property company he started it with tom mottram mp of course now mottrams a member of the government hes had to resign from all his directorships go on hilda i encouraged her im finding your daily telegraph unusually fascinating this evening it says here that seb believes in britain is that unusual i mean do some people think britains just a figment of our fevered imaginations i have every faith in the financial future of this country seb told a shareholders meeting recently hilda read out from the profile which is why were building a multistorey hotel and shoppingmall in the area of but the rest of this rousing speech was obliterated by the hysterical wail of the siren fixed to our front door as it called us to action stations when the device had been quietened she admitted d s appleby who had at last found time to come and dust our sitting room with fingerprint powder it wasnt until after he had done the job been given a cup of tea and sent on his way that i was able to pick up the newspaper and discover where sir sebastians faith in our country was going to find expression it was just behind euston station some time after the chambers meeting when she had so shamelessly softsoaped sam ballard phillida persuaded him to invite her to lunch not to the place of his choice which was a vegetarian nut n crunch bar in fetter lane but to a highly priced blowout at the savoy grill these facts may be taken as proved to the satisfaction of the jury there is also no doubt as to the outcome of their shared smoked salmon and cutlets it can also be assumed that mrs erskinebrown used the trump card of her undoubted physical attractions in a way which mizz liz probert had denounced in the case of dot clapton how exactly she played her hand must remain a matter of speculation and although i have had to invent their dialogue i have no doubt that the game was played along the following lines you know phillida probably led off as soon as their order had been placed ive been longing to have someone to talk to about claude to be perfectly honest with you hes not all that easy to live with these days of course i know nothing of that ballard assured her i mean ive never actually lived with your husband no you havent have you well its been pretty toughgoing recently quite honestly he seems to resent me being a woman do you think thats reasonable sam well no hardly ballard admitted hardly i cant help being a woman can i ive got no choice in the matter you dont blame me for being a woman do you sam this was accompanied by a slight inclination towards her lunch companion and a melting look oh not at all phillida not in the least i find your being a woman perfectly acceptable somehow i thought you might say that claude seems to think that being a woman gives me an unfair advantage you dont think that do you well i noticed that the waiter did smile at you when he was showing us to the table oh sam i can tell youve had lots of practice chatting up women over lunch the real trouble is that claude believes that if he were a woman he might do better with the lord chancellor what do you think of that i think thats very silly ballard had no doubt about it so do i erskinebrown couldnt possibly be a woman could he i think hed find it extremely difficult phillida agreed so he might as well give up the idea and settle down to being himself i think thats what hes afraid of and then she came to the real object of the exercise he said you had a little chat about his application for silk with dear old keith from the lord chancellors office champagne which she had as sumed sam ballard would have ordered if hed managed to think about it was no doubt being poured as they faced up to an embarrassing moment erskinebrown didnt seem too pleased about that he used an expression which i certainly couldnt repeat in a public place you mean he called you a pompous prick phillida pas devant ie waiter is this champagne of course it is did i order it you know you did sam i think you wanted to celebrate the fact that were going out together at long last jlt causes rather a curious sensation in the nose youve got to forgive claude he had a deprived childhood thats the sort of language chaps pick up at winchester and then she gave her victim the honest and wideeyed look which has had such a devastating effect on juries and asked him directly dont you think claude ought to get silk in his own interests i thought not youre fibbing sam she smiled beguilingly you were thinking entirely of me was i poor old ballard was puzzled admit it you thought id get fewer leading briefs with claude competing well i want to be entirely honest with you sam now that weve become real friends do you of course i do i want you to be the first to know i shant be looking for leading briefs in the future you wont im leaving the bar this bombshell produced a distressed yelp ofphillida from ballard ive made up my mind dont look so sad sam well still be able to meet for lunch im not leaving the country or anything and you know it might make it easier for us if claude were really busy and away in lets say for instance hong kong doing leading briefs for long periods of time we could have lunch together often youd like that wouldnt you well as a matter of fact phillida i believe i would this for ballard was a positive statement then just lift the telephone to dear old keith in the lord chancellors office tell him that there could be no possible objection to claude being entirely wrapped in silk even though he is a man through absolutely no fault of his own and that would help you and erskinebrown it would help you and me sam considerably heres to both of us this or something very like it was the lunchtime duet which led to agreement and the final clink of glasses it has to be said however that phillida had not yet told the whole truth to soapy sam ballard i had a harder struggle ahead than the war of dot claptons nose or the erskinebrown struggle for silk joby jonsons future was in my hands and from what mr bernard told me the queen was bringing all her big guns to bear at this juvenile target a red judge had been put in charge of the case and no less a tactician than phillida erskinebrown qc who could wrap our head of chambers round her little finger was in charge of the prosecution mugging was the flavour of that particular month and joby jonson attacker of grandmothers and robber of oldage pensioners came to stand for all that was most repulsive in british youth black as the prospects seemed i didnt despair i gave mr bernard his battle orders he was to get in touch with a mr clapton of macglinky terrace hard by euston station and discover if that address might be anywhere near pondicherry avenue home of the assaulted grannie i also required as much information as possible on the business of maiden over holdings pic and about any estate agents they might employ and when were on the subject of dawkins whos he a possible witness the faithful bernard wrote the name down carefully not really i mean john dawkins otherwise known as the artful dodger we should remember that he was only part of a wider organization run from fagins kitchen i dont know if youve had any experience of mr justice graves as a matter of fact ive never been before him then portia you must have led a charmed life we were standing side by side mrs erskinebrown and i as the old gravestone swept on to the bench like an icy draft as we bowed to each other i gave my opponent a whispered character sketch this judge i told her is an absolute fourletter man hes humourless tedious unimaginative and unjust in a word hes a judicial pain in the behind having bowed graves was still standing and made a pronouncement in my direction mr rumpole it may come as a surprise to you to know that the acoustics in this court are absolutely perfect and my hearing is exceptionally keen i can hear every word that is spoken on counsels benches at this i could do no more than bow low and mutter to phillida i rather hope audibly see what i mean we hadnt got off i must admit to a particularly good in his own interests i thought not youre fibbing sam she smiled beguilingly you were thinking entirely of me was i poor old ballard was puzzled admit it you thought id get fewer leading briefs with claude competing well i want to be entirely honest with you sam now that weve become real friends do you of course i do i want you to be the first to know i shant be looking for leading briefs in the future you wont im leaving the bar this bombshell produced a distressed yelp ofphillida from ballard ive made up my mind dont look so sad sam well still be able to meet for lunch im not leaving the country or anything and you know it might make it easier for us if claude were really busy and away in lets say for instance hong kong doing leading briefs for long periods of time we could have lunch together often youd like that wouldnt you well as a matter of fact phillida i believe i would this for ballard was a positive statement then just lift the telephone to dear old keith in the lord chancellors office tell him that there could be no possible objection to claude being entirely wrapped in silk even though he is a man through absolutely no fault of his own and that would help you and erskinebrown it would help you and me sam considerably heres to both of us this or something very like it was the lunchtime duet which led to agreement and the final clink of glasses it has to be said however that phillida had not yet told the whole truth to soapy sam ballard i had a harder struggle ahead than the war of dot claptons nose or the erskinebrown struggle for silk joby jonsons future was in my hands and from what mr bernard told me the queen was bringing all her big guns to bear at this juvenile target a red judge had been put in charge of the case and no less a tactician than phillida erskinebrown qc who could rumpole and the reform ofjoby jonson wrap our head of chambers round her little finger was in charge of the prosecution mugging was the flavour of that particular month and joby jonson attacker of grandmothers and robber of oldage pensioners came to stand for all that was most repulsive in british youth black as the prospects seemed i didnt despair i gave mr bernard his battle orders he was to get in touch with a mr clapton of macglinky terrace hard by euston station and discover if that address might be anywhere near pondicherry avenue home of the assaulted grannie i also required as much information as possible on the business of maiden over holdings pic and about any estate agents they might employ and when were on the subject of dawkins whos he a possible witness the faithful bernard wrote the name down carefully not really i mean john dawkins otherwise known as the artful dodger we should remember that he was only part of a wider organization run from fagins kitchen i dont know if youve had any experience of mr justice graves as a matter of fact ive never been before him then portia you must have led a charmed life we were standing side by side mrs erskinebrown and i as the old gravestone swept on to the bench like an icy draft as we bowed to each other i gave my opponent a whispered character sketch this judge i told her is an absolute fourletter man hes humourless tedious unimaginative and unjust in a word hes a judicial pain in the behind having bowed graves was still standing and made a pronouncement in my direction mr rumpole it may come as a surprise to you to know that the acoustics in this court are absolutely perfect and my hearing is exceptionally keen i can hear every word that is spoken on counsels benches at this i could do no more than bow low and mutter to phillida i rather hope audibly see what i mean we hadnt got off i must admit to a particularly good start however we then went through the opening formalities without any further disaster twelve honest citizens were sworn to try joby jonson according to the evidence and phillida erskinebrown was opening the prosecution case members of the jury she spoke to them in her most beguiling tones we say that jonson paid two visits to number i pondicherry avenue that day he came in the morning to scout out the territory and asked mrs parsons if she were still living there when he found out she was he returned that afternoon having made some attempts at covering his face he viciously attacked this lady old enough to be his grandmother and robbed her of what were no doubt her small lifetimes savings five pounds pence i murmured from my seat did you say something mr rumpole there was an icy interjection from the judge i was just reminding my learned friend that the sum involved in this case was exactly i rose to say politely but graves could quote scripture to discomfort the defence mr rumpole he told me with great satisfaction the widows mite was on a famous occasion considered of great importance to the widow i dont know if your lordship could remind the jury of the present value of a mite taking account of inflation i asked innocently it might come to rather more than mr rumpole i have no doubt we shall be hearing from you later now i think we might let mrs erskinebrown open her case without any more frivolous interruptions yes mrs erskinebrown for a moment his lordship was unable to get phillidas attention she was staring in fascinated horror at the door of the court through which ballard no doubt encouraged by events at the savoy grill had entered he raised a hand in a minisalute and twisted his lips in a way which i can only describe as a leer after a few seconds of this lamentable behaviour he withdrew no doubt in search of other criminal business and phillida was able to return to work it remains to be seen members of the jury she went on only a little shaken what sort of defence if any will be put forward for jonson we have been given notice of an alibi which may be typical of the unfortunate levity with which this very serious case is being taken both by the accused youth and his learned counsel mr rumpole it is alleged that while this appalling attack was taking place jonson was dancing with some girls from manchester outside the superloo at euston station did you say dancing mrs erskinebrown the judge couldnt believe his ears my lord im afraid so phillida was being deeply serious and perhaps you can help me what is a superloo exactly it is i believe my lord a kind of superior lavatory a kind of superior lavatory the judge made an extremely careful note opening speeches from the prosecution dont usually demand my full attention unless a particularly lengthy evening at pommeroys has kept me from reading my brief and i have to discover from them what the case is all about i knew the basic facts of the queens quarrel with joby jonson and as phillida held the floor i was checking once again in the london az and making sure that macglinky terrace did in fact lead off eversholt street and into pondicherry avenue the proceedings demanded my full attention only when the victim of the attack mrs louisa parsons a brighteyed pinkcheeked and game old lady who would no doubt be a considerable hit with the jury entered the witnessbox at the end of her evidence in chief she was asked about the identification parade on which occasion she told us the police had been very kind to her and saw she got a cup of tea and some very nice biscuits did you then identify the youth who visited you twice on the th and attacked you on the second occasion phillida asked at this the old lady showing an unexpected sense of drama pointed to the dock and said there he stands no prosecutor could have asked for more and i rose to crossexamine knowing that any attempt to rattle mrs louisa parsons would sink me with the jury for ever i started as though addressing my own grandmother mrs parsons this pounds pencein the post office didnt represent your entire worldly wealth did it she never told us it did mr rumpole graves rushed in before he was needed i ignored the interruption do you own your little house in pondicherry avenue my husband saved for it worked all his life as bookingclerk at the station he had the mortgage paid up by the time he died have you not been offered a considerable sum of money for that little house i wasnt going to move no matter how often they asked me it wasnt the money you see that was the home mr parsons meant me to have for my life i wasnt moving she looked at the jury then and they nodded back their admiration although they asked you very often im sick and tired of them always ringing me up she agreed and sending letters marked personal to mrs parsons we are most interested in the purchase of your property well i said im not interested in selling not to you not to anybody bonny bernard had called on dots father and made copies of a number of letters hed received i picked up this small bundle and asked mrs parsons did the requests to sell come from a firm of estate agents called jebber amp jonas they may have done i never kept the letters what did you do with them dustbinned them they went out with the other rubbish at this point i received a blast of cold air from the bench mr rumpole what on earth has this fascinating information got to do with the charges against your client of robbery with violence that is something you may discover my lord if i am allowed to pursue my crossexamination without interruption having dealt with that i gave my full attention to the witness you say that young joby jonson called in the morning and said you still living here mrs parsons yes he did did you think that question might have had some connection with the repeated requests to you to sell the house having thought it over mrs parsons said not at the time no mr rumpole are you seriously suggesting that your client accused of the robbery of pounds pence was working for a firm of reputable estate agents there is nothing so unquiet as the graves i told him i will demonstrate that they are both working for the same organization and then i asked louisa parsons do you think now that there might have been some connection my lord this witness cant be invited to speculate phillida rose in glorious indignation we should leave such nights of fancy to my learned friend his lordship of course agreed with this entirely and asked me to move on to the next matter whereupon i muttered congratulations to my opponent on having got the old deaths head eating out of her hand mr rumpole i didnt hear that graves warned me in adetached sort of way did you not my lord it must be the acoustics after which interruption i took up my conversation with the witness again later that day you say a young man rang at the door and when you opened it he attacked and robbed you i heard the bell i thought hes back again ill give him a piece of my mind you werent frightened of him when you went to the door not then no i was when i saw him though why well he had this what they calls it ballycarver balaclava yes hed pulled it down had he you say in your statement that his face was hidden the second time he called it was hidden a bit yes she had to admit mrs parsons can you be sure it was the same boy i i was rewarded by a silence and then she said i think it was the same you think so he had the same clothes a dark jersey like and jeans training shoes whatever they call them plimsolls thats what we knew them as the uniform of thousands and thousands of young men all over london but you didnt see his face just his eyes that was enough for me his eyes may have been enough for you mrs parsons they may not be enough for a jury to convict this young man on a serious charge of robbery with violence at which point i gave the twelve honest citizens a long and searching look and sat down not altogether displeased with my performance i have often said that life at the bar would be a great deal more pleasant if we could do without clients clients get in the way they fuss they tell you things youd rather not know and then they prance into the witnessbox and destroy the defence you have carefully built up by a moment of unnecessary candour some clients are of course more bearable than others and as a general rule i have found that the more serious the crime the politer the client murderers are always grateful those who contest parking fines never an exception to this rule was young joby jonson the crime he was accused of was as appalling as his manners all the same i forced myself to pay him a visit in the cells under the old bailey after the first days work was done the time has come for you to tell the truth joby confession is good for the soul now i want you to admit that someone told you to go round to the old ladys house and ask her if she was still living there then scarper that was in the morning what were you doing in the afternoon i told yo joby was in his usual laconic mood didn i yes and for once i believe you you were dropping an ecstasy pill youd bought off some girls down from manchester an activity which led to an unseemly bout of folkdancing outside the superloo in euston station and probably a horrible reaction of shivering and thirst plus a certain loss of memory how comes yo know so much about doing an e mr rumpole he made it sound like an accusation how come i know so much about everything i know you went to the house in the morning because your palm print was on the door and mrs parsons saw you that was why she picked you out at the id parade i know you didnt go in the afternoon because the group you work for were so desperate to discover our defence theyre dead scared youll say another of their lads came after you and did the serious business well youll have to tell the truth joby before this case is over i sat down opposite him then and saw him stare at his feet he didnt lift his eyes to ask whats this group yos on about then dont play games with me sunshine i spoke to joby in the language he understood that of the copper and criminal you know damn well who im talking about you can start telling us the truth tomorrow then we left our client with a certain amount of relief and mr bernard went off to arrange the attendance of a witness on whom i placed our few remaining hopes the next morning i asked the judge if i might call a character witness a particularly busy man to give his evidence before my client jonson went into the witnessbox the old gravestone gave his usual icy disapproval to this suggestion until he heard that jobys character was to be vouched for by none other than sir sebastian pilgrim bat carrier philanthropist and believer in britain of course he purred sir sebastians time is of the greatest value both to himself and to his country no doubt its only his sense of public duty which brings him to this rather sordid case well certainly meet his convenience provided you have no objection mrs erskinebrown phillida bowed in graceful agreement and seb entered the witnessbox a handsome and imposing figure perfectly at ease and prepared even in his advancing years to hit the bowling to the boundary to tumultuous applause from the jury when he admitted he was sir sebastian pilgrim graves gave him one of his spectral smiles and went off down memory lane you need no introduction im sure to those of us who remember that century against pakistan in your final test seb looked charmingly modest and i got on with the business in hand and do you run an organization called the youth enterprise reform trust allegedly to help boys who have fallen into criminal ways once again sir sebastian your wonderful work with yert is well known to many of us graves continued to butter up the witness who wasnt entirely delighted with the form of my question i do run that organization to help deliquent boys he said i dont know why mr rumpole used the word allegedly no doubt a slip of the tongue wasnt it mr rumpole the judge suggested not exactly my lord perhaps if i go on a little my meaning may become clear and i asked seb are you also chairman of maiden over holdings which is planning a development near euston station that includes building a large hotel and a tourist shoppingcentre i am we are most grateful to businessmen such as yourself sir sebastian who have so much faith in britains future graves chimed in and i wondered if we were going to have these varied versions of oh well played sir after every ball and arent you having trouble with certain householders who refuse to sell their homes to make way for this magnificent and palatial development no i dont think so not particularly now i thought seb was playing for safety are you not do you not employ among others estate agents called jebber amp jonas there was a pause as the witness seemed to be searching his memory then he said as casually as possible the name seems familiar please answer the question do you employ them or not from time to time sebs smile to the jury seemed to be saying it couldnt matter less but i asked the usher to hand him one of the estate agents letters obtained by courtesy of by jonson dot is this a letter from that firm to a mr peter clapton of macglinky terrace asking him to sell his house to make room for a new hotel development that would seem to be so seb had just glanced it it is it your hotel development well i cant think of anyone else with similar plans perhaps no one else is so anxious to invest in the future of this great city mr rumpole i ignored gravess support for the great cricketer and went on and isnt mrs parsons of pondicherry avenue also a householder who wodt sell to your company you mean mrs louisa parsons the victim in this case the judge was no longer smiling oh yes my lord whats the answer sir sebastian she might be the athletes shoulders in the business suiting gave us a small shrug had i been portia i vould have interrupted long before this for i was breaking all the rules by treating my own character witness with increasing hostility when she did rise to the obvious satisfaction of the learned judge i knew it was useless to argue and accepted her criticism with a good grace of course i surprised her my learned friend is perfectly right this is a characte witness and i will come at once to my clients character sir sebastian do you take the view that young delinquents should admit what theyve done and tell the truth about it yes i believe thats the start of reform seb looked safely back on his home ground admirable sentiments in my view the judge of course agreed i thought your lordship would feel that sir sebastian do you really want joby jonson to tell the truth about this case yes indeed he came to your club having been in trouble over a few minor matters no violence in his record i think that it was only some quite trivial thieving and you hoped to reform him i always hope and i thought there was some good in the lad he turned up regularly at the club i felt i might make quite a useful spin bowler out of him not as useful as you sir sebastian if we remember the australian wickets in they went down like ninepins members of the jury i looked at the honest twelve and thought they were becoming just a little bored with his lordships cricket reminiscences so i hammered away at the case and at seb did you also hope to turn him into quite a useful young thug to terrorize mrs parsons into selling her house to your company thats the sort of job you give your enterprising young lads isnt it my lord thats the most outrageous suggestion mr rumpole is crossexamining his own witness phillida was up on her hind legs again and surprise surprise his lordship was on her side mrs erskinebrown i am in complete agreement that is a question that should never have been asked as you must know perfectly well mr rumpole my lord may i say something seb looked like an honest outsider anxious to put an end to the lawyers bickering i think it only fair that i should be allowed to answer mr rumpoles accusation there is no truth in it at all no truth in it at all graves dictated the words to himself and wrote them down carefully spoken if i may say so like a great sportsman mr rumpole you will confine yourself to questions about your clients character delighted my lord always anxious to oblige sir sebastian despite his talents as a bowler did you come to the conclusion that young joby jonson was not an entirely trustworthy criminal good enough to send with a final warning before lunch perhaps but the afternoon terrorist attack had to be done by another of your proteges shrouded in a balaclava helmet mr rumpole i had now lit the blue touch paper and mr justice graves went off like a rocket this is quite intolerable i stopped you when you pursued this line before and you have totally disregarded my ruling you persist in attempting to involve this most distinguished gentleman in the terrible crime of which your client stands accused that is not the way in which we play the game in these courts as you should know perfectly well im extremely sorry my lord i managed my most charming smile ive never entirely understood the rules of cricket loitering outside the court after a midday guinness and slice of pie i saw ballard accost prosecuting counsel and tell her with a look of triumph in his eye that he had done it oh congratulations phillida sounded unimpressed done what exactly seen old keith from the lord chancellors office i said that id been quite wrong about claude and that recently hes been showing a good deal ofgravitas how about bottom yes quite a lot of that too im glad you put that right so what about lunch honestly it really is very nice in the healthfood bar and i wouldnt have to send a taxi back to chambers like last time for an extra sub out of the petty cash sorry ballard i think im going to be rather too busy for lunches out in the foreseeable future soapy sam looked disappointed but our portia had won her case i wasnt so sure that i was going to win mine my crossexamination of the great sportsman had been the high point then i had to call joby and although he told the truth as i had put it to sir sebastian he wasnt the sort of witness the jury could ever fall in love with and phillida used her considerable skill to bring out his many unattractive qualities as always i felt a considerable relief when my client had left the dangerous prominence of the witnessbox and been returned to the silence of the dock now it was up to me and ive never had any doubt since i won the penge bungalow murders by my two hours of brilliant deduction and emotional appeal of my talent for a final speech in a notable passage i summarized the position members of the jury i leant forward and spoke to them as though we were alone together and mr justice graves had melted away like an icicle n a hot afternoon perhaps now young joby jonson has taken the first step on the road to reform by telling you the truth until he went into that witnessbox he was protecting his boss his gang leader that wellknown cricketer whose performance in the test matches so delighted his lordship but the muchloved seb pilgrim had no intention of protecting him he used joby for a minor but disagreeable role in a plan to terrorize an innocent old lady into selling her house and then he was content to see him locked up for years in a penal dustbin for the crime he planned if thats cricket members of the jury you might think wed all be a great deal better off playing tiddlywinks when the speech was over i sat down and felt a great weight lift from my shoulders i had done my job as well as i could and now it was up to the honest twelve to make a decision his lordship during his summing up inserted a pointed and carefully polished boot into the defence at every possible opportunity and made it clear what he would like that decision to be after a couple of hours in their room the jury lost their collective bottle and agreed with him in passing sentence graves referred with disgust to an unwarranted attack on a great british sportsman and a public figure sir sebastian he said has devoted his life to the reform of youths such as you jonson unhappily you have proved quite unreformable you will go to prison for five years during which time i thought if there were anything joby did not know now about the life of crime he would certainly have learned it so he was taken down to the cells to continue his education you cant i suppose win them all but in jobys case it seemed to me we had been bowled out by the umpire it was in a somewhat doleful mood that i went back to chambers and finding dot once again alone in the clerks room i thanked her for the help she and her father had given us and said he should keep a careful lookout for young men in balaclava helmets i also thought the time had come to tell her as both ballard and henry had not yet dared to do that wed had a chambers meeting to discuss the exotic ornament in her nose you never the idea of the solemn conclave entertained us both nothing much was decided i said except young david inchcape told me yes mr rumpole dot clapton sounded unusually breathless what did he tell you only that quite honestly he hadnt noticed whether you had a diamond in your nose or not i left to the sound of dot attacking her typewriter with unusual ferocity the next day and on all the days after her nose was unadorned in the end most questions are resolved in the clerks room we were assembled there on the hunt for briefs one morning when claude erskinebrown came bounding in having at last had the courage to buy the times which he had opened on an inner page where the list of those privileged to be crowned in silk was printed hallo there hallo you chaps hallo liz good morning dot hi there henry he chortled in his joy youve all seen the times of course great news isnt it and totally unexpected seen it have you rumpole i shall be leading you my dear old fellow i shall be sitting in front of you doing your next murder for you dont bother i begged him youll probably be too occupied with royal divorces do you honestly think so well youve seen the list havent you ballard it seems thatgravitas is no longer called for congratulations ballard had the grace to say its wonderful news about your wife philly claude looked unaccountably surprised what about philly havent you looked at the front page of that newspaper erskinebrown ballard was astonished and the photograph hit seemed the poor nervewracked fellow had crept out of the house early bought the paper at the temple tube station and turned with trembling fingers immediately to the silk list our portia plays her cards pretty close to her chest and she had not told the rest of us and certainly not her husband that she was about to be wrapped not in mere silk but in scarlet and ermine mrs justice erskinebrown was now about to take her place on the high court bench and as her photograph made clear she was going to be a good deal easier on the eye than mr justice graves bless thee portia thou art translated i said as i looked at it she never even told her clerk henry complained and somewhere inside ballard the penny finally dropped so thats what she meant he told us when she said she was leaving the bar when erskinebrown first stood up in court decked out in the full glory of his newfound silk he found himself bowing low and saying if your ladyship pleases and with very great respect to his promoted wife and i had to pay a similar tribute to hilda when d s appleby telephoned to tell me the result of the longdelayed quest for fingerprints she who must be obeyed had ordered they found one i reported to her as we sat on either side of the gasfire in our onceviolated sittingroom on the window frame over there it was the thumb print of an old con who was sent down for robbery with violence for a good many years he now acts as father confessor and driver to that great british cricketer and reformer of the young sir sebastian pilgrim fred bry it was who entered our premises by night you know what that means hilda it means that the case of joby jonson is not entirely over then im very glad i got the burglar alarm fitted thats all i can say its not all i can say old thing id like to say thank you for insisting on the fingerprint evidence it shows how important it is to have a woman on the case i have often wondered how my career as an old bailey hack would terminate would i drop dead at the triumphant end of my most moving final speech ladies and gentlemen of the jury my task is done i have said my say this trial has been but a few days out of your life but for me it is the whole of my life and that life i leave with the utmost confidence in your hands and then keel over and out rumpole snuffs it in court the news would run like wild fire round the inns of court and i would challenge any jury to dare to convict after that forensic trick had been played upon them or will i die in an apoplexy after a particularly heated disagreement with mr injustice graves or sir oliver oliphant one thing imsure of i shall not drift into retirement and spend my days hanging around froxbury mansions in a dressinggown nor shall i ever repair to the golden gate retirement home westonsupermare and sit in the sun lounge retelling the extraordinary case of the judges elbow or the miracle in the ecclesiastical court which saved a vicar from an unfrocking no my conclusion had better come swiftly and rumpoles career should end with a bang rather than a whimper when thinking of the alternatives available i never expected i would finish by being kicked out of the bar dismissed for unprofessional conduct and drummed out of the monstrous regiment of learned friends and yet this conclusion became a distinct possibility on that dreadful day when apparently even i went too far and brought that weighty edifice the legal establishment crashing down upon my head the day dawned grey and wet after i had been kept awake lost of the night by a raging toothache i rang my dentist mr lionel leering a practitioner whose company i manage to shun until the pain becomes unbearable and he agreed to meet me at his harley street rooms at nine oclock so giving me time to get to the old bailey where i was engaged in a particularly tricky case so picture me at the start of what was undoubtedly the worst in a long career of difficult days stretched out on the chair of pain and terror beside the bubbling spittoon mr leering the smooth greyhaired master of the drill who seemed perpetually tanned from a trip to his holiday home in ibiza was fiddling about inside my mouth while subliminal baroque music tinkled on the cassette player and the blonde nurse looked on with wellsimulated concern busy day ahead of you mr rumpole mr leering was keeping up the bright chatter open just a little wider for me will you what sort of terrible crime are you on today then ans lorter i did my best to tell him my daughter leering purred with satisfaction how kind of you to remember well jessicas just done her alevels and shes off to florence doing the history of art you should hear her on the quattrocento knows a great deal more than i ever did and of course being blonde the italians are mad about her i said ans lorter down the ole alley i tried to explain before he started the drill my old lady oh you mean yolande im not sure shed be too keen on being called that shes better now gone in for acupuncture what were you saying an cord long your tongue not hurting you am i an supposed illed is ife something she did to her back leering explained patiently playing golf golf covers a multitude of sins particularly for the women of hampstead garden suburb ellontheender the drill had stopped now and he pulled the cotton wool rolls away from my gums my effort to tell him about my life and work had obviously gone for nothing because he asked politely send her what your love yolandell be tickled to death of course shes never met you but shell still be tickled to death rinse now will you now what were we talking about manslaughter i told him once again as i spat out pink and chemicated fluid oh no not really yolande can be extremely irritating at times what woman cant but im not actually tempted to bash her across the head no i was showing remarkable patience with this slowwitted dentist i said im doing a case at the old bailey my clients a man called long accused of manslaughter killed his wife mrs long she fell down and her head hit the fender oh really how fascinating now he knew what i was talking about mr leering had lost all interest in my case ive just done a temporary stopping that should see you through the day but ring me up if youre in any trouble i think its going to take a great deal more than a temporary stopping to see me through today i said as i got out of the chair and struggled into the wellworn black jacket im before mr justice oilie oliphant as i was walking towards the old bailey i felt a familiar stab of pain warning me that the stopping might be extremely temporary as i was going through the revolving doors mizz liz probert came flying in behind me sent the door spinning collided into my back then went dashing up the stairs calling sorry rumpole and vanished sorry rumpole i grumbled to myself mizz probert cannons into you nearly sends your brief flying and all she does is call out sorry rumpole on the trot everyone it seemed to me said sorry rumpole and didnt mean a word of it they were sorry for sending my clients to chokey sorry for not showing me all the prosecution statements sorry for standing on my foot in the underground and now no doubt sorry for stealing my bands for i had reached the robing room and while climbing into the fancy dress searched for the little white hanging tabs that ornament a legal hacks neck nd lo and behold these precious bands had been nicked i looked down the robing room in desperation and saw young dave inchcape mizz liz proberts lover and comortgagee carefully tie a snowwhite pair of crisp linen bands around his winged collar i approached him in a hostile manner inchcape i lost no time in coming to the point have you pinched my bands sorry rumpole he pretended to know nothing of the matter you have i regarded the case as proved honestly inchcape nowadays the barristers robing room is little better than a den of thieves these are my bands rumpole there are some bands over there on the table slightly soiled theyre probably yours slightly soiled sorry rumpole sorry whoever they belonged to and i put them on the bloody mans presumably got mine anyway when i got down correctly if sordidly decorated about the throat to oilie oliphants court one i found claude erskinebrown all tricked out as an artificial silk and his junior mizz she who cannons into you probert i want to ask you rumpole claude said in his newly acquired qcs voice about calling your client mr long yes are you calling him i call him mr long because thats his name i mean he said with exaggerated patience as though explaining the law to a white wig are you going to put him in the witnessbox you dont have to you know you see ive been asked to do a murder in lewes one does have so many demands on ones time in silk so if youre not going to call mr long i thought well perhaps we might finish today while he was drooling on i was looking closely at the mans neck then i came out with the accusation direct are those my bands youre wearing i took hold of the suspect tabs lifted them and examined them closely they look like my bands they are my bands whats that written on them ceb stands for claude erskinebrown this was apparently his defence when did you write that oh really rumpole we dont even share the same robing room now im in silk how could i have got at your bands just tell me are you calling your client i wasnt satisfied with his explanation but the usher was hurrying us in as the judge was straining at the leash i pushed my way into court telling erskinebrown nothing of my plans i knew what id like to call my client id like to call him a grade a hundredpercent pain in the neck in any team chosen to bore for england he would have been first in to bat he was a retired civil servant and his hair face business suit and spectacles were of a uniform grey when he spoke he did so in a dreary monotone and never used one word when twenty would suffice the only unexpected thing about him was that he ever got involved in the colourful crime of manslaughter i had considered a long time before deciding to call mr long as a witness in his own defence i knew he would bore the jury to distraction and no doubt drive that north country comedian mr justice oliphant into an apoplexy however mrs long had been found dead from a head wound in the sittingroom of their semidetached house in rickmansworth and i felt her husband was called upon to provide some sort of an explanation you will have gathered that things hadnt gone well from the start of that day for rumpole and matters didnt improve when my client long stepped into the witnessbox raised the testament on high and gave us what appeared to be a shortened version of the oath i swear by he said carefully omitting any reference to the deity that the evidence i shall give shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth h mr rumpole your client has left something out of the oath mr justice oliphant may not have been a great lawyer but at least he knew the oath by heart so i noticed my lord well see to it mr rumpole use your common sense mr long i asked the witness who is it you swear by one i wouldnt drag down to the level of this place my lord whats he mean mr rumpole drag down to the level of this court whats he mean by that the judges common sense was giving way to uncommon anger i suppose he means that the almighty might not wish to be seen in court number one at the old bailey i suggested not wish to be seen i never heard of such a thing mr long has some rather original ideas about theology my lord i did my best to deter further conversation on the subject im sure he would go into the matter at considerable length if your lordship were interested im not mr rumpole not interested in the least and here his lordship turned on the witness with are you saying mr whats your name again long my lord henry sebastian long are you saying my court isnt good enough for god is that what youre saying i am saying that this court my lord is a place of sin and worldliness and we should not involve a certain being in these proceedings may i remind you of the book of ezekiel and it shall be unto them a false divination to them that have sworn oaths dont lets worry about the book of ezekiel this work clearly wasnt oilie oliphants bedtime reading mr rumpole cant you control your client unfortunately not my lord when i was a young lad the first thing we learned at the bar was to control our clients the judge was back on more familiar territory its a great pity you werent brought up in a good old commonsensical chambers in leeds mr rumpole i suppose i might have acquired some of your lordships charm and polish i said respectfully lets use our common sense about this shall we mr long do you understand what it is to tell the truth i have always told the truth during my thirty years in the ministry ministry the judge turned to me in some alarm is your client a man of the cloth mr rumpole i think hes referring to the ministry of agriculture and fisheries where he was a clerk for many years are you going to tell the truth the judge addressed my client in a commonsense shout yes mr long even managed to make a monosyllable sound boring there you are mr rumpole the judge was triumphant thats the way to do it now lets get on with it shall we i assure your lordship i cant wait ouch the tooth mr leering had said would see me through the day disagreed with a sharp stab of pain i put a hand to my cheek and muttered to my instructing solicitor the faithful mr bernard its the temporary stopping stopping why are you stopping mr rumpole the judge was deeply suspicious now i knew what hell was examining a prize bore before oilie oliphant with a raging toothache all the same i soldiered on and asked long were you married to the late sarah long we had met in the min of ag and fish where sarah pennington as she then was held a post in the typing pool we were adjacent as i well remember on one occasion for the hot meal in the canteen i dont want to hurry you you hurry him mr rumpole lets come to your marriage i begged the witness the th of march at the church of st joseph and all angels in what was then the village of pinner mr long i supplied all the details the weather as i remember it was particularly inclement dark skies and a late snow flurry dont lets worry about the weather oilie was using his common sense and longing to get on with it i took it as a portent my lord of storms to come could you just describe your married life to the jury i tried a short cut i can only with the greatest respect and due deference adopt the words of the psalmist no doubt they are well known to his lordship i shouldnt bet on it mr long i warned him and ignoring ollies apparent displeasure added perhaps you could just remind us what the good book says it is better to dwell on the corner of a housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house mr long recited it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and angry woman so my clients evidence wound on accompanied by toothache and an angry judge and i felt that i had finally fallen out of love with the art of advocacy i didnt want to have to worry about mr long or the precise circumstances in which mrs long had been released from this world i wanted to sit down to shut up and to close my eyes in peace she who must be obeyed had something of the same idea she wanted me to become a judge without taking me into her confidence she met marigold featherstone the judges wife for coffee in harrods for the purpose of furthering her plan rumpole gets so terribly tired at night hilda said in the silver grill and marigold with a heavy sigh agreed so does guthrie at night hes as flat as a pancake is rumpole flat as a pancake too well not exactly hilda told me she wasnt sure of the exact meaning of this phrase but hes so irritable these days so edgy and then hes had this trouble with his teeth if only he could have a job sitting down you mean like a clerk or something something like a judge really marigold was astonished at the idea oh i dont mean a red judge hilda explained not a really posh judge like guthrie but an ordinary sort of circus judge and guthrie does know such important people you said hes always calling in at the lord chancellors office only when hes in trouble marigold said grimly but i suppose i might ask if he could put in a word about your horace oh marigold would you why not ill wake the old fellow up and tell him as it happened my possible escape from the agonies of the bar was not by such an honourable way out as that sought by hilda in the silver grill the route began to appear as mr long staggered slowly towards the high point of his evidence we had enjoyed numerous quotations from the old testament we had been treated to a blowbyblow account of a quarrel between him and his wife during a holiday in clactononsea and many other such incidents we had learned a great deal more about the ministry of agriculture and fisheries than we ever needed to know and then oilie driven beyond endurance said for gods sake my lord mr long looked deeply pained all right for all our sakes when are we going to come to the facts of this manslaughter so i asked the witness now mr long on the night this accident took place accident thats a matter for the jury to decide oilie exploded why do you call it an accident why did your lordship call it manslaughter isnt that a matter for the jury to decide did i say that the judge asked did i say that mr erskinebrown yes you did i told him before claude could stagger to his feet i wondered if your lordship had joined the prosecution team or was it a singlehanded effort to prejudice the jury there was a terrible silence and i suppose i should never have said it mr bernard hid his head in shame erskinebrown looked disapproving and liz appeared deeply worried the judge controlled himself with difficulty and then spoke in quiet but dangerous tones mr rumpole that was a quite intolerable thing to say my lord that was a quite intolerable thing to do i was determined to fight on i may have had a momentary slip of the tongue it seemed that the judge was about to retreat but i had no intention of allowing him to do so gracefully or i said your lordships wellknown common sense may have deserted you there was another sharp intake of breath from the attendant legal hacks and then the judge kindly let me know what was in his mind mr rumpole i think you should be warned one of these days you may go too far and behaviour such as yours can have certain consequences now can we get on certainly i didnt wish to interrupt the flow of your lordships rebuke so i started my uphill task with the witness again mr long on the night in question did you and mrs long quarrel as per usual my lord what was the subject of the quarrel she accused me of being overly familiar with a near neighbour this was a certain mrs grabowitz my lord a lady of polish extraction whose deceased husband had by a curious coincidence been a colleague of mine its a small world isnt it in the min of ag and fish mr long ignore the neighbours deceased husband if youd be so kind what did your wife do she ran at me my lord with her nails poised as though to scratch me across the face as it was often her habit so to do however as illluck would have it the runner in front of the gasfire slipped beneath her feet on the highly polished flooring and she fell as she did so the back of her head made contact with the raised tiling in front of our hearth my lord and she received the injuries which ultimately caused her to pass over mr rumpole is that the explanation of this ladys death you wish to leave to the jury the judge asked with some contempt certainly my lord does your lordship wish to prejudge the issue and are we about to hear a little premature adjudication mr rumpole i have warned you twice i shall not warn you again im looking at the clock so id noticed well break off now back at ten past two members of the jury and then oilie turned to my client and gave him the solemn warning which might help me into retirement i understand youre on bail mr long and youre in the middle of giving your evidence its vitally important that you speak to no one about your case during the lunchtime adjournment and no one must speak to you particularly your legal advisers is that thoroughly understood mr rumpole naturally my lord i assured him i do know the rules i hope you do mr rumpole i sincerely hope you do the events of that lunchhour achieved a historic importance after a modest meal of beanshoot sandwiches in the nuthouse vegetarian restaurant down by the bank he returned to the old bailey and was walking up to the silks robing room when he saw through an archway the defendant long seated and silent approaching nearer he heard the following words shouted by rumpole in a voice of extreme irritation listen to me my speech which claude knew to be legal advice to the client began is this damn thing going to last for ever well for gods sake get on with it youre driving me mad talk thats all you do you boring old fart just get on with it ive got enough trouble with the judge without you causing me all this agony get it out thats all short and snappy put us out of our misery get it out and then shut up as i say claude took a careful note of these words but said nothing to me about them when i emerged from behind the archway when we got back to court i asked my client a few more questions which he answered with astounding brevity mr long did you ever intend to do your wife the slightest gharm no did you strike her no or assault her in any way no just wait there will you i sat down with considerable relief in case mr erskinebrown can think of anything to ask you claude did have something to ask and his first question came as something of a surprise to me youve become very monosyllabic since lunch havent you mr long perhaps its something he ate i murmured to my confidant bernard no erskinebrown wouldnt have this its nothing you ate is it as your learned counsel suggests its something mr rumpole said to you said to him oilie oliphant registered profound shock when are you suggesting mr rumpole spoke to him oh during the luncheon adjournment my lord claude dropped the bombshell casually mr rumpole oilie gasped with horror mr erskinebrown did i not give a solemn warning that no one was to speak to mr long and he was to speak to no one during the adjournment you did my lord claude confirmed it that was why i was so surprised when i heard mr rumpole doing it you heard mr rumpole speaking to the defendant long im afraid so my lord again bernard winced in agony and there were varying reactions of shock and disgust all round i didnt improve the situation by muttering loudly oh come off it claude and what did mr rumpole say the judge wanted all the gory details he told mr long he did nothing but talk and he was to get on with it and he was to get it out and make it snappy oh yes he said he was a boring old fart a boring old what mr erskinebrown fart my lord and hes not the only one around here either i informed mr bernard if the judge heard this he ignored it he went on in tones of the deepest disapproval to ask claude and since that conversation you say that the defendant long has been monosyllabic in other words he is obeying mr rumpoles quite improperly given instructions precisely what i am suggesting my lord claude was delighted to agree well now mr rumpole the judge stared balefully at me whatve you got to say to mr erskinebrowns accusation suddenly a great weariness came over me for once in my long life i couldnt be bothered to argue and this legal storm in a lunchhour bored me as much as my clients evidence i was tired of long tired of judges tired of learned friends tired of toothache tired of life i rose wearily to my feet and said nothing my lord nothing mr justice oliphant couldnt believe it absolutely nothing so you dont deny that all mr erskinebrown has told the court is true i neither accept it nor deny it its a contemptible suggestion made by an advocate incapable of conducting a proper crossexamination further than that i dont feel called upon to comment so far as i know i am not on trial not at the moment said the judge i cannot answer for the bar council then i suggest we concentrate on the trial of mr long and forget mine my lord that was my final word on the matter when we did concentrate on the trial it went extremely speedily mr long remained monosyllabic our speeches were brief the judge all passion spent by the drama of the lunchhour summed up briefly and by half past five the jury were back with an acquittal shortly after that many of the characters important to this story had assembled in pommeroys wine bar although he was buying her a drink liz probert made no attempt to disguise her disapproval of the conduct of her learned leader as she told me after these events had taken place why did you have to do that claude she asked in a severe manner why did you have to put that lunchtime conversation to long rather brilliant i thought he answered with some selfsatisfaction and offered to split a halfbottle of his favourite pouilly fume with her it got the judge on my side immediately and got the jury on rumpoles side his client was acquitted i dont know if you remember well win a few lose a few claude said airily thats par for the course if youre a busy silk i mean why did you do that to rumpole well that was fair wasnt it he shouldnt have talked to his client when he was still in the box its just not on are you sure he did liz asked i heard him with my own ears you dont think id lie do you well it has been known didnt you lie to your wife about taking me to the opera liz had no compunction about opening old wounds that was love everyone lies when theyre in love dont ever tell me youre in love with me again i shant believe a single word of it did you really mean to get rumpole disbarred rumpole disbarred even claude sounded shaken by the idea its not possible of course its possible didnt you hear oilie oliphant that was just north country bluff i mean they couldnt do a thing like that could they not to rumpole if you ask me thats what theyve been longing to do to rumpole for years liz told him now youve given them just the excuse they need who needs the establishment claude theyll use you you know then theyll throw you out on the scrap heap thats what they do to spies my god erskinebrown was looking at her with considerable admiration youre beautiful when youre angry at which point mizz probert left him having seen me alone staring gloomily into a large brandy claude was surrounded with thirsty barristers eager for news of the great rumpoleoliphant battle before i got into conversation with liz who sat herself down at my table with a look of maddening pity on her face i have to confess that i had been watching our clerk henry at a distant table he had bought a strangelooking white concoction for dot clapton and was now sitting gazing at her in a way which made me feel that this was no longer a rehearsal for the bexleyheath thespians but a reallife drama which might lead to embarrassing and even disastrous results i didnt manage to earwig all the dialogue but i learned enough to enable me to fill in the gaps later you cant imagine what it was like dot when my wife was mayor henry was complaining as he so often did about his spouses civic duties bet you were proud of her dot seemed to be missing the point proud of her what happened to my selfrespect in those days when i was constantly referred to as the lady mayoress poor old henry dot couldnt help laughing poor old henry yes at council meetings i had to sit in the gallery known as the hen pen i was sat there with the wives things a bit better now are they dot was still hugely entertained now eileens reverted to alderperson very minimally dot shes on this slimming regime now what shall i go back to lettuce salad and cottage cheese you know that white stuff tastes of soap no drink of course nothing alcoholic you reckon you could go another snowball im all right thanks i saw dot cover her glass with her hand i know you are dot henry agreed enthusiastically you most certainly are all right the trouble is eileen and i havent exactly got a relationship not like weve got a relationship well she doesnt work with you does she not on the fee notes dot asked reasonably enough she doesnt work with me at all and well i dont feel close to her not as i feel close to you dot well dont get that close dot warned him i saw mr erskinebrown give a glance in this direction mr erskinebrown hes always chasing after young girls makes himself ridiculous henrys voice was full of contempt i had noticed im not like that dot i like to talk you know one on one have a relationship may i ask you a very personal question no harm in asking she sounded less than fascinated do you like me dot i mean do you like me for myself well i dont like you for anyone else dot laughed again youre a very nice sort of person speak as you find and then henry asked anxiously am i a big part of your life course you are she was still amused thank you dot thank you very much thats all i need to know henry stood up grateful and excited that deserves another snowball i saw him set out for the bar in a determined fashion so now dot was speaking to his back trying to explain herself i mean youre my boss arent you thats a big part of my life things had reached this somewhat tricky stage in the dothenry relationship by the time liz came and sat with me and demanded my full attention with a call to arms rumpole she said youve got to fight it every inch of the way fight what your case its the establishment against rumpole my dear mizz liz there isnt any case its a question of free speech is it your freedom to speak to your client during the lunchhour youre an issue of civil rights now rumpole oh am i i dont think i want to be that and then she looked at my glass and said as though it were a sad sign of decline youre drinking brandy dutch courage i explained oh rumpole thats not like you youve never been afraid of judges judges oh no as i always taught you mizz liz fearlessness is the first essential in an advocate i can cope with judges its the other chaps that give me the jimjams which other chaps rumpole dentists i took a large swig of brandy and shivered time cures many things and in quite a short time old smoothychops leering had the nagging tooth out of my head and i felt slightly bettertempered time however merely encouraged the growth of the great dispute and brought me nearer to an event that id never imagined possible the trial of rumpole you must understand that we legal hacks are divided into inns known as inns of court these inns are ruled by the benchers judges and senior barristers who elect each other to the office rather in the manner of the council which ruled venice during the middle ages the benchers of my inn known as the outer temple do themselves extremely proud and once elected pay very little for lunch in the outer temple hall and enjoy a good many ceremonial dinners grand nights guest nights and other such occasions when they climb into a white tie and tails enter the dining hall with bishops and generals on their arms and then retire to the parliament room for fruit nuts port brandy muscat beaumes de venise and romeo y julieta cigars there they discuss the hardships of judicial life and the sad decline in public morality and occasionally swap such jokes as might deprave and corrupt those likely to hear them on this particular guest night mr justice graves as treasurer of the inn was presiding over the festivities oilie oliphant was also present as was a tall handsome only slightly overweight qc called montague varian who was later to act as my prosecutor sam ballard the alleged head of our chambers and recently elected bencher was there delighted and somewhat overawed by his new honour it was ballard who told me the drift of the afterdinner conversation in the parliament room an account which i have filled up with invention founded on a hardwon knowledge of the characters concerned among the guests present were a lady mendip a sensible greyhaired headmistress and the bishop of bayswater it was to this cleric that graves explained one of the quainter customs of the outer temple dining process my dear bishop you may have heard a porter ringing a handbell before dinner thats a custom weve kept up since the middle ages the purpose is to summon in such of our students as may be fishing in the fleet river oh i like that i like that very much the bishop was full of enthusiasm for the middle ages we regard it as rather a charming eccentricity graves was smiling but his words immediately brought out the worst in oliphant ive had enough of eccentricity lately he said and i dont regard it as a bit charming ah oliver i heard youd been having a bit of trouble with rumpole graves turned the conversation to the scandal of the moment youve got to admit rumpoles a genuine eccentric montague varian seemed to find me amusing genuine oliphant cracked a nut mercilessly where i come from we know what genuine is theres nothing more genuine than a good old yorkshire pudding thats risen in the oven all fluffy and crisp outside at which a voice piped up from the end of the table singing a northern folk song with incomprehensible words on ilkley moor ba tat this was arthur nottley the junior bencher a thin rather elegant fellow whose weary manner marked a deep and genuine cynicism he often said he only stayed on at the bar to keep his basset hound in the way to which it had become accustomed now he had not only insulted the great yorkshire bore but had broken one of the rules of the inn so graves rebuked him master junior we dont sing on guest nights in this inn only on the night of grand revelry im sorry master treasurer nottley did his best to sound apologetic please remember that yes oliver you were saying its all theatrical oliphant grumbled those old clothes to make himself look poor and downatheel put on to get a sympathy vote from the jury that terrible old bit of waistcoat with cigar ash and gravy stains its no more than a facade of a waistcoat varian agreed asortofdickie the old lord chief would never hear argument from a man he suspected of wearing a backless waistcoat oliphant quoted a precedent do you remember him telling freddy ringwood it gives me little pleasure to listen to an argument from a gentleman in light trousers you could say the same for rumpoles waistcoat when he waves his arms about you can see his shirt youre telling me oliver graves added to the horror unfortunately ive seen more than that of course we do have rumpole in chambers ballard im sure felt he had to apologize for me unfortunately i inherited him come with the furniture did he varian laughed oh id never have let him in the loyal ballard assured them and i must tell you ive tried to raise the matter of his waistcoat on many occasions but i cant get him to listen well there you go you see and graves apologized to the cleric but were boring the bishop not at all its fascinating the bishop of bayswater was enjoying the fun this rumpole youve been talking about i gather hes a bit of a character you could say hes definitely got form varian made a legal joke previous convictions that means bishop graves explained for the benefit of the cloth we get them in our business the bishop told them priests who try to be characters theyve usually come to it late in life preach eccentric sermons mention saddam hus m in their prayers pay undue attention to the poor of north bayswater and never bother to drop in for a cup of tea with the perfectly decent old ladies in the south blame the government for all the sins of mankind in the faint hope of getting their mugs on television oh please god thats my nightly prayer save me from characters varian passed him the madeira and when he had refilled his glass the bishop continued give me a plain undistinguished parish priest a chap who can marry them bury them and still do a decent armistice day service for the veterans association or a chap wholl put his case keep a civil tongue in his head and not complain when you pot his client oliphant agreed by the way graves asked what did freddy ringwood do in the end was it that business with his girl pupil the one who tried to slit her wrists in the womens robing room at the old bailey no i dont think that was it didnt he cash a rubber cheque in the circuit mess arthur nottley remembered that was cleared no varian put them right old freddys trouble was that he spoke to his client while he was in the middle of giving evidence it sounds familiar oilie oliphant said with relish and in rumpoles case there was also the matter of the abusive language he used to me on the bench not that i mind for myself i can use my common sense about that i hope but when youre sitting representing her majesty the queen it amounts to tese majeste high treason oliver suggested graves languidly theres a strong rumour going round the sheridan club that rumpole called you a boring old fart at which arthur nottley whispered to our leader probably the only true words spoken in the case and ballard did his best to look disapproving at such impertinence i know what he said oliphant was overcome with terrible common sense it was the clearest contempt of court thats why i felt it was my public duty to report the matter to the bar council and theyre also saying varian was always marvellously well informed that rumpoles case has been put over to a disciplinary tribunal and may the lord have mercy on his soul graves intoned rumpole on trial you must admit its rather an amusing idea the news was bad and it had better be broken to she who must be obeyed as soon as possible i had every reason to believe that when she heard it the consequent eruption of just wrath against the tactless bloodymindedness of rumpole would register on the richter scale as far away as aldgate east and west hampstead so it was in the tentative and somewhat nervous way that a parent on guy fawkes night lights the blue touch paper and stands well back that i said to hilda one evening when we were seated in front of the gasfire old thing ive got something to tell you and ive got something to tell you rumpole she was drinking coffee and toying with the telegraph crossword and seemed in an unexpectedly good mood all the same i had to confess i think ive about finished with this game what game is that rumpole standing up and bowing saying if your lordship pleases in my very humble submission with the very greatest respect my lord to some old fool no one has any respect for at all thats the point rumpole you shouldnt have to stand up any more or bow to anyone those days are over hilda definitely over i quite agree i was delighted to find her so easily persuaded i shall let them go through their absurd rigmarole and then they can do their worst and youll spend the rest of your days sitting hilda said i thought that was rather an odd way of putting it but i was glad of her support and explained my present position in greater detail so be it i told her if thats all they have to say to me after a lifetime of trying to see that some sort of lustice is done to a long line of errant human beings good luck to them if thats my only reward for trying to open their eyes and understand that there are a great many people in this world who werent at winchester with them and have no desire to take port with the benchers of the outer temple let them get on with it from this time forth i never will speak word im sure thats best rumpole except for your summingsup my what i no longer followed her drift your summingsup to the jury rumpole you can do those sitting down cant you hilda i asked patiently what are you talking about i know what youre talking about i had a word with marigold featherstone in harrods does she know already news of rumpoles disgrace had of course spread like wildfire well not everything but she was going to see guthrie did something about it nothing he can do i had to shatter her hopes nothing anyone can do now you mean they told you she looked more delighted than ever told me what youre going to be a judge no my dear old thing im not going to be a judge im not even going to be a barrister im up before the disciplinary tribunal hilda theyre going to kick me out she looked at me in silence and i steeled myself for the big bang but to my amazement she asked quite quietly rumpole what is it youve got yourself into some sort of trouble thats the understatement of the year is it another woman hildas mind dwelt continually on sex not really its another man a north country comedian who gave me more of his downtoearth common sense than i could put up with sir oliver oliphant she knew her way round the judiciary you werent rude to him were you rumpole in all the circumstances i think i behaved with remarkable courtesy i assured her that means you were rude to him she was not born yesterday i once poured him a cup of tea at the outer temple garden party what made you forget the arsenic hes probably not so bad when you get to know him when you get to know him i assured her hes much much worse what else have you done rumpole you may as well tell me now they say i spoke to my client at lunchtime i am alleged to have told him not to bore us all to death was it a woman client she looked for a moment prepared to explode but i reassured her decidedly not it was a retired civil servant called henry sebastian long and when is this tribunal she was starting to sound determined as though war had broken out and she was prepared to fight to the finish shortly i shall treat it with the contempt it deserves i told her and when its all over i shall rest for the sword outwears its sheath and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe and love itself have rest the sound of the words brought me some comfort although i wasnt sure they were entirely appropriate and then she brought back my worst fears by saying i shall stand by you rumpole at whatever cost i shall stand by you through thick and thin perhaps i should explain the obscure legal process that has to be gone through in the unfrocking or should i say unwigging of a barrister the bar council may be said to be the guardian of our morality there to see we dont indulge in serious crimes or conduct unbecoming to a legal hack such as assaulting the officer in charge of the case dealing in dangerous substances round the corridors of the old bailey or speaking to our clients in the lunchhour mr justice oilie oliphant had made a complaint to that body and a committee had decided to send me for trial before a high court judge three practising barristers and a lay assessor one of the great and the good who could be relied upon to uphold the traditions of the bar and not ask awkward questions or give any trouble to the presiding judge it was the prospect of she who must be obeyed pleading my cause as a character witness before this august tribunal which made my blood run cold there was another offer of support which i thought was far more likely to do me harm than good i was a few weeks later alone in pommeroys wine bar contemplating the tail end of a bottle of chateau fleet street and putting off the moment when i would have to return home to hildas sighs of sympathy and the oftenrepeated unanswerable question how could you have done such a thing rumpole after all your years of experience to which would no doubt be added the information that her daddy would never have spoken to a client in the lunchhour or at any other time come to that when i heard a familiar voice calling my name and i looked up to see my old friend fred timson head of the great south london family of villains from which a large part of my income is derived naturally i asked him to pull up a chair pour out a glass and was he in some sort of trouble not me i heard you was mr rumpole i want you to regard me as your legal adviser when i explained that the indispensable mr bernard was already filling that post at my trial he said bernard has put me entirely in the picture he having called on my cousin kevins secondhand car lot as he was interested in a black rover only fifty thousand on the clock and the property of a late undertaker we chewed the fat to a considerable extent over your case mr rumpole and i have to inform you my own view is that youll walk it well get you out sir without a stain on your character oh really fred i already felt some foreboding and how will you manage that it so happened he started on a long story that cary and chas timson being interested spectators in the trial of chass brotherinlaw benny panton on the crockthorpe postoffice job was in the old bailey on that very day and they kept your client tongue or whatever his name was long yes they kept mr long in view throughout the lunchhour both of them remaining in the precincts as owing to a family celebration the night before they didnt fancy their dinner and they can say with the utmost certainty mr rumpole that you did not speak one word to your client throughout the lunchtime adjournment so the good news is two castiron alibi witnesses i have informed mr bernard accordingly and you are bound to walk i dont know what fred expected but all i could do was to look at him in silent wonder and at last say very interesting we thought youd be glad to know about it he seemed surprised at my not hugging him with delight how did they recognize mr long oh they asked who you was defending being interested in your movements as the regular family brief and the usher pointed this long out to the witnesses really and who was the judge in the robbery trial they were attending they told me that old penal parsloe im sure that was him mr justice parsloe is now lord justice parsloe sitting in the court of appeal i had to break the bad news to him he hasnt been down the bailey for at least two years im afraid your ingenious defence wouldnt work fred even if i intended to deny the charges well what judge was it then mr rumpole never mind fred i had to discourage his talent for invention its the thought that counts when i left pommeroys a good deal later bound for temple tube station i had an even stranger encounter and a promise of further embarrassment at my trial as i came down middle temple lane on to the embankment and turned right towards the station i saw the figure of claude erskinebrown approaching with his robe bag slung over his shoulder no doubt whistling the big number from gbtterdammerung perhaps kept late by some jury unable to make up its mind claude had been the cause of all my troubles and i had no desire to bandy words with the fellow so i turned back and started to retrace my steps in an easterly direction who should i see then but oilie oliphant issuing from middle temple lane smoking a cigar and looking like a man who has been enjoying a good dinner quick as a shot i dived into such traffic as there was and crossed the road to the embankment where i stood close to the wall looking down into the inky water of the thames with my back well turned to the two points of danger behind me i hadnt been standing there very long sniffing the night air and hoping i had got shot of my two opponents when an unwelcome hand grasped my arm and i heard a panicstricken voice say dont do it rumpole do what take the easy way out bollard i said for it was our head of chambers behaving in this extraordinary fashion let go of me will you at this ballard did relax his grip and stood looking at me with deep and intolerable compassion as he intoned however serious the crime all sinners may be forgiven and remember there are those that are standing by you your devoted wife and me i have taken up the burden of your defence well put it down bollard i have nothing whatever to say to those ridiculous charges i mean i am acting for you at your trial i then felt a genuine if momentary desire to hurl myself into the river but he was preaching on i think i can save you rumpole if you truly repent what is this i couldnt believe my ears a legal conference or a prayer meeting good question rumpole the two are never far apart you may achieve salvation if you will say after me you have erred and strayed like a lost sheep the say that to oilie oliphant had bollard taken complete leave of his few remaining senses repentance rumpole its the only way never i dont ask it for myself rumpole even though im standing by you well stop standing by me will you im on my way to the underground and i started to move away from the man at a fairly brisk pace i ask it for that fine woman who has devoted her life to you a somewhat unworthy cause perhaps but she is devoted rumpole i ask it for hilda what i didnt know at that point was that hilda was being more active in my defence than i was she had called at our chambers and while i was fulfilling a previous engagement in snaresbrook crown court she had burst into ballards room unannounced rousing him from some solitary religious observance or an afternoon sleep brought on by overindulgence in beanshoot sandwiches at the vegetarian snack bar and told him that i was in a little difficulty ballardsview when he had recovered consciousness was that i was in fact in deep trouble and he had prayed long and earnestly about the matter i hope youre going to do something a little more practical than pray hilda as you may have noticed can be quite sharp on occasions she went on to tell soapy sam that she had called at the bar council indeed there was no door she wouldnt open in my cause and had been told that what rumpole needed was a qc to defend him and if he did his own case in the way he carried on down the bailey hed be unk that seems to be sound advice mrs rumpole i said there was no difficulty in getting a qc of standing and that rumpoles head of chambers would be delighted to act for him you mean there was im sure a note of fear in ballards voice you want me to take on rumpole as a client i want you to stand by him sam as i am doing and as any decent head of chambers would for a tenant in trouble but hes got to apologize to mr justice oliphant fully and sincerely how on earth am i going to persuade rumpole to do that ballard no doubt felt like someone called upon to cleanse the augean stables knowing perfectly well that hed never be a hercules leave that to me ill do the persuading you just think of how youd put it nice and politely to the judge hilda was giving the instructions to counsel but ballard was still daunted rumpole as a client he muttered god give me strength dont worry sam if god wont i certainly will after this encounter ballard dined in his newfound splendour as a bencher and after dinner he found himself sitting next to none other than the complaining judge oilie oliphant who was in no hurry to return to his bachelor flat in temple gardens seeking to avoid a great deal of hard and thankless work before the disciplinary tribunal soapy sam started to soften up his lordship who seemed astonished to hear that he was defending rumpole i am acting in the great tradition of the bar judge soapy sam excused himself by saying of course we are bound to represent the most hopeless client in the most disagreeable case hopeless im glad you see that shows youve got a bit of common sense might you take ballard was at his most obsequious in your great wisdom and humanity which is a byword at the old bailey you are known i believe as the quality of mercy down there a merciful view if there were to be a contrite apology rumpoled rather be disbarred than apologize to me oliphant was probably right but if he would if he would itd cause him more genuine pain and grief than anything else in the world and then the judge thinking it over was heard to make some sort of gurgling noise that fr might have passed for a chuckle id enjoy seeing that i really would id love to see horace rumpole grovel that might be punishment enough it would be up to the tribunal of course of course but your attitude judge would have such an influence given the great respect youre held in at the bar well thank you thank you very much it was after that bit of crawling over the dessert that i spotted oliphant coming out of middle temple lane and ballard imagined hed saved me from ending my legal career in the cold and inhospitable waters of the thames it soon became clear to me that my supporters expected me to appear as a penitent before mr justice oliphant this was the requirement of she who must be obeyed who pointed out the awful consequences of my refusal to bow the knee how could i bear it rumpole she said one evening when the nine oclock news had failed to entertain us i remember daddy at the bar and how everyone respected him how could i bear to be the wife of a disbarred barrister how could i meet any of the fellows in chambers and hear them say as i turned away of course you remember old rumpole kicked out for unprofessional conduct of course i saw her point i sighed heavily and asked her what she wanted me to do take sam ballards advice weve all told you apologize to sir oliver oliphant all right hilda you win i hope i said it convincingly but down towards the carpet beside the arm of my chair i had my fingers crossed hilda and i were not the only couple whose views were not entirely at one in that uneasy period before my trial during a quiet moment in the clerks room henry came out with some startling news for dot well i told eileen last night it was an evening when she wasnt out at the drainage inquiry and i told my wife quite frankly what we decided what did we decide dot asked nervously like what you told me im a big part of your life did i say that you know you did we cant hide it can we dot were going to make a future together you told your wife that dot was now seriously worried she understood what i was on about eileen understands i got to have this one chance of happiness while im still young enough to enjoy it did you say young enough henry so were beginning a new life together that all right dot before she could answer him the telephone rang and the clerks room began to fill with solicitors and learned friends in search of briefs henry seemed to regard the matter as closed and dot didnt dare to reopen it at least until after my trial was over and a historic meeting took place during the day time when the nuts and fruit and madeira were put away and the tables were arranged in a more threatening and judicial manner my trial began in the outer temple parliament room it was all im sure intended to be pleasant and informal i wasnt guarded in a dock but sat in a comfortable chair beside my legal advisers sam ballard qc liz probert his junior and mr bernard my instructing solicitor however all friendly feelings were banished by the look on the face of the presiding judge i had drawn the short straw in the shape of mr justice graves or gravestone as i preferred to call him who looked as though he was sick to the stomach at the thought of a barrister accused of such appalling crimes but if someone had to be he was relieved on the whole that it was only horace rumpole claude gave evidence in a highly embarrassed way of what hed heard and i instructed ballard not to ask him any questions this came as a relief to him as he couldnt think of any questions to ask and then oilie oliphant came puffing in bald as an egg without his wig wearing a dark suit and the artificial flower of some charity in his buttonhole he was excused from taking the oath by graves who acted on the wellknown theory that judges are incapable of fibbing and he gave his account of all my sins and omissions to montague varian qc for the prosecution as he did so i examined the faces of my judges graves might have been carved out of yellowish marble the lay assessor was lady mendip the headmistress and she looked as though she were hearing an account of disgusting words found chalked up on a blackboard of the three practising barristers sent to try me only arthur nottley smiled faintly but then i had seen him smile through the most horrendous murder cases when varian had finished ballard rose with the greatest respect to crossexamine its extremely courteous of you to agree to attend here in person judge and absolutely charming of you to lodge a complaint against me i murmured politely now my client wants you to know that he was suffering from a severe toothache on the day in question ballard was wrong i didnt particularly want the judge to know that at any rate graves didnt think much of my temporary stopping as a defence mr ballard he said is toothache an excuse for speaking to a client during the luncheontime adjournment i should have thought mr rumpole would have been anxious to rest his mouth my lord im not dealing with the question of rudeness to the learned judge the boring old fart evidence i thought i heard nottley whisper to his neighbouring barrister and then ballard pulled a trick on me which i hadnt expected i understand my client wishes to apologize to the learned judge in his own words he told the tribunal no doubt he expected that overcome by the solemnity of the occasion i would run up the white flag and beg for mercy he sat down and i did indeed rise to my feet and address mr justice oliphant along these lines my lord i started formally if it please your lordship i do realize there are certain things which should not be said or done in court things that are utterly inexcusable and no doubt amount to contempt as i said this graves leant forward and i saw as i had never in court seen before a faint smile on those gaunt features mr rumpole the tribunal is i believe i can speak for us all both surprised and gratified by this unusually apologetic attitude here the quartet beside him nodded in agreement i take it youre about to withdraw the inexcusable phrases inexcusable certainly i agreed i was just about to put to mr justice oliphant the inexcusable manner in which he sighs and rolls his eyes to heaven when he sums up the defence case and here i embarked on a mild imitation of oilie oliphant of course you can believe that if you like members of the jury but use your common sense why dont you and what about describing my clients conduct as manslaughter during the evidence which was the very fact the jury had to decide if hes prepared to say sorry for that then ill apologize for pointing out his undoubted prejudice oliphant who had slowly been coming to the boil exploded at this point am i expected to sit here and endure a repetition of the quite intolerable no no my lord ballard fluttered to his feet of course not please mr rumpole if it please your lordship may i take instructions and when graves said i think youd better my defender turned to me with you said youd apologize im prepared to swap apologies i whispered back i heard that mr ballard graves was triumphant as i think your client knows perfectly well my hearing is exceptionally keen i wonder what mr rumpoles excuse is for his extraordinary behaviour today he isnt suffering from toothache now is he my lord i will take further instructions this time he whispered rumpole hadnt you better have toothache no i had it out im afraid my lord ballard turned to graves disappointed the answer is no he had it out during the trial so on this occasion mr ballard you cant even plead toothache as a defence im afraid not my lord had it out during the trial graves was making a careful note then he screwed the top back on his pen with the greatest care and said we shall continue with this unhappy case tomorrow morning my lord i rose to my feet again may i make an application what is it mr rumpole graves asked warily as well he might im getting tired of mr ballards attempts to get me to apologize unilaterally would you ask him not to speak to his client over the adjournment graves had made a note of the historic fact that i had had my tooth out during the trial and liz had noted it down also as she wrote she started to speculate as i had taught her to do in the distant days when she was my pupil as soon as the tribunal packed up business for the day she went back to chambers and persuaded claude erskinebrown to take her down to the old bailey and show her the locus in quo the scene where the ghastly crime of chattering to a client had been committed bewildered but no doubt filled with guilt at his treacherous behaviour to a fellow hack claude led her to the archway through which he had seen the tedious long listening to rumpoles harangue and where did you see rumpole well he came out through the arch after hed finished talking to his client but while he was speaking to his client well actually claude had to admit i didnt see him then at all i mean i suppose he was hidden from my view i suppose he was at which she strode purposefully a through the arch and saw what perhaps she had expected to find a row of telephones on the wall in a position which would also have been invisible to the earwigging claude they were half covered its true with plastic hoods but a man who didnt wish to crouch under these contrivances might stand freely with the connection pulled out to its full extent and speak to whoever he had chosen to abuse so rumpole might have been standing here when you were listening liz had taken up her position by one of the phones i suppose so and you heard him say words like just get on with it ive got enough trouble without you causing me all this agony get it out i told the tribunal that dont you remember the true meaning of the words hadnt yet sunk into that vague repository of wagnerian snatches and romantic longings the erskinebrown mind liz however saw the truth in all its simplicity as she lifted a telephone brushed it with her credit card in a way i could never manage and was in an instant speaking to she who must be obeyed miss probert had two simple requests could hilda come down to the temple tomorrow and what please was the name of horaces dentist when the tribunal met next morning my not so learned counsel announced that my case was to be placed in more competent hands my learned junior miss probert sam ballard said will call our next witness but first she wishes to recall mr erskinebrown no one objected to this and claude returned to the witnesss chair to explain the position of the archway and the telephones and the fact that he hadnt indeed seen me speaking to long montague varian had no questions and my judges were left wondering what significance if any to attach to this new evidence i was sure that it would make no difference to the result but then liz probert uttered the dread words i will now call mr lionel leering i had been at a crossroads one way led on through a countryside too well known to me i could journey on for ever round the courts arguing cases winning some losing more and more perhaps in my few remaining years the other road was the way of escape and once mr leering gave his evidence that i know would be closed to me dont do it i whispered my instructions to miss probert im not fighting this case oh rumpole she turned and leant down to my level her face shining with enthusiasm im going to win its what you taught me to do dont spoil it for me now i thought then of all the bloodyminded clients who had wrecked the cases in which i was about to chalk up a victory it was her big moment and who was i to snatch it from her i was tired too tired to win but also too tired to lose so i gave her her head go on then i told her if you have to with her nostrils dilated and the light of battle in her eyes mizz liz probert turned on her dental witness and proceeded to demolish the prosecution case do you carry on your practice in harley street in london that is so and may i say i have a most important bridge to insert this morning the patient is very much in the public eye then ill try and make this as painless as possible liz assured him did you treat mr rumpole on the morning of may the ith i did he came early because he told me he was in the middle of a case at the old bailey i think he was defendingin a manslaughter i gave him a temporary stopping which i thought would keep him going did it apparently not he rang me around lunchtime he told me that his tooth was causing him pain and he was extremely angry he raised his voice at me can you remember what he said so far as i can recall he said something like ive got enough trouble with the judge without you causing me all this agony get it out and put us out of our misery what do you think he meant i he wanted his tooth extracted did you do it for him yes i stayed on late especially i saw him at seventhirty that evening he was more cheerful then but a little unsteady on his feet i believe hed been drinking brandy to give himself dutch courage i think that may well have been so liz agreed now the members of the tribunal were whispering together then the whispering stopped and mr justice gravestone turned an ancient and fishlike eye on my prosecutor if this evidence is correct mr varian and we remember the admission made by mr claude erskinebrown and the position of the telephones and the fact that he never saw mr rumpole then this allegation about speaking to his client falls to the ground does it not i must concede that my lord then all that remains is the offensive remarks to mr justice oliphant yes my lord yes well im much obliged the fishy beam was turned on to the defence this case now turns solely on whether your client is prepared to make a proper unilateral apology to my brother oliphant indeed my lord then well consider that matter after a short adjournment so we all did a good deal of bowing to each other and as i came out of the parliament room who should i see but she who must be obeyed who for a reason then unknown to me made a most surprising uturn rumpole she said ive been thinking things over and i think oliphant treated you abominably my view of the matter is that you shouldnt apologize at all is that your view hilda of course it is im sure nothing will make you stop work unless youre disbarred and think how wonderful that will be for our marriage what do you mean but id already guessed with a sort of dread what she was driving at if you cant consort with all those criminals ill have you at home all day theres so many little jobs for you to do repaper the kitchen get the parquet in the hallway polished youd be able to help me with the shopping every day and wed have my friends round to tea dodo mackintosh complains she sees nothing of you there was considerably more in this vein but hilda had already said enough to make up my mind when my judges were back refreshed with coffee biscuits and in certain cases a quick drag on a silk cut sam ballard announced that i wished to make a statement the dye was cast and i tottered to my feet and spoke to the following effect if your lordship and the members of the tribunal please i have i hope some knowledge of the human race in general and the judicial race in particular i do realize that some of those elevated to the bench are more vulnerable more easily offended than others over my years at the old bailey before your lordship and his brother judges i have had to grow a skin like a rhinoceros mr justice oliphant i acknowledge is a more retiring shy and sensitive plant and if anything i have said may have wounded him i do most humbly most sincerely apologize at this i bowed and whispered to mizz liz probert will that do what went on behind closed doors between my judges i cant say were some of them was even the seagreen incorruptible graves a little tired of ollies downtoearth north country common sense had they been sufficiently bored by him over port and walnuts to wish to deflate just a little that great selfsatisfied balloon or did they stop short of depriving the old bailey monument of its few moments of worthwhile drama would they really have wanted to take all the fun out of the criminal law i dont know the answer to these questions but in one rather athletic bound rumpole was free still to be audible in the ludgate circus palais de justice the next events of importance occurred at an ambitious chambers party held as a delayed celebration of the fact that mrs phillida erskinebrown our portia was now elegantly perched on the high court bench and her husband claude had received the lesser honour of being swathed in silk this beano took place in ballards room and all the characters in equity court were there together with their partners as mizz liz would call them and i had taken the opportunity of issuing a few further invitations on my own account one of the most dramatic events on this occasion was an encounter by a table loaded with bottles and various delicacies between dot and a pleasantlooking woman in her forties who between rapid inroads into a plate of tunafish sandwiches said that she was henrys wife eileen and wasnt dot the new typist because henrys been telling me all about you i dont know why he does that he has no call really dot was confused and embarrassed look im sorry about what he told you oh dont be eileen reassured her its a great relief to me i was on this horrible slimming diet because i thought thats how henry liked me but now he says you want to make your life together so could you just whirl those cocktail sausages in my direction were not going to make a life together and i dont know where he got the idea from at all i mean i like henry i think hes very sweet and serious but in a boyfriend id prefer something more muscular know what i mean youre not going to take him on henrys wife sounded disappointed i couldnt entertain the idea with all due respect to your husband hell have to stay where he is then eileen lifted another small sausage on its toothpick but im not going back on that horrible cottage cheese not for him not for anyone by now the party was starting to fill up and among the first to come was old gravestone to whom i thought i owed a very small debt of gratitude i heard him tell ballard how surprised he was that id invited him and he congratulated my socalled defender on having got me to apologize ballard lied outrageously and said as head of these chambers of course i do have a little influence on rumpole shortly after this another of my invitees came puffing up the stairs and ballard apparently in a state of shock stammered judge youre here to mr justice oliphant of course im here oilie rebuked him use your common sense made rumpole squirm having to apologize did it good very good that was all i needed later mr justice featherstone arrived with marigold and among all these judicial stars eileen the exmayor had the briefest of heart to hearts with her husband she doesnt want you henry she told him please our clerk looked nervously round for earwiggers how on earth can you say that oh she told me no doubt about it she goes for something more muscular and i know exactly what she means oblivious of this domestic drama the party surged on around them ballard told mr justice featherstone that it had been a most worrying case and guthrie said things might be even more worrying now that id won and claude asked me why i hadnt told him that i was talking to my dentist your suggestion was beneath contempt erskinebrown besides which i rather fancied being disbarred at the time rumpole the man was shocked why ever should you want that for the sword outwears its sheath i explained and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe but not yet claude not quite yet at last henry managed to corner dot while claude set off in a beeline for the personable eileen the first thing henry did was to apologize i never wanted her to come dot but she insisted it must have been terribly embarrassing for you shes ever so nice isnt she youre a very lucky bloke henry having you you mean he still nursed a flicker of hope no she blew out the flame having a wife whos prepared to eat cottage cheese for you marigold said to hilda i hear rumpoles not sitting as a judge in fact i heard he was nearly made to sit at home permanently marguerite ballard exmatron down at the old bailey told mr justice oliphant that his naughty tummy was rather running away with him i told liz that she had been utterly ruthless in pursuit of victory and she asked if i had forgiven her for saving my legal life i think so but who fed hilda that line about having me at home all day what are you talking about rumpole she who must joined us oh i was just saying to liz of course itd be very nice if we could spend all day together hilda i mean that wasnt what led me to apologize thats the trouble with barristers she gave me one other piercing looks you cant believe a word they say before i could think of any convincing defence to hildas indictment the last of my personally invited guests arrived this was fred timson wearing a dark suit with a striped tie and looking more than ever like a senior member of the old serious crimes squad i found him a drink put it into his hand and told him how glad i was he could find time for us what a do eh he looked round appreciatively judges and sparkling wine heres to your very good health mr rumpole no fred i told him im going to drink to yours whereupon i banged a glass against the table called for silence and proposed a toast listen everybody i want to introduce you to fred timson head of a noted family of south london villains minor thieves and receivers of stolen property no violence in his record that right fred quite right mr rumpole fred confirmed the absence of violence and then i made public what had long been my secret thoughts on the relationship between the timsons and the law this should appeal to you my lords ladies and gentlemen fred lives his life on strict monetarist principles he doesnt believe in the closed shop he thinks that shops should be open all night preferably by jemmy he believes firmly in the marketplace because thats where you can dispose of articles that dropped off the back of a lorry but without fred and his like we should all be out of work there would be no judges none of her majestys counsel learned in the law no coppers and no humble old bailey hacks so charge your glasses fill us up henry and i would ask you to drink to fred timson and the criminals of england i raised my glass but the faces around me registered varying degrees of disapproval and concern ballard bleated rumpole hilda gave out a censorious really rumpole featherstone j said hes off again and mr justice oliphant decided that if this wasnt unprofessional conduct he didnt know what was only liz flushed with her success in court and a few quick glasses of the methods champenoise raised a fist and called out up the workers oh really graves turned wearily to our head of chambers will rumpole never learn im afraid never ballard told him i was back at work again and life would continue much as ever at equity court the end
