lawless nora roberts chapter one he wanted a drink whiskey cheap and warm after six weeks on the trail he wanted the same kind of woman some men usually managed to get what they wanted he was one of them still the woman could wait jake decided as he leaned against the bar the whiskey couldnt he had another ninety long dusty miles to go before he got home if anybody could call a frying pan like lone bluff home some did jake thought as he signaled for a bottle and took his first gutclenching gulp some had to for himself home was usually the six feet of space where his shadow fell but for the past few months lone bluff had been as good a place as any he could get a room there a bath and a willing woman all at a reasonable price it was a town where a man could avoid trouble or find it depending on his mood for now with the dust of the trail still scratchy in his throat and his stomach empty except for a shot of whiskey jake was just too tired for trouble hed have another drink and whatever passed for a meal in this twobit town blown up from the desert then hed be on his way the afternoon sunlight poured in over the swinging doors at the saloons entrance someone had tacked a picture of a woman in red feathers to the wall but that was the extent of the female company places like this didnt run to providing women for their clientele just to liquor and cards even towns like this one had a saloon or two a man could depend upon it the way he could depend on little else it wasnt yet noon and half the tables were occupied the air was thick with the smoke from the cigars the bartender sold two for a penny the whiskey went for a couple of bits and burned a line of fire straight from the throat to the gut if the owner had added a real woman in red feathers he could have charged double that and not heard a single complaint the place stank of whiskey sweat and smoke but jake figured he didnt smell too pretty himself hed ridden hard from new mexico and he would have ridden straight through to lone bluff except hed wanted to rest his horse and fill his own stomach with something other than the jerky in his saddlebags saloons always looked better at night and this one was no exception its bar was grimy from hundreds of hands and elbows dulled by spilled drinks scarred by match tips the floor was nothing but hardpacked dirt that had absorbed its share of whiskey and blood hed been in worse jake reflected wondering if he should allow himself the luxury of rolling a cigarette now or wait until after a meal he could buy more tobacco if he had a yearning for another there was a months pay in his pocket and hed be damned if hed ever ride cattle again that was a life for the young and stupid or maybe just the stupid when his money ran low he could always take a job riding shotgun on the stage through indian country the line was always looking for a man who was handy with a gun and it was better than riding at the back end of a steer it was the middle of and the easterners were still coming looking for gold and land following dreams some of them stopped in the arizona territory on their way to california because they ran out of money or energy or time their hard luck jake thought as he downed his second whiskey hed been born here and he still didnt figure it was the most hospitable place on the map it was hot and hard and stingy it suited him just fine redman jake lifted his eyes to the dingy glass behind the bar he saw the man behind him young wiry and edgy his brown hat was tipped down low over his eyes and sweat glistened on his neck jake nearly sighed he knew the type too well the kind that went out of his way looking for trouble the kind that didnt know that if you hung around long enough it found you anyway yeah jake redman so im barlow tom barlow he wiped his palms on his thighs they call me slim the way he said it jake was sure the kid expected the name to be recognized shuddered over he decided the whiskey wasnt good enough for a third drink he dropped some money on the bar making sure his hands were well clear of his guns there a place where a man can get a steak in this town jake asked the bartender down to grodys the man moved cautiously out of range we dont want any trouble in here jake gave him a long cool look im not giving you any im talking to you redman barlow spread his legs and let his hand hover over the butt of his gun a meanlooking scar ran across the back of his hand from his index finger to his wrist he wore his holster high a single rig with the leather worn smooth at the buckle it paid to notice details easy moving no more than was necessary jake met his eyes something you want to say you got a reputation for being fast heard you took out freemont in tombstone jake turned fully as he moved the swinging door flew back at least one of the saloons customers had decided to move to safer ground the kid was packing a colt its black rubber grip well tended jake didnt doubt there were notches in it barlow looked like the type who would take pride in killing you heard right barlows fingers curled and uncurled two men playing poker in the corner let their hands lie to watch and made a companionable bet on the higherstakes game in front of them im faster faster than freemont faster than you i run this town jake glanced around the saloon then back into barlows dark edgy eyes congratulations he would have walked away but barlow shifted to block him the move had jake narrowing his eyes the look came into them the hard flat look that made a smart man give way cut your teeth on somebody else i want a steak and a bed not in my town patience wasnt jakes long suit but he wasnt in the mood to waste time on a gunman looking to sharpen his reputation you want to die over a piece of meat jake watched the grin spread over barlows face he didnt think he was going to die jake thought wearily his kind never did why dont you come find me in about five years jake told him ill be happy to put a bullet in you i found you now after i kill you there wont be a man west of the mississippi who wont know slim barlow for some for many no other reason was needed to draw and fire make it easy on both of us jake started for the doors again just tell them you killed me i hear your mother was a squaw barlow grinned when jake stopped and turned again guess thats where you got that streak of yellow jake was used to rage it could fill a man from stomach to brain and take over when he felt it rising up he clamped down on it if he was going to fight and it seemed inevitable he preferred to fight cold my grandmother was apache barlow grinned again then wiped his mouth with the back of his left hand that makes you a stinking breed dont it a stinking yellow breed we dont want no indians around here guess ill have to clean up the town a little he went for his gun jake saw the move not in barlows hands but in his eyes cold and fast and without regret jake drew his own there were those who saw him who said it was like lightning and thunder there was a flash of steel then the roar of the bullet he hardly moved from where he stood shooting from the hip trusting instinct and experience in a smooth almost careless movement he replaced his gun tom theycallmeslim barlow was sprawled on the barroom floor jake passed through the swinging doors and walked to his horse he didnt know whether hed killed his man or not and he didnt care the whole damn mess had ruined his appetite sarah was mortally afraid she was going to lose the miserable lunch shed managed to bolt down at the last stop how anyone anyone survived under these appalling conditions shed never know the west as far as she could see was only fit for snakes and outlaws she closed her eyes patted the sweat from her neck with her handkerchief and prayed that shed make it through the next few hours at least she could thank god she wouldnt have to spend another night in one of those horrible stage depots shed been afraid she would be murdered in her bed if one could call that miserable sheetless rope cot a bed and privacy well there simply hadnt been any it didnt matter now she told herself she was nearly there after twelve long years she was going to see her father again and take care of him in the beautiful house hed built outside lone bluff when shed been six hed left her in the care of the good sisters and gone off to make his fortune there had been nights many nights when sarah had cried herself to sleep from missing him then as the years had passed shed had to take out the faded daguerreotype to remember his face but hed always written to her his penmanship had been strained and childish but there had been so much love in his letters and so much hope once a month shed received word from her father from whatever point hed stopped at on his journey west after eighteen months and eighteen letters hed written from the arizona territory where hed settled and where he would build his fortune hed convinced her that hed been right to leave her in philadelphia in the convent school where she could be raised and educated as a proper young lady should until sarah remembered she was old enough to travel across the country to live with him now she was nearly eighteen and she was going to join him undoubtedly the house hed built however grand required a womans touch since hed never married again sarah imagined her father a crusty bachelor never quite certain where his clean collars were or what the cook was serving for dinner shed soon fix all that a man in his position needed to entertain and to entertain he needed a hostess sarah conway knew exactly how to give an elegant dinner party and a formal ball true what shed read of the arizona territory was distressing to say the least stories of ruthless gunmen and wild indians but after all this was sarah had no doubt that even so distant a place as arizona was under control by this time the reports shed read had obviously been exaggerated to sell newspapers and penny dreadfuls they hadnt exaggerated about the climate she shifted for a better position the bulk of the woman beside her and her own corset gave her little room for relief and the smell no matter how often sarah sprinkled lavender water on her handkerchief there was no escaping it there were seven passengers crammed all but elbowtoknee inside the rattling stagecoach it was airless and that accentuated the stench of sweat and foul breath and whatever liquor it was that the man across from her continued to drink right from the bottle at first his pockmarked face and grimy neckcloth had fascinated her but when hed offered her a drink she had fallen back on a womans best defense her dignity it was difficult to look dignified when her clothes were sticking to her and her hair was drooping beneath her bonnet it was all but impossible to maintain her decorum when the plump woman beside her began to gnaw on what appeared to be a chicken leg but when sarah was determined she invariably prevailed the good sisters had never been able to pray or punish or lecture her stubbornness out of her now with her chin slightly lifted and her body braced against the bouncing sway of the coach she kept her eyes firmly shut and ignored her fellow passengers shed seen enough of the arizona landscape if one could call it that as far as she could see the entire territory was nothing but miles of sunbaked desert true the first cacti shed seen had been fascinating shed even considered sketching a few of them some were as big as a man with arms that stretched up to the sky others were short and squat and covered with hundreds of dangerouslooking needles still after shed seen several dozen of them and little else theyd lost their novelty the rocks were interesting she supposed the buttes and flattopped mesas growing out of the sand had a certain rugged charm particularly when they rose up into the deep endless blue of the sky but she preferred the tidy streets of philadelphia with their shops and tearooms being with her father would make all the difference she could live anywhere as long as she was with him again hed be proud of her she needed him to be proud of her all these years shed worked and learned and practiced so that she could become the proper welleducated young lady he wanted his daughter to be she wondered if hed recognize her shed sent him a small framed selfportrait just last christmas but she wasnt certain it had been a truly good likeness shed always thought it was too bad she wasnt pretty in the soft round way of her dear friend lucilla still her complexion was good and sarah comforted herself with that unlike lucilla she never required any help from the little pots of rouge the sisters so disapproved of in fact there were times she thought her complexion just a bit too healthy her mouth was full and wide when she would have preferred a delicate cupids bow and her eyes were an unremarkable brown rather than the blue that would have suited her blond hair so much better still she was trim and neat or she had been neat before shed begun this miserable journey it would all be worthwhile soon when she greeted her father and they settled into the lovely house hed built four bedrooms imagine and a parlor with windows facing west delightful undoubtedly shed have to do some redecorating men never thought about such niceties as curtains and throw rugs shed enjoy it once she had the glass shining and fresh flowers in the vases he would see how much he needed her then all the years in between would have been worthwhile sarah felt a line of sweat trickle down her back the first thing she wanted was a batha nice cool bath laced with the fragrant lilac salts lucilla had given her as a parting gift she sighed she could almost feel it her body free of the tight corset and hot clothes the water sliding over her skin scented delicious almost sinful when the coach jolted sarah was thrown against the fat woman to her left before she could right herself a spray of rotgut whiskey soaked her skirts sir but before she could lecture him she heard the shot and the screams indians the chicken leg went flying and the fat woman clutched sarah to her bosom like a shield were all going to be murdered dont be absurd sarah struggled to free herself not certain if she was more annoyed by the sudden dangerous speed of the coach or the spot of chicken grease on her new skirt she leaned toward the window to call to the driver as she did the face of the shotgun rider slid into view inches from hers he hung there upside down for seconds only but that was long enough for sarah to see the blood trickling from his mouth and the arrow in his heart even as the woman beside her screamed again his body thudded to the ground indians she shouted again god have mercy well be scalped every one of us apaches the man with the whiskey said as he finished off the bottle mustve got the driver too were on a runaway so saying he drew his gun made his way to the opposite window and began firing methodically dazed sarah continued to stare out the window she could hear screams and whoops and the thunder of horses hooves like devils she thought dully they sounded like devils that was impossible ridiculous the united states was nearly a century old ulysses s grant was president steamships crossed the atlan tic in less than two weeks devils simply didnt exist in this day and age then she saw one bare chested hair flying on a tough paint pony sarah looked straight into his eyes she could see the fever in them just as she could see the bright streaks of paint on his face and the layer of dust that covered his gleaming skin he raised his bow she could have counted the feathers in the arrow then suddenly he flew off the back of his horse it was like a play she thought and she had to pinch herself viciously to keep from swooning another horseman came into view riding low with pistols in both hands he wasnt an indian though in sarahs confusion he seemed just as wild he wore a gray hat over dark hair and his skin was nearly as dark as that of the apache shed seen in his eyes as they met hers she saw not fever but ice he didnt shoot her as shed been almost certain he would but fired over his shoulder using his right hand then his left even as an arrow whizzed by his head amazing she thought as a thudding excitement began to race with her terror he was magnificent sweat and grime on his face ice in his eyes his lean tense body glued to the racing horse then the fat lady grabbed her again and began to wail jake fired behind him clinging to the horse with his knees as easily as any apache brave hed caught a glimpse of the passengers in particular a pale darkeyed girl in a dark blue bonnet his apache cousins wouldve enjoyed that one he thought dispassionately as he bolstered his guns he could see the driver an arrow piercing one shoulder struggling to regain control of the horses he was doing his best despite the pain but he wasnt strong enough to shove the brake down swearing jake pushed his horse on until he was close enough to the racing coach to gain a handhold for one endless second he hung by his fingers alone sarah caught a glimpse of a dusty shirt and one powerful forearm a long leatherclad leg and a scarred boot then he was up scrambling over the top of the coach the woman beside her screamed again then fainted dead away when they stopped too terrified to sit sarah pushed open the door of the coach and climbed out the man in the gray hat was already getting down maam he said as he moved past her she pressed a hand to her drumming heart no hero had ever been so heroic you saved our lives she managed but he didnt even glance her way redman the passenger whod drunk the whiskey stepped out glad you stopped by lucius jake picked up the reins of his horse and proceeded to calm him there were only six of them theyre getting away sarah blurted out are you just going to let them get away jake looked at the cloud of dust from the retreating horses then back at sarah he had time now for a longer more interested study she was tiny with east stamped all over her pretty face her hair the color of honeycombs was tumbling down from her bonnet she looked as if shed just stepped out of the school room and she smelled like a cheap saloon he had to grin yep but you cant her idea of a hero was rapidly crumbling they killed a man he knew the chance he was taking riding the line pays good they murdered him sarah said again as if she were speaking to a very dull pupil hes lying back there with an arrow through his heart when jake said nothing just walked his horse to the back of the coach sarah followed him at least you can go back and pick up that poor mans body we cant just leave him there deads dead thats a hideous tiling to say because she felt ill sarah dragged off her bonnet and used it to fan hot air around her face the man deserves a decent burial i couldnt possibly what are you doing jake spared her a glance mighty pretty he decided even prettier without the bonnet hiding her hair hitching my horse she dropped her arm to her side she no longer felt ill she was certainly no longer impressed she was furious sir you appear to care more about that horse than you do about the man he stooped under the reins for a moment they stood facetoface with the sun beating down and the smell of blood and dust all around them thats right seeing as the mans dead and my horse isnt id get back inside maam itd be a shame if you were still standing here when the apaches decide to come back that made her stop and look around uneasily the desert was still but for the cry of a bird she didnt recognize as a vulture ill go back and get him myself she said between her teeth suit yourself jake walked to the front of the coach get that stupid woman inside he told lucius and dont give her any more to drink sarahs mouth fell open before she could retaliate lucius had her by the arm now dont mind jake miss he just says whatever he damn pleases hes right though those apaches might ram back this way we sure dont want to be sitting here if they do with what little dignity she had left sarah stepped back into the coach the fat woman was still sobbing leaning heavily against a tightlipped man in a bowler sarah wedged herself into her corner as the stage jumped forward again securing her bonnet she frowned at lucius who is that horrible man jake lucius settled back there was nothing he liked better than a good fight particularly when he stayed alive to enjoy it thats jake redman miss i dont mind saying we was lucky he passed this way jake hits what he aims at indeed she wanted to be aloof but she remembered the murderous look in the apaches eyes when hed ridden beside the window i suppose we do owe him our gratitude but he seemed coldblooded about it moren one says hes got ice in his veins along with some apache blood you mean hes indian on his grandmothers side i hear because his bottle was empty lucius settled for a plug of tobacco he tucked it comfortably in his cheek wouldnt want to cross him no maam i sure wouldnt mighty comforting to know hes on your side when things heat up what kind of man killed his own kind with a shiver sarah fell silent again she didnt want to think about it on top of the stage jake kept the team to a steady pace he preferred the freedom and mobility of having a single horse under him the driver held a hand to his wounded shoulder and refused the dubious comfort of the coach we could use you back on the line he told jake thinking about it but he was really thinking about the little lady with the big brown eyes and the honeycolored hair whos the girl the young one in blue conway from philadelphia the driver breathed slow and easy against the pain says shes matt conways daughter that so miss philadelphia conway sure as hell didnt take after her old man but jake remembered that matt bragged about his daughter back east from time to time especially after he started a bottle come to visit her father says shes come to stay jake gave a quick mirthless laugh wont last a week women like that dont shes planning on it with a jerk of his thumb the driver indicated the trunks strapped to the coach most of thats hers with a snort jake adjusted his hat figures sarah caught her first glimpse of lone bluff from the stagecoach window it spread like a jumble of rock at the base of the mountains hard coldlooking mountains she thought with a shudder fooled as the inexperienced always were into thinking they were much closer than they actually were shed forgotten herself enough to crane her head out but she couldnt get another look at jake redman unless she pushed half her body through the opening she really wasnt interested anyway she assured herself unless it was purely for entertainment purposes when she wrote back to lucilla and the sisters she wanted to be able to describe all the local oddities the man was certainly odd hed ridden like a warrior one moment undoubtedly risking his life for a coachful of strangers then the next minute hed dismissed his christian duty and left a poor soul beside a lonely desert road and hed called her stupid never in her life had anyone ever accused sarah conway of being stupid in fact both her intelligence and her breeding were widely admired she was wellread fluent in french and more than passably accomplished on the pianoforte taking the time to retie her bonnet sarah reminded herself that she hardly needed approval from a man like jake redman after she was reunited with her father and took her place in the local society it was doubtful shed ever see him again shed thank him properly of course sarah drew a fresh handkerchief from her reticule and blotted her temples just because he had no manners was no excuse to forget her own she supposed she might even ask her father to offer him some monetary reward pleased with the idea sarah looked out the window again and blinked surely this wasnt lone bluff her father would never have settled in this grimy excuse for a town it was no more than a huddle of buildings and a wide patch of dust that served as a road they passed two saloons side by side a dry goods store and what appeared to be a rooming house slacklegged horses were hitched to posts their tails switching lazily at huge black flies a handful of young boys with dirty faces began to race alongside the coach shouting and firing wooden pistols sarah saw two women in faded gingham walking arm in arm on some wooden planks that served as a sidewalk when the coach stopped she heard jake call out for a doctor passengers were already streaming out through the doors on both sides resigned sarah stepped out and shook out her skirts mr redman the brim of her bonnet provided inadequate shade she was forced to lift her hand over her eyes why have we stopped here end of the line maam a couple of men were already lifting the driver down so he swung himself around to unstrap the cases on top of the coach end of the line but where are we he paused long enough to glance down at her she saw then that his eyes were darker than shed imagined a smoky slate gray welcome to lone bluff letting out a long slow breath she turned sunlight treated the town cruelly it showed all the dirt all the wear and it heightened the pungent smell of horses dear god so this was it the end of the line the end of her line it didnt matter she told herself she wouldnt be living in town and surely before long the gold in her fathers mine would bring more people and progress no it didnt matter at all sarah squared her shoulders the only thing that mattered was seeing her father again she turned around in time to see jake toss one of her trunks down to lucius mr redman please take care of my belongings jake hefted the next case and tossed it to a grinning lucius yes maam biting down on her temper she waited until he jumped down beside her notwithstanding my earlier sentiments im very grateful to you mr redman for coming to our aid you proved yourself to be quite valiant im sure my father will want to repay you for seeing that i arrived safely jake didnt think hed ever heard anyone talk quite so fine since hed spent a week in st louis tipping back his hat he looked at her long enough to make sarah flush forget it forget it sarah thought as he turned his back and walked away if that was the way the man accepted gratitude she certainly would with a sweep of her skirts she moved to the side of the road to wait for her father jake strode into the rooming house with his saddlebag slung over his shoulder it was never particularly clean and it always smelled of onions and strong coffee there were a couple of bullet holes in the wall hed put one of them there personally since the door was propped open flies buzzed merrily in and out of the cramped entrance maggie jake tipped his hat to the woman who stood at the base of the stairs got a room maggie orourke was as tough as one of her fried steaks she had irongray hair pinned back from a face that should have been too skinny for wrinkles but wrinkles there were a maze of them her tiny blue eyes seemed to peek out of the folds of a worn blanket she ran her business with an iron fist a winchester repeater and an eye for a dollar she took one look at jake and successfully hid her pleasure at seeing him well look what the cat dragged in she said the musical brogue of her native country still evident in her thin voice got the law on your tail jake or a woman neither he kicked the door shut with his boot wondering why he always came back here the old woman never gave him a moments peace and her cooking could kill a man you got a room maggie and some hot water you got a dollar she held out her thin hand when jake dropped a coin into it she tested it with the few good teeth she had left it wasnt that she didnt trust jake she did she just didnt trust the united states government might as well take the one you had before no ones in it fine he started up the steps aint had too much excitement since you left couple drifters shot each other over at the bird cage worthless pair the both of them only one dead though sheriff sent the other on his way after the doc patched him up young mary sue brody got herself in trouble with that mitchell boy always said she was a fast thing that mary sue had a right proper wedding though just last month jake kept walking but that didnt stop maggie one of the privileges in running a rooming house was giving and receiving gossip what a shame about old matt conway that stopped him he turned maggie was still at the base of the steps using the edge of her apron to swipe halfheartedly at the dust on the banister what about matt conway got himself killed in that worthless mine of his a cavein buried him the day before yesterday chapter two the heat was murderous a plume of thin yellow dust rose each time a rider passed then hung there to clog the still air sarah longed for a long cool drink and a seat in the shade from the looks of things there wasnt a place in town where a lady could go to find such amenities even if there were she was afraid to leave her trunks on the side of the road and risk missing her father shed been so sure he would be waiting for her but then a man in his position could have been held up by a million things work at the mine a problem with an employee perhaps lastminute preparations for her arrival shed waited twelve years she reminded herself resisting the urge to loosen her collar she could wait a little longer a buckboard passed spewing up more dust so that she was forced to lift a handkerchief to her mouth her dark blue traveling skirt and her neat matching jacket with its fancy black braid were covered with dust with a sigh she glanced down at her blouse which was drooping hopelessly and now seemed more yellow than white it wasnt really vanity the sisters had never given her a chance to develop any she was concerned that her father would see her for the first time when she was travelstained and close to exhaustion shed wanted to look her best for him at this first meeting all she could do now was retie the bow at her chin then brush hopelessly at her skirts she looked a fright but shed make it up to him she would wear her brandnew white muslin gown for dinner tonight the one with thecharming rosebuds embroidered all over the skirt her kid slippers were dyed pink to match hed be proud of her if only hed come she thought and take her away from here jake crossed the street after losing the battle hed waged with himself it wasnt his business and it wasnt his place to tell her but for the past ten minutes hed been watching her standing at the side of the road waiting hed been able to see too clearly the look of hope that sprang into her eyes each time a horse or wagon approached somebody had to tell the woman that her father wasnt going to meet her sarah saw him coming he walked easily despite the guns at his sides as if they had always been there as if they always would be they rode low on his hips shifting with his movements and he kept his eyes on her in a way that she was certain a man shouldnt keep his eyes on a woman unless she was his own when she felt her heart flutter she automatically stiffened her backbone it was lucilla who was always talking about flut tering hearts it was lucilla who painted romantic pictures of lawless men and lawless places sarah preferred a bit more reality in her dreams maam he was surprised that she hadnt already swooned under the power of the afternoon sun maybe she was tougher than she looked but he doubted it mr redman determined to be gracious she allowed her lips to curve ever so slightly at the corners he tucked his thumbs into the pockets of his pants i got some news about your father she smiled fully beautifully so that her whole face lit up with it her eyes turned to gold in the sunlight jake felt the punch like a bullet in the chest oh did he leave word for me thank you for letting me know i might have waited here for hours maam is there a note no he wanted to get this done and done quickly matts dead there was an accident at his mine he was braced for weeping for wild wailing but her eyes filled with fury not tears how dare you how dare you lie to me about something like that she would have brushed past him but jake clamped a hand over her arm sarahs first reaction was simple indignation at being manhandled then she looked up at him really looked and said nothing he was buried two days ago he felt her recoil then go still the fury drained from her eyes even as the color drained from her cheeks dont go fainting on me it was true she could see the truth on his face as clearly as she could see his distaste at being the one to tell her an accident she managed a cavein he was relieved that she wasnt going to faint but he didnt care for the glassy look in her eyes youll want to talk to the sheriff the sheriff she repeated dully his office is across the street she just shook her head and stared at him her eyes were gold jake decided the color of the brandy he sometimes drank at the silver star right now they were huge and full of hurt he watched her bite down on her bottom lip in a gesture he knew meant she was fighting not to let go of the emotions he saw so clearly in her eyes if shed fainted hed happily have left her on the road in the care of whatever woman happened to pass by but she was hanging on and it moved something in him swearing jake shifted his grip from her arm to her elbow and guided her across the street he was damned if he could figure out how hed elected himself responsible sheriff barker was at his desk bent over some paperwork and a cup of sweetened coffee he was balding rapidly every morning he took the time to comb what hair he had left over the spreading bare spot on top of his head he had the beginnings of a paunch brought on by his love of his wifes baking he kept the law in lone bluff but he didnt worry overmuch about the order it wasnt that he was corrupt just lazy he glanced up as jake entered then he sighed and sent tobacco juice streaming into the spittoon in the corner when jake redman was around there was usually work to be done so youre back the wad of tobacco gave barker a permanently swollen jaw thought you might take a fancy to new mexico his brows lifted when jake ushered sarah inside there was enough gentleman left in him to bring him to his feet maam this is matt conways daughter well ill be damned begging your pardon maam i was just fixing to send you a letter sheriff she had to pause a moment to find her balance she would not fall apart not here in front of strangers barker maam he came around the desk to offer her a chair sheriff barker sarah sat praying shed be able to stand again mr redman has just told me that my father she couldnt say it no matter how weak or cowardly it might be she just couldnt say the words yes maam im mighty sorry couple of kids wandered on up by the mine playing games and found him appears he was working the mine when some of the beams gave way when she said nothing barker cleared his throat and opened the top drawer of his desk he had this watch on him and his tobacco hed had his pipe as well but since it had been broken like most of conways bones barker hadnt thought anyone would want it we figured hed want to be buried with his wedding ring on thank you as if in a trance she took the watch and the tobacco pouch from him she remembered the watch the tears almost won when she remembered how hed taken it out to check the time before hed left her in mother superiors lemonysmelling office i want to see where hes buried my trunks will need to be taken out to his house miss conway if you dont mind me offering some advice you dont want to stay way out there its no place for a young lady like you all alone and all my wifell be happy to have you stay with us for a few days until the stage heads east again its kind of you to offer she braced a hand on the chair and managed to stand again but id prefer to spend the night in my fathers house she swallowed and discovered that her throat was hurtfully dry is there do i owe you anything for the burial no maam we take care of our own around here thank you she needed air with the watch clutched in her hand she pushed through the door leaning against a post she tried to catch her breath you ought to take the sheriff up on his offer she turned her head to give jake an even look she could only be grateful that he made her angry enough to help her hold off her grief he hadnt offered a word of sympathy not one well she was glad of it im going to stay in my fathers house will you take me he rubbed a hand over his chin he hadnt shaved in a week ive got things to do ill pay you she said quickly when he started to walk away he stopped and looked back at her she was deter mined all right he wanted to see how determined how much two dollars when he only continued to look at her she said between her teeth five you got five disgusted sarah dug in her reticule there jake looked at the bill in her hand whats that its five dollars not around here it aint around here its paper sarah pushed the bill back into her reticule and pulled out a coin will this do jake took the coin and turned it over in his hand then stuck it in his pocket thatll do fine ill get a wagon miserable man she thought as he strode away she hated him and hated even more the fact that she needed him during the long hot ride in the open wagon she said nothing she no longer cared about the desolation of the landscape the heat or the coldbloodedness of the man beside her her emotions seemed to have shriveled up inside her every mile theyd gone was just another mile behind her jake redman didnt seem to need conversation he drove in silence armed with a rifle across his lap as well as the pistols he carried there hadnt been trouble out here in quite some time but the indian attack had warned him that that could change hed recognized strong wolf in the party that had attacked the stage if the apache brave had decided to raid in the area he would hit the conway place sooner or later they passed no one they saw only sand and rock and a hawk out hunting when he reined the horses in sarah saw nothing but a small adobe house and a few bartered sheds on a patch of thirsty land why are we stopping here jake jumped down from the wagon this is matt conways place dont be ridiculous because it didnt appear that he was going to come around and assist her sarah struggled down herself mr redman i paid you to take me to my fathers home and i expect you to keep the bargain before she could stop him he dumped one of her trunks on the ground what doyou think youre doing delivering your luggage dont you take another piece off that wagon surprising them both sarah grabbed his shirt and pulled him around to face her i insist you take me to my fathers house immediately she wasnt just stupid jake thought she was irritating fine he clipped her around the waist and hauled her over his shoulder at first she was too shocked to move no man had ever touched her before now this this ruffian had his hands all over her and they were alone totally alone sarah began to struggle as he pushed open the door of the hut before she could draw the breath to scream he was dropping her to her feet again that good enough for you she stared at him visions of a hundred calamities that could befall a defenseless woman dancing in her brain she stepped back breathing hard and prayed she could reason with him mr redman i have very little money of my own hardly enough worth stealing something came into his eyes that had her breath stopping altogether he looked more than dangerous now he looked fatal i dont steal the light coming through the low doorway arched around him she moistened her lips are you going to kill me he nearly laughed instead he leaned against the wall something about her was eating at him he didnt know what or why but he didnt like it not one damn bit probably not you want to take a look around she just shook her head they told me he was buried around back near the entrance of the mine ill go check on marts horses and water the team when he left she continued to stare at the empty doorway this was madness did the man expect her to believe her father had lived here like this she had letters dozens of them telling her about the house hed been building the house hed finished the house that would be waiting for her when she was old enough to join him the mine if the mine was near perhaps she could find someone there she could speak with taking a cautious look out the doorway sarah hurried out and rounded the house she passed what might have been the beginnings of a small vegetable garden withered now in the sun there was a shed that served as a stable and an empty paddock made of a few rickety pieces of wood she walked beyond it to where the ground began to rise with the slope of the mountain the entrance to the mine was easily found though it was hardly more than a hole in the rock wall above it was a crudely etched plank of wood sarahs pride she felt the tears then they came in a rush that she had to work hard to hold back there were no workmen here no carts shuttling along filled with rock no picks hacking out gold she saw it for what it was the dream of a man who had had little else her father had never been a successful prospector or an important landowner hed been a man digging in rock and hoping for the big strike she saw the grave then they had buried him only a few yards from the entrance someone had been kind enough to fashion a cross and carve his name on it she knelt and ran her palm along the rubble that covered him hed lied for twelve years hed lied to her telling her stories about rich veins and the mother lode hed spun fantasies about a big house with a parlor and fine wooden floors had he needed to believe it when hed left her hed made her a promise youll have everything your heart desires my sweet sweet sarah everything your mother would have wanted for you he had kept his promise except for one thing one vital thing he hadnt given her himself all those years all shed really wanted had been her father hed lived like this she thought in a mud house in the middle of nowhere so that she could have pretty dresses and new stockings so that she could learn how to serve tea and waltz it must have taken nearly everything hed managed to dig out of the rock to keep her in school back east now he was dead she could barely remember his face and he was dead lost to her oh papa didnt you know how little it mattered lying across the grave she let the tears come until shed wept her heart clean shed been gone a long time too long jake thought he was just about to go after her when he saw her coming over the rise from the direction of the old mine she paused there looking down at the house her father had lived in for more than a decade shed taken off her bonnet and she was holding it by the ribbons for a moment she stood like a statue in the airless afternoon her face marblepale her body slim and elegant her hair was pinned up but a few tendrils had escaped to curl around her face the sun slanted over it so that it glowed richly reminding him of the hide of a young deer jake blew out the last of the smoke from the cigarette hed rolled she was a hell of a sight silhouetted against the bluff she made him ache in places he didnt care to think about then she saw him he could almost see her chin come up as she started down over the rough ground yeah she was a hell of a sight mr redman the grief was there in her redrimmed eyes and her pale cheeks but her voice was strong i apologize for the scene i caused earlier that tied his tongue for a moment the way she said it they might have been talking over tea in some cozy parlor forget it you ready to go back i beg your pardon he jerked his thumb toward the wagon sarah noted that all her trunks were neatly stacked on it again i said are you ready to go back she glanced down at her hands because the palms of her gloves were grimy she tugged them off theyd never be the same she mused nothing would she drew a long steadying breath i thought you understood me im staying in my fathers house dont be a fool a woman like yous got no business out here really her eyes hardened be that as it may im not leaving id appreciate it if youd move my trunks inside she breezed by him you wont last a day she stopped to look over her shoulder jake was forced to admit that hed faced men over the barrel of a gun whod had less determination in their eyes is that your opinion mr redman thats a fact would you care to wager on it look duchess this is hard country even if youre born to it heat snakes mountain lions not to mention apaches i appreciate you pointing all that out mr redman now my luggage damn fool woman he muttered as he strode over to the wagon you want to stay out here hell it dont matter to me he hefted a trunk into the house while sarah stood a few feet back with her hands folded your language mr redman is quite unnecessary he only swore with more skill as he carried in the second trunk nobodys going to be around when it gets dark and you change your mind i wont change my mind but thank you so much for your concern no concern of mine he muttered ignoring her sarcasm he scooped up the rest of her boxes and dumped them inside the doorway hope you got provisions in there as well as fancy dresses i assure you ill be fine she walked to the doorway herself and turned to him perhaps you could tell me where i might get water theres a stream half a mile due east half a mile she thought trying not to show her dismay i see shading her eyes she looked out jake mumbled another oath took her by the shoulders and pointed in the opposite direction that ways east duchess of course she stepped back thank you again mr redman for all your help and good day she added before she closed the door in his face she could hear him swearing at her as he unhitched the horses if she hadnt been so weary she might have been amused she was certainly too exhausted to be shocked by the words he used if she was going to stay she was going to have to become somewhat accustomed to rough manners she peeled off her jacket and she was going to stay if this was all she had left she was going to make the best of it somehow she moved to the rounded opening beside the door that served as a window from there she watched jake ride away hed left her the wagon and stabled the rented horses with her fathers two for all the good it did her sarah thought with a sigh she hadnt the vaguest idea of how to hitch a team much less how to drive one she continued to watch jake until he was nothing but a cloud of dust fading in the distance she was alone truly alone she had no one and little more than nothing no one but herself she thought and if she had only that and a mud hut shed find a way to make the best of it nobody and certainly not jake redman was going to frighten her away turning she unbuttoned her cuffs and rolled up her sleeves the good sisters had always claimed that simple hard work eased the mind and cleansed the soul she was about to put that claim to the test she found the letters an hour later when she came across them in the makeshift loft that served as a bedroom she wiped her grimy hands as best as she could on the embroidered apron shed dug out of one of her trunks hed kept them from the first to the last shed written her father had kept her letters to him the tears threatened again but she willed them back tears would do neither of them any good now but oh it helped more than she could ever have explained that hed kept her letters to know now when she would never see him again that he had thought of her as she had thought of him he must have received the last the letter telling nun she was coming to be with him shortly before his death sarah hadnt mailed it until shed been about to board the train shed told herself it was because she wanted to surprise him but shed also wanted to be certain he wouldnt have time to forbid her to come would you have papa she wondered or would you finally have been willing to share the truth with me had he thought her too weak too fragile to share the life hed chosen was she sighing she looked around four bedrooms and a parlor with the windows facing west she thought with a quiet laugh well according to jake redman the window did indeed face west the house itself was hardly bigger than the room shed shared with lucilla at school it was too small certainly for all shed brought with her from philadelphia but shed managed to drag the trunks into one corner to please herself shed taken out a few of her favorite things one of her wildflower sketches a delicate blue glass perfume bottle a pretty petitpoint pillow and the chinafaced doll her father had sent her for her twelfth birthday they didnt make it home not yet but they helped setting the letters back in the tin box beside the bed she rose she had practical matters to think about now the first was money after paying the five dollars she had only twenty dollars left she hadnt a clue to how long that would keep her but she doubted it would be very long then there was food that was of immediate concern shed found some flour a few cans of beans some lard and a bottle of whiskey pressing a hand to her stomach sarah decided shed have to make do with the beans all she had to do now was to figure out how to start a fire in the batteredlooking stove she found a few twigs in the wood box and a box of matches it took her half an hour a lot of frustration and a few words the sisters would never have approved of before she was forced to admit she was a failure jake redman disgusted she scowled at the handful of charred twigs the least the man could have done was to offer to start a cook fire for her and fetch some water shed already made the trip down to the stream and back once managing to scrounge out half a bucket from its stingy trickle shed eat the beans cold shed prove to jake redman that she could do very well for herself by herself sarah unsheathed her fathers bowie knife shuddered once at the sight of the vicious blade then plunged it into the lid of the can until shed made an opening too hungry to care she sat beside the small stone hearth and devoured the beans shed think of it as an adventure she told herself one she could write about to her friends in philadelphia a better one she decided as she looked around the tiny clean cabin than those in the penny dreadfuls lucilla had gotten from the library and hidden in their room in those the heroine had usually been helpless a victim waiting for the hero to rescue her in any of a dozen dashing manners sarah scooped out more beans well she wasnt helpless and as far as she could tell there wasnt a hero within a thousand miles no one would have called jake redman heroic though hed certainly looked it when hed ridden beside the coach he was insulting and illmannered he had cold eyes and a hot temper hardly sarahs idea of a hero if she had to be rescued and she certainly didnt shed prefer someone smoother a cavalry officer perhaps a man who carried a saber a gentlemans weapon when shed finished the beans she hiccuped wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and leaned back against the hearth only to lose her balance when a stone gave way nursing a bruised elbow she shifted she would have replaced the stone but something caught her eye crouching again she reached into the small opening that was now exposed and slowly pulled out a bag with her lips caught tight between her teeth she poured gold coins into her lap two hundred and thirty dollars sarah pressed both hands to her mouth swallowed then counted again there was no mistake she hadnt known until that moment how much money could mean she could buy decent food fuel whatever she needed to make her way she poured the coins back into the bag and dug into the hole again this time she found the deed to sarahs pride what an odd man he must have been she thought to hide his possessions beneath a stone the last and most precious item she discovered in the hiding place was her fathers journal it delighted her the small brown book filled with her fathers cramped handwriting meant more to sarah than all the gold coins in arizona she hugged it to her as shed wanted to hug her father before she rose with it she replaced the gold and the deed under the stone she would read about one of his days each evening it would be like a gift something that each day would bring her a little closer to this man shed never really known for now she would go back to the stream wash as best she could and gather water for the morning jake watched her come out of the cabin with a pail in one hand and a lantern in the other hed made himself as comfortable as he needed to be among the rocks there had been enough jerky and hardtack in his saddlebag to make a passable supper not what hed planned on exactly but passable hed be damned if he could figure out why hed decided to keep an eye on her the lady wasnt his problem but even as hed been cursing her and steering his horse toward town hed known he couldnt just ride off and leave her there alone maybe it was because he knew what it was to lose everything or because hed been alone himself for more years then he cared to remember or maybe damn her it had something to do with the way shed looked coming down that bluff with her bonnet trailing by the ribbons and tears still drying on her face he hadnt thought he had a weak spot certainly not where women were concerned he shoved himself to his feet he just didnt have anything better to do he stayed well behind her he knew how to move silently over rock through brush in sunlight or in the dark of the moon that was both a matter of survival and a matter of blood in his youth hed spent some years with his grandmothers people and hed learned more than any white man could have learned in a lifetime about tracking without leaving a mark about hunting without making a sound as for the woman she was still wearing that fancy skirt with the bustle and shoes that were made for city sidewalks rather than rough ground twice jake had to stop and wait or even at a crawl hed have caught up with her probably break an ankle before she was through he thought that might be the best thing that could happen to her then hed just cart her on back to town couldnt say hed mind too much picking her up again she felt good maybe too good he had to grin when she shrieked and landed on her fancy bustle because a rabbit darted across her path nope the pretty little duchess from philadelphia wasnt going to last a day with a hand to her heart sarah straggled to her feet shed never seen a rabbit that large in her life with a little sound of distress she noted that shed torn the hem of her skirt how did the women out here manage she wondered as she began to walk again in this heat a corset felt like iron and a fashionable skirt prevented anything but the most delicate walking when she reached the stream she dropped down on a rock and went to work with her buttonhook it was heaven absolute heaven to remove her shoes there was a blister starting on her heel but shed worry about that later right now all she could think about was splashing some cool water on her skin she glanced around cautiously there couldnt be anyone there the sensation of being watched was a natural one she supposed when a woman was alone in the wilderness and the sun was going down she unpinned the cameo at her throat and placed it carefully in her skirt pocket it was the one thing she had that had belonged to her mother humming to keep herself company she unbuttoned her blouse and folded it over a rock with the greatest relief she unfastened her corset and dropped it on top of the blouse she could breathe really breathe for the first time all day hurrying now she stripped down to her chemise then unhooked her stockings glorious she closed her eyes and let out a low sound of pleasure when she stepped into the narrow ankledeep stream the water trickling down from the mountains was cold and clear as ice what the hell did she think she was doing jake let out a low oath and averted his eyes he didnt need this aggravation who would have thought the woman would strip down and play in the water with the night coming on he glanced back to see her bend down to splash her face there was nothing between the two of them but shadows and sunlight water dampened the cotton she wore so that it clung here and there when she bent to scoop up more water the ruffles at the bodice sagged to tease him crouching behind the rock he began to curse himself instead of her his own fault didnt he know minding your own business and only your own was the best way to get by hed just had to be riding along when the apaches had hit the stage hed just had to be the one to tell her about her father hed just had to feel obliged to drive her out here and then to stay what he should be doing was getting good and drunk at carlottas and spending the night in a feather bed wrestling with a woman the kind of woman who knew what a man needed and didnt ask a bunch of fool questions the kind of woman jake thought viciously who didnt expect you to come to tea on sunday he glanced back to see that one of the straps of sarahs chemise had fallen down her arm and that her legs were gleaming and wet her shoulders were pale and smooth and bare too long on the trail jake told himself too damn long when a man started to hanker after skinny city women who didnt know east from west sarah filled the pail as best she could then stepped out of the stream it was getting dark much more quickly than shed expected but she felt almost human again even the thought of the corset made her ribs ache so she ignored it after slipping on her blouse she debated donning her shoes and stockings again there was no one to see or disapprove instead she hitched on her skirt and made a bundle of the rest with the water sloshing in the pail she made her way gingerly along the path she had to fight the urge to hurry with sunset the air was cooling rapidly and there were sounds sounds she didnt recognize or appreciate hoots and howls and rustles stones dug into her bare feet and the lantern spread more shadow than light the half mile back seemed much much longer than it had before again she had the uncomfortable sensation that someone was watching her apaches mountain lions damn jake redman the little adobe dwelling looked like a haven to her now half running she went through the door and bolted it behind her the first coyote sent up a howl to the rising moon sarah shut her eyes if she lived through the night shed swallow her pride and go back to town in the rocks not far away jake bedded down chapter three soon after sunrise sarah awoke stiff and sore and hungry she rolled over wanting to cling to sleep until lucillas maid brought the morning chocolate shed had the most awful dream about some grayeyed man carrying her off to a hot desolate place hed been handsome the way men in dreams were supposed to be but in a rugged almost uncivilized way his skin had been like bronze taut over his face hed had high almost exotic cheekbones and the dark shadow of a beard his hair had been untidy and as black as coal but thick quite thick as it had swept down past his collar shed wondered even in the dream what it would be like to run her hands through it there had been something familiar about him almost as if shed known him in fact when hed forced her to kiss him a name had run through her mind then he hadnt had to force her any longer drowsy sarah smiled she would have to tell lucilla about the dream they would both laugh about it before they dressed for the day lazily she opened her eyes this wasnt the roseandwhite room she used whenever she visited lucilla and her family nor was it the familiar bedroom she had had for years at school her fathers house she thought as everything came back to her this was her fathers house but her father was dead she was alone with an effort she resisted the urge to bury her face in the pillow and weep again she had to decide what to do and in order to decide she had to think clearly for some time last night shed been certain the best thing would be for her to return to town and use the money she had found to book passage east again at best lucillas family would welcome her at worst she could return to the convent but that had been before shed begun reading her fathers journal it had taken only the first two pages the only two shed allowed herself to make her doubt hed begun the journal on the day hed left her to come west the love and the hope hed felt had been in every word and the sadness hed still been raw with grief over the death of sarahs mother for the first time she fully understood how devastated he had been by the loss of the woman theyd both shared so briefly and how inadequate hed felt at finding himself alone with a little girl hed made a promise to his wife on her deathbed that he would see that their daughter was well cared for she remembered the words her father had written on the yellowed paper she was leaving me there was nothing i could do to stop it toward the end there was so much pain i prayed for god to take her quickly my ellen my tiny delicate ellen her thoughts were all for me and our sweet sarah i promised her the only comfort i could give was my promise our daughter would have everything ellen wanted for her proper schooling and church on sunday she would be raised the way my ellen would have raised her like a lady one day shed have a fine house and a father she could be proud of hed come here to try sarah thought as she tossed back the thin blanket and she supposed hed done as well as he could now she had to figure what was best and if she was going to think first she needed to eat after shed dressed in her oldest skirt and blouse she took stock of thecupboard again she could not under any circumstances face another meal of cold beans perhaps he had a storage cellar somewhere a smokehouse anything sarah pushed open the door and blinked in the blinding sunlight at first she thought it was a mirage but mirages didnt carry a scent did they this one smelled of meat roasting and coffee brewing and what she saw was jake redman sitting crosslegged by a fire ringed with stones gathering up her skirt she forgot her hunger long enough to stride over to him what are you doing here he glanced up and gave her the briefest of nods he poured coffee from a small pot into a dented tin cup having breakfast you rode all the way out here to have breakfast she didnt know what it was he was turning on the spit but her stomach was ready for just about anything nope he tested the meat and judged it done never left he jerked his head in the direction of the rocks bedded down over there there sarah eyed the rocks with some amazement whatever for he looked up again the look in his eyes made her hands flutter nervously it made her feel though it was foolish that he knew how she looked stripped down to her chemise lets say it was a long ride back to town i hardly expect you to watch over me mr redman i explained that i could take what is that jake was eating with his fingers and with obvious enjoyment rabbit rabbit sarah wrinkled her nose at the idea but her stomach betrayed her i suppose you trapped it on my property so it was her property already mightve if thats the case the least you could do is offer to share jake obligingly pulled off a hunk of meat help yourself dont you have any never mind when in rome sarah decided taking the meat and the coffee he offered she sat down on a rock get yourself some supper last night yes thank you never never in her life had she tasted anything better than this roast rabbit in the al readysweltering morning youre an excellent cook mr redman i get by he offered her another hunk this time she didnt hesitate no really she caught herself talking with her mouth full and she didnt care this is delightful because she doubted that his saddlebags held any linens she licked her fingers better than a can of cold beans anyway she glanced up sharply but he wasnt even looking at her i suppose shed never had breakfast with a man before and she decided it would be proper to engage in light conversation tell me mr redman what is your profession never gave it much thought but surely you must have some line of work nope he leaned back against a rock and taking out his pouch of tobacco proceeded to roll a cigarette she looked as fresh and neat as a daisy he thought youd have thought shed spent the night in some highpriced hotel instead of a mud hut apparently making conversation over a breakfast of roasted rabbit took some skill patiently she smoothed her skirts and tried again have you lived in arizona long why i the cool flat look he sent her had her fumbling simple curiosity i dont know about back in philadelphia jake took out a match scraped it on the rock and twisted the end of his cigarette studying her while but around here people dont take kindly to questions i see her back had stiffened shed never encountered anyone to whom rudeness came so easily in a civilized society a casual question is merely a way to begin a conversation around here its a way to start a fight he drew on the cigarette you want to fight with me duchess ill thank you to stop referring to me by that name he grinned at her again but lazily the brim of his hat shadowing his eyes you look like one especially when youre riled her chin came up she couldnt help it but she answered him in calm even tones i assure you im not at all riled although you have on several occasions already been rude and difficult and annoying where i come from mr redman a woman is entitled to a bit more charm and gallantry from a man that so her mouth dropped open when he slowly drew out his gun dont move move she couldnt even breathe shed only called him rude and sweet mary he was going to shoot her mr redman i dont the bullet exploded against the rock a few inches away from her with a shriek she tumbled into the dirt when she found the courage to look up jake was standing and lifting something dead and hideous from the rock rattler he said easily when she moaned and started to cover her eyes he reached down and hauled her to her feet id take a good look he suggested still holding the snake in front of her if you stay around here youre going to see plenty more it was the disdain in his voice that had her fighting off the swoon with what little voice she had left she asked would you kindly dispose of that with a muttered curse he tossed it aside then began to smother the fire sarah felt her breakfast rising uneasily and waited for it to settle it appears you saved my life yeah well dont let it get around i wont i assure you she drew herself up straight hiding her trembling hands in the folds of her skirts i appreciate the meal mr redman now if youll excuse me i have a number of things to do you can start by getting yourself into the wagon ill drive you back to town i appreciate the offer as a matter of fact i would be grateful i need some supplies look theres got to be enough sense in that head of yours for you to see you dont belong out here its a twohour drive into town theres nothing out here but rattlers and coyotes she was afraid he was right the night shed spent in the cabin had been the loneliest and most miserable of her life but somewhere between the rabbit and the snake shed made up her mind matt conways daughter wasnt going to let all his efforts and his dreams turn to dust she was staying lord help her my father lived here this place was obviously important to him i intend to stay she doubted jake redman had enough heart to understand her now if youd be good enough to hitch up the wagon ill go change change what why my dress of course i can hardly go into town like this he cast a glance over her she already looked dolledup enough for a church social in her crisp white blouse and gingham skirt hed never known gingham to look quite so good on a woman before lone bluff aint philadelphia it aint anyplace you want the wagon hitched ill oblige you but youd better watch how its done because theres not going to be anyone around to do it for you next time with that he slung his saddlebags over his shoulder and walked away very well she thought after one last deep breath he was quite right it was time she learned how to do things for herself the sooner she learned the sooner shed have no more need of him with her head held high she followed him she watched him guide the team out it seemed easy enough you simply hooked this and tied that and the deed was done men she thought with a little smile they always exaggerated the most basic chores thank you mr redman if youll wait just a moment ill be ready to go didnt the woman know anything jake tipped his hat forward hed driven her out of town yesterday if he drove her back this morning her reputation would be ruined even lone bluff had its standards since shed decided to stay at least temporarily shed need all the support she could get from the town women i got business of my own maam but he was already moving off to saddle his own horse setting her teeth sarah stamped inside she added another twenty dollars to what she carried in her reticule as an afterthought she took down the rifle her father had left on the wall she hadnt the least idea how to use it was certain she wouldnt be able to in even the most dire circumstances but she felt better having it jake was mounted and waiting when she came out the road will lead you straight into town he told her as she fastened her bonnet if you give lucius a dollar hell drive back out with you then take the wagon and team back to the livery matts got two horses of his own in the stables someone from towns been keeping an eye on them a dollar as if it were spun glass she set the rifle in the wagon you charged me five he grinned at her im not lucius with a tip of his hat he rode off it didnt take her long to climb up into the wagon but she had to gather her courage before she touched the reins though she considered herself an excellent horsewoman shed never driven a team before youve ridden behind them she reminded herself as she picked up the reins how difficult can it be she took the horses or they took her in a circle three times before she managed to head them toward the road jake sat on his horse and watched her from a ridge it was the best laugh hed had in months by the time she reached lone bluff sarah was sweating profusely her hands felt raw and cramped and her lower back was on fire in front of the dry goods store she climbed down on legs that felt like water after smoothing her skirts and patting her forehead dry she spotted a young boy whittling a stick young man do you know a man named lucius everybody knows old lucius satisfied sarah drew a coin out of her bag if you can find lucius and tell him miss sarah conway wishes to see him you can have this penny the boy eyed it thinking of peppermint sticks yes maam he was off at a run at least children seemed about the same east or west sarah entered the store there were several customers milling around looking over the stock and gossiping they all stopped to stare at sarah before going back to their business the young woman behind the counter came around to greet her good morning may i help you yes im sarah conway i know when the pretty brunette smiled dimples flashed in her cheeks she was already envying sarah her bonnet you arrived on the stage yesterday im very sorry about your father everyone liked matt thank you sarah found herself smiling back im going to need a number of supplies are you really going to stay out there at matts place alone yes at least for now id be scared to death the brunette gave her an appraising look then offered a hand im liza cody no relation i beg your pardon to buffalo bill most people ask welcome to lone bluff thank you with lizas help sarah began to gather supplies and introductions within twenty minutes shed nodded to half the women in lone bluff been given a recipe for biscuits and been asked her opinion of the calico fabric just arrived from st joe her spirits rose dramatically perhaps the women dressed less fashionably than thencounterparts in the east but they made her feel welcome maam sarah turned to see lucius hat in hand beside him the young boy was nearly dancing in anticipation of the penny the moment it was in his hand he raced to the jars of hard candy and began to negotiate mr just lucius maam lucius i was told you might be willing to drive my supplies back for me then return the wagon and team to the livery he pushed his chaw into his cheek and considered well now maybe i would id be willing to give you a dollar for your trouble he grinned showing a few yellowed and several missing teeth glad to help miss conway perhaps youd begin by loading my supplies leaving him to it sarah turned back to liza miss cody liza please liza i wonder if you might have any tea and i would dearly love some fresh eggs dont get much call for tea but weve got some in the back liza opened the door to the rear storeroom three fatbellied puppies ran out john cody you little monster i told you to keep these pups outside laughing sarah crouched down to greet them oh theyre adorable ones adorable maybe liza muttered as usual her young brother was nowhere in sight when she needed him threes unmanageable just last night they chewed through a sack of meal pop finds out hell take a strap to johnny a brown mutt with a black circle around his left eye jumped into sarahs lap and captured her heart youre a charmer arent you she laughed as he bathed her face a nuisance is more like it will you sell one sell liza stretched to reach the tea on a high shelf my popd pay you to take one really with the brown pup cradled in her arms sarah stood again id love to have one i could use the company liza added the tea and eggs to sarahs total you want that one you take it right along she grinned when the pup licked sarahs face again he certainly seems taken with you ill take very good care of him balancing the dog she took out the money to pay her bill thank you for everything liza counted out the coins before she placed them in the cash drawer and took out sarahs change pop would be pleased she thought not only because of the pup but because miss conway was a cash customer liza was pleased because sarah was young and pretty and would surely know everything there was to know about the latest fashions its been nice meeting you miss conway sarah liza smiled again and walked with sarah to the door maybe ill ride out and see you if you dont mind id love it any time at all abruptly liza lifted a hand to pat her hair good morning mr carlson liza youre looking pretty as ever she blushed and fluttered though carlsons eyes were on sarah samuel carlson this is sarah conway delighted carlsons smile made his pale handsome face even more attractive it deepened the alreadybrilliant blue of his eyes when he lifted sarahs hand to his lips in a smooth cavalier gesture she was doubly glad shed come into town apparently lone bluff had some gentlemen after all samuel carlson was slim and well dressed in a beautiful black riding coat and a spotless white shirt his trim mustache was the same rich brown as his wellgroomed hair he had as a gentleman swept off his hat at the introduction it was a ularly fine hat sarah thought black like his coat with a silver chain for a band my deepest sympathies for your loss miss conway your father was a fine man and a good friend thank you its been comforting for me to learn he was well thought of the daughter was certainly a pretty addition to a dust hole like lone bluff he thought word around town is that youll be staying with us for a while he reached over to scratch the puppys ears and was rewarded with a low growl hush now sarah smiled an apology yes ive decided to stay at least for the time being i hope youll let me know if theres anything i can do to help he smiled again undoubtedly life here isnt what youre used to the way he said it made it clear that it was a compliment mr carlson was obviously a man of the world and of some means thank you she handed the puppy to lucius and was gratified when carlson assisted her into the wagon it was a pleasure to meet you mr carlson the pleasure was mine miss conway goodbye liza i hope youll come and visit soon sarah settled the puppy on her lap she considered it just her bad luck that she glanced across the street at that moment jake was there one hand hooked in his pocket leaning against a post watching with an icy nod she acknowledged him then stared straight ahead as lucius clucked to the horses when the wagon pulled away the men studied each other there was no nod of acknowledgment they simply watched cool and cautious across the dusty road sarah felt positively triumphant as she stored her supplies the puppy circled her legs apparently every bit as pleased as she with the arrangement her nights wouldnt be nearly so lonely now with the dog for company shed met people was perhaps even on the way to making friends her cupboard was full and lucius had been kind enough to show her how to fire up the old cookstove tonight after supper she was going to write to lucilla and mother superior she would read another page or two from her fathers journal before she curled up under the freshly aired blanket jake redman be damned she thought as she bent to tickle the pups belly she was making it with a glass of whiskey at his fingertips jake watched carlotta work the room she sure was something her hair was the color of gold nuggets plucked from a riverbed and her lips were as red as the velvet drapes that hung in her private room she was wearing red tonight something tight that glittered as it covered her long curvy body and clung to her smooth white breasts her shoulders were bare jake had always thought that a womans shoulders were enough to drive a man to distraction he thought of sarah standing ankledeep in a stream with water glistening on her skin he took another gulp of whiskey carlottas girls were dressed to kill as well the men in the silver star were getting their moneys worth the piano rang out and the whiskey and the laughter poured the way he figured it carlotta ran one of the best houses in arizona maybe one of the best west of the mississippi the whiskey wasnt watered much and the girls werent bad a man could almost believe they enjoyed their work as for carlotta jake figured she enjoyed it just fine money came first with her he knew because shed once had enough to drink to tell him that she took a healthy cut of all her girls pay if the man one of her girls was with decided to slip her a little extra that was just fine with carlotta she took a cut of that as well she had dreams of moving her business to san francisco and buying a place with crystal chandeliers gilt mirrors and red carpets carlotta favored red but for now like the rest of them carlotta was stuck in lone bluff tipping back more whiskey jake watched her she moved like a queen her full red lips always smiling her cool blue eyes always watching she was making sure her girls were persuading the men to buy them plenty of drinks what the bartender served the working girls was hardly more than colored water but the men paid and paid happily before they moved along to one of the narrow rooms upstairs hell of a business jake thought as he helped himself to one of the cigars carlotta provided for her paying customers she had them shipped all the way from cuba and they had a fine rich taste jake had no doubt she added to the price of her whiskey and her girls to pay for them business was business one of the girls sidled over to light the cigar for him he just shook his head at the invitation she was warm and ripe and smelled like a bouquet of roses for the life of him he couldnt figure out why he wasnt interested youre going to hurt the girls feelings perfume trailing behind her carlotta joined jake at the table dont you see anything you like he tipped his chair back against the wall see plenty i like she laughed and lifted a hand in a subtle signal you going to buy me a drink jake before he could answer one of the girls was bringing over a new bottle and a glass no watereddown liquor for carlotta havent seen you around in a while havent been around carlotta took a drink and let it sweep through her system shed take liquor over a man any day going to stay around might heard there was a little trouble on the stage yesterday its not like you to do good deeds jake she drank again and smiled at him in a movement as smooth as the liquor she drank she dropped a hand to his thigh thats what i like about you just happened to be there also heard matt conways daughters in town smiling she took the cigar from him and took a puff you working for her why word around is that you drove her on out to his place she slowly blew out a stream of smoke from between her painted lips cant see you digging in rock for gold jake when its easier just to take it far as i remember there was never enough gold in that rock to dig for he took the cigar back and clamped it between his teeth you know different i only know what i hear and i dont hear much about conway she poured a second drink and downed it she didnt want to talk about matt conways mine or about what she knew something in the air tonight she decided made her restless maybe she needed more than whiskey after all glad youre back jake things have been too quiet around here two men hankering after the same girl started to scuffle carlottas tall black servant tossed them both out she just smiled and poured a third drink if youre not interested in any of my girls we could make other arrangements she lifted the small glass in a salute before she knocked it back for old times sake jake looked at her her eyes glittered against her white skin her lips were parted above the flaming red of her dress her breasts rose and fell invitingly he knew what she could do to a man with a man when the mood was on her it baffled and infuriated him that she didnt stir him in the least maybe some other time he rose and after dropping a few coins on the table strolled out carlottas eyes hardened as she watched him she only offered herself to a privileged few and she didnt like to be rejected with the puppy snoozing at her feet sarah closed her fathers journal hed written about an indian attack on the wagon train and his own narrow escape in simple often stark terms hed written of the slaughter the terror and the waste yet even after that hed gone on because hed wanted to make something of himself for her shivering a bit despite her shawl she rose to replace the book beneath the stone if she had read those words while still in philadelphia she would have thought them an exaggeration she was coming to know better with a half sigh she looked down at her hands they were smooth and well tended they were she was afraid woefully inadequate to the task of carving out a life here it was only the night that made her feel that way sarah told herself as she moved to check the bolt on the door shed done all she could that day and it had been enough shed driven to town alone stocked the cabin and replanted the vegetable garden her back ached enough to tell her shed put in a full day tomorrow shed start again the lonely howl of a coyote made her heart thud gathering the puppy to her breast she climbed up for bed she was in her night shift when the dog started to bark and growl exasperated she managed to grab him before he could leap from the loft youll break your neck when he strained against her hold and continued to yelp she took him in her arms all right all right if you have to go out ill let you out but you might have let me know before i went to bed nuzzling him she climbed down from the loft again she saw the fire through the window and ran to the door oh my god the moment she yanked it open the puppy ran out barking furiously with her hands to her cheeks sarah watched the fire rise up and eat at the old dry wood of the shed a scream eerily like a womans pierced the night her fathers horses following instinct alone she ran the horses were already wildeyed stamping and screaming in their stalls muttering a prayer sarah dragged the first one out and slapped its flank the fire was moving fast racing up the walls and onto the roof the hay had already caught and was burning wildly eyes stinging from the smoke she groped her way to the second stall coughing swearing she fought the terrified horse as it reared and shoved against her then she screamed herself when a flaming plank fell behind her fire licked closer and closer to the hem of her shift whipping off her shawl she tossed it over the horses eyes and dragged them both out of the shed blinded by smoke she crawled to safety behind her she could hear the walls collapse could hear the roar of flames consuming wood gone it was gone she wanted to beat her fists in the dirt and weep it could spread the terror of that had her pushing up onto her hands and knees somehow she had to prevent the fire from spreading she caught the sound of a horse running hard and had nearly gained her feet when something slammed into her chapter four the night was clear with a sharpedged halfmoon and white pinpoint stars jake rode easily arguing with himself it was stupid just plain stupid for him to be heading out when he could be snuggled up against carlotta right this minute except carlotta didnt snuggle what she did was more like devouring with her sex was fast and hot and uncomplicated after all business was business at least he knew what carlotta was and what to expect from her she used men like poker chips that was fine with jake carlotta wouldnt expect posies or boxes of chocolates or sunday calls sarah conway was a whole different matter a woman like that wanted a man to come courting wearing a stiff collar and probably a tie he snorted and kicked his mount into a trot youd have to see that your boots were shined so you could sit around making fancy talk with her sex would be he swore viciously and the mustang pricked up his ears you didnt have sex with a woman like that you didnt even think about it and even if you did well he just wasnt interested so what the hell was he doing riding out to her place in the middle of the night stupid he muttered to his horse overhead a nighthawk dived and killed with hardly a sound life was survival and survival meant ruthessness jake understood that accepted it but sarah he shook his head survival to her was making sure her ribbons matched her dress the best thing he could do was to turn around now and head back to town maybe ride right on through town and go down to tombstone for a spell he could pick up a job there if he had a mind to better yet he could travel up to the mountains where the air was cool and smelled of pine there wasnt anything or anyone holding him in lone bluff he was a free agent and that was the way he intended to stay but he didnt turn his horse around when he got back from the mountains he mused if he got back miss sarah conway with her big brown eyes and her white shoulders would be long gone just plain stubbornness was keeping her here now anyway even stubbornness had to give way sometime if she was gone maybe hed stop having this feeling that he was about to make a big mistake as far as he could see the biggest mistakes men made were over three things money whiskey and women none of the three had ever meant enough to him to worry or fight over he didnt plan on changing that even if this woman was different somehow that was what bothered him the most hed always been able to figure people it had helped keep him alive all these years he couldnt figure sarah conway or what it was about her that made him want to see that she was safe maybe he was getting soft but he didnt like to think so he couldnt help feeling for her some traveling all this way just to find out her father was dead and he had to admire the way she was sticking it out staying at the old mine it was stupid he mused but you had to admire it with a shrug he kept riding he was nearly to the conway place anyway he might as well take a look and make sure she hadnt shot her foot off with her daddys rifle he smelled the fire before he saw it his head came up like a wolfs when it scents an enemy in a similar move the mustang reared and showed the whites of his eyes when he caught the first flicker of flame he kicked the horse into a run what had the damn fool woman done now there had only been a few times in his life when he had experienced true fear he didnt care for the taste of it and he tasted it now as his mind conjured up the image of sarah trapped inside the burning house the oil shed undoubtedly spilled spreading the fire hot and fast another image came back to him an old one an image of fire and weeping and gunplay hed known fear then too fear and hate and an anguish hed sworn hed never feel again there was some small relief when he saw that it was the shed burning and not the house the heat from it roared out as the last of the roof collapsed he slowed his horse when he spotted two riders heading up into the rocks his gun was already drawn his blood already cold before he saw sarah lying on the ground his horse was still moving when he slid from the saddle and ran to her her face was as pale as the moon and she smelled of smoke as he knelt beside her a small brown dog began to snarl at him jake brushed it aside when it nipped him if you were going to do any guarding youre too late his mouth set in a grim line he pressed a hand to her heart something moved in him when he felt its slow beat gently he lifted her head and felt the blood warm on his fingers he looked up at the rocks again his eyes narrowed and icy as carefully as he could he picked her up and carried her inside there was no place to lay her comfortably but the cot the puppy began to whine and jump at the ladder after jake carried her up jake shushed him again and grateful that sarah had at least had the sense to bring in fresh water prepared to dress her wound dazed and aching sarah felt something cool on her head for a moment she thought it was sister angelina the softvoiced nun who had nursed her through a fever when she had been twelve though she hurt hurt all over it was comforting to be there safe in her own bed knowing that someone was there to take care of her and make things right again sister would some times sing to her and would always when she needed it hold her hand moaning a little sarah groped for sister angelinas hand the one that closed over hers was as hard as iron confused fooled for a minute into thinking her father had come back for her sarah opened her eyes at first everything was vague and wavering as though she were looking through water slowly she focused on a face she remembered the face with its sharp lines and its taut bronzed skin a lawless face shed dreamed of it hadnt she unsure she lifted a hand to it it was rough unshaven and warm gray eyes she thought dizzily gray eyes and a gray hat yes shed dreamed of him she managed a whisper dont dont kiss me the face smiled it was such a quick flashing and appealing smile that she almost wanted to return it i guess i can control myself drink this he lifted the cup to her lips and she took a first greedy sip whiskey shot through her system thats horrible i dont want it put some color back in your cheeks but he set the cup aside i just want to but the whiskey had shocked her brain enough to clear it jake had to hold her down to keep her from scrambling out of bed her shift tangled around her knees and drooped over one shoulder hold on you stand up now youre going to fall on that pretty face of yours fire she coughed gasping from fee pain in her throat to balance herself she grabbed him then dropped her head weakly on his chest theres a fire i know relief and pleasure surged through him as he stroked her hair her cheek was nestled against his heart as if it belonged there its pretty well done now it might spread ive got to stop it its not going to spread he eased her back with a gentleness that would have surprised her if shed been aware of it nothing to feed it no wind to carry it you lost the shed thats all i got the horses out she murmured her head was whirling and throbbing but his voice his voice and the stroke of his hands soothed her everywhere comforted she let her eyes close i wasnt sure i could you did fine because he wanted to say more and didnt know how he passed the cloth over her face youd better rest now dont go she reached for his hand again and brought it to her cheek please dont go im not going anywhere he brushed the hair away from her face while he fought his own demons go on to sleep he needed her to if she opened her eyes and looked at him again if she touched him again he was going to lose the puppy was barking i thought he needed to go out so i she came to herself abruptly he could see it in the way her eyes flew open mr redman what are you doing here here she repeated scandalized as she glanced around the loft im not dressed he dropped the cloth back in the bowl its been a trial not to notice she was coming back all right he thought as he watched her eyes fire up it was a pleasure to watch it with some regret he picked up the blanket and tossed it over her feel better mr redman her voice was stiff with embarrassment i dont entertain gentlemen in my private quarters he picked up the cup of whiskey and took a drink himself now that she seemed back to normal it hit him how scared hed been bonescared aint much entertaining about dressing a head wound sarah pushed herself up on her elbows and the room reeled with a moan she lifted her fingers to the back of her neck i must have hit my head must have he thought of the riders but said nothing since i picked you up off the ground and carted you all the way up here dont you figure im entitled to know what happened tonight i dont really know with a long sigh she leaned back against the pillow shed purchased only that morning he was entitled to the story she supposed in any case she wanted to tell someone id already retired for the night when the puppy began to bark he seemed determined to get out so i climbed down i saw the fire i dont know how it could have started it was still light when i fed the stock so i never even had a lamp over there jake had his own ideas but he bided his time sarah lifted a hand to her throbbing head and allowed herself the luxury of closing her eyes i ran over to get the horses out the place was going up so fast ive never seen anything like it the roof was coming down and the horses were terrified they wouldnt come out id read somewhere that horses are so frightened by fire they just panic and burn alive i couldnt have stood that so you went in after them they were screaming her brows drew together as she remembered it sounded like women screaming it was horrible yeah i know he remembered another barn another fire when the horses hadnt been so lucky i remember falling when i got out the last time i think i was choking on the smoke i started to get up i dont know what i was going to do then something hit me i guess one of the horses perhaps or perhaps i simply fell again she opened her eyes and studied him he was sitting on her bed his hair disheveled and his eyes dark and intense beautiful she thought then she wondered if she was delirious then you were here why are you here riding by this way saw the fire he looked into the cup of whiskey if he was going to sit here much longer watching what the lamplight did to her skin he was going to need more than a cupful i also saw two riders heading away away righteous indignation had her sitting up again despite the headache you mean someone was here and didnt try to help jake gave her a long even look she looked so fragile like something you put behind glass in a parlor fragile or not she had to know what she was up against i figure they werent here to help he watched as the realization seeped in there was a flicker of fear that was what hed expected what he hadnt counted on and was forced to admire was the passion in her eyes they came on my land burned down my shed why shed forgotten that she was wearing no more than a shift forgotten that it was past midnight and that she was alone with a man she sat up and the blanket dropped to pool at her waist her small round breasts rose and fell with her temper her hair was loose hed never seen it that way before until that moment he hadnt taken the time or the trouble to really look a mans hands could get lost in hair like that the thought ran through his mind and was immediately banished it glowed warm in the lamplight sliding over her right shoulder and streaming down her back anger had brought the color back to her face and the golden glow back to her eyes he finished off the whiskey reminding himself that hed do well to keep his mind on the business at hand seems logical to figure they wanted to give you some trouble maybe make you think twice about keeping this place that doesnt make any sense she leaned forward jake shifted uncomfortably when her thin lawn gown gapped at the throat why should anyone care about an adobe house and a few sagging sheds jake set the cup down again you forgot the mine some peoplell do a lot more than set a fire for gold with a sound of disgust sarah propped her elbows on her knees gold do you think my father would have lived like this if thered been any significant amount of gold if you believe that why are you staying the brooding look left her eyes as she glanced back at him i dont expect you to understand this is all i have all i have left of my father is this place and a gold watch she took the watch from the tilting table beside the bed and closed her hand around it i intend to keep whats mine if someones played a nasty joke jake interrupted her mightve been a joke its more likely somebody thinks this place is worth more than you say trying to burn horses alive and hitting women isnt considered much of a joke even out here she lifted a hand to the wound on her head he was saying someone had struck her and he was right she acknowledged with a quick shudder he was undoubtedly right no ones going to scare me off my land tomorrow ill report this incident to the sheriff and ill find a way to protect my property just what way is that i dont know she tightened her grip on the watch the look in her eyes said everything but ill find it maybe she would he thought and maybe since he didnt care much for people setting fires hed help her someone might be offering to buy this place from you jake murmured thinking ahead im not selling and im not running if and when i return to philadelphia it will be because ive decided thats what i want to do not because ive been frightened away that was an attitude he could respect fair enough since it appears youre going to have your hands full tomorrow youd best get some sleep yes sleep how could she possibly close her eyes what if they came back if its all the same to you ill bunk down outside her eyes lifted to his and held them the quiet understanding in them made her want to rest her head on his shoulder hed take care of her she had only to ask but she couldnt ask of course youre welcome to mr redman she remembered belatedly to drag the blanket up to her shoulders im in your debt again it seems youve come to my aid a number of times in a very short acquaintance i didnt have to go out of my way much he started to rise then thought better of it i got a question for you because she was feeling awkward again she offered him a small polite smile yes whyd you ask me not to kiss you her fingers tightened on the blanket i beg your pardon when you were coming to you took a good long look at me and then you told me not to kiss you she could feel the heat rising to her cheeks dignity she told herself even under circumstances like these a woman must keep her dignity apparently i wasnt in my right senses he thought that through and then unnerved her by smiling for his own satisfaction he reached out to touch the ends of her hair a man could take that two ways she sputtered the lamplight shifted across his face light then shadow it made him look mysterious exciting forbidden sarah found it almost as difficult to breathe as she did when her stays were too tight mr redman i assure you it made me think he was close now so close that she could feel his breath flutter over her lips they parted seemingly of their own volition he took the time a heartbeat two to flick his gaze down to them maybe youve been wondering about me kissing you certainly not but her denial lacked the ring of truth they both knew it ill have to give it some thought myself the trouble was hed been giving it too much thought already the way she looked right now with her hair loose around her shoulders and her eyes dark just a little scared made him not want to think at all he knew that if he touched her head wound or not hed climb right in the bed with her and take whatever he wanted he was going to kiss her her head swam with the idea he had only to lean closer and his mouth would be on hers hard somehow she knew it would be hard firm masterful he could take her in his arms right now and there would be nothing she could do about it maybe there was nothing she wanted to do about it then he was standing for the first time she noticed that he had to stoop so that his head didnt brush the roof his body blocked the light her heart was thudding so hard that she was certain he must hear it for the life of her she couldnt be sure if it was fear or excitement slowly he leaned over and blew out the lamp in the dark he moved down from the loft and out into the night shivering sarah huddled under the blanket the man was she didnt have words to describe him the only thing she was certain of was that she wouldnt sleep a wink she went out like a light when sarah woke her head felt as though it had been split open and filled with a drumandbugle corps moaning she sat on the edge of the cot and cradled her aching head in her hands she wished she could believe it had all been a nightmare but the pounding at the base of her skull and the rustcolored water in the bowl said differently gingerly she began to dress the best she could do for herself at the moment was to see how bad the damage was and pray the horses came back she doubted she could afford two more on her meager budget in deference to her throbbing head she tied her hair back loosely with a ribbon even the thought of hairpins made her grimace the power of the sun had her gasping small red dots danced in front of her eyes and her vision wa vered and dimmed she leaned against the door gathering her strength before she stepped out the shed was gone in its place was rubble a mass of black charred wood determined sarah crossed over to it she could still smell the smoke if she closed her eyes she could hear the terrifying sound of fire crackling over dry wood and the heat shed never forget the heat the intensity of it the meanness of it it hadnt been much of a structure but it had been hers in a civilized society a vandal was made to pay for the destruction of property arizona territory or philadelphia she meant to see that justice was done here but for now she was alone alone she stood in the yard and listened never before had she heard such quiet there was a trace of wind hot and silent it lacked the strength to rustle the scrub that pushed its way through the rocks the only sound she heard was the quick breathing of the puppy who was sitting on the ground at her feet the horses had run off so sarah thought as she turned in a circle had jake redman it was better that way she decided because she remembered all too clearly the way she had felt when he had sat on the cot in the shadowy lamplight and touched her hair foolish it was hateful to admit it but shed felt foolish and weak and worst of all willing there was no use being ashamed of it but she considered herself too smart to allow it to happen again a man like jake redman wasnt the type a woman could flirt harmlessly with perhaps she didnt have a wide and worldly experience with men but she recognized a dangerous one when she saw him there were some she had no doubt who would be drawn to his kind a man who killed without remorse or regret who came and went as he pleased but not her when she decided to give her heart to a man it would be to one she understood and respected with a sigh she bent down to soothe the puppy who was whimpering at her feet there was a comfort in the way he nuzzled his face against hers when she fell in love and married sarah thought it would be to a man of dignity and breeding a man who would cherish her who would protect her not with guns and fists but with honor they would be devoted to each other and to the family they made between them he would be educated and strong respected in the community those were the qualities shed been taught a woman looked for in a husband sarah stroked the puppys head and wished she could conquer this strange feeling that what shed been taught wasnt necessarily true what did it matter now as things stood she had too much to do to think about romance she had to find a way to rebuild the shed then shed have to bargain for a new wagon and team she stirred some of the charred wood with the toe of her shoe she was about to give in to the urge to kick it when she heard horses approaching panic came first and had her spinning around a cry for help on her lips the sunbaked dirt and empty rocks mocked her the lord helped those who help themselves she remembered and raced into the house with the puppy scrambling behind her when she came out again her knees were trembling but she was carrying her fathers rifle in both hands jake took one look at her framed in the doorway her eyes mirroring fear and fury it came to him with a kind of dull painful surprise that she was the kind of woman a man would die for he slid from his horse id be obliged maam if youd point that someplace else oh she nearly sagged with relief mr redman i thought youd gone he merely inclined his head and took another meaningful look at the rifle oh she said again and lowered it she felt foolish not because of the gun but because when shed looked out and seen him all her thoughts about what she wanted and didnt want had shifted ground there he was looking dark and reckless with guns gleaming at his hip and there she was fighting back a driving instinct to run into his arms you found the horses he took his time tying the team to a post before he approached her they hadnt gone far he took the rifle from her and leaned it against the house the stock was damp from her nervous hands but hed seen more than nerves in her eyes and he wondered im very grateful because she felt awkward she leaned down to gather the yapping puppy in her arms jake still hadnt shaved and she remembered how his face had felt against the palm of her hand fighting a blush she curled her fingers im afraid i dont know what to do with them until i have shelter again what was going on in that mind of hers jake wondered a leanto would do well enough for the time being just need to rig one over a corner of the paddock a leanto yes it was a relief to deal with something practical her mindwent to work quickly mr redman have you had breakfast he tipped his hat back on his head not to speak of if you could fashion a temporary shelter for the horses id be more than glad to fix you a meal hed meant to do it anyway but if she wanted to bargain hed bargain can you cook naturally preparing meals was a very important part of my education he wanted to touch her hair again and more instead he hooked his thumb in his pocket i aint worried about you preparing a meal can you cook she tried not to sigh yes all right then when he walked away and didnt remount his horse sarah supposed a deal had been struck mr redman he stopped to look over his shoulder how do you prefer your eggs hot he told her then continued on his way shed give him hot sarah decided rattling pans shed give him the best damn breakfast hed ever eaten she took a long breath and forced herself to be calm his way of talking was beginning to rub off on her that would never do biscuits delighted that shed been given a brandnew recipe only the day before she went to work thirty minutes later jake came in to stand in the doorway the scents amazed him hed expected to find the frying pan smoking with burnt eggs instead he saw a bowl of fresh goldentopped biscuits wrapped in a clean bandanna sarah was busy at the stove humming to herself the pup was nosing into corners looking for trouble jake had never thought much about a home for himself but if he had it would have been like this a woman in a pretty dress humming by the stove the smells of good cooking rising in the air a man could do almost anything if the right woman was waiting for him then she turned one look at her face the elegance of it was a reminder that a man like him didnt have a woman like her waiting for him just in time she smiled pleased with herself conquering the cookstove was her biggest accomplishment to date theres fresh water in the bowl so you can wash up she began to scoop eggs onto an ironstone plate im afraid i dont have a great deal to offer im thinking of getting some chickens of my own we had them at school so i know a bit about them fresh eggs are such a comfort dont you think he lifted his head from the bowl and water dripped down from his face her cheeks were flushed from cooking and her sleeves were rolled up past her elbows revealing slender milkwhite arms comfort was the last thing on his mind without speaking he took his seat sarah wasnt sure when he made her more nervous when he spoke to her or when he lapsed into those long silences and just looked gamely she tried again mrs cobb gave me the recipe for these biscuits yesterday i hope theyre as good as she claimed jake broke one and the steam and fragrance poured out watching her he bit into it theyre fine please mr redman all this flattery will turn my head she scooped up a forkful of eggs i was introduced to several ladies yesterday while i was buying supplies they seem very hospitable i dont know much about the ladies in town at least not the kind sarah was speaking of i see she took a bite of biscuit herself it was more than fine she thought with a pout it was delicious liza cody her family runs the dry goods store i found her very amiable she was kind enough to let me have one of their puppies jake looked down at the dog who was sniffing at his boot and thumping his tail that where you got this thing yes i wanted the company jake broke off a bite of biscuit and dropped it to the dog ignoring sarahs muttered admonition about feeding animals from the table scrawny now but hes going to be a big one really intrigued she leaned over to look how can you tell his paws hes clumsy now because theyre too big for him hell grow into them i fancy its to my advantage to own a large dog didnt do you much good last night he pointed out but pleased both the pup and sarah by scratching between the dogs floppy ears you give him a name yet lafitte jake paused with his fork halfway to his lips what the hell kind of name is that for a dog after the pirate he had that black marking around his eye like a patch pretty fancy name for a mutt jake said over a mouthful of eggs bandits better sarah lifted a brow id certainly never give him a name like that a pirates a bandit isnt he jake dived into another biscuit be that as it may the name stands chewing jake looked down at the puppy who was groveling a bit obviously hoping for another handout bet it makes you feel pretty stupid doesnt it fella would you care for more coffee mr redman frustrated sarah rose and wrapping a cloth around the handle took the pot from the stove without waiting for an answer she stood beside jake and poured she smelled good he thought soft kind of subtle like a field of wildflowers in early spring at the ends of her stiff white sleeves her hands were delicate he remembered the feel of them on his cheek they taught you good he muttered i beg your pardon she looked down at him there was something in his eyes a hint of what shed seen in them the night before it didnt make her nervous as shed been certain it would it made her yearn the cooking jake put a hand over hers to straighten the pot andkeep the coffee from overflowing the cup then he kept it there feeling the smooth texture of her skin and the surprisingly rapid beating of her pulse she didnt back away or blush or snatch her hand from his instead she simply looked back at him the question in her eyes was one he wanted badly to answer she moistened her lips but kept her eyes steady thank you im glad you enjoyed it you take too many chances sarah slowly when he was certain she understood his meaning he removed his hand with her chin up she returned the pot to the stove how dare he make her feel like that then toss it back in her face you dont frighten me mr redman if you were going to hurt me you would have done so by now maybe maybe not your kind wears a man down my kind she turned the light of challenge in her eyes just what kind would that be the soft kind the soft stubborn kind whos right on the edge of stepping into a mans arms you couldnt be more mistaken her voice was icy now in defense against the blood that had heated at his words i havent any interest in being in your arms or any mans my only interest at the moment is protecting my property could be im wrong he rocked back in his chair she was a puzzle all right and hed never known how pleasurable it could be to get a womans dander up well born find out sooner or later meanwhile just how do you plan to go about protecting this place not much caring whether he was finished or not she began to stack the plates im going to alert the sheriff of course thats not going to hurt but its not going to help much either if you get more trouble out here the sheriffs ten miles away just what do you suggest hed already given it some thought and he had an answer if i were you id hire somebody to help out around here somebody who can give you a hand with the place and who knows how to use a gun a thrill sprinted through her she managed just barely to keep her voice disinterested yourself i suppose he grinned at her no duchess i aint looking for that kind of job i was thinking of lucius frowning she began to scrub out the frying pan he drinks who doesnt give him a couple of meals and a place to bunk down and hell do all right for you a woman staying out here all alones just asking for trouble those men who burned your shed last night mightve done more to you than give you a headache his meaning was clear enough clearer still because shed thought of that possibility herself shed prefer him though only because she knew he was capable she assured herself but she did need someone perhaps youre right no perhaps about it someone as green as you doesnt have the sense to do more than die out here i dont see why you have to insult me the plain truths the plain truth duchess teeth clenched she banged dishes i told you not to i got a question for you he said interrupting her easily what would you have done this morning if it hadnt been me bringing back the horses i would have defended myself you ever shot a henry before she gave him a scandalized look why in the world would i have shot anyone named henry with a long sigh he rose a henry rifle duchess thats what you were pointing at my belt buckle before you fixed my eggs sarah wiped the pan clean then set it aside no i havent actually fired one but i cant imagine its that complicated in any case i never intended to shoot it what did you have in mind dancing with it she snatched up a plate mr redman im growing weary of being an amusement to you i realize that someone like you thinks nothing of shooting a man dead and walking away i however have been taught rightfully that killing is a sin youre wrong something in his voice had her turning toward him again survivings never a sin its all there is if you believe that im sorry for you he didnt want her pity but he did want her to stay alive moving over he took the plates out of her hands if you see a snake are you going to kill it or stand there and let it bite you thats entirely different you might not think its so different if you stay out here much longer wheres the cartridges for the rifle wiping her hands on her apron sarah glanced at the shelf behind her jake took the cartridges down checked them then gripped her arm come on ill give you a lesson i havent finished cleaning the dishes theyll keep i never said i wanted lessons she told him as he pulled her outside if youre going to pick up a gun you ought to know how to use it he hefted the rifle and smiled at her unless youre afraid you cant learn sarah untied her apron and laid it over the rail im not afraid of anything chapter five hed figured a challenge would be the best way to get her cooperation sarah marched along beside him chin up eyes forward he didnt think she knew it but when shed held the rifle that morning shed been prepared to pull the trigger he wanted to make sure that when she did she hit what she aimed at from the rubble of the burned shed jake selected a few pieces of charred wood and balanced three of them against a pile of rocks first thing you do is learn how to load it without shooting off your foot jake emptied the rifles chamber then slowly reloaded youve got to have respect for a weapon and not go around holding it like you were going to sweep the porch with it to prove his point he brought the rifle up sighted in and fired three shots the three pieces of scrap wood flew backward in unison bullets can do powerful damage to a man he told her as he lowered the gun again she had to swallow the sound of gunfire still ech oed im aware of that mr redman i have no intention of shooting anyone most people dont wake up in the morning figuring on it he went to the rocks again this time he set up the largest piece of wood unless youre planning on heading back to philadelphia real soon youd better learn how to use this im not going anywhere with a nod jake emptied the rifle and handed her the ammo load it she didnt like the feel of the bullets in her hands they were cold and smooth holding them she wondered how anyone could use them against another metal against flesh no it was inconceivable you going to play with them or put them in the gun because he was watching her sarah kept her face impassive and did as he told her he pushed the barrel away from his midsection youre a quick study it shouldnt have pleased her but she felt the corners of her mouth turn up nonetheless so ive been told unable to resist he brushed the hair out of her eyes dont get cocky stepping behind her he laid the gun in her hands then adjusted her arms balance it and get a good grip on it i am she muttered wishing he wouldnt stand quite so close he smelled of leather and sweat a combination that for reasons beyond her comprehension aroused her one hand was firm on her arm the other on her shoulder hardly a lovers touch and yet she felt her system respond as it had never responded to the gentle flirtatious handholding shed experienced in philadelphia she had only to lean back the slightest bit to be pressed close against him not that she wanted to be she shifted then grumbled under her breath when he pushed her into place again hold still not stiff woman still he told her when her body went rigid at his touch theres no need to snap at me you stand like that when you fire youre going to get a broken shoulder loosen up you see the sight that little thing sticking up there he closed his eyes for a moment yeah that little thing sticking up there use it to sight in the target bring the stock up some he leaned over sarah pressed her lips together when his cheek brushed hers steady he murmured resisting the urge to turn his face into her hair wrap your finger around the trigger dont jerk it just pull it back slow and smooth she shut her eyes and obeyed the rifle exploded in her hands and would have knocked her flat on her back if he hadnt been there to steady her she screamed afraid shed shot herself missed breathing hard sarah whirled around always a cautious man jake took the rifle from her you might have warned me she brought her hand up to nurse her bruised shoulder it felt like someone hit me with a rock its always better to find things out firsthand try it again with her teeth clenched sarah took the rifle and managed to get back into position this time use your arm instead of your shoulder to balance it lean in a bit my ears are ringing youll get used to it he put a steadying hand on her waist it helps if you keep your eyes open sight low good now pull the trigger this time she was braced for the kick and just staggered a little jake kept a hand at her waist and looked over her head you caught a corner of it i did she looked for herself i did laughing she looked over her shoulder at him i want to do it again she lifted the rifle and didnt complain when jake pushed the barrel three inches to the right she kept her eyes wide open this time as she pressed her finger down on the trigger she let out a whoop when the wood flew off the rocks i hit it looks like i really nit it imagine when he took the gun from her she shook her hair back and laughed my arms tingling itll pass he was surprised he could speak the way she looked when she laughed made his throat slam shut he wasnt a man for pretty words not for saying them or for thinking them but just now it ran through his head that she looked like an angel in the sunlight with her hair the color of wet wheat and her eyes like gold dust and he wanted her as hed wanted few things in his life slowly wanting to give himself time to regain control he walked over to the rocks to pick up the target she had indeed hit it the hole was nearly at the top and far to the right of center but shed hit it he walked back to drop the wood in sarahs hands and watched her grin about it trouble is most things you shoot at dont sit nice and still like a block of wood he was determined to spoil it for her sarah thought studying his cool unreadable eyes the man was impossible to understand one moment he was going to the trouble to teach her how to shoot the rifle and the next he couldnt even manage the smallest of compliments because shed learned well the devil with him mr redman its very apparent that nothing i do pleases you she tossed the block of wood aside isnt it fortunate for both of us that it doesnt matter in the least with that she gathered up her skirts and began to stamp back toward the house she managed no more than a startled gasp as he spun her around she knew that look she thought dazedly as she stared at him it was the same one shed first seen on his face when hed ridden beside the stage firing his pistol over his shoulder she hadnt a clue as to how to deal with him now so she took the only option that came to mind take your hands off me i warned you you took too many chances his grip only tightened when she tried to shrug him off its not smart to turn your back on a man whos holding a loaded gun did you intend to shoot me in the back mr redman it was an unfair remark and she knew it but she wanted to get away from him quickly until that look faded from his eyes i wouldnt put that or anything else past you youre the rudest most illmannered most ungentlemanly man ive ever met ill thank you to get back on your horse and ride off my land hed resisted challenges before but hed be damned if hed resist this one from the first time hed seen her shed started an itch in him it was time he scratched it seems to me you need another lesson duchess i neither need nor want anything from you and i wont be called by that ridiculous name her breath came out in a whoosh when he dragged her against him he saw her eyes go wide with shock then i wont call you anything he was still holding the rifle with his eyes on hers he slid his hand up her back to gather up her hair i dont much like talking anyway she fought him at least she needed to believe she did despite her efforts his mouth closed over hers in that instant the sun was blocked out and she was plunged breathless into the deepest darkest night his body was like iron his arm bonded her against him so that she had no choice really no choice but to absorb the feel of him he made her think of the rifle slim and hard and deadly through the shock the panic and the excitement she felt the fast uneven beating of his heart against hers her blood had turned into some hot foreign liquid that made her pulse leap and her heart thud the rough stubble of his beard scraped her face and she moaned from the pain she assured herself it couldnt be from pleasure and yet her hands were on his shoulders holding on now rather than pushing away he wondered if she knew she packed a bigger kick than her fathers rifle hed never known that anything so sweet could be so potent that anything so delicate could be so strong she had him by the throat and didnt even know it and he wanted more in a move too desperate to be gentle he dragged her head back by the hair she gasped in the instant he allowed her to breathe dragging in air unaware that shed been stunned into holding her breath then his mouth was on hers again his tongue invading arousing in a way she hadnt known she could be aroused weakening in a way she hadnt believed she could be weakened she moaned again but this time there was no denying the pleasure tentatively then boldly she answered the new demand savoring the hot salty taste of his lips she ran her hands along the planes of his face and into his hair glorious no one had ever warned her that a kiss could make the body burn and tremble and yearn a sound of stunned delight caught in her throat the sound lit fires in him that he knew could never be allowed to burn free she was innocent any fool could see that arid he he hadnt been innocent since hed drawn his first breath there were lines he crossed laws he broke but this one had to be respected he struggled to clear his mind but she filled it her arms were around his neck pulling him closer pulling him in and her mouth sweet lord her mouth his heart was hammering in his head in his loins all from the taste of her honeyed whiskey a man could drown in it afraid he would and even more afraid hed want to he pushed her away her eyes were dark and unfocused the way theyd been last night when shed started to come to it gave him some satisfaction to see it because he felt as though hed been knocked cold himself like i said you learn fast sarah his hand was shaking infuriated he curled it into a fist he had a flash an almost painful one of what it would be like to drag her to the ground and take everything from her before he could act one way or the other he heard the sound of an approaching wagon you got company coming he handed her the rifle and walked away what had he done to her sarah put a hand to her spinning head hed hed forced himself on her forced her until until he hadnt had to force her any longer until it had felt right to want him until wanting him had been all there was just like the dream but this wasnt a dream sarah told herself straightening her shoulders it was more than real and now he was walking away from her as if it hadnt mattered to him in the least pride was every bit as dangerous an emotion as anger mr redman when he turned he saw her standing there with the rifle if the look in her eyes meant anything shed have dearly loved to use it apparently you take chances too she tilted her head there was challenge in the gesture as well as a touch of fury and a stab of hurt this rifles still loaded thats right he touched the brim of his hat in a salute its a hell of a lot harder to pull the trigger when youre aiming at flesh and blood but go ahead itd be hard to miss at this range she wished she could she wished she had the skill to put a bullet between his feet and watch him jump lifting her chin she walked toward the house the difference between you and me mr redman is that i still have morals theres some truth in that he strode easily beside her seeing as you fixed me breakfast and all why dont you call me jake he swung up into the saddle as a buggy rumbled into the yard sarah with her hands still on the reins liza cast an uncertain glance at her new friend then at the man in the saddle she knew she wasnt supposed to approve of men like jake redman but she found it difficult not to when he looked so attractive and exciting i hope you dont mind us coming out a young boy jumped out of the buggy and began to chase the puppy who was running in circles not at all im delighted sarah shaded her eyes with her hand so that she could see jake clearly mr redman was just on his way those sure are some pretty guns you got there mister young john cody put a hand on the neck of jakes gray mustang and peered up at the smooth wooden grip of one of the colts he carried he knew who jake redman was hed heard all the stories but hed never managed to get this close before think so ignoring the two women jake shifted in his saddle to get a better look at the boy no more than ten he figured with awe in his eyes and a smudge of dirt on his cheek yessiree i think that when you slap leather youre just about the fastest there is maybe in the whole world john cody liza stayed in the buggy wringing her hands you oughtnt to bother mr redman jake shot her a quick amused look did she think hed shoot the kid for talking to him no bother maam he glanced down at johnny again you cant believe everything you hear but johnny figured he knew what was what my ma says that since you saved that stage theres probably some good in you somewhere this time liza called her brothers name in a strained desperate whisper jake had to grin he shifted his attention to sarah long enough to see that she was standing as stiff as a rod with one eyebrow arched thats right kind of her ill tell the sheriff about your trouble miss conway i reckon hell be out to see you thank you mr redman good day he tipped his hat to her then to liza see you around johnny he turned his horse in a half circle and rode away yessir johnny shouted after him yessiree john cody liza collected herself enough to climb out of the buggy johnny just grinned and raced off after the puppy again firing an imaginary peacemaker thats my brother yes i imagined it was liza gave johnny one last look of sisterly disgust before going to sarah mas tending the store today she wanted you to have this its a loaf of her cinnamon bread oh how kind of her one whiff brought memories of home can you stay liza gave sarah the bread and a quick dimpled smile i was hoping i could come in please ill fix us some tea while sarah busied herself at the stove liza looked around the tiny cabin it was scrubbed clean as a whistle its not as bad as i thought it would be instantly she lifted a hand to her mouth im sorry ma always says i talk too much for my own good thats all right sarah got out two tin cups and tried not to wish they were china i was taken by surprise myself at ease again liza sat at the table i didnt expect to run into jake redman out here sarah brought the knife down into the bread with a thwack neither did i he said you had trouble unconsciously sarah lifted a finger to her lips they were still warm from his and they tingled as her arms had from the kick of the henry she had trouble all right since she couldnt explain the kiss to herself she could hardly explain it to liza someone set fire to my shed last night oh sarah no who why i dont know she brought the two cups to the table fortunately mr redman happened to be riding by this way do you think he might have done it sarahs brow rose as she considered the possibility she remembered the way hed bathed her face and tended her hurts no im quite certain he didnt i believe mr redman takes a more direct approach i guess youre right about that i cant say hes started any trouble here in lone bluff but hes finished some what do you know about him i dont think anyone knows much he rode into town about six months ago of course everybodys heard of jake redman some say hes killed more than twenty men in gunfights killed stunned sarah could only stare but why i dont know if there always is a why i did hear that some rancher up north hired him on thered been trouble rustling barnburning hired him on sarah murmured to kill thats what it comes down to i suppose i do know that plenty of people were nervous when he rode in and took a room at maggie orourkes liza broke off a corner of the slice of bread sarah had served her but he didnt seem to be looking for trouble about two weeks later he found it anyway a hired killer sarah thought her stomach churning and shed kissed him kissed him in a way no lady kissed a man who wasnt her husband what happened jim carlson was in the bird cage thats one of the saloons in town carlson yes hes samuel carlsons brother you wouldnt know it liza continued pursing her lips jims nothing like samuel full of spit that one likes to brag and swagger and bully cheats at cards but nobody had the nerve to call him on it until jake liza drank more tea and listened with half an ear to her brothers war whoops in the yard the way i heard it there were some words over the card table jim was drunk and a little careless with his dealing once jake called him on it some of the other men joined in word is jim drew everybody figured jake would put a bullet in him there and then but he just knocked him down he didnt shoot him she felt a wave of relief perhaps he wasnt what people said he was no at least the way i heard it jake just knocked him silly and gave jims gun to the bartender somebody had already hightailed it for the sheriff by the time he got there jake was standing at the bar having himself a drink and jim was picking himself up off the floor i think barker was going to put jim in a cell for the night until he sobered up but when he took hold of him jim pulled the gun from the sheriffs holster instead of getting a bullet in the back jake put one in jim carlson then turned around and finished his drink deads dead did he kill him no though theres some in town wished he had the carlsons are pretty powerful around here but there were enough witnesses the sheriff included to call it selfdefense i see but she didnt understand the kind of justice that had to be meted out with guns and bullets im surprised jake mr redman hasnt moved on he must like it around here what about you doesnt it scare you to stay out here alone sarah thought of her first night shivering under the blanket and praying for morning a little after living back east liza gave a sigh to her philadelphia sounded as glamorous and foreign as paris or london all the places youve seen the pretty clothes you must have worn sarah struggled with a quick pang of homesickness have you ever been east no but ive seen pictures liza eyed sarahs trunks with longing the women wear beautiful clothes would you like to see some of mine lizas face lit up id love to for the next twenty minutes liza oohed and aahed over ruffles and lace her reaction caused sarah to appreciate what she had always taken for granted crouched on the cabin floor they discussed important matters such as ribbons and sashes and the proper tilt of a bonnet while johnny was kept occupied with a hunk of bread and the puppy oh look at this one delighted liza rose sweeping a dress in front of her i wish you had a looking glass it was the white muslin with the rosebuds on the skirt the dress shed planned to wear for her first dinner with her father hed never see it now she glanced at the trunks or any of the other lovely things hed made certain she had in her life whats wrong with the dress still crushed against her liza stepped forward you look so sad i was thinking of my father of how hard he worked for me lizas fascination with the clothes was immediately outweighed by her sympathy he loved you often when he came in the store hed talk about you about what youd written in one of your letters i remember how he brought in this picture of you a drawing in a little frame he wanted everyone to see how pretty you were he was so proud of you sarah i miss him with a shake of her head sarah blinked back tears its strange all those years we were separated sometimes i could barely remember him but since ive been here i seem to know him better and miss him more gently liza laid a hand on her shoulder my pa sure riles me sometimes but i guess id about die if anything happened to him well at least i have this she looked around the small cabin i feel closer to him here i like to think about him sitting at that table and writing to me after a long breath she managed to smile im glad i came liza held out a hand so am i rising sarah fluffed out the sleeves of the dress liza was holding now let me be your looking glass youre taller and curvier than i with her lips pursed she walked in a circle around liza the neckline would flatter you but i think id do away with some of the ruffles in the bodice a nice pink would be your color it would show off your hair and eyes can you imagine me wearing a dress like that closing her eyes liza turned in slow circles it would have to be at a dance id have my hair curled over my shoulder and wear a velvet ribbon around my throat will metcalfs eyes would fall right out whos will metcalf liza opened her eyes and giggled just a man hes a deputy in town hed like to be my beau mischief flashed across her face i might decide to let him liza loves will johnny sang through the window you hush up john cody rushing to the window liza leaned out if you dont ill tell ma who broke grandmas china plate liza loves will he repeated unconcerned then raced off with the puppy nothing more irritating than little brothers she muttered with a sigh of regret she replaced the dress in the trunk tapping a finger on her lips sarah came to a quick decision she should have thought of it before she reflected or perhaps it had been milling around in her mind all along liza would you like a dress like that in pink like that pretty muslin i saw in your store yesterday i guess id think id gone to heaven what if i made it for you made it for me wideeyed liza looked at the trunk then back at sarah could you im very handy with a needle caught up in the idea sarah pushed through her trunks to find her measuring tape if you can get the material ill make the dress if you like it you can tell the other women who come in your store of course obediently liza lifted her arms so that sarah could measure her ill tell everyone then some of those women might want new dresses fashionable new dresses looking up she caught the gleam of understanding in lizas eyes you bet they would you get me that material and ill make you a dress that will have will metcalf standing on his head two hours later sarah was pouring water over her vegetable garden in the heat of the afternoon with her back smarting from the chores and sun baking the dirt almost as fast as she could dampen it she wondered if it was worth it a garden out here would require little less than a miracle and she would much prefer flowers you couldnt eat flowers she reminded herself and poured the last of the water out now she would have to walk back to the stream and fill the pail again to have water for cooking and washing a bath she thought as she wiped the back of her hand over her brow what she wouldnt give for a long bath in a real tub she heard the horses it pleased her to realize that she was becoming accustomed to the sound or lack of sound that surrounded her new home with her hand shading her eyes she watched two riders come into view it wasnt until she recognized one as lucius that she realized shed been holding her breath lafitte she called but the dog continued to race around the yard barking miss conway sheriff barker tipped his hat and chuckled at the snarling pup got yourself a fiercelooking guard dog there makes a ruckus anyhow lucius said swinging down from his horse lafitte sprang at him gripping the bottom of his pant leg with sharp puppy teeth bending lucius snatched him up by the cuff of the neck you mind your manners young fella the second he was on the ground again lafitte ran to hide behind sarahs skirts heard you had some trouble out here barker nodded toward the remains of the shed this happen last night thats right if youd like to come inside i was just about to get some water im sure youd like some coffee after your ride ill fetch you some water miss lucius said taking the pail from her hey boy he grinned down at the pup why dont you come along with me ill keep you out of trouble after a moments hesitation lafitte trotted along after him are you thinking about hiring him on with her lip caught between her teeth sarah watched lucius stroll off i was considering it youd be smart to do it barker took out a bandanna and wiped his neck lucius has a powerful affection for the bottle but it doesnt seem to bother him hes honest did some soldiering a while back hes amiable enough drunk or sober sarah managed a smile ill take that as a recommendation sheriff barker well now the sheriff looked back at the shed why dont you tell me what happened here as clearly as she could sarah told him everything she knew he listened grunting and nodding occasionally everything she said jibed with the story jake had given him but she didnt add because she didnt know that jake had followed the trail of two riders into the rocks where hed discovered the ashes of a campfire any reason you can think of why somebodyd want to do this none at all theres nothing here that could mean anything to anyone other than myself did my father have any enemies barker spit tobacco juice in the dirt i wouldnt think so right off i got to tell you miss conway there aint much i can do ill ask some questions and poke around some could be some drifters passed through and wanted to raise some hell begging your pardon but he didnt think so id wondered the same myself youll feel safer having old lucius around she glanced over to see him coming back with the pail and the puppy i suppose youre right but he didnt look like her idea of a protector it was unfortunate for her that her idea of one had taken the form of jake redman im sure well do nicely she said with more confidence than she felt ill ride out now and again and see how youre getting on barker pulled himself onto his horse you know miss conway matt tried to grow something in that patch of dirt for as long as i can recollect he spit again never had any luck perhaps ill have better good afternoon sheriff good day maam he lifted a hand to lucius as he turned for home chapter six within a week sarah had orders for six dresses it took all her creativity and skill to fashion them using her wardrobe and her imagination instead of patterns she set aside three hours each day and three each evening for sewing each night when she climbed up to bed her eyes and fingers ached once or twice when the exhaustion overwhelmed her she wept herself to sleep the grief for her father was still too raw the country surrounding her still too rugged but there were other times and they were becoming more common when she fell asleep with a sense of satisfaction in addition to the dresses shed made pretty yellow curtains for the windows and a matching cloth for the table it was her dream when shed saved enough from her sewing to buy planks for a real floor in the meantime she made do with what she had and was more grateful than shed ever imagined she could be for lucius hed finished building a new shed and he was busy repairing the other outbuildings though hed muttered about it hed agreed to build sarah the chicken coop she wanted at night he was content to sleep with the horses sometimes he watched tickling lafittes belly as she took her daily rifle practice she hadnt seen jake redman since the day hed given her a shooting lesson just as well sarah told herself as she pulled on her gloves there was no one she wanted to see less if she thought about him at all and she hated to admit she had it was with disdain a hired gun a man with no loyalty or morals a drifter moving from place to place always ready to draw his weapon and kill to think shed almost begun to believe there was something special about him something good and admirable hed helped her there was no denying that but hed probably done so out of sheer boredom or perhaps she thought remembering the kiss because he wanted something from her something she was ashamed to admit she had nearly been willing to give how sarah picked up her hand mirror and studied her face not out of vanity but because she hoped to see some answers there how had he managed to make her feel that way in just a few short days with just one embrace now time after time in the deepest part of the night she brought herself awake because she was dreaming of him remembering she thought experiencing once again that stunning moment in the sun when his mouth had been on hers and there had been no doubt in her mind that she belonged there a momentary madness she told herself placing the mirror face down on the table sunstroke perhaps she would never could never be attracted to a man who lived his life the way jake redman lived his it was time to forget him perhaps he had already moved on and she would never see him again well it didnt matter one way or the other she had her own life to see to now and with a little help from li a it appeared she had her own business picking up the three bundles wrapped in brown paper sarah went outside you real sure you dont want me to drive you to town miss conway sarah put the wrapped dresses in the back of the wagon while lucius stood at the horses heads no thank you lucius she was well aware that her driving skills were poor at best but shed bartered for the wagon with the owner of the livery stable he had two daughters that shed designed gingham frocks for and she intended to deliver them herself for lucius she had a big sunny smile i was hoping youd start on the chicken coop today im going to see if mrs miller will sell me a dozen young chicks yesm lucius shuffled his feet and cleared his throat going to be a hot dry day yes what day wasnt i have a canteen thank you he waited until sarah had gained the seat and smoothed out her skirts theres just one thing miss conway anxious to be on her way sarah took the reins yes lucius what is it im plumb out of whiskey her brow rose all but disappearing under the wispy bangs she wore and well seeing as youre going into town and all i thought you could pick some up for me i you can hardly expect me to purchase whiskey hed figured on her saying something of the kind maybe you could get somebody to buy a bottle for you he gave her a gaptoothed smile and was careful not to spit id be obliged she opened her mouth ready to lecture him on the evils of drink with a sigh she shut it again the man worked very hard for very little it wasnt her place to deny him his comforts whatever they might be ill see what can be done his grizzled face brightened immediately thats right kind of you miss and i sure will get started on that coop relieved he spit in the dirt you look real pretty today miss just like a picture her lips curved if anyone had told her a week ago that she would grow fond of a smelly whiskeydrinking creature like lucius shed have thought them mad thank you theres chicken and fresh bread in the cabin she held her breath and snapped the reins sarah had dressed very carefully for town if she was going to interest the ladies in ordering fashionable clothes from her then it was wise to advertise her dress was a particularly flattering shade of moss green with a high neckline shed graced with her cameo the trim of rosecolored ribbon and the rows of flounces at the skirt made it a bit flirtatious shed added a matching bonnet tilted low as much for dash as for added shade she felt doubly pleased with her choice when her two young customers came running out of the livery and goggled at it sarah left them to race home and try on their new dresses while she completed her errands sarah liza danced around the counter of the dry goods store to take both of her hands oh what a wonderful dress every woman in towns going to want one like it i was hoping to tempt them laughing sarah turned in a circle its one of my favorites i can see why is everything all right with you i havent been able to get away for days everythings fine theres been no more trouble she wandered over to take a look at the bolts of fabric im certain it was just an isolated incident as the sheriff said it must have been drifters glancing over she smiled hello mrs cody she said as lizas mother came in from the stockroom sarah its nice to see you and looking so pretty too thank you ive brought your dress well that was quick work anne cody took the package in her wide capable hands and went immediately to the cash drawer oh i dont want you to pay for it until you look and make sure its what you wanted anne smiled showing dimples like her daughters thats good business my ed would say youve got a head on your shoulders lets just take a look then as she unwrapped the package two of her customers moved closer to watch why sarah its lovely clearly pleased anne held it up the dress was dove gray simple enough to wear for work behind the counter yet flatteringly feminine with touches of lace at the throat and sleeves my goodness honey youve a fine hand with a needle deliberately she moved from behind the counter so that the rest of her customers could get the full effect look at this work mrs miller ill swear you wont see better grinning liza leaned over to whisper in sarahs ear shell have a dozen orders for you in no time pa always says ma could sell a legless man new boots here you are sarah anne passed her the money its more than worth every penny young lady mrs miller peered through her spectacles at the stitches in annes new dress im going to visit my sister in kansas city next month i think a traveling suit of this same fabric would be flattering to me oh yes maam sarah beamed ignoring the fact that very little would be flattering to mrs millers bulky figure you have a good eye for color this fabric trimmed in purple would be stunning on you by the time she was finished sarah had three more orders and an armful of fabric with one hand muffling her giggles liza walked out with her imagine you talking that old fuddyduddy mrs miller into two dresses she wants to outshine her sister ill have to make sure she does it wont be easy considering what you have to work with and shes overcharging you for those chicks thats all right sarah turned with a grin im going to overcharge her for the dresses do you have time to walk with me id like to go down and see if this blueandwhite stripe takes mrs orourkes fancy they started down the walkway after only a few steps liza stopped and swept her skirts aside sarah watched the statuesque woman approach in all her life shed never seen hair that color it gleamed like the brass knob on mother superiors office door the vivid blue silk dress she wore was too snug at the bodice and entirely too low for day wear smooth white breasts rose out of it the left one adorned with a small beauty mark that matched another at the corner of her red lips she carried an unfurled parasol and strolled her hips swaying shamelessly as she came shouldertoshoulder with sarah the woman stopped and looked her up and down the tiny smile she wore became a smirk as she walked oh rolling her hips my goodness sarah could think of little else to say as she rubbed her nose the womans perfume remained stubbornly behind that was carlotta she runs the silver star she looks extraordinary well shes a you know a what a woman of ill repute liza said in a whisper oh sarahs eyes grew huge shed heard of course even in philadelphia one heard of such women but to actually pass one on the street oh my i wonder why she looked at me that way probably because jake redmans been out your way a couple times jakes a real favorite with carlotta she shut her mouth tight if her mother heard her talking that way shed be skinned alive i should have known with a toss of her head sarah started to walk again for the life of her she didnt know why she felt so much like crying mrs orourke greeted her with pleasure not only had it been a year since shed had a new dress she was determined to know all there was to know about the woman who was keeping jake so churned up i thought you might like this striped material mrs orourke its right nice maggie fingered the cotton with a large reddened hand no doubt itll make up pretty michael my first husband was michael bailey he was partial to a pretty dress died young did michael got a little drunk and took the wrong horse hung him for a horse thief before he sobered up not certain what response was proper sarah murmured something inaudible im sure the colors would flatter you maggie let out a bray of laughter girl im past the age where i care about being flattered buried me two husbands mr orourke rest his soul was hit by lightning back in the good lord doesnt always protect fools and drunkards you know save me im not in the market for another one the only reason a woman decks herself out is to catch a man or keep one she ran her shrewd eyes over sarah now youve got a rig on this day you do deciding to take the remark as a compliment sarah offered a small smile thank you if youd prefer something else i could i wasnt saying i didnt like the goods sarah can make you a very serviceable dress mrs orourke liza put in my mas real pleased with hers mrs millers having her make up two for her trip to kansas city that so maggie knew what a pinchpenny the miller woman was i reckon i could do with a new dress nothing fancy mind i dont want any of my boarders getting ideas in their heads she let out a cackle if a man got ideas about you maggie hed lose them quick enough after a bowl of your stew sarahs fingers curled into her palms when she heard jakes voice slowly her body braced she turned to face him he was halfway down the stairs some men want something more from a woman than a bowl of stew maggie told him and cackled again you ladies want to be wary of a man who smiles like that she added pointing a finger at jake i ought to know since i married two of them as she spoke she watched the way jake and sarah looked at each other someone had lit a fire there she decided she wouldnt mind fanning it a bit liza all this talk about cooking reminds me i need another ten pounds of flour run on up and fetch it for me have your ma put it on my account yes maam anxious to be off sarah picked up the bolt of material again ill get started on this right away mrs orourke hold on a minute ive got a dress upstairs you can use for measuring needs some mending too im no hand with a needle liza i can use two pounds of coffee she motioned at the girl with the back of her hand go on off with you ill just be a minute liza promised as she walked out the door pleased with her maneuvering maggie started up the stairs youre about as subtle as a load of buckshot jake murmured to her with the material still in her hands sarah watched jake approach her though she was standing in the center of the room she had the oddest sensation that her back was against the wall he was staring at her in that way he had that made her stomach flutter and her knees shake she promised herself that if he touched her if he even looked as though he might touch her she would slap him hard enough to knock his hat off he had images of touching her of tasting her of rolling around on the ground and filling himself with her seeing her now looking like some flower that had sprung up out of the sand he had to remind himself that they could only be images he figured that was no reason he couldnt needle her a bit morning duchess you come by to see me certainly not he couldnt help but enjoy the way her eyes fired up casually he brushed a finger over the fabric she held and felt her jolt mighty pretty but i like the dress youve got on better it isnt for me there was no reason in the world she should feel flattered sarah reminded herself no reason at all mrs orourke expressed interest in having a dress made so you sew too his gaze traveled over her face lingering on her mouth too long for comfort youre full of surprises its an honest way to make a living deliberately she looked down at the gun on his hip its a pity not everyone can say the same it was difficult to say what the cool disapproving tone made him feel rage familiar and bittertasting futility with its cold hollow ring both emotions and flickers of others showed in his eyes as he stared down at her so you heard about me he said before she could follow her first impulse and lay a soothing hand on his arm im a dangerous man sarah he took her chin in his hand so that her eyes stayed on his i draw my gun and leave women widows and children orphans the smell of gunsmoke and death follows me wherever i go i got apache blood in my veins so i dont look on killing the way a white man might i put a bullet in a man the same way a wolf rips out throats because its what i was made for a woman like you had best keep her distance she heard the fury licking at his words more she heard frustration a deep raw frustration before he could reach the door she was calling after him mr redman mr redman please gathering up her skirts she hurried after him jake he stopped and turned as she came through the doorway they were outside only a step but that was enough to have the heat and dust rising around them youd do better to stay inside until maggie comes down for you please wait she laid a hand on his arm i dont understand what you do or who you are but i do know youve taken the trouble to be a help to me dont tell me to forget it she said quickly because i wont youve got a talent for tying a man up in knots he murmured i dont mean no i dont reckon you do anything else you want to say actually i she broke off when she heard a burst of wild laughter from the next building as she looked a man was propelled headfirst through a pair of swinging doors he landed in a heap in the dust of the road even as sarah started forward jake shifted to block her what do you think youre doing that man might be hurt hes too drunk to be hurt her eyes wide sarah looked past jakes shoulder and saw the drunk struggle to his feet and stagger back inside but its the middle of the day just as easy to get drunk in the daylight as it is when the suns down her lips primmed its just as disgraceful whis key might be the work of the devil sarah thought but she had promised lucius i wonder if i might ask you another favor you can ask i need a bottle of whiskey jake took off his hat and smoothed back his hair then replaced the hat i thought you didnt care for it much its not for me its for lucius she was certain she heard the sound of breaking glass from the neighboring saloon as she reached for her reticule im afraid i dont know the price lucius is good for it go back inside he told her then passed through the swinging doors quite a man isnt he sarah lifted a hand to her heart mrs orourke you startled me grinning maggie stepped outside your mind was elsewhere she handed sarah a bundle goodlooking jake is strong back good hands a woman can hardly ask for more maggie glanced over as the din from the saloon grew louder you dont have a fella back east do you a what distracted sarah inched closer to the saloon she hated to admit it but she was dying to see inside oh no at least there was no one i cared for enough to many a smart woman knows how to bring a man around to marriage and make him think it was his idea all along you take jake maggie broke off when sarah squealed two men burst through the swinging doors and rolled into the street fists flying my goodness her mouth hanging open sarah watched the two men kick and claw and pummel each other i thought i told you to go inside jake strolled out carrying a bottle of whiskey by the neck i was just oh she saw blood fly as a fist connected with a nose this is dreadful you have to stop them like hell i do wheres your wagon but you must sarah insisted you cant simply stand here and watch two men beat each other like this duchess if i try to break that up both of them are going to start swinging at me he passed her the bottle of whiskey i dont feel much like killing anybody today with a huff sarah thrust the bottle back into his hands and followed it with the fabric and maggies bundle then ill stop them myself its going to be a shame when you lose some of those pretty teeth taking time only to glare at him sarah bent down and scooped up the spittoon maggie kept beside her doorway her skirts in one hand weapon in the other she marched toward the middle of the melee thats some woman maggie said with a grin jake merely grunted got grit go water down your stew maggie just laughed shes got you too hope im around when she figures it out a little breathless sarah dodged the rolling bodies the men were groaning and hissing as they struggled to land punches the smell of stale whiskey and sweat rose from both of them she had to scramble a bit for aim before she brought the brass down with a thunk on one head and then the other a roar of laughter then a few cheers poured out the doorway of the saloon ignoring the sound sarah looked down at the two men who were frowning at her and rubbing their heads you should be ashamed of yourselves she told them in a tone that would have made mother superior proud fighting in the street like a couple of schoolboys youve done nothing but bloody your faces and make a spectacle of yourselves now stand up both men reached for their hats and struggled to their feet im sure whatever disagreement you have can be better solved by talking it out satisfied sarah nodded politely then glided back across the street to where jake and maggie stood there she handed maggie the spittoon her selfsatisfied smirk was for jake alone it was only a matter of getting their attention then applying reason he glanced over her head to where the two men were wrestling in the dirt again yes maam taking her arm he started up the street before she could get it in her head to do something else did you learn to swing like that in your fancy school i had occasion to observe the nuns techniques for handling disagreements ever get knocked on the head with a spittoon she tilted her head her eyes laughing under the cover of her lashes no but i know what a wooden ruler feels like sarah glanced in the dry goods as she stopped by her wagon inside she could see liza flirting with a thin gangly man with strawcolored hair and shiny brown boots is that will metcalf jake stowed the rest of her things in the back of the wagon yeah i think lizas quite taken with him she bit back a sigh romance was as far away from her right now as the beautiful house her father had built for her in his mind turning she bumped into jakes chest his hands came up to steady her and stayed on her arms not so far away she thought again it wasnt far away at all when it could reach out and touch you you got to watch where youre going i usually do i used to he was going to kiss her again right there in the center of town she could feel it she could almost taste it he wanted to he wanted five minutes alone with her though he knew there was no use it was no good sarah good morning jake twirling her parasol carlotta sauntered up to the wagon smiling slightly she ignored the warning look he sent her and turned her attention to sarah shed already decided to hate her for what she was for what she had her smile still in place she skimmed her gaze up and down sarah pure and proper and dull she decided jake would be tired of her in a week but in the meantime it would give her pleasure to make the little priss uncomfortable arent you going to introduce me to your friend jake ignored her and kept a hand on sarahs arm to steer her to the front of the wagon sarah didnt recognize the basic female urge the primal urge to face the enemy down she only knew she wouldnt have the woman smirking at her back im sarah conway she didnt offer her hand she simply nodded it was as much of an insult as carlottas sneering scrutiny i know who you are carlotta smiled fully even as her eyes turned to blue ice i knew your pa i knew him real well the blow hit home carlotta was delighted to see it but when her eyes skimmed up to meet jakes most of the pleasure she felt died shed seen him look at men that way when theyd pushed him too far with a toss of her head she turned away hed come around she told herself men always did his mouth grim jake reached for sarahs arm again to help her into the wagon the moment his fingers brushed her she jerked away dont touch me she had to turn to grip the edge of the wagon until she caught the breath carlotta had knocked out of her all of her illusions were shattered now the idea of her father her own father with a woman like that was more than she could take hed have preferred to walk away just turn and keep going infuriated he dug his hands into his pockets let me help you into the damn wagon sarah i dont want your help she whirled back to face him i dont want anything from you do you understand no but then i dont figure im supposed to do you kiss her the same way you kissed me did you think of me the same way you think of her and women like her his hand shot out to stop her before she could scramble into the wagon i wasnt thinking at all when i kissed you and that was my mistake miss conway samuel carlson stopped his horse at the head of the wagon his eyes stayed on jakes as he dismounted is there a problem no instinctively she stepped between the men carlsons gun had a handle of polished ivory and it looked deadly and beautiful below his silver brocade vest it no longer shocked her to realize that even a man as obviously cultured and educated as he wouldnt hesitate to use a weapon mr redmans been an invaluable help to me since i arrived i heard youd had some trouble sarah discovered she was digging her nails into her palms slowly stiffly she uncurled her fingers but she could do nothing about the tension that was pounding at the base of her throat it sprang she knew from the men who stood on either side of her watching each other ready almost eager yes fortunately the damage wasnt extensive im glad to hear that at last carlson shifted his gaze to sarah she heard her own sigh of relief did you ride into town alone miss conway yes i did as a matter of fact id better be on my way id be obliged if youd allow me to drive you back its a long ride for a woman alone thats kind of you mr carlson i couldnt impose no imposition at all taking her arm he helped her into the seat ive been meaning to ride out pay my respects id consider it a favor if youd allow me to drive you she was about to refuse again when she looked at jake there was ice in was eyes she imagined there would be a different look in them altogether when he looked at carlotta id love the company she heard herself say and she waited while carlson tied his horse to the rear of the wagon good day mr redman folding her hands in her lap she let carlson guide her team out of town they talked of nothing important for most of the drive the weather music the theater it was a pleasure sarah told herself to spend an hour or two in the company of a man who understood art and appreciated beauty i hope you wont take offense if i offer some advice miss conway advice is always welcome she smiled at him even if its not taken i hope youll take mine jake redman is a dangerous man the kind who brings trouble to everyone around him stay away from him miss conway for your own good she said nothing for a moment surprised by the strength of the anger that rose up in her carlson had said nothing but the truth and nothing she hadnt already told herself i appreciate your concern his voice was calm and quiet and laced with regret but you wont take my advice i dont think it will be necessary its unlikely ill be seeing mr redman now that ive settled in carlson shook his head and smiled i have offended you not at all i understand your feelings for jake she corrected herself carefully mr redman im sure the trouble between him and your brother was very distressing for you carlsons mouth thinned it pains me to say that jim brought that incident on himself hes young and a bit wild yet redmans a different matter he lives by his gun and his reputation with it that sounds like no life at all now ive stirred your sympathies that certainly wasnt my intention he touched a hand lightly to hers youre a beautiful sensitive woman i wouldnt want to see you hurt she hadnt been called beautiful in what felt like a very long time since a waltz she remembered at a ball at lucillas big house thank you but i assure you im learning very quickly to take care of myself as they drove into the yard the puppy bounded up racing around the wagon and barking hes grown some carlson commented as lafitte snapped at his ankles hush now lafitte snarled when carlson lifted sarah from the wagon he has the makings of an excellent guard dog i think and thank heaven he gets along well with lucius may i offer you some coffee id like that once inside carlson took a long look ive had some difficulty picturing you here a drawing room with flowered wallpaper and blue draperies would suit you she laughed a little as she put the coffee on i think it will be some time yet before i put up wallpaper and draperies id like a real floor first please sit down from the tin on the shelf she took a few of the sugar cookies shed baked earlier in the week it pleased her to be able to offer him a napkin shed sewed out of scrap material it must be a lonely life for you i havent had time to be lonely though i admit its not what id hoped for its a pity your father never made the mine pay it gave him hope she thought of the journal she was reading he was a man who needed hope more than food youre right about that carlson sipped at the coffee she served him you know i offered to buy this place from him some time back you did sarah took the seat across from him whatever for sentiment carlson sent her an embarrassed smile foolish really my grandfather once owned this land he lost it in a poker game when i was a boy it always infuriated him he smiled again and sampled a cookie of course he had the ranch twelve hundred acres with the best water that can be had in these parts but he grumbled about losing that old mine until the day he died there must be something about it that holds a man it certainly held my father matt bought it from the gambler and dived right in he always believed hed find the mother lode though i dont think there is one after the old man died and i took over ithought it might be fitting somehow for me to bring it back into the family a tribute but matt he wouldnt part with it he had a dream sarah murmured it killed him eventually im sorry ive upset you i didnt mean to its nothing i still miss him i suppose i always will it might not be healthy for you to stay here so close to where he died its all i have carlson reached over to pat her hand as i said youre a sensitive woman i was willing to buy this place from matt id be willing to buy it from you if you feel youd like to sell sell surprised she looked over the sun was streaming through the yellow curtains at the window it made a stream of gold on the floor before long the strength of it would fade the material thats very generous of you mr carlson id be flattered ifyoud call me samuel its very generous and very kind samuel rising she walked to the window yes the sun would bleach it out the same way it bleached the land she touched a hand to the wall the adobe stayed cool it was a kind of miracle she thought like the endurance that kept men in this place i dont think im ready to give up here you dont have to decide what you want now he rose as well and moved over to lay a gentle hand on her shoulder she smiled at the gesture it was comforting to have friends who cared its been difficult adjusting here yet i feel as though i cant leave that in leaving id be deserting my father i know what it is to lose family it takes time to think straight again he turned her to face him i can say that i feel i knew matt enough to be sure hed want the best for you if you decide you want to let it go all you have to do is tell me well leave it an open offer thank you she turned and found herself flustered when he lifted both her hands to his lips i want to help you sarah i hope youll let me miss conway she jolted then sighed when she saw lucius in the doorway yes he eyed carlson then turned his head to spit you want me to put this team away please lucius stayed where he was how about the extra horse ill be riding out thank you for the company sarah it was a pleasure as they stepped outside carlson replaced his hat i hope youll let me call again of course sarah was forced to snatch up the dog when he came toward her guest snarling and snapping goodbye samuel she waited until hed started out before she put the puppy down and walked over to lucius lucius she leaned over to speak to him as he unhitched the horses you were quite rude just now if you say so miss well i do frustrated she ducked under the horses to join him mr carlson was considerate enough to drive me back from town you looked at him as though you wanted to shoot him in the head maybe for heavens sake why some snakes dont rattle casting her eyes to the sky she gave up instead she snatched the bottle of whiskey from the wagon and watched his eyes light up if you want this take off your shirt his mouth dropped as if shed hit him with a board beg pardon maam the pants too i want you to strip right down to the skin he groped at his neckcloth mind if i ask why youd be wanting me to do that miss conway im going to wash your clothes ive tolerated the smell of them and you quite long enough while im washing them you can take that extra cake of soap i bought and do the same with yourself now miss i if and only if youre clean ill give you this bottle you get a pail of water and the soap and go into that shed toss your clothes out not sure he cared for the arrangement lucius shifted his feet and if i dont then ill pour every drop of this into the dirt lucius laid a hand on his heart as she stamped off he was mortally afraid shed do it chapter seven sarah rolled up the sleeves of her oldest shirtwaist hitched up her serviceable black skirt and went to work theyd be better off burned she thought as she dunked luciuss stiff denim pants into the stream the water turned a mud brown instantly with a sound of disgust she dunked them again it would take some doing to make them even marginally acceptable but she was determined cleanliness was next to godliness that had been one of the proverbs crossstitched on mother superiors office wall well she was going to get lucius as close to god as was humanly possible whether he liked it or not leaving the pants to soak she picked up his faded blue shirt by the tips of her fingers deplorable she decided as she dampened and scrubbed and soaked absolutely deplorable she doubted the clothes had seen clean water in a year which meant luciuss skin had been just as much in need of washing shed soon fix that she began to smile as she worked the expression on his face when shed threatened to empty out the whiskey had been something to see poor lucius he might look tough and crusty but underneath he was just a sweet misguided man who needed a woman to show him the way most men did at least that was what lucilla had always said as she beat luciuss weathered shirt against the rocks sarah wondered what her friend would think of jake redman there was certainly nothing sweet about him no matter how deep down a woman might dig though he could be kind it baffled her that time and time again he had shown her that streak of goodheartedness always briefly she added her lips thinning always right before he did something inexcusable like kissing the breath out of her kissing her until her blood was hot and her mind was empty and she wanted something she didnt even understand hed had no right to do it and still less to walk away afterward leaving her trembling and confused she should have slapped him with that thought in mind sarah slapped the shirt on the water and gave a satisfied nod at the sound she should have knocked the arrogance right out of him and then it should have been she who walked away the next time there would be no next time she assured herself if jake redman ever touched her again shed shed melt like butter she admitted oh she hated him for making her wish he would touch her again when he looked at her something happened some thing frantic something shed never experienced before her heart beat just a little too fast and dampness sprang out on the palms of her hands a look was all that was necessary his eyes were so dark so penetrating when he looked at her it was as if he could see everything she was or could be or wanted to be it was absurd he was a man who lived by the gun who took what he wanted without regret or compunction all her life shed been taught that the line between right and wrong was clear and wide and wasnt to be crossed to kill was the greatest sin the most unforgivable yet he had killed and would surely kill again knowing it she couldnt care for him but care she did and want she did and need her hands were wristdeep in water when she brought herself back she had no business even thinking this way thinking about him if she had to think of a man shed do better to think of samuel carlson he was wellmannered polished he would know the proper way to treat a lady there would be no wild groping kisses from a man like him a woman would be safe cherished cared for but she wished jake had offered to drive her home this was nonsense sarah wrung out the shirt and rubbed her nose with the back of her damp hand shed had enough nonsense for the time being she would wash thoughts of jake away just as she washed the grime and grit and the good lord knew what from luciuss shirt she wanted her life to be tidy perhaps it wouldnt be as grand as shed once imagined but it would be tidy even here sitting back on her heels she looked around the sun was heading toward the buttes in the west slowly like a big golden ball in a sky the color of indian paintbrush the rocks towered their odd somewhat mystical shapes rising up and up some slender as needles others rough and thick there was a light smell of juniper here and the occasional rustle that didnt alarm her as it once would have she watched an eagle soar its wings spread wide king of the sky below the stream gurgled making its lazy way over the rocks why it was beautiful she lifted a hand to her throat surprised to discover that it was aching she hadnt seen it before or hadnt wanted to there was a wild desolate marvelous beauty here that man hadnt been able to touch or hadnt dared if the land was lawless perhaps it deserved to be for the first time since she had arrived she felt a sense of kinship of belonging of peace shed been right to stay because this was home hers at long last hers when she rose to spread the shirt over a rock she was smiling then she saw the shadow and she looked up quickly there were five of them their black hair was loose past their bare shoulders all but one sat on a horse it was he who stepped toward her silent in kneelength moccasins there was a scar white and puckered that ran from his temple catching the corner of his eye then curving like a sickle down his cheek she saw that and the blade of the knife he carried then she began to scream lucius heard the rider coming and strapped his gunbelt on over his long underwear with soap still lathered all over his face he stepped out of the shed jake pulled up his mount and took a long lazy look dont tell me its spring already damn women lucius spit expertly aint that the truth after easing off his horse jake tossed the reins over the rail lafitte immediately leaped up to rest his paws on his thigh in the way dogs have he grinned and his tongue lolled going to a dance or something no i aint going any where lucius cast a vicious look toward the house she threatened me yes sir theres no two ways about it it was a threat said lessn i took myself a bath and let her wash my clothes shed pour out every last drop of whiskey in the bottle she brought with a grin of his own jake leaned against the rail and rolled a cigarette maybe shes not as stupid as she looks she looks okay lucius muttered got a streak of stubborn in her though he wiped a soapy hand on the thigh of his long underwear what are you doing out here came out to talk to you like hell i got eyes she aint in there he said when jake continued to stare at the house i said i came to talk to you annoyed jake flicked a match and lit his cigarette have you done any checking in the mine ive taken a look she dont give a body much free time he picked up a rock and tossed it so that the puppy would have something to chase always wanting something built or fixed up cooks right good though he patted his belly cant complain about that see anything i saw where matt was working some right enough and the cavein he spit again cant say i felt real good about digging my way past it now maybe if you told me what it was i was supposed to be looking for youll know if you find it he looked back at the house shed put curtains on the windows does she ever go up there goes up not in sits by his grave sometimes breaks your heart sounds like youre going soft on her old man he reached down to give lafitte a scratch on the head wouldnt talk if i was you he only laughed when jake looked at him there werent many men who would have dared dont go icing up on me boy ive known you too long might interest you to know that samuel carlson paid a call jake blew out smoke with a shrug i know he waited took another drag then swore under his breath did he stay long long enough to make up to her kissing her hands he was both of them is that so the fury burned low in his gut and spread rapidly eyes narrowed he flicked the cigarette away half finished and watched it smolder where is she down to the stream i imagine lucius smothered a laugh and bent down to pick up lafitte before the puppy could scramble after jake i wouldnt if i was you young fella theres going to be fireworks fit for independence day jake wasnt sure what he was going to do but he didnt think sarah was going to like it he hoped she didnt she needed a short rein he decided and he was going to see to it himself letting carlson paw all over her just the thought of it made small jagged claws of jealousy slice through him when he heard her scream both guns were out of their holsters and in his hands in a heartbeat he took the last quarter of a mile at a run her screams and the sound of running horses echoing in his head when he reached the stream he saw the dust the ponies had kicked up even at a distance he recognized little bears profile there was a different kind of fire in him now it burned icecold as he bolstered his weapons lafitte came tearing down the path snarling youre too late again jake told the dog as he sniffed the ground and whined he turned as lucius came running in nothing more than his gunbelt and long johns what happened jake said nothing hunkering down lucius studied the marks left by the struggle paches he saw his shirt freshly washed and drying in the sun damn it all to hell still swearing he raced down the path toward jake let me get on my spare shirt and my boots they dont have much of a lead im going alone there was four of them maybe more five jake strode back into the clearing i ride alone listen boy even if it was little bear that dont give you no guarantees you werent no more than kids last time and you chose different ways it was little bear and im not looking for guarantees he swung into the saddle im going to get her back lucius put a hand on the saddle horn see that you do if im not back tomorrow sundown go get barker ill leave a trail even he can follow he kicked his horse into a gallop and headed north she hadnt fainted but she wasnt so sure that was a blessing shed been tossed roughly onto the back of a horse and she was forced to grip its mane to keep from tumbling off the indian with the scar rode behind her calling out to his companions occasionally and gesturing with a new governmentissue winchester hed dragged her by her hair to get her astride the horse and he still seemed fascinated by it when she felt him push his nose into it she closed her eyes shuddered and prayed they rode fast their ponies apparently tireless and obviously surefooted as they left the flats for the rocks and the hills the sun was merciless here she felt it beating down on her head as she struggled not to weep she didnt want to die weeping they would undoubtedly kill her but what frightened her more than whatever death was in store for her was what they would do to her first shed heard stories horrible barbaric stories about what was done to captive white women once shed thought them all foolishness like the stories of bogeymen conjured up to frighten small children now she feared that the stories were pale reflections of reality they climbed higher to where the air cooled and the mountains burst to life with pine and fastrunning streams when the horses slowed she slumped forward her thighs screaming from the effort of the ride they talked among themselves in words that meant nothing to her time had lost all meaning as well it had been hours she was only sure of that because the sun was low and just beginning to turn the western sky red blood red they stopped and for one wild moment she thought about kicking the horse and trying to ride free then she was being dragged to the ground with the breath knocked from her she tried to get her bearings three of the men were filling water skins at the stream one seemed hardly more than a boy but she doubted age mattered they watered their mounts and paid no attention to her pushing herself up on her elbows she saw the scarfaced indian arguing with one she now took to be the leader he had a starkly beautiful face lean and chiseled and cold there was an eagle feather in his hair and around his neck was a string of what looked like small bleached bones he studied her dispassionately then signaled to the other man she began to pray again silently desperately as the scarfaced brave advanced on her he dragged her to her feet and began to toy with her hair the leader barked out an order that the brave just snarled at he reached for her throat sarah held her breath as he ripped the cameo from her shirtwaist apparently satisfied for the moment he pushed her toward the stream and let her drink she did greedily perhaps death wasnt as close as shed feared perhaps somehow somehow she could evade it she wouldnt despair she told herself as she soothed her burning skin with the icy water someone would come after her someone jake she nearly cried out his name when she was dragged to her feet again her captor had fastened her brooch to his buckskin vest like a trophy she thought her mothers cameo wouldnt be a trophy for a savage furious she reached for it and was slapped to the ground she felt the shirtwaist rip away from her shoulder as she was pulled up by it instinctively she began to fight using teeth and nails she heard a cry of pain then rolling masculine laughter as she kicked and squirmed her hands were bound together with a leather strap she was sobbing now but with rage tossed astride the pony again she felt her ankles bound tight under its belly there was the taste of blood in her mouth and tears in her eyes they continued to climb she dozed somehow when the pain in her arms and legs grew unbearable it seemed the best escape the height was dizzying they rode along the edge of a narrow canyon that seemed to drop forever into hell she thought as her eyes drooped again straight into hell wherever they were taking her it was a different world one of forests and rivers and sheer cliffs it didnt matter she would die or she would escape there was nothing else survival thats all there is she hadnt understood what jake had meant when hed said that to her now she did there were times when there was nothing but life or death if she could escape and had to kill to do so then she would kill if she could not escape and they were planning what she feared they were she would find a way to kill herself they climbed endlessly it seemed to sarah they rode up a winding trail and into the twilight around her she could hear the call of night birds high and musical accented by the hollow hooting of an owl the trees glowed gold and red and as the wind rose it sounded through them the air chilled working through the torn shirtwaist only her pride remained as she shivered in silence exhaustion had her dreaming she was riding through the forest with lucilla chatting about the new bonnet they had seen that morning they were laughing and talking about the men they would fall in love with and marry they would be tall and strong and devastatingly handsome she dreamed of jake of a dream kiss and a real one she dreamed of him riding to her sweeping her up on his big gray mount and taking her away holding her warming her keeping her safe then the horses stopped her heart was too weary even for prayer as her an kle bonds were cut she was pulled unresisting from the horse then sprawled on the ground when her legs buckled under her there was no energy left in her for weeping so she lay still counting each breath she must have slept because when she came to again she heard the crackling of a fire and the quiet murmuring of men at a meal biting back a moan she tried to push herself up before she could a hand was on her shoulder rolling her onto her back her captor leaned over her his dark eyes gleaming in the firelight he spoke but the words meant nothing to her she would fight him she promised herself even knowing she would lose she would fight he touched her hair running his fingers through it lifting it and letting it fall it must have pleased him for he grinned at her before he took out his knife she thought almost hoped that he would slit her throat and be done with it instead he began to cut her skirt away she kicked as viciously as she could but he only parried the blows then locked her legs with his own hearing her skirt rip she struck out blindly with her bound hands as he raised his own to strike her there was a call from the campfire her kidnappers rose bows and rifles at the ready she saw the rider come out of the gloom and into the flickering light another dream she thought with a little sob then he looked at her strength poured back into her body and she scrambled to her feet jake she would have run to him but she was yanked ruthlessly back he gave no sign barely glanced her way as he walked his horse toward the group of apaches he spoke but the words were strange incomprehensible to her much time has passed little bear i felt breath on my back today little bear lowered his rifle and waited i thought never to see you again gray eyes slowly ignoring the rage bubbling inside him jake dismounted our paths have run apart now they come together again he looked steadily into eyes he knew as well as he knew his own there was between them a love few men would have understood i remember a promise made between boys we swore in blood that one would never lift a hand against the other the promise sworn in blood has not been forgotten little bear held out his hand they gripped firm hand to elbow will you eat with a nod jake sat by the fire to share the venison out of the corner of his eye he saw sarah huddled on the ground watching her face was pale with fear and exhaustion he could see bruises of fatigue under eyes that were glazed with it her clothes were torn and he knew as he ate and drank that she must be cold but if he wanted her alive there were traditions to be observed where is the rest of our tribe dead lost running little bear stared broodingly into the fire the long swords have cut us down like deer those who are left are few and hide in the mountains still they come crooked arm straw basket they live north where the winters are long and the game is scarce he turned his head again and jake saw a cold depthless anger one he understood the children do not laugh gray eyes nor do the women sing they talked as the fire blazed of shared memories of people both had loved their bond was as strong as it had been when jake had lived and learned and felt like an apache but they both knew that time had passed when the meal was over jake rose from the fire you have taken my woman little bear i have come to take her back little bear held up a hand before the scarred man beside him could speak she is not my prisoner but black hawks it is not for me to return her to you then the promise can be kept between us he turned to black hawk you have taken my woman i have not finished with her he put a hand on the hilt of his knife i will keep her he could have bargained with him a rifle was worth more than a woman but bargaining would have cost him face he had claimed sarah as his and there was only one way to take her back the one who lives will keep her he unstrapped his guns handing them to little bear there were few men he would have trusted with his weapons i will speak with her he moved to sarah as black hawk began to chant in preparation for the fight i hope you enjoyed your meal she said sniffing i actually thought you might have come to rescue me im working on it yes i could see that sitting by the fire eating telling stories my hero his grin flashed as he hauled her against him for a long hard kiss youre a hell of a woman sarah just sit tight and let me see what i can do take me home pride abandoned she gripped the front of his shirt please just take me home i will he squeezed her hands as he removed them from his shirt then he rose and he too began to chant if there was magic he wanted his share they stood side by side in the glow of the fire as the youngest warrior bound their left wrists together the glitter of knives had sarah pushing herself to her feet little bear closed a hand over her arm you cannot stop it he said in calm precise english no she struggled as she watched the blades rise oh god no they came down whistling i will spill your white blood gray eyes black hawk murmured as their blades scraped edge to edge locked wrist to wrist they hacked dodged advanced jake fought in grim silence if he lost even as his blood poured out black hawk would celebrate his victory by raping sarah the thought of it the fury of it broke his concentration and black hawk pushed past his guard and sliced down his shoulder blood ran warm down his arm concentrating on the scent of it he blocked sarah from his mind and fought to survive in the frigid night air their faces gleamed with sweat the birds had flown away at the sound of blades and the smell of blood the only sound now was the harsh breathing of the two men locked in combat intent on the kill the other men formed a loose circle around them watching the inevitability of death accepted sarah stood with her bound hands at her mouth holding back the need to scream and scream until she had no air left at the first sight of jakes blood she had closed her eyes tight but fear had had them wide again in an instant little bear still held her arm his grip light but inescapable she already understood that she was to be a kind of prize for the survivor as jake narrowly deflected black hawks blade she turned to the man beside her please if you stop it let him live ill go with you willingly i wont fight or try to escape for a moment little bear took his eyes away from the combat gray eyes had chosen his woman well only death stops it now as she watched both men tumbled to the ground she saw black hawks knife plunge into the dirt an inch from jakes face even as he drew it out jakes knife was ripping into his flesh they rolled toward the fire jake didnt feel the heat only an icecold rage the fire seared the skin on his arm before he yanked free the hilt of his knife was slick with his own sweat but the blade dripped red with his opponents blood the horses whinnied and shied when the men rolled too close then they were in the shadows sarah could see only a dark blur and the sporadic gleam of a knife but she could hear desperate grunts and the scrape of metal then she heard nothing but the sound of a man breathing hard one man with her heart in her throat she waited to see who would come back into the light bruised bloodied jake walked to her saying nothing he cut through her bonds with the blade of the stained knife still silent he pushed it into his boot and took his guns back from little bear he was a brave warrior little bear said with pain and triumph singing through him jake strapped on his gunbelt he died a warriors death he offered his hand again may the spirits ride with you brother and with you gray eyes jake held out a hand for sarah when he saw that she was swaying on her feet he picked her up and carried her to his horse hold on he told her swinging up into the saddle behind her he rode out of camp without looking back knowing he would never see little bear again she didnt want to cry but she couldnt stop her only comfort was that her tears were silent and he couldnt hear them or so she thought theyd ridden no more than ten minutes at a slow walk when he turned her around in the saddle to cradle her against him youve had a bad time duchess go on and cry for a while so she wept shamelessly her cheeks pressed against his chest the movement of the horse lulling her i was so afraid her voice hitching she clung to him he was going to i know you dont want to think about it he didnt if he did hed lose the alreadyslippery grip he had on his control its all over now will they come after us no how can you be sure as the tears passed the fear doubled back it wouldnt be honorable honorable she lifted her head to look at him in the moonlight his face looked hard as rock but theyre indians thats right theyll stand by their honor a lot longer than any white man but she had forgotten for a moment the apache in him you seemed to know them i lived with them five years little bear the one with the eagle feather is my cousin he stopped and dismounted youre cold ill build a fire and you can rest a while he pulled a blanket out of his saddlebag and tossed it over her shoulders too tired to argue sarah wrapped it tight around herself and sat on the ground he had a fire burning quickly and started making coffee without hesitation sarah bit into the jerky he gave her and warmed her hands over the flames the one you fought with did you know him yeah hed killed for her she thought and had to struggle not to weep again perhaps it had been a member of his own family an old friend im sorry she managed for what he poured coffee into a cup then pushed it into her trembling hands for all of it they were just there all at once there was nothing i could do she drank needing the warmth badly when i was in school we would read the papers hear stories i never really believed it i was certain that the army had everything under control you read about massacres he said with a dull fury in his voice that had her looking up again about settlers slaughtered and wagon trains attacked you read about savages scalping children its true enough but did you read any about soldiers riding into camps and butchering raping women putting bullets in babies long after treaties were signed and promises made did you hear stories about poisoned food and contaminated blankets sent to the reservations but that cant be the white man wants the land and the land isnt his or wasnt he took out his knife and cleaned it in the dirt hell take it one way or the other she didnt want to believe it but she could see the truth in his eyes i never knew it wont go on much longer little bear and men like him are nearly done how did you choose between one life and the other he moved his shoulders there wasnt much choice theres not enough apache in me to have been accepted as a warrior and i was raised white mostly red man thats what they called my father when he was coming up outside an army post down around tucson he kept it maybe it was pride maybe it wasnt he stopped annoyed with himself hed never told anyone so much you up to riding she wanted him to go on to tell her everything there was to tell about himself instinct held her back if she pushed she might never learn i can try smiling she reached out to touch his arm i want to oh youre bleeding he glanced down here and there let me see i should have tended these already she was up on her knees pulling away the rent material of his sleeve nothing a man likes better than to have his clothes ripped off by a pretty woman ill thank you to behave yourself she told him but she couldnt muffle a chuckle it was good to hear her laugh even if only a little most of the horror had faded from her eyes but he wanted it gone all of it heard you made lucius strip down to the skin he claimed you threatened him this time her laughter was warmer the man needed to be threatened i wish youd seen his face when i told him to take off his pants i dont suppose youd like me to do the same just the shirt should do this arm certainly needs to be bandaged she rose and modesty prevailing turned her back before she lifted the hem of her skirt to rip her petticoat im obliged he eased painfully out of his shirt ive been wondering duchess just how many of those petticoats do you wear thats certainly not a subject for discussion but its fortunate that i she turned back to him and the words slipped quietly down her throat shed never seen a mans chest before had certainly never thought a man could be so beautiful but he was firm and lean with the dark skin taut over his rib cage and gleaming in the firelight she felt the heat flash inside her pressing and throbbing in her center and then spreading through her like a drug an owl hooted behind her and made her jolt ill need some water she was forced to clear her throat those wounds should be cleaned with his eyes still on hers he lifted the canteen saying nothing she knelt beside him again to tend the cut that ran from his shoulder to his elbow this is deep youll want a doctor to look at it yes maam her eyes flicked up to his then quickly away its likely to scar ive got others yes she could see that his was the body of a hero scarred disciplined and magnificent ive caused you a great deal of trouble more than i figured on he murmured as her fingers glided gently over his skin she tied the first bandage then gave her attention to the slice in his side this one doesnt look as serious but it must be painful her voice had thickened he could feel the flutter of her breath on his skin he winced as she cleaned the wound but it was the firelight on her hair that was making him ache he held his breath when she reached around him to secure the bandage there are some nicks she murmured fascinated she touched her palm to his chest youll need some salve he knew what he needed his hand closed over her wrist her pulse jumped but she only stared as if she were mesmerized by the contrast of his skin against hers dazed she watched her own fingers spread and smooth over the hard line of his chest the fire had warmed it warmed her slowly she lifted her head and looked at him his eyes were dark darker than shed ever seen them storm clouds she thought or gunsmoke she thought she could hear her heart pounding in her head then there was no sound no sound at all he reached for her face just to rub his palm over her cheek nothing in his life had ever seemed so soft or looked so beautiful the fire was in her eyes glowing heating there was passion there he knew enough of women to recognize it her cheeks drained of color by fatigue were as delicate as glass he leaned toward her his eyes open ready for her to shy away she leaned toward him her pulse pounding waiting for him to take an inch apart they hesitated his breath merging with hers softly more softly than either of them would have thought he could he brushed his lips over hers and heard her sigh gently with hands more used to molding the grips of guns he drew her to him and felt her give her lips parted as they would only for him boldly as she had never known she could she ran her hands up his chest was he trembling she murmured to him lost in the wonder of it his body was rigid with tension even as he took the kiss deeper gloriously deeper she tasted the hot flavor of desire on his lips as they moved restless and hungry over hers eager for more she pressed against him letting her arms link tight behind him and her mouth tell him everything he felt the need burst through him like wildfire searing his mind and loins and heart her name tore out of him as he twisted her in his arms and plundered her mouth the flames beside them leaped caught by the wind and sent sparks shooting into the air he felt her body strain against his seeking more desperate he tugged at the torn neck of her blouse she could only gasp when he covered her breast with his hand his palm was rough with calluses and the sensation made her arch and ache then his mouth was on her hot and wet and greedy as it trailed down helpless she dragged her hands through his hair she had faced death this was life this was love his lips raced over her until she was a mass of nerves and need recklessly she dragged his mouth back to hers and drove them both toward delirium his hands were everywhere pressing bruising exciting with her breath hammering in and out of her lungs she began to tremble his mouth was buried at her throat the taste of her had seeped into him and now it was all he knew all he wanted to know she was shuddering over and over beneath his own her body shook jake dug his fingers into the dirt as he fought to drag himself back hed forgotten what he was what she was hadnt he proven that by nearly taking her on the ground he heard her soft breathless moan as he rolled away from her she was dizzy dazed desperate with her eyes half closed she reached out the moment she touched him he was moving away standing jake he felt as though hed been shot low in the gut and would bleed for the rest of his life in silence he smothered the fire and began to break camp sarah suddenly felt the cold and she wrapped her arms around herself whats wrong weve got to ride but her skin still tingled where his hands had scraped over it i thought that is it seemed as though damn it woman i said weve got to ride he yanked a duster out of his saddlebag and tossed it to her put that on she held it against her as she watched him secure his saddlebags again she wouldnt cry biting her lip hard to make sure she vowed she would never cry over him he didnt want her it had just been a whim he preferred another kind of woman after dragging the duster around her shoulders she walked to the horse i can mount she said coldly when he took her arm with a nod he stepped back then vaulted into the saddle behind her chapter eight the crack of the rifle echoed over the rock and sent a lone hawk wheeling sarah gritted her teeth cocked the lever and squeezed again the empty whiskey bottle exploded she was improving she decided as she mopped her brow and reloaded and she was determined to get better still lucius wandered over lafitte dancing at his heels you got a good eye there miss sarah thank you she lowered the rifle to give the pup a scratch jake was right he was going to be a big one i believe i do no one was going to have to rescue her again not from a rattlesnake not from apache marauders not from the wrath of god himself in the two weeks since jake had dropped her without a word and apparently without a thought on her doorstep shed increased her daily rifle practice her aim had sharpened a great deal since shed taken to imagining that the empty bottles and cans were jakes grinning face i told you lucius theres no need for you to watch my every move what happened before wasnt your fault i cant help feeling it was you hired me on to keep a look out around here then the first time my pantsre down so to speak miss sarah youre in trouble im back now and unharmed and im mighty grateful for it if jake hadnt just ridden up id have tried to get you back miss sarah but he was the man for it she bit back the unkind remark that sprang to mind he had saved her had risked his life to do so whatever had happened afterward couldnt diminish that im very grateful to mr redman lucius jake just done what he had to she remembered the knife fight with a shudder i sincerely hope he wont be required to do anything like it again thats why im going to keep a better eye on you i tell you the gods truth now miss sarah worrying after a womans a troublesome thing i aint had to bother since my wife died why lucius i never knew youd been married some years back quiet water was her name she was mighty dear to me you had an indian wife wanting to hear more sarah sat down on a rock spreading her skirts he didnt talk about it often at least not when he was sober but he found he was making himself comfortable and telling his tale yes maam she was apache one of little bears tribe fact is shedve been some kind of aunt to him i met her when id come out here to do some soldiering fought cheyenne mostly that would have been back in didnt mind the fighting but i sure got tired of the marching i headed south some to do a little prospecting anyways i met up with john redman that was jakes pa you knew jakes father knew him right well partnered up for a while he and his missus had hit some hard times lot of people didnt care much for the idea of him being halfapache with a little laugh he shrugged he told me once that some of his tribe didnt care much for the idea of him being halfwhite so there you go what kind of man was he hardheaded but real quiet didnt say much lessn you said something first could be funny sometimes it wouldnt occur to you for a minute or two that hed made a joke he was good for a laugh guess he was the best friend i ever had he took out his bottle and was relieved when sarah said nothing john had in mind to do some ranching so i lent a hand here and there thats how i came to meet quiet water casually sarah pleated her skirt i suppose you knew jake as a boy ill say i did lucius let go a whistling laugh tough little cuss could look a hole right through you aint changed much he was spending some time with his grandmas people wouldve thought he was one of them then cept for the eyes course he wasnt they knew it and he knew it like john said its hard not being one or the other i used to wonder what wouldve happened if quiet water and me had had kids what happened to her lucius i had gone off looking for gold his eyes narrowed as he stared off into the sun seems a regiment rode through early one morning some settler claimed his stock was stolen and that the apaches had done it so the soldiers came in looking for trouble hating indians killed most everybody but those who made it up into the rocks oh lucius lucius im so sorry unable to find words she took both his hands in hers when i come back it was done i was halfcrazy i guess rode around for days not going anywhere i guess i was hoping somebodyd come along and shoot me then i headed to the redman place theyd been burned out oh dear god nothing left but charred wood and ashes how horrible she tightened her grip on his hands oh lucius it wasnt the soldiers no leastwise they werent wearing uniforms seemed like some men from town got liquored up and decided they didnt want no breed that close by john and his missus had had trouble before like i said but this went past hard words and threats they started out to burn the barn raise hell one of them started shooting maybe theyd meant to all along theres no saying when it was over theyd burned them out and left the family for dead horror made her eyes dark and huge jake he would have been just a boy thirteen fourteen i reckon but he was past being a boy i found him where hed buried his folks he was just sitting there between the two fresh graves has his pas hunting knife in his hands still carries it she knew the knife shed seen it stained with blood for her but now all she could think of was the boy oh the poor child he must have been so frightened no maam i dont believe frighteneds the word he was chanting like in a trance the indians sometimes use war chant it was he figured on going into town and finding the men who killed his folks but you said he was only thirteen i said he was past being a boy best i could do was talk him out of it for a time till he learned to handle a gun better he learned mighty fast i aint never seen a man do with a gun what jake can do though it was hot out she rubbed the chill from her arms did he go back for them i dont rightly know i never asked i thought it best we move on until he had some years on him so we headed south didnt know what to do for mm bought him a horse and we rode together awhile i always figured hed hook up with the wrong kind but jake was never much for hooking up with anybody hedve been about sixteen when we parted ways heard about him off and on then he rode into lone bluff a few months back to lose everything that way a tear ran down her cheek its a wonder hes not filled with hate hes got it in him but its cold me i use the bottle wash it away now and then jake uses something in here he tapped his temple that boy holds more inside than anybody should have to he ever lets it out people better stand back she understood what he meant hadnt she seen it that flat dangerous look that came into his eyes that expressionless stare that was more passionate than fury more deadly than rage you care for him hes all i got that you might call family yeah i got an affection for the boy lucius squinted over at her i figure you do too i dont know what i feel for him that was a lie she knew very well what she felt how she felt she was even coming to understand why she felt he wasnt the man she had once imagined she would love but he was the only man she ever would it doesnt matter what i feel she said if he doesnt feel it back maybe he does it might be hard for him to say it right out but i always figure a womans got a sense about those things not always with a little sigh she rose theres work to be done lucius yesm there is one question what have you been doing in the mine the mine miss sarah you said yourself i have a good eye i know youve been going in there id like to know why well now fabricating wasnt luciuss strong suit he coughed and shifted his feet and peered off at nothing just having a look around for gold could be do you think youll find any matt always figured there was a rich vein in that rock and when jake he broke off when jake what asked you to look maybe he might have suggested it sometime i see sarah looked up to the top of the ridge she had always wondered what jake wanted she thought her heart shattering perhaps she knew now gold seemed to pull at the men she loved i have no objection to you working the mine lucius in fact i think its an excellent idea you must let me know if you require any tools when she looked back at him her eyes were as cool and hard as any mans the next time you ride into town you might mention to jake that sarahs pride is mine yes maam if youd like i insist she looked toward the road theres a buggy coming lucius spit and hoped it wasnt carlson as far as he was concerned the man had been too free with his visits to sarah in the past few weeks it wasnt carlson as the buggy drew closer sarah saw it was a woman holding the reins not liza she realized with a pang of disappointment the woman was dark and delicate and a stranger to her good morning sarah set the rifle against the wall of the house good morning maam the young woman sat in the buggy and sent sarah a nervous smile you sure live a ways out yes since her visitor didnt seem in a hurry to alight sarah walked to the buggy im sarah conway yes maam i know im alice alice johnson she gave the puppy a bright cheerful smile then looked at sarah again pleased to meet you its nice to meet you too miss johnson would you like to come in for some tea oh no maam i couldnt baffled by alices horrified expression sarah tried again perhaps youre lost no ive come to talk with you but i couldnt come in it wouldnt be fitting oh why well you see miss conway im one of carlottas girls carlotta wideeyed sarah looked her visitor over again she was hardly more than a girl a year or more younger than sarah herself her face was scrubbed clean and her dress was certainly modest as sarah stared thick lashes lowered over her dark eyes and a blush rushed into her cheeks do you mean you work at the silver star yes maam for nearly three months now but sarah swallowed the words when she saw alice bite her lip miss johnson if youve come to see me i suggest we talk inside its much too hot to stand in the sun i couldnt really it wouldnt be fitting miss conway fitting or not i dont wish sunstroke on either of us please come in leaving the decision in the hands of her visitor sarah walked inside alice hesitated it didnt feel right not when miss conway was a real lady but if she went back and couldnt tell carlotta that shed done what shed been sent for shed get slapped around for sure carlotta always knew when you lied and you always paid for it sarah heard the timid footsteps as she put water on to boil before she could turn and offer alice a seat the girl was bubbling oh my isnt this pretty youve got a real nice place here miss conway curtains and all thank you her smile was full and genuine it was the first time shed had company who had thought so im more and more at home here please sit down miss johnson im making tea its real kind of you but i dont feel right you giving me tea it aint proper this is my house and youre my guest of course its proper i hope youll enjoy these cookies i made them only yesterday with her fingers plucking nervously at her skirt alice sat thank you maam and dont worry i wont tell a soul i came in and sat at your table intrigued sarah poured the tea why dont you tell me what brought you out to see me carlotta shes been looking at all the dresses youve been making for the ladies in town theyre real pretty miss conway thank you just the other day after jake left jake yesm hoping she was holding the cup properly alice drank he comes into the silver star pretty regular carlottas real fond of him she dont work much herself you know unless its somebody like jake yes i see she waited for what was left of her heart to break instead it swelled with fury i suppose she might find a man like him appealing she surely does all the girls got a fondness for jake im sure she murmured well like i was saying carlotta got it into her head one day after he left that we should have us some new clothes something classy like ladies would wear she told me jake said you could sew some up for us did he yes maam she said she thought jake had a real fine idea there and she sent me on out to see about it i got me all the measurements im sorry miss johnson i really couldnt be sure to tell carlotta that i appreciate the offer theres eight of us girls miss and carlotta said shed pay you in advance i got the money thats generous but i cant do it would you like more tea i dont confused alice looked at her cup she didnt know anyone whod ever said no to carlotta if its not too much trouble she wanted to stretch out her visit though she knew that and the message shed be taking back would make carlotta box her ears miss johnson you can call me alice miss conway everybody does alice then would you mind telling me how it was you came to work for carlotta youre very young to be on your own my daddy sold me off sold you there was ten of us at home and another on the way every time he got drunk he whipped one of us or made another he got drunk a lot few months back a man passed through and daddy sold me for twenty dollars i ran off as soon as i could when i got to lone bluff i went to work for carlotta i know it aint right and proper but its better than what i had i get my meals and a bed to myself when im finished work she gave a quick uncomfortable shrug most of the men are all right your father had no right to sell you alice sometimes theres right and theres whats done if you wanted to leave carlotta im sure there would be other work for you in town proper work begging your pardon miss conway but that aint true none of the town ladies would hire me for anything and they shouldnt why how would they know if id been with one of their husbands it was sound thinking but sarah shook her head if you decide to leave ill find work for you alice stared at her wideeyed thats kind of you i knew you were a real lady miss conway and im obliged id better be heading back if youd like to visit again id be happy to see you sarah told her as she walked her out no maam that wouldnt be proper thank you for the tea miss conway sarah thought a great deal about alices visit that night as she read her fathers journal by lamplight she tried to imagine what it had been like to be sold she thought with an inward shudder by her own father like a horse or a steer it was true that she too had spent years of her life without a real family but she had always known her father loved her what he had done he had done with her best interests at heart once she would have condemned alices choice out of hand but now she thought she understood it was all the girl knew the cycle had begun with her fathers callousness and the girl was caught in it helplessly moving in the same circle selling herself time after time because she knew nothing else had it been the same for jake had the cruelty hed lived through as a child forced him into a life of restlessness and violence the scars he carried must run deep and the hate sarah looked into the soft glow of the lamp as lucius had said the hate ran cold she should have hated him she wanted to she wished the strong destructive emotion would come filling all the cracks in her feelings blocking out everything else with hate a coolheaded sharply honed hate she would have felt in control again she needed badly to feel in control again but she didnt hate him she couldnt even though she knew he had spent the night with another woman kissing another womans lips touching another womans skin she couldnt hate him but she could grieve for her loss for the death of a beauty that had never had a chance to bloom fully she had come to understand what they might have had together she had almost come to accept that they belonged together whatever their differences whatever the risks he would always live by his gun and by his own set of rules but with her briefly perhaps reluctantly he had shown such kindness such tenderness there was a place for her in his heart sarah knew it beneath the roughhewn exterior was a man who believed in justice who was capable of small endearing kindnesses hed allowed her to see that part of him a part she knew hed shared with few others then why the moment she had begun to soften toward him to accept him for what and who he was had he turned to another woman a woman whose love could be bought with a handful of coins what did it matter with a sigh she closed her fathers journal and prepared for bed she had only fooled herself into believing he could care for her whatever kindness jake had shown her would always war with his lawless nature and his restless heart she wanted a home a man by her side and children at her feet as long as she loved jake she would go on wanting and never having somehow no matter how hard it was no matter how painful she would stop loving him jake hated himself for doing it but he rode toward sarahs place a dozen excuses forming in his head he wanted to talk to lucius and check on the progress in the mine he wanted to make sure she hadnt been bitten by a snake hed wanted a ride and her place was as good as any they were all lies he just wanted to see her he just wanted to look at her hear her talk smell her hair hed stayed away from her for two weeks hadnt he he had a right he had no rights he told himself as he rode into the yard he had no rights and no business thinking about her the way he was thinking about her wanting her the way he wanted her she deserved a man who could make her promises and keep them who could give her the kind of life shed been born to live he wasnt going to touch her again that was a promise hed made himself when hed ridden away from her the last time if he touched her he wouldnt pull back that would only cause them both more misery hed hurt her he had seen that plain enough when hed left her but that was nothing compared to what he would have done if hed stayed it was quiet jake pulled up his mount and took a long cautious look around his hand hovering over the butt of his gun the dog wasnt yapping nor was there any smoke rising from the chimney the saddle creaked as he dismounted he didnt knock but pushed open the door and listened there wasnt a sound from inside he could see as his eyes scanned from one corner to the next that the cabin was empty and as tidy as a church the curtains shed sewed had already begun to fade but they moved prettily in the hot wind his shoulders relaxed shed done something here that was something else he had to admire about her shed taken less than nothing and made it a home there were pictures on the walls one was a watercolor of wildflowers in soft dreamy hues it looked like her he thought as he took a closer study all dewy and fresh and delicate flowers like that would wither fast if they werent tended he moved to the next his brows drawing together as he scanned it it was a pencil drawing a sketch he figured shed call it he recognized the scene the high arrogant buttes the sunbleached rock if you looked west from the stream youd see it it wasnt an empty place the apache knew the spirits that lived there but oddly as he studied the lines and shadows he thought sarah might know them too he would never have imagined her taking the time to draw something so stark and strong much less hang it on the wall so that she would see it every time she turned around somehow he couldnt quite figure out the why of it it suited her every bit as much as the wildflowers annoyed with himself he turned away she knew something about magic he figured didnt the cabin smell of her so that his stomach kept tying itself in knots hed be better off out in the ahfifty miles away a book caught his eye as he started out without giving a thought to her privacy he opened it apparently shed started a diary unable to resist he scanned the first page shed described her arrival in lone bluff he had to grin as he read over her recounting of the apache raid and his timely arrival shed made him sound pretty impressive even if shed noted what she called his infuriating and unchristian behavior there was a long passage about her father and her feelings about him he passed it by grief was to be respected unless it needed to be shared he chuckled out loud as she described her first night the cold can of beans and the sounds that had kept her awake and trembling until morning there were bits and pieces he found entertaining enough about the townspeople and her impressions of life in the west then he caught his name again jake redman is an enigma he puzzled over the word sure hed never heard it before it sounded a little too fancy to be applied to him i dont know if one might call him a diamond in the rough though rough he certainly is honesty forces me to admit that he has been of some help to me and shown glimmers of kindness i cant resolve my true feelings about him and i wonder why i find it necessary to try he is a law unto himself and a man wholly lacking in manners and courtesy his reputation is distressing to say the least he is what is referred to as a gunslinger and he wears his weapons as smoothly as a gentleman wears a watch fob yet i believe if one dug deeply enough one might discover a great deal of goodness there fortunately i have neither the time nor the inclination to do the digging despite his manner and his style of living there is a certain even a strong attractiveness about him he has fine eyes of clear gray a mouth that some women might call poetic particularly when he smiles and truly beautiful hands he stopped there to frown down at his hands theyd been called a lot of things but beautiful wasnt one of them he wasnt sure he cared for it still she sure did have a way with words he turned the page and would have read on but the slightest of sounds at his back had him whirling his guns gripped firmly in his hands lucius swore long and skillfully as he lowered his own pistol i aint lived this long to have you blow holes in me jake slipped his guns home youd better be careful how you come up on a man didnt you see my horse yeah i saw it just making sure didnt expect to find you poking around in here he glanced down at the book without a word jake shut it i didnt expect to find the place deserted ive been up to the mine lucius pulled a small bottle of whiskey from his pocket and its interesting he took a long pull then wiped his mouth with the back of his hand i cant figure how matt got himself caught in that cavein he was pretty sharp and i recollect them beams being secure enough looks to me like someone worked pretty hard to bring them down with a nod jake glanced at the watercolor on the wall have you said anything to her yet nope he didnt think it was the best time to tell jake that sarah had found him out theres something else i havent mentioned his face split into a grin as jake looked at nun theres gold in there boy just like matt always claimed hed found the mother lode lucius took a swig from the bottle then corked it you figured on that just a hunch want me to keep it under my hat for the time being i dont care much for playing tricks on miss sarah but i reckon youve got your reasons ive got them i wont ask you what they are i wont ask you neither what reasons you got for not coming around lately miss sarah shes been looking a mite peaked since you brought her back from the hills shes sick he asked too quickly lucius rubbed a hand over his mouth to hide a grin i figure shes got a fever all right heart fever shell get over it jake muttered as he walked outside youre looking peaked yourself when jake didnt answer he tried again sure is some woman looks soft but that streak of stubborn keeps her going see there he pointed to the vegetable patch shes got something growing there never thought id see a speck of green but there you go she waters that thing every day stubborn a stubborn womans just bound to make things happen where is she lucius had been hoping hed ask gone off driving with carlson hes been coming around here near every day drinks tea he spit kisses her fingers and calls her right out by her first name it warmed his heart to see jakes eyes harden said something about taking her to see his ranch been gone better than an hour now i dont know when ive spent a more pleasant day sarah rose from the glossy mahogany table in carlsons dining room or had a more delightful meal the pleasure has been mine carlson took her hand all mine sarah smiled and gently took her hand away you have such a beautiful home i never expected to see anything like it out here my grandfather loved beautiful things he took her elbow i inherited that love from him most of the furniture was shipped in from europe we had to make some concessions to the land he patted a thick adobe wall but theres no reason to sacrifice all our comforts this painting he guided her to a portrait of a pale elegant woman in blue silk my mother she was my grandfathers pride and joy his wife died before this house was completed everything he did from that day was for his daughter shes lovely she was even my grandfathers love and devotion couldnt keep her alive the women in my family have always been delicate this land is hard too hard for the fragile it baked the life out of her i suppose thats why i worry about you im not as delicate as you might think she thought of the ride into the mountains with her hands and feet bound youre strongwilled i find that very attractive he took her hand again before she could decide how to respond a man strode into the house he was shorter and leaner than carlson but there was enough of a resemblance around the mouth and eyes for her to recognize him his hat was pushed back so that it hung around his neck by its strap yellow dust coated his clothes he hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his pants and looked at her in a way that made her blood chill well now what have we got here miss conway there was a warning mild but definite in carlsons voice my brother jim youll have to excuse him hes been working the cattle sam handles the money i handle the rest you didnt tell me we were having company he swaggered closer he carried the scents of leather and tobacco but she found nothing appealing about it such nicelooking company i invited miss conway to lunch and it was lovely but i really should be getting back and away she thought from jim carlson you dont want to rush off the minute i get in grinning jim laid a duty hand on the polished surface of a small table we dont get enough company here at least not your kind youre just as pretty as a picture he glanced at his brother with a laugh sarah didnt understand just as pretty as a picture youd better wash up though his voice was mild carlson sent him a hard look we have some business to discuss when i get back its all business with sam jim winked at sarah now me i got time for other things sarah swallowed a sigh of relief when carlson took her elbow again good day mr carlson jim watched her retreating back yeah good day to you a real good day youll have to excuse him carlson helped sarah into the waiting buggy jims a bit rough around the edges i hope he didnt upset you no not at all she said struggling to keep a polite smile with her hands folded in her lap she began to chat about whatever came to mind you seem to be adjusting well to your new life carlson commented actually im enjoying it for selfish reasons im glad to hear it i was afraid youd lose heart and leave he let the horses prance as he turned to smile at her im very glad youre staying he pulled up so that they could have a last look at the ranch from the rise the house spread out rising two stories glowing pink in the sunlight its small glass windows glimmering neat paddocks and outbuildings dotted the land which was cut through by a blue stream and ringed by hills its lovely samuel you must be very proud of it pride isnt always enough a place like this needs to be shared ive regretted not having a family of my own to fill it until now id nearly given up hoping id find a woman to share it with me he took her hand and brought it to his lips sarah nothing would make me happier than if that woman were you she wasnt sure she could speak though she could hardly claim to be surprised hed made no secret about the fact that he was courting her she studied his face in silence he was everything she had dreamed of handsome dashing dependable successful now he was offering her everything she had dreamed of a home a family a full and happy life she wanted to say yes to lift a hand to his cheek and smile but she couldnt she looked away struggling to find the right words she saw him then he was hardly more than a silhouette on the horizon an anonymous man on horseback but she knew without seeing his face without hearing his voice that it was jake that knowledge alone made her pulse beat fast and her body yearn deliberately she turned away samuel i cant begin to tell you how flattered i am by your offer he sensed refusal and though anger tightened within him he only smiled please dont give me an answer now id like you to think about it believe me sarah i realize weve known each other only a short time and your feelings might not be as strong as mine give me a chance to change that thank you she didnt object when he kissed her hand again i will think about it that she promised herself im very grateful youre patient theres so much on my mind right now ive nearly got my life under control again and now that im going to open the mine the mine his hand tightened on hers youre going to open the mine yes she gave him a puzzled look is something wrong no no its only that its dangerous it was a measure of his ambition that he was able to bring himself under control so quickly and im afraid doing so might distress you more than you realize after all the mine killed your father i know but it also gave him life i feel strongly that he would have wanted me to continue there will you do something for me ill try think about it carefully youre too important to me i would hate to have you waste yourself on an empty dream with another smile he clucked to the horses and if you marry me ill see that the mine is worked without causing you any heartache i will think about it but her mind was crowded with other thoughts as she looked over her shoulder at the lone rider on the hill chapter nine sarah had never been more excited about a dance in her life nor had she ever worked harder the moment the plans had been announced for a town dance to celebrate independence day the orders for dresses began to pour in she left all the chores to lucius and sewed night and day her fingers were cramped and her eyes burned but she had earned enough to put through an order for the wood floor she wanted so badly after the floor sarah thought she would order glass for the windows and a proper set of dishes then when time and money allowed she was going to have lucius build her a real bedroom with a little laugh she closed her eyes and imagined it if the mine came through she would have that house with four bedrooms and a parlor but for now shed settle for a real floor beneath her feet soon she thought but before floors and windows came the dance she might have made every frock as pretty and as fashionable as her skill allowed but she wasnt about to be outdone on the afternoon of the dance she took out her best silk dress it was a pale lavender blue the color of moonbeams in a forest white lace flirted at the squarecut bodice that accented the line of her throat and a hint of shoulder there were pert bows of a deeper lavender at the edge of each poofed sleeve she laced her stays so tightly that her ribs hurt telling herself it would be worth it with her hand mirror she struggled to see different parts of herself and put them together in her mind for a complete image the flounced skirt with the bows was flattering she decided and the matching velvet ribbon at her throat was a nice touch she would have pinned her cameo to it but that like so much else had been lost she wouldnt think about that tonight she told herself as she patted her hair shed swept it up and its weight had caused her to use every hairpin she could find but she thought with a nod it looked effortless curling ever so slightly at her ears and temples it was important that she look her best very important she added pulling on her long white gloves if jake was there she wanted him to see just what hed tossed aside she swept on her white lace shawl checked the contents of her reticule then stepped outside glory be lucius stood by the wagon with his hat in his hand hed cleaned up without her having to remind him and had even taken a razor to his chin when she smiled at him he decided that if hed been ten years younger hed have given jake a run for his money lucius how handsome you look hell miss sarah i mean he cleared his throat you sure look a sight recognizing that as a compliment sarah smiled and held out a hand with as much style as he could muster lucius helped her into the wagon youre going to set them on their ears i hope so at least she hoped she set one person on his ear youre going to save a dance for me arent you lucius id be pleased to if i do say so i dance right well drunk or sober perhaps youll try it sober tonight jake saw them ride into town he was sitting at his window smoking and watching some of the cowboys racing in the streets waving their hats shooting off guns and howling independence day he thought blowing smoke at the sky most of them figured they had a right to freedom and the land theyd claimed hed come to accept that they and others like them would take the arizona territory and the rest of the west black hawk and others like him would never stop the rush and he was neither invader nor invaded maybe that was why he had never tried to put his mark on the land not since hed lost what his father had tried to build it was better to keep whatever you owned light light enough that it fit on your horse the town was full of noise and people most of the cowhands were going to get threequarters drunk and they were liable to end up shooting themselves instead of the targets cody had set up for the marksmanship contest he didnt much care he just sat at the window and watched then he saw her it hurt unconsciously he rubbed a hand over his heart where the ache centered she laughed he could hear the sound float right up to him and shimmer like water over his skin the wanting the pure strength of it made him drag his eyes away for survival but he looked back unable to stop himself she stepped out of the wagon and laughed again as liza cody ran out of her fathers store she twirled in a circle for liza and he saw all of her the white skin of her throat the hint of high round breasts the tiny waist the glow in her eyes the cigarette burned down to his fingers and he cursed but he didnt stop looking you going to sit in the window all day or take me down like you promised maggie came farther into the room her hands on her hips the boy hadnt heard a word she tugged on his shoulder ignored the name he called her and repeated herself i never promised to do anything you promised all right the night i poured you into that bed when you came in so drunk you couldnt stand he remembered the night clearly enough it had been a week after hed brought sarah back from the mountains a week since hed been going to the silver star trying to work up enough interest to take carlotta or any other woman to bed drinking had been simpler but getting blind drunk was something hed never done before and didnt intend to do again i could have gotten myself into bed well enough you couldnt even crawl up the stairs if theres one thing i know its a man whos too drunk to think now are you going to take me down or are you going to back down he grumbled but pushed himself away from the window nothing worse than a nagging woman she only grinned and handed him his hat they had no more than stepped outside when john cody came racing up mr redman mr redman ive been waiting for you yeah he pulled the boys hat over his face whys that delighted with the attention johnny grinned the contest my pas having a contest best shooting gets a brandnew saddle blanket a red one youre going to win aint you i wasnt figuring on it how come nobody shoots bettern you its a real nice blanket too go on jake maggie gave him a slap on the arm the boys counting on you i dont shoot for sport he meant to walk on but he saw johnnys face fall a red blanket the boys eyes lit instantly yessiree about the prettiest one i ever seen i guess we could look before the sentence was complete johnny had him by the hand and was pulling him across the street at the back of the store cody had set up empty bottles and cans of varying sizes each contestant stood behind a line drawn in the dirt and took his best six shots broken glass littered the ground already it costs two bits to enter johnny told him i got a short bit if you need it jake looked at the dime the boy offered the gesture touched him in a way that only those who had been offered very little through life would have understood thanks but i think i got two bits you can shoot better than jim carlson hes winning now johnny glanced over to where jim was showing off a fancy railmans spin with his shiny new smith wesson can you do that why it doesnt help you shoot any better he flipped a quarter to johnny why dont you go put my name down yessir yessiree he took time out to have a friendly shoving match with another boy then raced away going to shoot for the blanket lucius asked from behind him thinking about it but he was watching jim carlson he remembered that jim rode a big white gelding jake had seen the gleam of a white horse riding away the night sarahs shed had burned lucius tipped his hat to maggie maam that you lucius i dont believe ive ever seen you with that beard shaved he colored up and stepped away i guess a man can shave now and then without a body gawking at him i forgot you had a face under there jake com mented as he watched will metcalf hit four out of six bottles you looking for a new red blanket too nope just thought id come around and tell you hurt donley rode into town only his eyes changed is that so i thought he was in laramie not anymore he came this way while you were in new mexico started working for carlson in an easy move jake turned and scanned the area behind him donley doesnt punch cattle hasnt been known to could be carlson hired him to do something else could be jake murmured watching donley walk toward the crowd he was a big man burly at the shoulders thick at the waist he wore his graying hair long so long it merged with his beard and he was fast jake had good reason to know just how fast if the law hadnt stepped in two years before one of them would be dead now heard you had some trouble a while back some through the crowd jakes eyes met donleys they didnt need words there was unfinished business between them as she stood beside liza sarah watched jake and shivered something had come into his eyes something cold and deadly and inevitable then the crowd roared when the next contestant shattered all six bottles oh look liza gave sarah a quick shake jakes going to shoot i know its wrong but ive always wanted to see how he does it you hear such stories there was one her mouth fell open when he drew his right hand and fired i didnt even see him take it out she whispered it was just in his hand quick as a blink he hit them all sarah wrapped her shawl tighter around her he had hardly moved his gun was still smoking when he slid it back in place donley strode over flipped a quarter and waited until more targets were set sarah watched his big hand curl over the butt of his gun then he drew and fired goodness he hit all of them too that leaves dave jeffrey jim carlson jake and burt donley who is he she asked wondering why jake looked like he wanted to kill him the big man in the leather vest donley he works for samuel carlson ive heard talk about him too the same kind of talk as you hear about jake only only well you know how i told you johnnys been tagging after jake pestering him and talking his ear off i cant say it worries me any but if he got within ten feet of burt donley id skin him alive the crowd shifted as cody brought the line back five feet when the first man aimed and fired missing two bottles sarah saw johnny tug on jakes arm and whisper something to her surprise jake grinned and ruffled the boys hair there it was again she thought that goodness that basic kindness yet she remembered the look that had come into his eyes only moments before who are you she wanted to ask as if hed heard her jake turned his head their eyes met and held she felt a flood of emotions rise up uncontrollably and again wished she could hate him for that alone you keep looking at her like that maggie murmured at his side youre going to have to marry her or ride fast in the other direction shut up maggie she smiled as sweetly as if hed kissed her cheek just thought youd like to know that sam carlson aint too pleased by the way you two are carrying on jakes gaze shifted and met carlsons he had come up to stand behind sarah and lay a proprietary hand on her shoulder jake considered allowing himself the pleasure of shooting him for that alone hes got no claim not for lack of trying better move fast boyo the onlookers cheered again as jim carlson nipped five out of six targets taking his time jake reloaded his pistol then moved to the line the six shots sounded almost like one when he lowered his colt six bottles had been shattered donley took his place six shots six hits the line was moved farther back they cant do it from here liza whispered to sarah no one could sarah just shook her head it wasnt a game any more there was something between the two men something much deeper much darker than a simple contest of skill others sensed it too she could hear the murmur of the crowd and see the uneasy looks jake moved behind the line he scanned the targets judging the distance taking mental aim then he did what he did best he drew and fired on instinct bottles exploded one by one there was nothing left but a single jagged base without pausing he drew his other gun and shattered even that there was silence as donley stepped forward he drew and the gun kicked in his hand with each shot when he was done a single bottle remained unbroken congratulations redman cody brought the blanket over hoping to dispel some of the tension relief made him let out his breath audibly when sheriff barker strolled over that was some shooting boys he gave each man a casual nod will metcalf stood at his shoulder as directed good to get it out of your system with a few bottles either one of you catches a bullet tonight theres sure no way i can doubt who put it there the warning was given with a smile that was friendly enough behind sarah carlson gave a quick shake of his head without speaking donley made his way through the crowd which parted for him i aint never seen nobody shoot like that johnny looked up at jake with awe and wonder in his eyes jake tossed the blanket to him there you go his eyes widened even farther i can have it you got a horse dont you yes sir i got me a bay pony red ought to look real nice on a bay why dont you go see with a whoop johnny raced off only to be caught by his mother after a minor scuffle he turned back grinning thanks mr redman thanks a lot you sure did please that boy pink barker commented i dont need a blanket barker only shook his head youre a puzzle jake i cant help but have a liking for you thats a puzzle to me sheriff most lawmen got other feelings maybe so either way id be obliged if youd keep those guns bolstered tonight you wouldnt want to tell me what there is between you and donley jake sent him an even look no didnt figure you would he spit out tobacco juice well im going to have me some chicken and dance with my wife there were a dozen tables lined up along one side of the big canvas tent even before the music started more than half of the food was gone women young and old were flirting pleased to be shown off in their best dresses when the fiddle started couples swarmed onto the floor liza in her pink muslin grabbed wills hand and pulled him with her carlson dashing in his light brown suit and string tie bowed to sarah id be honored if youd step out with me sarah with a little laugh she gave him a formal curtsy id be delighted the music was fast and cheerful despite the heat the dancing followed suit at the front of the tent the musicians fiddled and plucked and strummed tirelessly and the caller wet his whistle with free beer couples swung and sashayed and kicked up their heels in a reel it was different from the dances sarah had attended in philadelphia wonderfully different she thought as she twirled in luciuss arms hoots and hollers accompanied the music as well as handclapping footstamping and whistles you were right lucius laughing she laid a hand on her speeding heart when the music stopped i was yes indeed youre a fine dancer and this is the best party ive ever been to she leaned over impulsively and kissed his cheek well now his face turned beet red with embarrassed pleasure why dont i fetch you a cup of that punch that would be lovely sarah lizas face was nearly as pink as luciuss when she rushed over and grabbed sarahs arm my goodness whats wrong nothing nothing in the world is wrong impatient liza dragged sarah to a corner of the tent i just got to tell somebody or bust then tell me id hate to see you rip the seams of that dress i was just outside taking a little air she looked quickly right then left will came out after me he kissed me he did twice i guess my heart just about stopped one brow lifted sarah struggled with a smile i suppose that means youve decided to let him be your beau were getting married liza blurted out oh liza really thats wonderful delighted sarah threw her arms around her friend im so happy for you when well hes got to talk to pa first liza chewed her lip as she glanced toward her father but i know its going to be all right pa likes will of course he does liza i cant tell you how happy i am for you i know when her eyes filled liza blinked and sniffled oh lordy i dont want to cry now no dont or ill start laughing liza hugged her again i cant wait i just cant wait itll be your turn before long the way samuel carlson cant take his eyes off you i have to admit i used to have a crush on him she gave a quick wicked smile mostly i thought about using him to make will jealous im not going to marry samuel i dont think im ever going to get married oh nonsense if not samuel theres bound to be a man around here wholl catch your eye the musicians began to play again a waltz half smiling sarah listened the trouble is she heard herself saying one has but he isnt the kind who thinks about marriage but who liza broke off when she saw sarahs eyes go dark oh my she said under her breath as she watched jake come into the tent and cross the room there might have been no one else there no one at all the moment hed walked in everything had faded but the music and him she didnt see carlson start toward her to claim the waltz nor did she see his jaw clench when he noted where her attention was focused she only saw jake coming toward her he didnt speak he just stopped in front of her and held out a hand sarah flowed like water into his arms she thought it must be a dream he was holding her spinning her around and around the room while the music swelled in her head his eyes never left hers without thinking she lifted her hand from his shoulder to touch his face and watched his eyes darken like storm clouds flustered by her own behavior she dropped her hand again i didnt imagine you would dance my mother liked to you havent she broke off it was shameless the devil with it you havent been by to see me no he was never any help sarah thought why you know why he was crazy to be doing even this holding her torturing himself she had lowered her eyes at his words but she raised them again now the look was clear and challenging are you afraid to see me no that was a lie and he didnt lie often but you should be you dont frighten me jake you havent got the sense to be scared sarah when the music stopped he held her a moment longer if you did youd run like hell any time i got close youre the one doing the running she drew out of his arms and walked away it was difficult to hold on to her composure difficult not to fume and stamp and scream as she would have liked with her teeth gritted she stood up for the next dance with the first man who asked her when she looked again jake was gone sarah carlson appeared at her side with a cup of lemonade thank you her small silk fan was hardly adequate for the july heat its a lovely party isnt it yes more so for me because youre here she sipped using the drink as an excuse not to respond i dont want to spoil your evening sarah but i feel i must speak my mind of course what is it youre stepping on very dangerous ground with jake redman oh her dander rose and she fought it down again how is that samuel you must know him for what he is my dear a killer a hired gun a man like that will treat you with no more respect than he would a woman who was less of a lady whatever you think of him samuel mr redman has come to my aid a number of times if nothing else i consider him a friend hes no ones friend stay away from him sarah for your own sake her spine shot ramrodstraight that doesnt sound like advice any longer but like a demand recognizing the anger in her eyes he shifted ground consider it a request he took her hand i like to think we have an understanding sarah im sorry gently she took her hand from his we dont i havent agreed to marry you samuel until i do i feel no obligation to honor a request now if youll excuse me id like some air alone knowing she had been unnecessarily short with him she hurried out of the tent the moon was up now and nearly full taking the deep long breaths sister madeleine had always claimed would calm an unhealthy temper she studied it surely the moon had been just as big and white in the east but it had never seemed so just as the sky had never seemed so vast or so crowded with stars or the men as impossible the breathing wasnt going to work she discovered shed walk off her anger instead shed taken no more than five steps when the shadow of a man brought her up short she watched jake flick away a cigarette its a hot night for walking thank you for pointing that out she said stiffly and continued on her way theres a lot of drinking going on tonight a lot of men in town who dont get much chance to see pretty women much less hold on to one walking alones not smart your advice is noted she stormed away only to have her arm gripped do you have to be so ornery yes she yanked her arm free now if thats all you have to say id like to be alone i got more to say he bit off the words then dug into his pocket this belongs to you oh she took the cameo closing her fingers around it i thought it was gone the apache with the scar hed taken it he was wearing it when when you killed him she thought i took it back ive been meaning to give it to you but it slipped my mind that was another lie hed kept it because hed wanted to have something of her even for a little while thank you she opened her bag and slipped the cameo inside it means a great deal to me the sound of high wild feminine laughter tightened her lips apparently there was a party at the silver star tonight as well she wouldnt soften toward him not now not ever again im surprised youre still here id think a dance would be a bit tame for your tastes dont let me keep you damn it i said i dont want you walking around alone sarah looked down at the hand that had returned to her arm i dont believe im obliged to take orders from you now let go of me go back inside ill go where i want when i want she jerked free a second time and with whom i want if youre talking about carlson im going to tell you now to stay away from him are you the temper that had bubbled inside her when one man had warned her boiled over at the nerve of this one you can tell me whatever you choose but dont choose to listen ill see samuel when it pleases me to see him so he can kiss your hand the anger he was keeping on a short rein strained for freedom so you can have the town talking about you spending the day at his place you have quite a nerve she whispered you who spends your time with that woman paying her for attention how dare you insinuate that theres anything improper in my behavior she stepped closer to stab a finger at his chest if i allow samuel to kiss my hand thats my affair hes asked me to marry him the last thing she expected was to be hauled off her feet so that her slippers dangled several inches from the ground what did you say i said he asked me to marry him put me down he gave her a shake that sent hairpins flying i warn you duchess you think long and hard about marrying him because the same day youre his wife youre his widow thats a promise she had to swallow her heart which was lodged in her throat is a gun your answer for everything slowly his eyes on hers he set her down stay here i dont he shook her again by god youll stay here right here or ill tie you to a rail like a badtempered horse scowling after him she rubbed the circulation back into her arms of all the rude highhanded then her eyes grew wide oh dear lord she thought hes going to kill someone flinging a hand to her throat she started to run he caught her on his way back when she was still two feet from the tent dont you ever listen i thought i was afraid that i was going to put a bullet in carlsons heart his mouth thinned so she cared that much to come running to save him theres time for that yet taking a firmer grip on her arm he pulled her with him what are you doing taking you home you are not she tried and failed to dig in her heels im not going with you and im not ready to go home too bad impatient with her struggles he swooped her up stop this at once and put me down ill scream go right ahead he dumped her on the wagon seat she scrambled for the reins but he was faster lucius will take me home when i choose to go home lucius is staying in town jake cracked the reins now why dont you sit back and enjoy the ride and keep quiet he added when she opened her mouth or i swear ill gag you chapter ten dignity despite the circumstances no sarah thought correcting herself because of the circumstances she would maintain her dignity it might be difficult at the speed jake was driving and given the state of her own temper but she would never never forget she was a lady she wished she were a man so she could knock him flat control jake kept his eyes focused over the horses heads as they galloped steadily and wished it was as easy to control himself it wasnt easy but hed used his control as effectively as he had his colts for most of his life he wasnt about to lose it now and do something hed regret he thought it was a shame that a man couldnt slug a woman in stony silence they drove under the fat full moon some might consider it a night for romance sarah thought with a sniff not her she was certain shed never see another full moon without becoming furious dragging her off in the middle of a party she fumed trying to give her orders on her personal affairs threatening to tie her up like like a horse she remembered of all the highhanded arrogant illmannered taking a long cautious breath she blocked her thoughts shed lose more than her dignity if she allowed herself to dwell on jake redman the dog sent up a fast frantic barking as they drove into the yard he scented sarah and the tall man who always scratched him between the ears tongue lolling he jumped at the side of the wagon clearly pleased to have his mistress home one look had him subsiding and slinking off again shed worn that same look when hed tried to sharpen his teeth on one of her kid slippers the moment jake had pulled the horses up in front of the house sarah gathered her skirts to step down haste and temper made her careless and she caught the hem before she could remind herself about her dignity she was tugging it free she heard the silk rip now see what youve done just as angry but without the encumbrances jake climbed down from the opposite side if youd have held on a minute id have given you a hand oh really with her chin lifted she marched around the front of the wagon youve never done a gentlemanly thing in your life you eat with your hat on swear and ride in and out of here without so much as a good day or a goodbye he decided she looked much more likely to bite than her scrawny dog those are powerful faults faults she lifted a brow and stepped closer i havent begun to touch on your faults if i began id be a year older before i could finish how dare you toss me in the wagon like a sack of meal and bring me back here against my wishes she was stunning in the moonlight her cheeks flushed with anger her eyes glowing with it i got my reasons do you id be fascinated to hear them so would he he wasnt sure what had come over him unless it was blind jealousy that wasnt a thought he wanted to entertain go to bed duchess i have no intention of going anywhere she grabbed his arm before he could lead the horses away and neither will you until you explain yourself you accosted me manhandled me and threatened to kill samuel carlson it wasnt a threat he took her hand by the wrist and dragged it away from his arm the next time he touches you ill kill him he meant it sarah realized she stood rooted to the spot the ways of the west might still be new to her but she recognized murder when she saw it in a mans eyes with her shawl flying behind her she raced after him are you mad maybe what concern is my relationship with samuel carlson to you i assure you that if i didnt wish samuel or any man to touch me i would not be touched so you like it the horses shied nervously when he spun around to her you like having him hold you put his hands over you kiss you she would have suffered the tortures of hell rather than admit that carlson had done no more than kiss her fingers and that the only man who had done more was standing before her now she stepped forward until she was toetotoe with him ill risk repeating myself and say that its none of your business the way she lifted that chin he thought she was just asking to have it punched i figure it is he dragged the horses inside the shed to unharness them you figure incorrectly sarah followed him inside dignified or not she was going to have her say what i do is my business and mine alone ive done nothing im ashamed of and certainly nothing i feel requires justification to you if i allow samuel to court me you have no say in the matter whatsoever is that what you call it he dragged the first horse into its stall courting she went icily still have you another name for it maybe ive been wrong about you he took the second horse by the bridle as he studied sarah i thought you were a bit choosier then again you didnt pull back when i put my hands on you he grabbed her wrist before she could have the satisfaction of slapping his face how dare you her breath heaved through her lips how dare you speak to me that way when she jerked free her shawl fell to the ground unnoticed no i didnt object when you touched me by god i wish i had you make me feel the words backed up in her throat sarah dug her fingers into her palms until she could choke them free you made me feel things i still dont understand you made me trust you and those feelings when it was all a lie you made me want you when you didnt want me back after youd done that you turned away as though it had meant nothing pain clawed through his gut what she was saying was true the hurt shining from her eyes was real youre better off he said quietly as he led the horse into a stall i couldnt agree more she wanted to weep but if you think that gives you any right to interfere in my life youre wrong very wrong you jumped mighty fast from my arms to his bitterness hardened the words even as he cursed himself for saying them i it was too much much more than she could bear driven by fury she grabbed his shirt with both hands it wasnt i who jumped it was you you left me here without a word then rode straight to the silver star you kissed me then rubbed my taste from your mouth so that you could kiss her who he caught her by the shoulder before she could rush back outside who i have nothing more to say to you you started it now finish it whose bed do you have me jumping in sarah carlottas she threw the name at him with all the hurt and fury that was bottled up inside of her you left me to go to her if that wasnt enough hurt and humiliation you told her to hire me hire you shock had his fingers tightening bruising her flesh what the hell are you talking about you know very well you told her she should hire me to sew dresses for her and her the others sew he didnt know if he should laugh or curse slowly he released his grip and let his hands fall to his sides whatever else you think about me you should know im not stupid i dont know what i think about you she was fighting back tears now and it infuriated her it was the gleam of those tears that had him explaining when he would have preferred to keep silent i never told carlotta to hire you for anything and i havent been with he broke off swearing before he could stride out she snatched his arm again shed conquered her tears but she couldnt stop her heart from pounding are you telling me that you havent been to the silver star no im not telling you that i see with a bitter little laugh she rubbed her temple so youve simply found and bought another woman who suits you poor carlotta she must be devastated it would take a hell of a lot more than that and i havent bought anything in the silver star but whiskey since you since i got back to town why she had to force even a whisper through her lips thats my business cursing himself he started out again only to have her rush to stop him i asked you a question i gave you my answer he scooped up her shawl and pushed it into her hands now go to bed she tossed the filmy lace on the ground again im not going anywhere and neither are you until you tell me why you havent been with her or anyone because i cant stop thinking about you enraged he shoved her back against the wall with a force that had pins scattering and her hair tumbling wild and free to her waist he wanted to frighten her frighten her half as much as she frightened him youre not safe with me duchess he leaned close to her dragging a hand roughly through her hair remember that she pressed her damp hands against the wall it wasnt fear she felt the emotion was strong and driving but it wasnt fear you dont want me wanting yous eating holes in me his free hand slid up to circle her neck id rather be shot than feel the way you make me feel how do i make you feel she murmured reckless it was true but it wasnt everything and thats not smart not for either of us ill hurt you he squeezed lightly trying to prove it to them both and i wont give a damn so you better run while i still have a mind to let you im not running even if she had wanted to it would have been impossible her legs were weak and trembling she was already out of breath but you are knowing exactly what she was doing what she was risking she raised her chin threats come easily to you if you were the kind of man you say you are and you wanted me youd take me right here right now his eyes darkened they were almost black as they bored into hers she didnt wince as his fingers tightened painfully in her hair instead she kept her chin up and dared him damn you he brought his mouth down hard on hers to scare her he told himself as he pressed her back against the wall and took his fill to make her see once and for all what he was ruthless knowing she would bruise he dragged his hands over her he touched her the way he would have touched a girl at the silver star boldly carelessly he wanted to bring her to tears to make her sob and tremble and beg him to leave her alone maybe then he would be able to he heard her muffled cry against his mouth and tried to pull back her arms circled him drawing him in she gave herself totally unrestrainedly to the embrace he was trying to hurt her she knew but he couldnt she would make him see that being in his arms would never cause her pain she gasped forced to grip him tighter to keep her balance when his mouth roamed down her throat spreading luxuriant heat the scraping of his teeth against her skin had her moaning too aroused to be shocked by her own actions she tugged at his shirt she wanted to touch his skin again wanted to feel the warmth of it he was losing himself in her no he was already lost her scent the fragility of it had his senses spinning her mouth the hunger of it clawed at his con trol then she said his name it was a sigh a prayer and broke the last bonds he pulled her down into the hay desperate for her the silk of her dress rustled against his hands as he dragged it from her shoulders a wildness was on him peeling away right and wrong as he tore the silk away to find her terror rose up to grab her by the throat but it wasnt terror of him it was terror of the need that had taken possession of her it ruled her drove her beyond what could and could not be as ruthless as he she ripped at his shirt he was yanking at her laces cursing them cursing himself impatient with encumbrances he shrugged out of his shirt then sucked in his breath when her fingers dug into his flesh to pull him closer hot quick kisses raced over her face she couldnt catch her breath not even when he tore her laces loose they rolled over on the hay as they fought to free themselves and each other of the civilized barrier of clothing she arched when he filled his hands with her breasts too steeped in pleasure to be ashamed of her nakedness her pulse hammered at dozens of points making her thoughts spin and whirl and center only on him she was willowslim soft as the silk hed torn delicate as glass for all her fragility he couldnt fight her power over him he could smell the hay the horses the night he could see her eyes her hair her skin as the moonlight pushed through the chinks in the shed to shimmer over them once more just once more he tried to bring himself to sanity for her sake for his own then she lifted her arms to him and took him back he was lean and firm and strong sarah tossed her common sense aside and gave herself to the need to the love his eyes were dark dangerously dark his skin gleamed like copper in the shadowed light she saw the scar that ran down his arm as his mouth came bruisingly back to hers she ran a gentle finger over it there was no turning back for either of them the horses scraped the ground restlessly in their stalls in the hills a coyote sent up a wailing lonesome song they didnt hear she heard her name as he whispered it but that was all the hay scratched her bare skin as he covered her body with his own she only sighed he felt the yielding gloried in it he tasted the heat and the honey as he drew her breast into his mouth a breathless moan escaped her at this new intimacy then his tongue began to stroke to tease the pleasure built painful beautiful tugging at her center as his teeth tugged at her nipples it was unbearable it was glorious she wanted to tell him wanted to explain somehow but she could only say his name over and over he felt her thigh tremble when he stroked a hand along it then he heard her gasp of surprise her moan of desire when he touched what no man had ever dared to touch his he took her as gently as his grinding need would allow toward her first peak she was his she cried out her body curving like a bow as she crested the breath burned in his lungs as he crushed his mouth to hers and took her flying again she held on rocked dazed and desperate so this was love this was what a man and woman brought to each other in the privacy of the night it was more so much more than she had ever dreamed tears streamed from her eyes to mix with the sweat that slicked her body and his please she murmured against his mouth unsure of what she was asking please he didnt want to hurt her with that part of his mind that still functioned he prayed he could take her painlessly his breathing harsh and ragged he entered her slowly trying to soothe her with his mouth and his hands lights exploded behind her eyes brilliant white lights that flashed into every color shed ever seen or imagined the heat built and built until she was gasping from it unaware that her nails had scraped down his back and dug in then she was running racing speeding toward something unknown something urgently desired like life like breath like love instinct had her hips moving joy had her arms embracing she lost her innocence in a wild burst of pleasure that echoed endlessly the moonlight slanted across her face as she slept he watched her though his body craved sleep his mind couldnt rest she looked almost too beautiful to be real curled into the hay her hair spread out her skin glowing covered by nothing more than the thin velvet ribbon around her neck hed recognized the passion in her from the beginning he had suppressed his own for too long not to recognize it when it was suppressed in another shed come to him openly honestly innocently and of all the sins hed ever committed the greatest had been taking that innocence from her hed had no right he pressed his fingers against his eyes hed had no choice the kind of need hed felt for her still felt he realized left no choice he was in love with her he nearly laughed out loud that kind of thinking was dangerous dangerous to sarah the things he loved always seemed to end up dead destroyed his gaze shifted her dress was bundled in a heap near her feet on the pale silk lay his gunbelt that said it all jake decided he and sarah didnt belong together any more than his colts and her silk dress did he didnt belong with anyone he shifted started to rise but sarah stirred and reached for his hand jake yeah just the way she said his name made desire quicken in him slowly a smile curving her lips she opened her eyes she hadnt been dreaming she thought he was here with her she could smell the hay feel it she could see the glint of his eyes in the shadowed light her smile faded whats wrong nothings wrong turning away he reached for his pants why are you angry im not angry he yanked his pants over his hips as he rose why the hell should i be angry i dont know she was determined to be calm nothing as beautiful as what had happened between them was going to be spoiled by harsh words she found her chemise noted that one shoulder strap was torn and slipped it on are you going somewhere he picked up his gunbelt because it troubled him to see it with her things i dont think id care to walk back to town and lucius has my horse i see is that the only reason youre staying he turned ready to swear at her she was standing very straight her hair drifting like clouds around her face and shoulders her chemise skimmed her thighs and dipped erotically low at one breast because his mouth had gone dry he could only shake his head she smiled then and held out a hand come to the house with me stay with me it seemed he still had no choice he closed his hand over hers sarah awoke with lafitte licking her face go away she muttered and turned over you asked me to stay jake hooked an arm around her waist he watched her eyes fly open saw the shock the remembering and the pleasure i was talking to the dog she snuggled closer surely there was no more wonderful way to wake up than in the arms of the man you loved he figured out how to climb up but he hasnt figured out how to get down jake leaned over to pat lafittes head jump he said then rolled sarah on top of him is it morning nope he slid a hand up to cup her breast as he kissed her but the suns up oh it dimmed as his hands moved over her day night summer winter what did time matter he was here with her taking her back to all those wonderful places he had shown her she went willingly at dawn as she had on the blanket of hay and then again and again on the narrow cot as the moon had set he taught her everything a woman could know about the pleasures of love about needs stirred and needs met he showed her what it was like to love like lightning and thunder and he showed her what it was to love like soft rain she learned that desire could be a pain burning hot through the blood she learned it could be a joy rushing sweet under the skin but though she was still unaware of it she taught him much more taught him that there could be beauty and comfort and hope they came together with the sun rising higher and the heat of the day chasing behind it later when she was alone in the cabin sarah cooled and bathed her skin this was how it could be she thought dreamily early every morning she would heat the coffee while he fed the stock and fetched fresh water from the stream she would cook for him and tend the house together they would make something out of the land out of their lives something good and fine they would start a family she pressed a hand lightly against her stomach and wondered if one had already begun what a beautiful way to make a child she thought running her fingers over her damp skin what a perfect way she caught herself blushing and patted her skin dry it wasnt right to think that way not when they werent married not when he hadnt even asked her would he sarah slipped on her shirtwaist and buttoned it quickly hadnt she herself said he wasnt the kind of man who thought of marriage and yet could he love her the way he had loved her and not want to spend his life with her what had mrs orourke said sarah thought back as she finished dressing it had been something about a smart woman bringing a man around to marriage and making him think it had been his idea all along with a light laugh she turned toward the stove she considered herself a very smart woman something funny she glanced around as jake walked in no not really i guess im just happy he set a basket of eggs on the table i havent gathered eggs since my mother for a long time as casually as she could she took the eggs and started preparations for breakfast did your mother have chickens when you were a boy yeah is that coffee hot sit down ill pour you some he didnt want to talk about his past she decided perhaps the time wasnt right yet i was able to get a slab of bacon from mr cobb she sliced it competently while the pan heated ive thought about getting a few pigs lucius is going to grumble when i ask him to build a sty but i dont think hed complain about eating ham i dont suppose you know anything about raising pigs would you listen to her jake thought as he tilted back in her chair the duchess from philadelphia talking about raising pigs you deserve better he heard himself say the bacon sizzled as she poured the coffee better than what than this place why dont you go back east sarah and live like you were meant to she brought the cup to him is that what you want jake you want me to go its not a matter of what i want she stood beside him looking down id like to hear what you want their eyes held hed had some time to think and think clearly but nothing seemed clear enough when he looked at her coffee he said taking the cup your wants are admirably simple take your hat off at my table she snatched it off his head and set it aside he just grinned running a hand through his hair yes maam good coffee duchess its nice to know i do something that pleases you she let out a yelp when he grabbed her from behind and spun her around you do a lot that pleases me he kissed her hard and long a whole lot really she tried to keep her tone aloof but her arms had already wound around his neck a pity i cant say the same i guess that was some other woman who had her hands all over me last night her laugh was muffled against his lips i brought your things over from the shed dress is a little worse for wear four petticoats he nipped her earlobe i hope you dont pile that many on every day around here i dont intend to discuss and that contraption you lace yourself into lucky you dont pass out cant figure you need it your waists no bigger around than my two hands i ought to know he proved it by spanning her why do you want to strap yourself into that thing i have no intention of discussing my undergarments with you i took them off you seems i should be able to talk about them blushing to the roots of her hair she struggled away the bacons burning he took his seat again and picked up his coffee how many of those petticoats do you have on now after rescuing the bacon she sent him a quick flirtatious look over her shoulder youll just have to find out for yourself pleased at the way his brows shot up she went back to her cooking he was no longer certain how to handle her with breakfast on the table the scents wafting cozily in the air and sarah sitting across from him jake searched his mind for something to say i saw your pictures on the wall you draw real nice thank you ive always enjoyed it if id known that my father was living here that is if id known how a few sketches would brighten the house up i would have sent him some i did send a small watercolor she frowned a little it was a selfportrait from last christmas i thought he might like to know what i looked like since id grown up its strange he had all the letters id written to him in that little tin box in the loft but the sketch is nowhere to be found ive been meaning to ask the sheriff if he might have forgotten to give it to me if barker had it hed have seen you got it back he didnt care for the direction his thoughts were taking you sure it got this far mail gets lost oh yes he wrote me after he received it liza also mentioned that my father had been rather taken with it and had brought it into the store to show around might turn up i suppose she shrugged ive given this place a thorough cleaning but i might not have come across it ill look again when lucius puts in the floor what floor the wooden floor ive ordered boards she broke off a bite of biscuit actually i ordered extra i have my heart set on a real bedroom out the west wall i think my sewing moneys coming in very handy sarah last night you said something about carlotta telling you id given her some idea about having you sew for her he watched her stiffen up immediately when did you talk to her i didnt i have no intention of talking to that woman he rolled his tongue into his cheek he doubted sarah would be pleased to know that her tone amused him where did you hear that from alice johnson she works in that place apparently carlotta had her drive out here to negotiate for my services alice he cast his mind back juggling faces with names shes the little one dark hair big eyes sarah drew in a quiet indignant breath thats an accurate description you seem to know the staff of the silver star very well i dont know as id call them staff but yeah i know one from the other rising she snatched up his empty plate and im sure they know you quite well when he just grinned she had to fight back the urge to knock the look off his face with the castiron skillet ill thank you to stop smirking at me yes maam but he went right on you sure are pretty when you get fired up if thats a compliment she said wishing it didnt make her want to smile youre wasting your breath i aint much on compliments but youre pretty and thats a fact i guess youre about the prettiest thing ive ever seen especially when youre riled is that why you continue to go out of your way to annoy me i expect come here she smoothed down her skirt i will not he rose slowly youre ornery too cant figure why it appeals to me he dragged her to him after a moments feigned struggle she laughed up at him ill have to remember to stay ornery and annoyed then he said nothing the way shed looked up at him had knocked the breath out of his body he pulled her closer holding on wishing content sarah nuzzled his shoulder before he could draw her back she framed his face with her hands and brushed her lips over his youre still tying me up in knots he muttered thats good i dont intend to stop he stepped back then gripped her hands with his which one did he kiss i dont know what you mean carlson she gave a surprised gasp when his fingers tightened on hers which hand did he kiss sarah kept her eyes on his both she watched the fury come then and was amazed at how quickly how completely he masked it but it was still there she could feel it rippling through him jake he shook his head then in a gesture that left her limp he brought her hands to his lips then he dropped them obviously uncomfortable and dug his own hands into his pockets i dont want you to let him do it again i wont her response should have relaxed him but his tension doubled just like that yes just like that he turned away and began to pace her brow lifted she realized shed never before seen him make an unnecessary movement if he took a step it was to go toward or away ive got no right there was fury in his voice the same kind she heard outside the tent the night before in contrast hers was soft and soothing you have every right the only right im in love with you now he didnt move at all he froze as a man might when he heard a trigger cocked at the back of his head she simply waited her hands folded at her waist her eyes calm and clear you dont know what youre saying he managed at last of course i do and so do you with her eyes on his she walked to him do you think i could have been with you as i was last night this morning if i didnt love you he stepped back before she could touch him it had been so long since hed been loved that hed forgotten what it could feel like it filled him like a river and its currents were strong ive got nothing for you sarah nothing yourself she reached a hand to his cheek im not asking for anything youre mixing up what happened last night with with what she challenged do you think because you were the first man that i dont know the difference between love and lust can you tell me its been like that for you before with anyone can you no he couldnt and he couldnt tell her it would never be that way with anyone but her lucius will be back soon he said instead ill go down and get the water you wanted before i leave and that was all she thought damn him for turning his back on her again he didnt believe her she thought he thought she was just being foolish and romantic but no no that wasnt right she realized that wasnt it at all it came to her abruptly and with crystalline clarity he did believe her and that was why he had turned away he was as frightened and confused by her love as she had been by the land it was just as foreign to him just as difficult to understand and accept she could change that taking a long cleansing breath she turned to her dishes she could change that in the same way she had changed herself she embraced the land now called it her own one day he would do the same with her she heard the door open again and she turned smiling jake but it was burt donley who filled the doorway chapter eleven wheres redman panic came first and it showed in her wide wild eyes she was still holding the skillet and she had one mad thought of heaving it at his head but his hand was curled over the butt of his gun she saw in his eyes what she had never seen in jakes what she realized shed never seen in any mans not even in those of the apache who had kidnapped her a desire even an eagerness to kill he stepped inside and through the thickness of his beard she saw that he was smiling i asked you wheres redman hes not here it surprised her how calm a voice could sound even when a heart was pounding she had a man to protect the man she loved i dont believe i asked you in his smile widened into a grin you aint going to tell me he brought you all the way out here last night and then left a pretty thing like you all alone she was terrified jake would come back and terrified he wouldnt she had no choice but to hold her ground im not telling you anything but as you can see im alone i can see that real plain funny cause his horse is in town and he aint he picked up a biscuit from the bowl on the table with his wide bluntedged fingers studied it then bit in word is he spends time out here mr redman occasionally visits ill be sure to tell him you were looking for him if and when i see him you do that you be sure and do that he took another bite chewing slowly watching her good day then but he didnt leave he only walked closer youre prettier than i recollect she moistened her lips knowing they were trembling i dont believe weve met no but ive seen you she strained backward when he put a hand to her hair you dont favor your pa none youll have to excuse me she tried to step to the side but he blocked her he sure did set some store by you a man can see why he pushed the rest of the biscuit into his mouth chewing as he reached down to toy with the small bow at her collar too bad he got himself killed over that mine and left you orphaned smart man wouldve kept himself alive smart man wouldve seen the sense in that she shifted again and was again blocked he could hardly be blamed for an accident maybe well talk about that later enjoying her trembling he tugged the little bow loose you look smarter than your pa was lafitte burst in snarling donley had his hand on the butt of his gun when sarah grabbed his arm no please hes hardly more than a puppy moving quickly she gathered the growling dog up theres no need for you to hurt him hes harmless donley likes killing harmless things jake spoke from the doorway the men stood ten feet apart jake backed by sun donley by shadow there was a man in laramie more of a boy really daniel little deer was harmless wasnt he donley he was a breed donleys teeth gleamed through his beard i dont think no more of killing a breed than a sick horse and its easier when its backshooting i aint shooting at your back redman move aside sarah jake please move aside he was over the sick fear hed felt when hed seen donleys horse outside the house he was cold killingcold his guns hung low on his hips and his hands were limber and ready donley shifted settling his weight evenly ive waited a long time for this some of us get lucky jake murmured and wait a long time to die when ive killed you im going to have the woman and the gold his hand slapped the butt of his gun the was aimed hearthigh he was fast the sound of a gunshot exploded ripping through the still morning air sarah watched in horror as don ley stumbled forward then back a red stain spread across his shirt and his leather vest before he fell by the stone hearth and lay still jake stood in the doorway his face expressionless his mind calm and cold hed never once felt the rush some men spoke of that came from killing to him it was neither power nor curse it was survival oh god pressed back against the wall sarah stared lafitte leaped out of her limp arms to crouch growling by donleys gun hand her vision grayed wavered then snapped back when jake gripped her arms did he hurt you no i get outside hysteria bubbled up in her throat a man was dead lying dead on her floor and the one holding her looked like a stranger jake get outside he repeated doing his best to shield her from the man hed killed go on into the shed or down to the stream when she only continued to stare he pulled her to the door and shoved her out do what i tell you what what are you going to do im going to take him into town giving in to weakness she leaned on the rail dragging in gulps of the hot dusty air as though it were water what will they do to you you killed him barkerll take me at my word or hell hang me no but nausea was churning now coating her skin with a thin clammy sweat he wanted to kill you he came looking for you thats right he took both her arms again because he wanted her to look at him really look and tomorrow next week next month therell be someone else who comes looking for me i got fast hands sarah and somebodys always going to want to prove they got faster one day theyll be right you can change it can change it has to she struggled out of his hold only to throw her arms around him you cant want to live this way what i want and what is have always been two different things he pushed her away i care about you it was easy to mean it hard to say it thats why im telling you to walk away hed just killed a man in front of her eyes and killed him coldly even through her horror shed seen that but it hadnt left him untouched what she saw now was the frustration and anger of a man caught in a trap he needed someone to offer him a way out or at least the hope of one if she could do nothing else she could give him hope no she stepped forward to frame his face with her hands i cant i wont her hands were trembling cold and trembling he thought as he reached for them youre a damn fool yes im quite sure youre right but i love you he couldnt have begun to tell her what it did to him inside when she said that when he looked into her eyes and saw that she meant it he pulled her against him for a rough hungry kiss go away from the house i dont want you here when i bring him out she nodded took a long breath and stepped back the sickness had passed though the raw feeling inside remained once i was sure there was only right and wrong and that to kill another person was the greatest wrong but there isnt only right and wrong jake what you did what you had to do kept you alive theres nothing more important to me than that she paused and touched his hand come back he watched her as he had watched her once before start up the rise to her fathers grave when she was gone he went back inside two days passed and sarah tried to follow her daily routine and not to wonder why jake hadnt ridden back to her it seemed everyone else had paid her a visit but not jake barker had come out and in his usual takeyourtime way questioned her about burt donley it seemed no more than a token investigation to sarah barker either because he was lazy or because he was a shrewd judge of character had taken jake at his word the story had spread quickly soon after barker liza and johnny had driven up to hear the details and eat oatmeal cookies before she had left liza had chased johnny outside to pester lucius so that she could spend an hour talking about will and her upcoming wedding she was to have a new dress and she had already ordered the pink silk and the pattern from santa fe the following morning the sound of a rider approaching had sarah rushing out of the chicken coop eggs banging dangerously against each other in the basket she carried she struggled to mask her disappointment when she saw samuel carlson sarah he dismounted quickly and would have taken her hand but she used both to grip the handle of the basket ive been worried about you theres no need she smiled as he tiedhis horse at the rail i was shocked to learn that donley and redman had drawn guns right here in your house its a miracle you werent injured im sure i would have been if jake hadnt come back when he did donley was very threatening i feel responsible you she stopped in front of the house why donley worked for me i knew what kind of man he was there was a grimness around his eyes and mouth as he spoke i cant say i had any trouble with him until redman came back to town it was donley who sought jake out samuel her voice sharpened with the need to defend him it was he who deliberately provoked a fight i was there of course he laid a soothing hand on her arm manners prevented him from stepping inside the house without an invitation he was shrewd enough to see that something had changed and that he wouldnt get one i detest the fact that you were forced to witness a killing and in your own home it must distress you to stay here now no she glanced over her shoulder it had been difficult the first time she had gone inside afterward there were still traces of dried blood in the dirt the sight of which had given johnny ghoulish pleasure but it was her home im not as frail as that youre a strong woman sarah but a sensitive one im concerned about you its kind of you to be your friendship is a great comfort to me sarah he touched a gentle hand to her cheek you must realize that i want to be much more than your friend i know regret was in her eyes in her voice its not possible samuel im sorry she saw the anger mar his face and was surprised by the depth of it before he brought it under control again its redman isnt it she felt it would be dishonorable and insulting to lie to him yes i thought you were more sensible sarah youre an intelligent gently bred woman you must understand that redman is a dangerous man a man without scruples he lives by violence its part of him she smiled a little he describes himself the same way i believe youre both wrong hell only hurt you perhaps but i cant change my feelings nor do i wish to regret had her reaching out to touch his arm im sorry samuel i have faith that in time youll get over this infatuation i can be patient samuel i dont dont distress yourself he patted her hand along with patience i have confidence you were meant to belong to me sarah he stepped back to untie his horse inside he was boiling with rage he wanted this woman and what belonged to her and he intended to have them one way or the other when he turned to stand beside his mount with his reins in his hands his face was touched only with affection and concern this doesnt change the fact that i worry about you living out here all alone im not alone i have lucius carlson cast a slow meaningful look around the yard hes up in the mine sarah explained if there was trouble hed come down quickly enough the mine carlson cast his eyes up at the rock at least promise me that you wont go inside its a dangerous place gold doesnt lure me she smiled again relieved that they would remain friends he swung gracefully into the saddle gold lures everyone she watched him ride off perhaps he was right she mused gold had a lure even though in her heart she didnt believe shed ever see the mine pay it was exciting knowing there was always a chance it kept lucius in the dark and the dust for hours on end her father had died for it even jake she thought wasnt immune it was he who had asked lucius to pick up where her father had left off she had yet to discover why with death on his mind donleys last words had been a glimmer of suspicion broke into her mind im going to have the woman and the gold why should a man like donley speak of gold before he drew his gun why would a worthless mine be on his mind at such a time or was it worthless her promise to samuel forgotten she started toward the rise a movement caught her eye and turning around again she scanned the road someone was coming on foot even as she watched the figure stumbled and fell sarah had her skirts in her hand and was running before the figure struggled to stand again alice sarah quickened her pace the girl was obviously hurt but until sarah reached her catching her before she fell again she couldnt see how badly oh dear lord gripping the sobbing girl around the waist she helped her toward the house what happened who did this to you miss conway alice could hardly speak through her bruised and bloodied lips her left eye was blackened and swollen nearly shut there were ugly scratches like the rake of fingernails down her cheek and every breath she took came out with a hitch of pain all right dont worry just lean on me were nearly there didnt know where else to go alice managed shouldnt be here dont try to talk yet let me get you inside oh lucius half stumbling herself sarah looked up with relief as he came hurrying down the rocks help me get her inside up to bed shes badly hurt what in the holy hell wheezing a bit from the exertion he picked alice up in his scrawny arms you know who this girl is miss sarah yes take her up to my bed lucius ill get some water alice swooned as he struggled to carry her up the ladder to the loft shes done passed out that may be a blessing for the moment moving quickly sarah gathered fresh water and clean cloths she must be in dreadful pain i cant see how she managed to get all the way out here on foot shes taken a mighty beating he stepped out of the way as best he could when sarah climbed the stairs to sit on the edge of the bed gently she began to bathe alices face when she loosened the girls bodice he cleared his throat and turned his back oh my god with trembling hands sarah unfastened the rest of the buttons help me get this dress off of her lucius it looks as though shes been whipped his sense of propriety was overcome by the sight of the welts on alices back and shoulders yeah shes been whipped the cotton of her dress stuck to the raw open sores whipped worsen a dog id like to get my hands on the bastard who done this sarah found her own hands were clenched with fury theres some salve on the shelf over the stove lucius fetch it for me she did her best to bathe and cool the wounds as alices eyes fluttered open and she moaned sarah soothed her in a low calming voice try not to move alice were going to take care of you youre safe now i promise you youre safe hurts i know oh i know there were tears stinging her eyes as she took the salve from lucius and began to stroke it over the puffy welts it was a slow painful process though sarahs fingers were light and gentle alice whimpered each time she touched her her back was striped to the waist with angry red lines some of which had broken open and were bleeding with sweat trickling down her face sarah tended and bandaged talking always talking would you like another sip of water please with sarahs hand cradling her head alice drank from the cup im sorry miss conway she lay back weakly as sarah held a cool cloth to her swollen eye i know i shouldnt have come here it aint right but i wasnt thinking straight you did quite right by coming you was were so nice to me before and i was afraid if i didnt get away you arent to worry sarah applied salve to her facial scratches in a few days youll be feeling much better then we can think about whats to be done for now youll stay right here i cant you can and you will setting the salve aside sarah took her hand do you feel strong enough to tell us what happened did a man one of your customers do this to you no maam alice moistened her swollen lips it was carlotta carlotta sarahs eyes narrowed to slits are you saying that carlotta beat you like this i aint never seen her so mad sometimes she gets mean if something dont go her way or if shes been drinking too much you get a slap or two she went crazy i think she mightve killed me if the other girls hadnt broke in the door and started screaming why why would she hurt you like this i cant say for sure i done something wrong her voice slurred and her eyes dropped shut she was mad powerful mad after jake came by they had words nancy shes one of the other girls listened outside of carlottas office he said something to set her off i expect nancy said she was yelling said something about you miss conway i dont rightly know what when he left she went crazy started smashing things i went on up to my room she came after me beat me worsen pa ever did eli he brought me out elis the big black carlotta has working for her lucius explained he drove me out as far as he could she finds out shell make him sorry took a belt to me she murmured as sleep took her under kept hitting me and hitting me saying it was my fault jake dont come around no more bitch lucius said viciously then he wiped his mouth scuse me miss sarah no excuse necessary i couldnt agree more there was a rage running through her hotter and huger than anything shed ever experienced she stared at the girl asleep in her bed her small pretty face bruised and swollen she remembered each welt shed tended hitch up the wagon lucius yesm you want me to go somewheres no im going i want you to stay with alice ill hitch it up miss sarah but if youre thinking about talking to the sheriff it wont do much good alice here aint going to talk to him like she done with you shed be too scared im not going to the sheriff lucius just hitch up the wagon she pushed the horses hard pleased that the fury didnt subside as she approached town she wanted the fury since shed come west shed learned to accept many things the grief the violence the labor perhaps the land was lawless but there were times and reasons even here for justice johnny raced out of the dry goods as sarah rode by then raced back in again to complain to liza that sarah hadnt waved at him she hadnt even seen him there was only one face in her mind now she drew up in front of the silver star three women lounged in what might have been called a parlor the latemorning heat had them half dozing in their petticoats and their feathered wraps the room itself was dim and almost airless vivid red drapes hung limp at the windows gold leaf glowed dull and dusty on the frames of the mirrors as sarah entered a heavyeyed redhead popped up from her sprawled position on a settee she plopped back again with a howling laugh well look here girls we got ourselves some company get out the teacups the others looked over one of them hitched her wrap up around her shoulders her hands folded sarah stood in the doorway and took it all in so this was a bordello she couldnt say she saw anything remotely exciting it looked more like a badly furnished parlor in need of a good dusting there was a heavy floral scent of mixed perfumes that merged none too appealingly with plain sweat carefully finger by finger sarah drew off her driving gloves id like to speak with carlotta please will someone tell her im here no one moved the women merely exchanged looks the redhead went back to examining her nails after a long breath sarah tried another tactic im here to speak with her about alice that caught their attention every one of the women looked over at her shell be staying with me until shes well now the redhead rose her flowered wrap slid down her shoulders with the movement you took alice in yes she needs care miss im nancy she took a quick look behind her how come somebody like yous going to see to alice because she needs it id be grateful to you if you would tell carlotta id like to speak with her i reckon i could do that the redhead pulled her wrap up you tell alice we was asking about her ill be glad to while nancy disappeared up the stairs sarah tried to ignore the other womens stares she had changed to one of her best day dresses sarah thought the dove gray very distinguished particularly with its black trim her matching hat had been purchased just before her trip west and was the latest paris fashion apparently it wasnt proper attire for a bordello she thought as she watched carlotta descend the stairs the owner of the silver star was resplendent in her trademark red the silk slithered down her tall curvaceous body clinging shifting swaying her high white breasts rose like offerings from the scalloped bodice which was threaded with silver threads in her hand she carried a matching fan as she flicked it in front of her face the heavy scent of roses filled the room despite her feelings sarah couldnt deny that the woman was stunning in another place another time she could have been a queen my my this is a rare honor miss conway shed been drinking sarah caught the scent of whiskey under the perfume this is hardly a social call now you disappoint me her painted mouth curved i can always use a new girl around here isnt that right ladies the other women shifted uncomfortably and remained tactfully silent i thought maybe youd come in looking for work still waving the fan she strolled around sarah sizing her up little scrawny she said but some men like that could use some fixing up right girls little more here she patted sarahs unrouged cheek little less there she flicked a hand at the neckline of sarah dress you might make a tolerable living i dont believe id care to work for you carlotta that so her eyes already hardened by the whiskey iced over too much of a lady to take pay for it but not too much of a lady to give it away sarah curled her fingers into a fist then forced them to relax again she would not resort to violence or be driven to it no i wouldnt care to work for anyone who beats their employees alice is with me now carlotta and shell stay with me if you ever put your hands on her again ill see to it that youre thrown in jail oh will you an angry flush darkened cheeks already bright with rouge ill put my hands on who i please she stabbed the fan into sarahs chest no primfaced bitch from back east is going to come into my place and tell me different with surprising ease sarah reached out and snapped the fan in two i just have she had only an instant to brace herself for the slap it knocked her backward to balance herself she grabbed a table and sent a statuette crashing to the floor your kind makes me sick carlottas voice was high and brittle as she leaned toward sarah whiskey and anger had taken hold of her and twisted her striking face looking as though they wouldnt let a man touch them but youll spread your legs as easy as any you think because you went to school and lived in a big house that makes you special youre nothing out here nothing she scooped up a fat plaster cherub and sent it crashing into the wall the fact that i went to school and lived in a house isnt all that separates us sarahs voice was a sharp contrast to carlottas in its calmness you dont make me sick carlotta you only make me sorry i dont need pity from you i made this place i got something and nobody handed it to me nobody ever gave me money for fine dresses and fancy hats i earned it breasts heaving she stepped closer you think you got jake dangling on a string honey youre wrong soon as hes had his fill of you hell be back what hes doing to you on these hot sweaty nights hell be doing to me no amazingly sarahs voice was still calm even if he comes back and puts your price in your hands youll never have what i have with him you know it sarah said quietly and thats why you hate me with her eyes on carlotta she began to pull on her gloves again her hands would tremble any moment she knew it and she wanted to be on her way first but the issue here is alice not jake she is no longer in your employ ill tell that slut when shes through here it happened so quickly sarah was hardly aware of it she had managed to hold her temper during carlottas insulting tirade against her own person but to hear alice called by that vile name while the girl was lying helpless and hurt was too much her ungloved hand shot out and connected hard with the side of carlottas face the three women and the one who had come creep ing down the stairs to look in on the commotion let out gasps of surprise in unison sarah barely had time to feel the satisfaction of her action when carlotta had her by the hair they tumbled to the floor in a flurry of skirts sarah shrieked as carlotta tried to pull her hair out by the roots she had handfuls of it tugging and ripping while she cursed wildly fighting the pain sarah swung out and connected with soft flesh she heard carlotta grunt and they rolled across the rug crockery smashed as they collided with a table each trying to land a blow or defend against one sarah took a fist in the stomach with a gasp but managed to evade a lethal swipe of carlottas redtipped nails there was hate in carlottas eyes a wild almost mad hate sarah grabbed her wrist and twisted knowing that if the other woman got her hands on her throat shed squeeze until all her breath was gone she had no intention of being strangled or pumeled her own rage had her rolling on top of her opponent and grabbing a handful of dyed hair when she felt teeth sink into her arm she cried out and yanked with all her strength jerking carlottas head back and bringing out a howl of rage and pain other screams rose up but sarah was lost in the battle she yanked and clawed and tore as viciously as carlotta they were equals now with no barriers of class or background a lamp shattered in a shower of glass as the two writhing bodies careened into another table what in the hell is going on here barker burst into the parlor he took one look at the scene on the floor and shut his eyes hed rather have faced five armed drunken cowboys than a pair of scratching women break it up he ordered as the two of them tumbled across the floor somebodys going to get hurt here he shook his head and sighed most likely me he stepped into the melee just as jake strode through the parlor doors lets pull them apart barker said heavily take your pick but jake was already hauling sarah up off the floor she kicked out her breath hissing as she tried to struggle away pull in your claws duchess he clamped an arm around her waist as barker restrained carlotta get her out of here carlotta shoved away from barker and stood her dress ripped at both shoulders her hair in wild tufts i want that bitch out of here and in jail she came in here and started breaking up my place now that dont seem quite logical barker mused miss sarah you want to tell me what youre doing in a place like this business she tossed her hair out of her eyes personal business well looks to me like youve finished with your business here why dont you go on along home now sarah drew on her dignity like a cape over her torn dress thank you sheriff she cast one last look at carlotta i am quite finished here she glided toward the door to the secret admiration of carlottas girls just one damn minute jake took her arm the second she stepped outside she had time now for embarrassment when she noted the size of the crowd shed drawn if youll excuse me she said stiffly i must get home she reached up to tidy her tousled hair my hat i think i saw what was left of it back in there jake ran his tongue over his teeth as he looked at her she had a bruise beginning under her eye it would make up to be a pretty good shiner by the end of the day her fashionable gray dress was ripped down one arm and her hair looked as though shed been through a windstorm thoughtfully he tucked his hands in his pockets carlotta had looked a hell of a lot worse duchess a man wouldnt know it to look at you but youre a real firebrand grimly she brushed at her rumpled skirts i can see that amuses you i have to say it does he smiled and her teeth snapped together i guess im flattered but you didnt have to get yourself in a catfight over me her mouth dropped open the man looked positively delighted she was scratched and bruised and aching and humiliated and he looked as though his grin might just split his face over him she thought and made herself return the smile so you think i fought with carlotta over you because i was jealous cant think of another reason oh ill give you a reason she brought her fist up and caught him neatly on the jaw he was holding a hand to his face and staring after her when barker strolled out shes got what you might call a mean right hook in the street people howled and snickered as sarah climbed into the wagon and drove off son barker said with a hand on jakes shoulder youre the fastest hand i ever saw with those colts of yours you play a fine game of poker and you hold your whiskey like a man but you got a hell of a lot to learn about women apparently jake murmured he walked across to orileys and untied his horse sarah seethed as she raced the wagon toward home shed made a spectacle of herself shed engaged in a crude despicable sparring match with a woman with no morals shed brought half the town out into the street to stare and snicker at her and then to top it all off shed had to endure jake redmans grinning face shed shown him sarah tossed her head up and spurred the horses on her hand might possibly be broken but shed shown him the colossal conceit of the man to believe that she would stoop to such a level out of petty jealousy she wished shed torn carlottas brasscolored hair out by its black roots not over him she reminded herself at least not very much over him she heard the rider coming up fast and looked over her shoulder with a quick gasp of alarm she cracked the reins she would not speak to him now jake red man could go to the devil as far as she was concerned and he could take his grin with him but her sturdy workhorses were no match for his mustang nor was her driving skill a match for his riding even as she cursed him he cameup beside her she had a flash clear as a bell of how hed looked when hed raced beside the stagecoach firing over his shoulder he looked just as untamed and dangerous now stop that damn thing chin up she cracked the reins again one of these days somebody was going to teach her to listen jake thought it might just be today he judged the timing and rhythm then leaped from his horse into the wagon surefooted he stepped over onto the seat and though she fought him furiously he pulled the horses in what the hells got into you woman he scrambled for a hold as she shoved him aside and tried to jump out take your hands off me i wont be handled this way handling you is a sight more work than i care for he snatched his hand out of range before she could bite him havent you had enough scratching for one day sit down before you hurt yourself you want the blasted wagon take it i wont ride with you youll ride with me all right out of patience he twisted her into his lap and silenced her she squirmed and pushed and held herself as rigid as iron then she melted he felt the give slow easy inevi table in her in himself as her lips parted for his he forgot about keeping her quiet and just took what he kept trying to tell himself he couldnt have you pack a punch duchess he drew her away to rub a hand over his chin in a lot of ways you want to tell me what that was for she pulled away furious that shed gone soft with just one kiss for assuming that i was jealous and would fight over any worthless man so now im worthless well that may be but you seem to like having me around she did her best to straighten what was left of her dress perhaps i do he needed to know it more than hed imagined jake took her chin in his hand and turned her to face him you change your mind again she softened this time because she saw the doubt in his eyes no i havent changed my mind she drew a long breath even though you didnt come back and youve been to the silver star to see carlotta you sure do hear things cant imagine what youd know if you lived closer to town stay in the wagon he recognized the look in her eye by now stay in the wagon sarah until i get my horse tied on ill just catch you again if you run i wont run she brought her chin up again and stared straight ahead when hed joined her again she continued her silence jake clucked to the horses and started off i like to know why a womans mad at me why dont you tell me how you know ive been to carottas alice told me alice johnson thats right your friend carlotta nearly beat her to death he brought the horses up short what her fury bounded back and poured over him you heard what i said she beat that poor girl as cruelly as anyone can be beaten eh helped alice get out of town then she walked the rest of the way to my place is she going to be all right with time and care and youre going to give it to her yes her eyes dared him do you have any objections no he touched her face gently in a way that was new to him abruptly he snatched his hand back and snapped the reins again you went into the silver star to have it out with carlotta over alice ive never been so furious sarah lifted a hand to where jake had touched her alice is hardly more than a child no matter what she did she didnt deserve that kind of treatment did she tell you why carlotta did it she didnt seem to know only that she must have made some kind of mistake alice did say that carlotta was in a temper after you had been there he said nothing for a moment as he put the pieces together and she took it out on alice why did you go why did you go to carlotta if theres something you she hadnt any idea how to phrase it properly if i dont know enough about your needs i realize i dont have any experience in these matters but i she found her mouth crushed again in a kiss that was half hungry half angry theres never been anyone else whos known so much about what i need he watched her face clear into a smile i went to see carlotta to tell her i dont care much for having my name used as a reference so she took it out on alice because alice was the one whod come to talk to me sarah shook her head and tried not to let her temper take over again alice only told me what carlotta wanted her to tell me it didnt work the way shed planned and alice paid for it thats about the size of it sarah linked her fingers again and set them in her lap is that the only reason you went to carlotta no he waited for the look the look of passionate fury i went for that and to tell her to stay away from you of course i didnt know at the time that you were going to go and bloody her lip did i she tried and failed to bank down the pleasure she felt at the news did i really and her nose guess you were a little too involved to notice ive never struck anyone before in my life she tried to keep her voice prim then gave up i liked it with a laugh jake pulled her to his side youre a real wildcat duchess chapter twelve jake learned something new when he watched sarah with alice he had always assumed that a woman who had been raised in the sheltered privileged world would ignore even condemn one who lived as alice lived there were many decent women as they called themselves who would have turned alice away as if she were a rabid dog not sarah and it was more than what he supposed she would have called christian charity hed run into his share of people who liked to consider themselves good christians they had charity all right unlessthey came across somebody who looked different thought different there had been plenty of christian women who had swept their skirts aside from his own mother because shed married a man of mixed blood they went into church on sundays and quoted the scriptures and professed to love their neighbor but when their neighbor didnt fit their image of what was right love turned to hate quickly enough with sarah it wasnt just words it was compassion caring and an understanding he hadnt expected from her he could hear as he sat at the table the simple kindness in her voice as she talked to the girl and tended her wounds as for alice it was obvious the girl adored sarah hed yet to see her as sarah claimed her patient wasnt up to visitors but he could hear the shyness and the respect in her voice when she answered sarahs questions shed fought for alice he couldnt quite get over that most people wouldnt fight for anything unless it was their own or something they wanted to own it had taken pride and maybe what people called valor for her to walk into a place like the silver star and face carlotta down and shed done it he glanced up toward the loft shed more than done it shed held her own rising he walked outside to where lucius was doing his best to teach an uncooperative lafitte to shake hands damn it boy did i say jump all over me no you fleabrained mongrel i said shake lucius pushed the dogs rump down and grabbed a paw shake get it lafitte leaped up again and licked luciuss face doesnt appear so jake commented fool dog but lucius rubbed the pups belly when he rolled over grows on you though he squinted up at jake something around here seems to be growing on you too somebody had to bring her back reckon so he waited until jake crouched to scratch the puppys head you want to tell me how miss sarah came to look like shed been in a fistfight she looked like she was in a fistfight because she was in a fistfight lucius snorted and spit like hell with carlotta luciuss cloudy eyes widened and then he let out a bark of laughter that had lafitte racing in circles aint that a hoot are you telling me that our miss sarah went in and gave carlotta what for she gave her a bloody nose jake looked over with a grin and pulled out more than a little of her hair sweet jesus idve given two pints of whiskey tove seen that did you chuckling jake pulled on lafittes ears the tail end of it when i walked in the two of them were rolling over the floor spitting like cats i figure carlotta outweighs sarah by ten pounds or more but sarah was sitting on her skirts hiked up and blood in her eye it was one hell of a sight shes got spunk lucius pulled out his whiskey and toasted sarah with a healthy gulp i knew she had something in her head when she tore out of here feeling generous he handed the bottle to jake never would have thought shed set her mind on poking a fist into carlotta but nobody ever deserved it more you seen alice no jake let the whiskey spread fire through him sarahs got the idea that its not fitting for me to talk to the girl until shes covered up or something i carried her in myself and i dont mind saying i aint seen no womans face ever smashed up so bad took a belt to her too from the looks of it her back and shoulders all come up in welts jake you wouldnt whup a dog the way that girl was whupped that carlotta must be crazy mean and crazys two different things he handed lucius the bottle carlottas just mean reckon youd know her pretty well jake watched lucius take another long sip i paid for her a few times sometime back doesnt mean i know her soon plop my ass next to a rattlers lucius handed the bottle back to jake again then fell into a fit of coughing miss sarah i didnt hear you come out so i surmised she said with a coolness that had lucius coughing again perhaps you gentlemen have finished drinking whiskey and exchanging crude comments and would like to wash for supper if not youre welcome to eat out here in the dirt with that she turned on her heel making certain she banged the door shut behind her ooowhee lucius snatched back the bottle and took another drink shes got a mighty sharp tongue for such a sweet face i tell you boy youll have to mind your step if you hitch up with her jake was still staring at the door thinking how beautiful shed looked black eye and all standing there like a queen addressing her subjects i aint planning on hitching up with anyone maybe you are and maybe you aint lucius rose and brushed off his pants a little dirt and shed have them off him again and in the stream but shes got plans all right and a woman like thats hard to say no to sarah spoke politely at supper as if she were entertaining at a formal party her hair was swept up and tidied and shed changed her dress she was wearing the green one that set off her hair and eyes the stew was served in ironstone bowls but the way she did it it could have been a restaurant meal on fancy china it made him think as he hadnt in years of his mother and how she had liked to fuss over sunday supper she said nothing about the encounter in town and it was clear that she didnt care to have the subject brought up it was hard to believe she was the same woman hed dragged off the floor in the silver star but he noticed that she winced now and then he bit into a hunk of fresh bread and held back a grin she was hurting all right and more than her pride from the look of it as he ate he entertained thoughts of how he would ease those hurts when the sun went down would you like some more stew lucius no maam he patted his belly full as a tick if its all the same to you ill just go take a walk before i feed the stock and such going to be a pretty night he sent them both what he thought was a bland look ill sleep like a log after a meal like this yessir i dont believe ill stir till morning he scraped back his chair and reached for his hat mighty fine meal miss sarah thank you lucius jake tipped back his chair i wouldnt mind a walk myself sarah had to smile at the way lucius began to whistle after hed closed the door you go ahead he took her hand as she rose id like it better if you went with me she smiled hed never asked her to do something as ordinary and as romantic as going for a walk thank goodness she hadnt forgotten how to flirt why thats nice of you but i have to see to the dishes and alice may be waking soon i think she could eat a bit now i imagine i could occupy myself for an hour or two well take a walk when youre done she sent him a look from under lowered lashes maybe then she laughed as he sent her spinning into his lap why mr redman you are quite a brute he ran a finger lightly over the bruise under her eye then youd best be careful kiss me sarah she smiled when her lips were an inch from his and if i dont but you will he traced her bottom lip with his tongue you will she did sinking into it into him her arms wound around him slender and eager her mouth opened like a flower in sunlight they softened against him even as they heated they yielded even as they demanded dont be long he murmured he kissed her again passion simmering then set her on her feet she let out a long shaky breath when he closed the door behind him with alice settled for the night and the days work behind her sarah stepped out into the quieting light of early evening it was still too warm to bother with a shawl but she pushed her sleeves down past her elbows and buttoned the cuffs there were bruises on her arms that she didnt care to dwell on from where she stood she could hear lucius in the shed talking to lafitte hed become more his dog than hers sarah thought with a laugh or perhaps theyd both become something of hers as the land had she closed her eyes and let the light breeze flutter over her face she could if she concentrated hard enough catch the faintest whiff of sage and she could if she used enough imagination picture what it would be like to sit on the porch she envisioned having watching the sun go down every evening while jake rolled a cigarette and listened with her to the music of the night bringing herself back she looked around where was he she stepped farther out into the yard when she heard the sound of hammer against wood she saw him a few yards from the chicken coop beating an old post into the ground hed taken his shirt off and she could see the light sheen of sweat over his lean torso and the rippling and bunching of his muscles as he swung the heavy hammer down her thoughts flew back to the way his arms had swung her into heat into passion the hands that gripped the thick worn handle of the hammer now had roamed over her touching taking whatever they chose and she had touched wantonly even greedily that long limber body taking it accepting it as her own her breath shuddered out as she watched him bend and lift and pound was it wrong to have such thoughts such wonderful exciting visions how could it be when she loved so completely she wanted his heart but oh she wanted his body as well and she could find no shame in it his head came up quickly as she imagined an animals might when it caught a scent and he had though she was several yards away he had sensed her the trace of lilac the subtlety of woman he straightened and just as she had looked her fill of him he looked his of her she might have stepped from a cool terrace to walk in a garden the wind played with her skirts and her hair but gently the backdrop of the setting sun was like glory behind her her eyes as she walked toward him were wide and dark and aware youve got a way of moving duchess that makes my mouth water i dont think thats what the good sisters intended when they taught me posture but im glad she moved naturally to his arms to his lips very glad for the first time in his life he felt awkward with a woman and he drew her away im sweaty i know she pulled a handkerchief from her pocket and dabbed at his face what are you doing she made him feel like a boy fumbling over his first dance you said you wanted pigs you need a pen he picked up his shirt and shrugged it on what are you doing watching you she put a hand to his chest where the shirt lay open remembering wondering if you want me as much as you did he took her hand before she could tear what was inside of him loose no i dont i want you more he picked up his gunbelt but instead of strapping it on he draped it over his shoulder why dont we go for that walk content she slipped her hand into his when i first came here i wondered what it was that had kept my father rooted him here at first i thought it was only for me because he wanted so badly to provide what he thought id need that grieved me i cant tell you how much she glanced up as they passed the rise that led to his grave later i began to see that even though that was part of it perhaps the most important part to him he was also happy here it eases the loss to know he was happy they started down the path to the stream she had come to know so well i didnt figure youd stick her hand felt right easy and right tucked in his when i brought you out here the first time you looked as if someone had dropped you on your head it felt as though someone had losing him well the truth is id lost him years and years ago to me hes exactly the same as he was the day he left maybe theres something good about that i never told you he had spun me a tale at the stream she settled down on her favorite rock and listened to the waters mel ody he told me of the fine house hed built after hed struck the rich vein of gold in sarahs pride he painted me a picture of it with his words four bedrooms a parlor with the windows facing west a wide porch with big round columns she smiled a little and watched the sun glow over the buttes maybe he thought i needed that and maybe i did to see myself as mistress of a fine big house with curving stairs and high cool walls he could see it and her it was what you were made for its you i was made for rising she held out her hands i want you sarah i cant offer you much more than a blanket to spread on the ground she glanced over at the small pile of supplies hed already brought down to the stream she moved to it and lifted the blanket it was twilight when they lowered to it the air had softened the wind was only a rustle in the thin brush overhead the sky arched a deep everdarkening blue under the wool of the blanket the ground was hard and unforgiving she lifted her arms to him and they left the rest behind it was as it had been the first time and yet different the hunger was there and the impatient pull of desire with it was a knowledge of the wonder the magic they could make between them a little slower now a little surer they moved together there was urgency in his kiss she could feel it but beneath it was a tenderness she had dreamed of hoped for seduced by that alone she murmured his name beneath her palm his cheek was rough under her ringers his skin was smooth his body like his mind like his heart was a contrast that drew her compelled her to learn more a deep drugging languor filled her as he began to undress her there was no frantic rush as there had been before his fingers were slow and sure as they moved down the small covered buttons she felt the air whisper against her skin as he parted the material then it was his mouth warmer sweeter moving over her her sigh was like music he wanted to give her something hed never given another woman the kind of care she deserved tenderness was new to him but it came easily now as he peeled off layer after layer to find her he sucked in his breath as her fingers fumbled with the buttons at his waist her touch wasnt hesitant but it was still innocent it would always be and her innocence aroused him as skill never could have she removed the layers hed covered himself with not layers of cotton or leather but layers of cynicism and aloofness the armor hed used to survive just as hed used his pistols with her he was helpless more vulnerable than he had been since childhood with her he felt more of a man than he had ever hoped to be she felt the change an explosion of feelings and needs and desires as he dragged her up into his arms to crush his mouth against hers what moved through him poured into her leaving her breathless shaken and impossibly strong without understanding without needing to she answered him with everything in her heart then came the storm wild windy wailing rocked by it she cried out as he drove her up up into an airless rushing cloud of passion sensations raced through her the sound of her own desperate moans the scrape of his face against her skin as he journeyed down her trembling body the taste of him that lingered on her lips on her tongue as he did mad unspeakably wonderful things to her lost driven beyond reason she pressed his head closer to her she was like something wild that had just been unchained he could feel the shocked delight ripple through her when he touched her moist heat with his tongue he thought her response was like a miracle though hed long ago stopped believing in them there was little he could give her besides the pleasures of her own body but at least that he would do sliding upward he covered her mouth with his and filled her long after her hands had slipped limply from his back long after their breathing had calmed and leveled he lay over her his face buried in her hair shed brought him peace and though he knew it wouldnt last for now shed brought him peace of mind of body of heart he hadnt wanted to love hadnt dared to risk it even now when it was no longer possible to hide it from himself he couldnt tell her lucius was right she murmured against his ear mmm its a pretty night she ran her hands up his back a very pretty night am i hurting you no she gripped her own wrists so that she could hold him closer dont move yet im heavy and youve got some colorful bruises if shed had the energy she might have laughed id forgotten about them i put some on you myself last night he lifted his head to look down at her i dont know much about going easy im not complaining you should fascinated he stroked a finger down her cheek youre so beautiful like something i made up she turned her lips into his palm as her eyes filled youve never told me you thought i was beautiful sure i did he shifted then frustrated by his own lack of words i should have she curled comfortably against his side i feel beautiful right now they lay in contented silence looking up at the sky whats an enigma he asked her hmm oh its a puzzle something difficult to understand why i guess i heard it somewhere he thought of her diary and her description of him but couldnt see how it applied hed always seen himself as being exactly what he appeared to be youre getting cold a little sitting up he pushed through her discarded undergarments for her chemise she smiled lifting her arms over her head her lips curved when she saw his gaze slide over her skin when he pulled the cotton over her she linked her hands behind his neck i was hoping to stay warm a different way with a laugh he slid a hand down over her hip i remember telling you once before you were a quick study experimentally he pushed the strap of her chemise off her shoulder you want to do something for me yes she nuzzled his lips very much go on over and stand in that stream confused she drew back i beg your pardon nobody says that better than you duchess ill swear to that he kissed her again in a light friendly manner that pleased and puzzled her you want to go wading not exactly he toyed with the strap women wore the damnedest things then they covered them all up anyhow i thought youd go stand in the stream wearing just this little thing like you did that first night what first night her puzzled smile faded as he traced his fingertip along the edge of her bodice that first you you were watching me while i i was just making sure you didnt get yourself into any trouble thats disgraceful she tried to pull away but he held her still i started thinking then and there how much id like to get my hands on you had some trouble sleeping that night he lowered his lips to the curve of her throat and began to nibble fact is i havent had a good nights sleep since i set eyes on you stop it she turned her head but it only made it easier for him to find her mouth are you going to go stand in the stream i am not she smothered a laugh when he rolled her onto the blanket again im going to get dressed and go back to the house to check on alice no need lucius is keeping an eye on her oh i see youve already decided that for me i guess you could put it like that youre not going anywhere but this blanket and maybe the stream once i talk you into it you wont talk me into it i have no intention of sleeping outside i dont figure on sleeping much at all he stretched out on his back again and gathered her close havent you ever slept outside before looked at the sky counted stars no but of course tonight she would she wanted nothing more she turned her head to study his profile have you ever counted stars jake when i was a kid he stroked a hand lazily up and down her arm my mother used to say there were pictures shed point them out to me sometimes but i could never find them again ill show you one sarah took his hand and began to draw in the air its a horse a winged horse pegasus she added then she caught her breath look a shooting star she watched his hand held in hers as it arced across the sky she closed her eyes quickly then made a wish will you tell me about your mother for a long moment he said nothing but continued to stare up at the sky the arc of light was gone without a trace she was a teacher sarahs gaze flicked up quickly to his face shed come out here from st louis and met your father i dont know much about that he wanted to learn to read and write and she taught him she set a lot of store by reading and while she was teaching him they fell in love he smiled a little it sounded nice the way she said it i guess they did she married him it wouldnt have been easy with him being half apache they wanted to build something i remember the way my father used to talk about taking the land and making it work for him leaving something behind she understood that because it was what she wanted for herself were they happy they laughed a lot my mother used to sing he always talked about buying her a piano one day so she could play again like she did in st louis shed just laugh and say she wanted lace curtains first id forgotten that he murmured she wanted lace curtains she turned her face into his shoulder because she felt his pain as her own lucius told me what happened to them to you im so sorry he hadnt known he needed to talk about it needed to tell her they came in from town eight ten of them ive never been sure his voice was quiet now his eyes on the sky he could still see them as he hadnt allowed himself to see them for years they lit the barn first maybe if my father had stayed in the house let them shoot and shout and trample theyd have left the rest but theyd have come back he knew it he took his rifle and went out to protect what was his they shot him right outside the door sarah held him tighter seeing it with him we ran out they tasted blood now like wolves wildeyed teeth bared she was crying holding on to my father and crying inside the barn the horses were screaming the sky was lit up so i could see their faces while they torched the rest and he could smell the smoke as he lay there could hear the crackle of greedy flames and his mothers pitiful weeping i picked up the rifle thats the first time i ever wanted to kill its like a fever in the blood like a hand has ahold of you squeezing she started to scream i saw one of the riders take aim at me i had the rifle in my hands but i was slow better with a bow or a knife back then she threw herself up and in front of me so when he pulled the trigger the bullet went in her sarah tightened her arms around him as tears ran fast and silent down her cheeks one of them hit me with a rifle butt as he rode by it was morning before i came to theyd burned everything the house was still smoking even when it cooled there was nothing in it worth keeping the ground was hard there and i got dizzy a few times so it took me all day to bury them i slept there that night between the two graves i told myself that if i lived until morning id find the men whod done it and kill them i was still alive in the morning she said nothing could say nothing it wasnt necessary to ask what hed done hed learned to use a gun and use it well and he had found the men or some of them when lucius came i told him what happened that was the last time i told anyone dont she turned to lay her body across his dont think about it anymore he could feel her tears on his chest the warmth of them as far as he knew no one had ever cried for him before taking her hand he kissed it show me that picture in the sky sarah turning keeping her hand in his she began to trace the stars the time for tears for regrets and she hoped for revenge was done the stars arent as big in the east or as bright they lay quietly for a while wrapped close listening to the night sounds i used to jump every time i heard a coyote now i like listening for them every night when i read my fathers journal matt kept a journal he sat up as he asked dragging her with him why yes there was an intensity in his eyes that made her heart skip erratically what is it have you read it not all of it ive been reading a few pages each night he suddenly realized that he was digging his fingers into her arms he relaxed them will you let me read it her heart was steady again but something cold was inching its way over her skin yes if you tell me why you want to he turned away to reach casually in his saddlebag for his tobacco pouch and papers i just want to read it she waited while he rolled a cigarette all right i trust you when are you going to trust me jake he struck a match on a rock the flame illuminated his face what do you mean why did you ask lucius to work in the mine he flicked the match out then tossed it aside the scent of tobacco stung the air maybe i thought matt would have liked it determined she put a hand to his face and turned it toward hers why a feeling i had thats all shifting away he blew out a stream of smoke people usually have a reason for setting fires sarah there was only one i could figure when it came to you somebody didnt want you there thats ridiculous i hardly knew anyone at that point the sheriff said it was drifters she curled her hands in her lap as she studied his face you dont think it was no maybe barker does and maybe he doesnt theres only one thing on this land that anyone could want thats gold impatient sarah sat back on her heels but there isnt any gold yes there is jake drew deep on his cigarette and watched the range of expressions cross her face what are you talking about lucius found the mother lode just the way matt did he glanced at the glowing tip of his cigarette youre going to be a rich woman duchess wait she pressed a hand to her temple it was beginning to throb are you telling me that the mine is really worth something more than something according to lucius i cant believe it with a quick confused laugh she shook her head i never thought it was anything but a dream just this morning id begun to wonder but how long have you known a while a while she repeated looking back at him and you didnt think it important enough to mention to me i figured it was important enough not to he took a last drag before crushing the cigarette out ive never known a woman who could keep her mouth shut is that so yes maam im perfectly capable of keeping my mouth shut as you so eloquently put it but why should i there was no way to tell her but straight out matt found the gold and then he was dead there was an accident she began suddenly cold she hugged her elbows he didnt have to speak for her to see what was in his mind youre trying to tell me that my father was murdered that cant be she started to scramble up but he took her arms and held her still ten years he worked the mine and scratched a few handfuls of gold from it then he hits hits big the minute he does theres a cavein and hes dead i dont want to think about it youre going to think about it he gave her a quick shake the mines yours now and the gold in it im not going to let what happened to matt happen to you his hands gentled and slid up to frame her face not to you she closed her eyes she couldnt take it in not all at once fear hysteria and fresh grief tangled within her she lifted her hands to his wrists and held on until she felt herself calming he was right she had to think about it then she would act when she opened her eyes they were clear and steady tell me what you want me to do trust me he touched his lips to hers then laid her back gently on the blanket shed given him peace early in the night now as the night deepened he would try to do the same for her chapter thirteen im feeling lots better miss conway alice took the tin cup and sipped gingerly she didnt want to complain about her back or about the pain that still galloped along it despite the cooling salve the morning light showed her facial bruises in heartwrenching detail and caused the girl to look even younger and smaller and more vulnerable though the scratches on her cheeks were no longer red and angry sarah judged it would be several days before they faded you look better it wasnt strictly true and sarah vowed to keep her patient away from a mirror a bit longer though the swelling had eased considerably she was still worried about alices eye and had already decided to drive into town later and talk with the doctor try a little of this softboiled egg you need your strength yes maam privately alice thought the glossy wet yolk looked more like a slimy eye than food but if sarah had told her to eat a fried scorpion shed have opened her mouth and swallowed miss conway yes alice sarah spooned up more egg im beholden to you for taking me in like you did and i cant miss conway you gave me your own bed last night it aint fitting smiling a little sarah set the plate aside alice i assure you i was quite comfortable last night but miss conway alice if you keep this up im going to think youre ungrateful oh something close to horror flashed in alices eyes no maam well then because the response was exactly what shed expected sarah rose she remembered that the nuns had nursed with compassion tempered with brisk practicality you can show your gratitude by being a good patient and getting some more rest if youre feeling up to it later ill have lucius bring you down and we can sit and talk a while id like that miss conway if it hadnt been for you and eli i think idve died i was hoping well i got some money saved it aint much but id like you to have it for all your trouble i dont want your money alice the girl flushed and looked away i know youre probably thinking about where it comes from but no she took alices hand firmly in hers that has nothing to do with it pride sarah thought she had plenty of her own alice was entitled to hers alice did eli want money for driving you out of town no but hes a friend id like to be your friend if youd let me you rest now and well talk about all this later she gave alices hand a reassuring squeeze before she picked up the empty dishes and started down the ladder she barely muffled a squeal when hands closed around her waist told you you didnt need that corset sarah sent jake what she hoped was an indignant look over her shoulder is that why i couldnt find it when i dressed this morning just doing you a favor before she could decide whether to laugh or lecture he was whirling her around and kissing her jake alice is not likely to faint if she figures out what im doing but he set her aside because he liked the way the sunlight streamed through the curtains and onto her hair youre mighty nice to look at duchess it was foolish to blush but her color rose why dont you sit down and you can look at me some more while i fix you breakfast id like to but ive got some things to see to he touched her again just a fingertip to the single wispy curl that had escaped from the neat bun on top of her head sarah will you let me have matts journal both the grief and the dread showed clearly in her eyes before she lowered them during the night after love and before sleep she had thought of little else but what jake had told her part of her wondered if she would be better off not knowing not being sure but another part the same part that had kept her from turning back and going east again had already accepted what needed to be done yes she walked to the hearth to work the rock loose i found this the first night his journal what must have been his savings and the deed to sarahs pride when she held the book out to him jake resisted the urge to open it there and then if he found what he thought he would find he would have business to take care of before he said anything else to her ill take it along with me if its all the same to you she opened her mouth to object wanting the matter settled once and for all but hed asked for her trust perhaps this was the way to show him he had it all right and the deed will you let me hold on to it until we have some answers in answer she offered it to him without hesitation without question for a moment they held the deed and the dream between them just like that he murmured yes she smiled and released her hold just like that that her trust was so easily given so total in her eyes left him groping for words sarah i want what he wondered as he stared down at her to guard and protect to love and possess she was like something cool and sweet that had poured into him and washed away years of bitter thirst but he didnt have the words he thought and he didnt have the right ill take care of this she lifted a brow there had been something else something in his eyes she wanted it back so that she could see it understand it i thought we were going to take care of it no he cupped her chin in his hand youre going to leave this to me i dont want anything to happen to you her brow was still lifted as her lips curved why because i dont i want you to whatever he might have said was postponed he moved to the window quickly youve got company coming as he spotted the buggy his shoulders relaxed looks like mrs cody and her girl oh sarahs hands shot up automatically to straighten her hair i must look oh how would i know i havent had a chance to so much as glance in the mirror wouldnt matter much without glancing back he pulled open the door too bad youre so homely muttering she pulled off her apron and followed him outside then memory came flooding back and had her biting her up i imagine they would have heard all about the ah incident yesterday i expect jake secured the deed and the journal in the saddlebags that hed tossed over the rail you neednt look so amused she fiddled nervously with the cameo at her throat then put on her brightest smile good morning mrs cody liza good morning sarah anne cody brought the horses to a stop i hope you dont mind an early call not at all but her fingers were busy pleating her skirt she was afraid there was a lecture coming the good sisters had given sarah more than what she considered her share over the past twelve years im always delighted to see you she added both of you anne glanced over at the dog whod run out to bark at the horses my hes grown some hasnt he she held out a hand mr redman jake stepped over to help her then liza down remaining silent until hed slung his saddlebags over his shoulder id best be on my way he touched a hand to his hat ladies mr redman anne held up a hand in the gesture she used to stop her children from rushing out before their chores were finished might i have a word with you he shifted his bags until their weight fell evenly yes maam my son john has been dogging your heels these last weeks im surprised you put up with it jake didnt imagine it pleased her either to have the boy spending time with him he hasnt made a pest of himself curious anne studied his face thats a kind thing to say mr redman when im sure hes done just that johnny was born a pest liza put in earning a slow measured look from her mother it appears my children have that in common with liza effectively silenced anne turned back to jake hes been going through what most boys his age go through i expect fascinated with guns gun fights gunfighters i dont mind saying its given me some worry ill keep my distance jake said and turned to leave mr redman anne hadnt raised two willful children without knowing how to add the right tone of authority to her voice ill have my say ma both lizas cheeks and voice paled when she saw the look in jakes eyes cold she thought and moistened her lips shed never seen eyes so cold maybe we should let mr redman be on his way your mothers got something to say jake said quietly i reckon she ought to say it thank you pleased anne drew off her riding gloves johnny was real excited about what happened here between you and burt donley mrs cody sarah began only to be silenced by a look from both her and jake as i was saying anne continued johnny hardly talked about anything else for days he figured having a shootout made a man a man and gave him something to strut about even started pestering his pa for a peacemaker she glanced down at the guns on jakes hips wooden grip he said nothing fancy like some of the glory boys wear just a good solid colt mr cody and i had just about run clean out of patience with the boy then just yesterday he came home and told me something she paused measuring her words he said that killing somebody in a gunfight or any other way doesnt make a man grownup or important he said that a smart man doesnt look for trouble he walks away from it when he can and faces it when he cant for the first time anne smiled i guess id been telling him pretty near the same but it didnt get through coming from me or his pa made me wonder who got him thinking that way she offered her hand again i wanted to tell you im obliged jake stared at the hand before taking it it was the kind of gesture one of gratitude even friendship that had rarely been made to him hes a smart boy mrs cody hed have come around to it sooner or later anne stepped toward the door of the house and then she turned back maggie orourke thinks a lot of you i guess i found out why i wont keep you any longer mr redman not quite sure how to respond he touched his hat before he started toward the paddock to saddle his horse thats quite a man sarah anne commented if i were you id want to go say a proper goodbye yes i she looked at anne then back toward jake torn between manners and longings you wont mind if i fix tea will you anne asked as she disappeared inside no please make yourself at home sarah looked toward jake again ill only be a minute gathering her skirts she ran jake he turned the saddle held in both hands and enjoyed the flash of legs and petticoats wait i she stopped a hand on her heart when she realized she was not only out of breath but hadnt any idea what she wanted to say to him are you when will you be back the mustang shifted and nickered softly as jake settled the saddle in place havent left yet she hated feeling foolish and hated even more the idea that he could swing onto his horse and ride out of her life for days at a time perhaps patience would do the job i was hoping youd come back for supper he tossed up a stirrup to tighten the cinch you asking me to supper unless youve something else youd rather be doing his hand snaked out fast and smooth to snag her arm before she could flounce away its not often i get invitations to supper from pretty ladies his grip firm he glanced back toward the house things were changing he decided and changing fast when he looked at the adobe cabin and thought of home he still didnt know what the hell to do about it if id known youd need so long to think about it sarah said between her teeth i wouldnt have bothered you can just but before she could tell him he swept her off her feet you sure do get fired up easy he brought his mouth down hard on hers to taste the heat and the honey thats one of the things i like about you put me down but her arms encircled his neck mrs cody might see then she laughed and kissed him again as he swung her down well will you come to supper or not he vaulted into the saddle in one fluid economical motion his eyes were shadowed by the brim of his hat when he looked down at her yeah ill come to supper itll be ready at seven she called after him as he spurred his horse into a gallop she watched until dust and distance obscured him gathering her skirts again she ran back to the house the laughter that was bubbling in her throat dried up when she heard alices weeping liza stood by the stove the kettle steaming in her hand sarah mas but sarah was already rushing up the ladder ready to defend the girl anne cody held the weeping alice in her arms rocking her gently one wide capable hand was stroking the girls dark hair there now honey you cry it all out she murmured then itll be behind you wanting quiet she sent sarah a warning glance her own eyes were damp slowly sarah descended the ladder alice called for you liza explained still holding the kettle ma went up to see what she needed liza set the sputtering kettle aside tea was the last thing on her mind sarah whats going on im not sure i know liza cast another look toward the loft and said in a low voice was she that girl really beaten yes the memory of it had sarah touching a fingertip to the bruise under her own eye horribly liza ive never known one person was capable of hurting another so viciously she needed to be busy sarah decided there was too much to think about her father the mine jake alice after running a dis tracted hand over her hair she began to slice honey cake did she really work for carlotta yes liza shes just a girl younger than you and i really torn between sympathy and fascination liza edged closer to sarah but she well i mean at the silver star she must have she didnt know anything else sarah looked down at her hands honey cake and tea there had been a time when she had thought life was as ordered and simple as that her father sold her sold her to a man for twenty dollars but thats the curiosity in lizas eyes heated to fury why hes the one who should be beat her own pa somebody ought to hush liza anne slipped quietly down the ladder no one deserves to be beat ma sarah says that girls pa sold her sold her off for money like a horse anne paused in the act of brushing down her skirts is that true sarah yes she ran away and ended up at the silver star annes lips tightened as she fought back words that even her husband had never heard her utter id dearly love that tea now oh yes sarah hurried back to the stove im sorry please sit down she set out the napkins shed made out of blue checked gingham i hope youll enjoy this honey cake its a recipe from the cook of a very dear friend of mine in philadelphia as she offered the plate philadelphia and everyone in it seemed years away thank you dear anne waited for sarah to sit down then said alice is sleeping now i wasnt sure youd done the right thing by taking her in here truth is i drove out this morning because i was concerned i had to take her in no you didnt when sarah bristled anne laid a hand on hers but you did what was right and im proud of you that girl needs help with a sigh she sat back and looked at her own daughter pretty liza she thought always so bright and curious and safe she reflected adding a quick prayer of thanksgiving her children had always had a full plate and a solid roof over their heads and a father who loved them she made up her mind to thank her husband very soon alice johnson has had nothing but hard times anne took a sip of tea her mind was made up she had only to convince her husband at that thought her lips curved a little it was never hard to convince a man whose heart was soft and open the other ladies in town would be a bit more difficult but shed bring them around the challenge of it made her smile widen and the light of battle glint in her eyes what that girl needs is some proper work and a real home when shes on her feet again i think she should come work at the store oh mrs cody anne brushed sarahs stunned gratitude aside once lizas married to will im going to need new help she can take lizas room in the house as well as part of her wage sarah fumbled for words then gave up and simply leaned over to wrap her arms around anne its kind of you she managed so kind ive spoken with alice about just that but she pointed out that the women in town wouldnt accept her after shed worked at the silver star you dont know ma pride shimmered in lizas voice shell bring the ladies around every one wont you ma anne patted her hah you can put money on it satisfied she broke off a corner of the honey cake sarah now that weve got that settled i feel i have to talk to you about the visit you paid to the silver star yesterday visit though she knew it was hopeless sarah covered the bruise under her eyes with her fingers you know when you tangled with carlotta liza put in everyone in towns talking about how you wrestled with her and even punched jake redman i wish id seen it she caught her mothers eye and grimaced well i do oh lord this time sarah covered her entire face everyone mrs miller was standing just outside when the sheriff went in liza took a healthy bite of cake you know how she loves to carry tales when sarah just groaned anne shook her head at liza honey you eat some more of that cake and keep your mouth busy now sarah anne pried sarahs hands away from her face i have to say i was a mite surprised to hear that youd gone in that place and had a hairpulling match with that woman truth is a nice young girl like you shouldnt even know about places and people like that cant live in lone bluff two days and not know about carlotta liza said past a mouthful of cake even johnny liza anne held up a single finger chew seeing as youre without kin of your own sarah i figured id come on out and speak to you about it she took another sip of tea while sarah waited to be lectured well blast it now that ive seen that girl up there i wished id taken a good yank at carlotta myself ma delighted liza slapped both hands to her mouth you wouldnt no anne flushed a little and shifted in her chair but id like to now im not saying i want to hear about you going back there sarah no sarah managed a rueful smile i think ive finished any business i might have at the silver star popped you a good one did she anne commented studying sarahs eye yes sarah grinned irrepressibly but i gave her a bloody nose its quite possible that i broke it really oh i do wish id seen that ready to be impressed liza leaned forward only to straighten again at a look from anne well its not as if id go inside myself not if you want to keep the hide on your bottom anne said calmly she smoothed her hair took another sip of tea then gave up well darn it are you going to tell us what it looks like in there or not with a laugh sarah propped her elbows on the table and told them scheming came naturally to carlotta as she lay in the wide feather bed she ran through all the wrongs that had been done to her and her plans for making them right the light was dim with only two thin cracks appearing past the sides of the drawn shades it was a large room by the silver stars standards shed had the walls between two smaller rooms removed to fashion her own private quarters sacrificing the money one extra girl would have made her for comfort for carlotta money and comfort were one and the same she wanted plenty of both though it was barely nine she poured a glass of whiskey from the bottle that was always at her bedside the hot powerful taste filled the craving she awoke with every morning sipping and thinking she cast her eyes around the room the walls were papered in a somewhat virulent redandsilver stripe she found rich and elegant thick red drapes too heavy for the blistering arizona summers hung at the windows they made her think smugly of queens and palaces the carpet echoed the color and was badly in need of cleaning she rarely noticed the dirt on the mirrored vanity which was decorated with painted cherubs was a silver brush set with an elaborate c worked into the design it was the only monogram she used carlotta had no last name at least none she cared to remember her mother had always had a man in her bed carlotta had gone to sleep most nights on a straw pallet in the corner her lullaby the grunts and groans of sex it had made her sick the way men had pounded themselves into her mother but that had been nothing compared to the disgust she had felt for her mothers weeping when the men were gone crying and sniveling and begging gods forgiveness carlotta thought her mother had been the whore of that frigid little town in the carolina mountains but she hadnt had the guts to make it work for her always claimed she was doing it to feed her little girl carlotta remembered with a sneer she poured more whiskey into the glass if that had been so why had her little girl gone hungry so many nights in the dim light carlotta studied the deep amber liquid because ma was just as fond of whiskey as i am she decided she drank and savored the taste the difference between you and me ma she thought to herself is that i aint ashamed not of the whiskey not of the men and i made something of myself did you cry when i left carlotta laughed as she thought back to the night shed left the smelly windowless shack for the last time shed been fifteen and shed saved nearly thirty dollars shed made selling herself to trappers men paid more for youth carlotta had learned quickly her mother had never known her daughter was her stiffest competition she despised them all every man whod pushed himself into her she took their money arched her hips and loathed them hate made a potent catalyst for passion her customers went away satisfied and she saved every coin one night shed packed her meager belongings sto len another twenty dollars from the can her mother kept hidden in the rafters and headed west shed worked saloons in the early years enjoying the fancy clothes and bottles of paint her affair with whiskey had blossomed and helped her smile and seduce hungryeyed cowboys and roughhanded drifters shed saved keeping her mouth firmly shut about the bonuses she wheedled from men when shed turned eighteen she had had enough to open her own place a far cry from the silver star carlotta remembered her first brothel had been hardly more than a shack in a stinking cattle town ineast texas but shed made certain her girls were as young and pretty as she could get shed hada brief affair with a gambler whod sported brocade vests and string ties hed filled her head with talk of crystal chandeliers and red carpets when shed moved on shed taken his pearl stickpin two hundred in cash and her own profits then shed opened the silver star one day shed move on again on to california but she intended to do it in style shed have those crystal chandeliers she vowed and a white porcelain tub with gold handles gold carlotta felt a pleasure flow through her a pleasure as fluid as the whiskey it was gold she needed to bring her dream to full life and gold she intended to have the man beside her was the tool she would use to gain it jim carlson carlotta looked down at his face it was rough with several days growth of beard and slack from sleep sex and whiskey she knew him for a fool hottempered smallminded and easily manipulated still he was betterlooking than many she had taken into her bed his body was tough and lean but she preferred young limber bodies like jakes scowling carlotta took another drink shed broken her most important rule with jake redman shed let herself want him really want him in a way shed never desired another man her body had responded to his so that for the first time in her life she hadnt feigned the ecstasy men wanted from a whore shed felt it now she craved it as she craved whiskey and gold and power with jake desire was a hot tight fist in her gut not just because he had a style in bed most men who came to her didnt feel obliged to employ because jake redman held something of himself back something she sensed was powerful and exciting something she wanted for herself and had been on her way to getting she thought before that pastyfaced bitch had come to town she had a lot to pay miss sarah conway back for thoughtful carlotta touched a hand to her bruised cheek a whole lot pay her back she would and in doing so she would take jake and the gold jim carlson though he was unaware of it was going to help her on all counts setting the empty glass aside carlotta picked up a hand mirror the bruises annoyed her but they would fade the faint lines fanning out from her eyes and bracketing her mouth would not they would only deepen she cursed and pushed the mirror aside with a pleased smile she ran both hands down her body it was long smoothskinned and curvaceous it was her body men wanted and her body she had used and would continue to use to get what life had cheated her of she shifted took jim in her hand and brought him breathlessly awake god almighty carlotta groaning he tried to roll over and into her in a hurry jim she evaded him expertly all the while using her skill to keep him aroused thought youd burned the life out of me last night he shuddered glad to find out it aint so i want to talk to you jim talk he filled his hands with her breasts honey i got better ways to spend my money than talk she let him suck and nuzzle calculating how far she could let him go and keep him in line rooting about like a puppy she thought in disgust while she stroked his hair your money ran out at dawn sweetheart i got more he bit her hard because she knew he expected it she gave a soft moan of pleasure house rules jim money first he swore at her and considered taking his pleasure as he chose but if he forced her and managed to avoid getting tossed out by eli the doors of the silver star would be barred to him he had money he thought and a need that was rockhard when he started to shift carlotta trailed a finger down his arm talk jim and ill with a long sigh she arched back so that he could look his fill ill give you the rest for free sweat beaded on his upper lip as he studied her you dont do nothing for free deliberately she ran a hand over her breast and down her rib cage and stroked the soft swell of her belly talk were going to talk first her lips curved as she watched him swallow about gold when he stiffened her smile only widened dont worry jim i havent told anyone have i ive never said a word about how you and donley killed old matt conway i was drunk when i told you about that he wiped a hand over the back of his mouth as fear and desire twined inside him a man says all kinds of things when hes drunk that made her laugh she pillowed her head on her folded arms nobody knows that better than a whore or a wife honey relax who was the one who told you old matt had finally hit who was the one who told you his daughter was coming and you had to move fast dont try dealing from the bottom with me sweetheart its business remember yours and mine after pushing himself up in bed he reached badtemperedly for the whiskey bottle i told you once sam got things worked out youd get your share and what does sam have to work out she let him take a swallow two it never hurt to loosen a mans tongue but there were some who went from relaxed to mean with whiskey with jim the line was all too easily crossed she took the bottle back weve already been through this he muttered he no longer felt like having sex and he sure as hell didnt want to talk if sam had some idea about getting that conway bitch to the altar to get his hands on the deed hes had time enough everybody in town knows she doesnt have her eye on your brother but on jake redman how about you he tapped a finger none too gently against her bruised cheekbone who do you have those blue eyes on the main chance sweetheart always the main chance she ran her tongue over her lips grimly pleased with the way jims eyes followed the movement the surest way to lead a man she knew was from a point just below his gunbelt she rose knowing the shuttered light would be flattering to her skin slowly she ran her hands up her body letting them linger on her breasts you know jim she began slipping into a thin red negligee that was as transparent as glass ive always been drawn to men who take risks who know what they want and take it she left the negligee open as she walked back toward the bed that night you came in and told me how you and donley had dragged matt up to the mine and how youd killed him because he wouldnt hand over the deed you told me just how youd killed him how youd hurt him first remember that night jim you and me sure had ourselves a good time after we came upstairs he wet his lips her nipples were dark and just out of reach i remember it was exciting knowing youd just come from killing a man killing him to get what you wanted i knew i was with a real man the negligee fell carelessly off one shoulder trouble is nothings happened since i keep waiting i told you sams going the hell with sam she battled back her temper to smile at him hes too slow too careful a real man takes action if he wants the conway girl why doesnt he just take her or you could take her for him she moved closer letting the idea take root shes all thats in the way jim you deal with her and i aint talkingabout firing one of her sheds the quick wariness in his eyes pleased her hurt her jim shell hand over the deed quick enough then kill her she murmured the words like a love song when shes dead you come to me we can do anything you want she stood beside the bed glorious and gleaming anything and it wont cost you a cent she didnt cry out when his hand clamped over her wrist their faces were close each of them aroused in different ways for different reasons youll take care of her yes damn you come here carlotta smiled bitterly at the ceiling while jim collapsed on top of her from her window an hour later carlotta watched as jake rode into town her hands clenched into fists from anger yes but also from a stab of desire soon she thought very soon hed come back to her she turned as jim pulled up his pants she was smiling i think its a real good time for you to pay sarah conway a visit chapter fourteen when jake walked into maggies she set her fisted hands on her hips and looked him up and down with a sniff fine time to be strolling in boyo what she wanted was gossip and she hoped to annoy it out of him cant figure why a man would be paying good money for a bed and never sleep in it i pay for your chicken and dumplings too but i aint stupid enough to eat them he started resignedly up the stairs knowing she would follow you dont seem to be suffering any from lack of food with the audacity shed been born with she poked a finger in his ribs must be getting meals someplace must be sarah a good cook is she saying nothing he pushed open the door to his room dont go pokering up on me jake my boy maggie swiped a dustcloth here and there its too late every blessed soul in town saw the way you looked at her at the dance then there was the way you rode out of town after her when she socked you in the jaw the dark furious glint in his eyes had maggie cackling thats more like it always said you could drop a man dead with a look as quick as with those guns of yours no need to draw on me though i figure sarah conways just what you need do you jake tossed his saddlebags on the bed he considered starting to strip to get rid of her but hed tried that before and it hadnt budged her an inch i reckon you want to tell me why before you leave me the hell alone like to see the back of me would you she just laughed again and patted his cheek more than one mans considered it my best side he barely managed to control a grin he was damned if he knew why the nosy old woman appealed to him why dont you get yourself another husband maggie then you could nag him youd miss me i reckon some dogs miss the fleas once they manage to scratch them off then he sat by the window propping his back against one side and his boot against the other somebodys got to bite at you might as well be me i got something to say about you and sarah conway staring out the window he frowned it wont be anything i havent said to myself go away maggie now listen to me boy she said in an abruptly serious tone theres some whove born to the pretty they slide out of their mothers and straight into silk and satin then theres others who have to fight and claw and scratch for every good thing we know something about that you and me still frowning he looked back at her with a nod she continued some go hungry and some have their bellies full the sweet lord himself knows why he set things up that way and no one else but he didnt make the one man better than the other its men themselves who decide if theyre going to be strong or weak and thats the same as good or bad sometimes theres a woman who shoves them one way or the other you take ahold of sarah conway jake shell shove you right enough could work the other way around he murmured a womans easier to shove than a man maggies brows rose in two amused peaks jake my boy youve got a lot to learn about women it was the second time in so many days hed been told that jake mused when maggie clicked the door shut behind her but it wasnt a woman he had to think about now it was gold and it was murder he took matt conways journal and started to read unlike sarah jake didnt bother with the early pages he scanned a few at the middle where matt had written of working the mine and of his hopes for a big strike there were mentions of sarah here and there of matts regrets at leaving her behind of his pride in the letters she wrote him and always he wrote of his longing to send for her he had wanted to build her a home first a real home like the one hed described to her the mine would do it or so he had thought throughout the pages his confidence never wavered each time i enter i feel it not just hope but certainty today each time im sure it will be today there is gold here enough to give my sarah the life of a princess the life i had wanted so badly to give her mother how alike they are the miniature sarah sent me for christmas might be my own lost lovely ellen looking at it each night before i sleep makes me grieve for the little girl i left behind and ache for the young woman my daughter has become so there had been a painting jake mused questions might be answered once it was found he skipped on toward the end in my years of prospecting ive learned that success is as elusive as any dream a man may have a map and tools he may have skill and persistence but there is one factor that cannot be bought cannot be learned luck without it a man can dig and hammer for years with the vein he seeks always inches out of reach as i have been sweet god as i have been was it the hand of chance that caused my own to slip that had me sprawled in the dirt nursing my bruised and bloody fingers and cursing god as i learned to curse him so eloquently and when i stumbled halfblind with tears of frustration and pain was it his hand that led me deeper into the tunnel swinging my pick like a madman there it was under my stillbleeding fingers glinting dull against the dark rock it ran like a river back back into the dark mouth of the mine narrow then widening i know it cannot be yet to me it seemed to shimmer and pulse like a living thing gold at long last i am not ashamed that i sat on the dusty floor of the mine my lamp between my knees and wept hed found it jake thought as he frowned over the words it was no longer just a hunch a feeling but fact matt conway had found his gold and hed died perhaps there would be an answer to why and how in the remaining pages do men grow more foolish with age perhaps perhaps but then whiskey makes fools of young and old there need be no excuses a man finds his hearts desire after years of sweat to what does he turn a woman and a bottle i found both at the silver star it had been my intention to keep my discovery to myself for a little longer sarahs letter changed that shes coming my own little girl is already on her way to join me there is no way to prepare her for what she will find thank god i will soon be able to give her all that i promised it wasnt my intent to tell carlotta of the gold or of sarahs arrival whiskey and weakness undoubtedly i paid for my lack of discretion with a vicious head the next morning and the visit from samuel carlson could it be coincidence that now after all these years he wants the mine his offer was generous too generous for me to believe the purchase was to be made from sentiment on his part perhaps my suspicions are unfounded he took my refusal in good temper leaving the offer open yet there was something something in the way he held his brother and his man donley to silence like holding wild dogs on a leash tomorrow i will ride into town and tell barker about my discovery it may be wise to hire a few men to help me work the mine the sooner it is begun the sooner i can build my sarah the house she believes is already waiting for her it was the last entry closing the book jake rose he had his answers miss sarah seeing as youre going into town and all sarah sighed as she adjusted her straw bonnet again lucius he scratched his grizzled beard a man gets powerful thirsty doing all this work very well shed managed to cure him of his abhorrence of water easing him away from his passion for whiskey would take a bit more time im obliged miss sarah he grinned at her in the weeks hed been working for her hed discovered she had a soft heart and a tough mind you check on that wood you ordered ill be right pleased to put that floor in for you when it gets here easily said she mused when the wood was still hundreds of miles away you might finish building the pen jake started i intend to inquire about buying some piglets while im in town yesm he spit hed build the cursed pen but hed be damned if hed tend pigs miss sarah im getting a mite low on tobacco whiskey and tobacco sarah thought rolling her eyes heavenward what would mother superior have said ill see to it you look in on alice regularly lucius see that she has a bit of that broth and rests she heard him grumble about being a nursemaid and snagged her lip to keep it from curving ill be back by three im going to fix a very special meal tonight she gave him a final glance youll want to change your shirt she cracked the reins and headed out before she allowed herself to laugh life was glorious life was she thought as she let the horses prance magnificent perhaps she was rich as jake had said but the gold no longer mattered so many things that had seemed so important onlya short time before really meant nothing at all she was in love beautifully wildly in love and all the gold in the world couldnt buy what she was feeling she would make him happy it would take some time some care and more than a little patience but she would make jake redman see that together they could have everything two people could want a home children roots a lifetime what they had brought to each other had changed them both she was not the same woman who had boarded the train in philadelphia how far shed come sarah reflected as she scanned the distant buttes not just in miles it was much more than miles only weeks before shed been certain her happiness depended on having a new bonnet she laughed as the hot wind tugged at the brim of the one she wore now she had come to lone bluff with dreams of fine parties and china dishes she hadnt found them but she had found more much more and she had changed him she could see it in the way he looked at her in the way he reached for her as he slept just to hold her to keep her close perhaps the words were difficult for him to say she could wait now that she had found him nothing and no one would keep her from being with him she saw the rider coming and for an instant her smile bloomed but it wasnt jake sarah watched jim carlson slow his horse to a trot as he crossed the road in front of her she intended to ride by with a brief nod of greeting but he blocked her way morning maam he shifted in his saddle to lean toward her the stink of whiskey colored his words all alone good morning mr carlson im on my way to town and im afraid im a bit pressed for time that so it was going to be easier than hed thought he wouldnt have to go through lucius to get to her now thats a shame since i was just riding out to see you oh she didnt care for the look in his eyes and the smell of whiskey on his breath didnt seem harmless as it did with lucius is there something i can do for you mr carlson there sure is slowly his eyes on hers he drew his gun step on out of the wagon you must be mad shed frozen at the first sight of the barrel but now instinctively her fingers inched toward her rifle i wouldnt touch that rifle maam itd be a shame for me to put a hole in that pretty white hand of yours now i said get out of the wagon jake will kill you if you touch me hed already thought that one through that was the reason he was altering carlottas plan to suit himself he wasnt going to kill sarah here and now unless she did something stupid oh i got plans for redman honey dont you worry you just step out of that wagon before i have to put a bullet in your horses she didnt doubt he would or that he would shoot her in the back should she try to run trapped she stepped down and stood stiffly beside the wagon god almighty you got looks sarah thats why sam took to you with his gun still in his hand jim slid out of the saddle you got those fine lady looks like our mama did you saw her picture at the house sam hes mighty fond of pictures he grinned again when he reached out to touch sarahs face she hissed and jerked it aside but you you got some fire mama was just crazy plumb crazy he stepped forward so that his body pushed hers against the side of the wagon sam told you she was delicate didnt he thats the word he uses crazy was what she was so that the old man would lock her up sometimes for days one day when he opened up the door he found her hanging dead with a pretty pink silk scarf around her neck horror leaped into her eyes and warred with fear let me go if samuel finds out what youve done hell you think i run scared of sam laughing jim forced sarahs face back to his maybe you figure hes smoother than me got more brains but were blood his fingers bit into her skin dont forget it you ever let him get this close let him do what he wanted or did you save yourself for that breed she slapped him with all the force of her fear and rage then she was clawing at him blindly with some mad hope of getting to his horse she felt the barrel of the gun press into the soft underside of her jaw and heard the click of the hammer try that again and ill leave whats left of you here for the buzzards gold or no gold your pa tried to get away too the stunned look in her eyes pleased him gave him the edge he wanted you think on what happened to him and take care he was breathing quickly his finger trembling on the trigger hed lied when hed said he wasnt scared of his brother if it hadnt been for the rage sam would heap on him jim would have sent a bullet into her now youre going to do just like i say and youll stay alive a while longer interesting reading barker squinted down at matts journal while he fanned the hot still air around his face with his hat matt had a fine way of putting words on paper fine or not its plain enough jake fidgeted at the window annoyed with himself for coming to the law with something he could and should have handled himself sarahs doing he thought he hadnt even felt the shove its plain that matt thought hed found gold hed found it lucius dug through to where matt was working its there just the way matt wrote thoughtful barker closed the book and leaned back in his chair poor old matt finally makes the big strike then gets caught in a cavein he was dead before those beams gave way taking his time barker pushed a cozy plug of tobacco in his cheek well now maybe you think so and maybe im doing some pondering on it but this here journal isnt proof its not going to be easy to ride out to the carlson ranch and talk to sam about murder with no more than a book in my hand now hold on he added when jake snatched the book from the desk i didnt say i wasnt going out i just said it wasnt going to be easy still fanning himself with his hat he sat back in his chair he wanted to think it through and think it through carefully the carlson family had a long reach he was more concerned about that than about the quick temper and gun of young jim got a question for you jake whyd you bring me that journal instead of riding on out and putting a hole in the carlson brothers jake skimmed his eyes over barkers comfortable paunch my deep and abiding respect for the law after a bark of laughter the sheriff spit a stream of tobacco juice into the spittoon i once knew a woman before mrs barker who lied as smooth as that couldnt help but admire her with a sigh he perched his hat on his head whatever your reason you brought it so im dutybound to do something about it got to tell you nothings more tiring than duty he reached unenthusiastically for his gunbelt as the door burst open sheriff nancy stood darting glances over her shoulder and tugging restlessly at the shoulder of her hastily donned dress i got to talk to you youll just have to hold on to it till i get back one of them cowboys got a little too enthusiastic over at the silver star i aint getting worked up about it youd better listen nancy stood firm in front of the door im only doing this cause of alice she glanced at jake then carlottad strip my skin if she found out i come but i figured miss conway done right by alice i ought to do right by her quit babbling if youre hellbent on talking say it its carlotta nancy kept her voice low as if it might carry back to the silver star shes been feeling real mean since yesterday carlotta was born feeling mean barker muttered then he waved to nancy to continue all right finish it out last night she took jim carlson up she dont usually let men stay overnight in her room but he was still there this morning my rooms next to hers and i heard them talking jake took her arm to draw her farther into the room why dont you tell me what you heard she was talking about how jim and donley killed matt conway and how he was supposed to take care of matts girl she yelped when jakes fingers bit into her arm i didnt have no part in it im telling you what i heard cause she took alice in after carlotta near killed her looks like id better have a talk with carlotta barker mused straightening his hat no you cant fear for her own skin had her yanking free of jake shell kill me thats the gods truth anyways its too late for that why jake caught her again before she could dash out the door shed gone this far nancy thought dragging the back of her hand over her mouth she might as well finish carlotta said jim was to scare miss conway good hurt her then when he had the deed to the mine he was to kill her he rode out an hour ago and i couldnt get away till now jake was already through the door and halfway to his horse when barker caught up with him will and mell be right behind you there had been times when killing had come easily to jake so easily that after it was done hed felt nothing this time would be different he knew it felt it as he sped down the road toward sarahs house if jim carlson was ahead of him and he got within range he would kill him without question it would be easy and it would be a pleasure he heard the horses behind him but he didnt look back his own mount seemed to sense the urgency and lengthened his strides until his powerful legs were a blur and the dust was a yellow wall behind them when jake saw the wagon the cold rage dropped into his gut and turned into a hot bubbling fear he vaulted from the saddle beside the two horses which stood slackhipped and drowsy surprisingly agile barker slipped down beside him take it easy he began to place a hand on jakes shoulder but then he thought better of it if he took her off somewhere well track him he held up a hand before any of the men with him could speak along with will were three men from town including john cody who still wore his store apron we take care of our own here jake well get her back in silence jake bent down to pick up the cameo lying facedown in the road its slender pin was snapped there were a few pale blue threads clinging to the broken point the signs told him shed struggled and the picture of her frightened and fighting clawed at him the signs also told him where she was being taken with the broach in his pocket he jumped into the saddle and rode hard for the carlson ranch her hands were bound together and tied to the saddle horn if it had been possible she would have jumped to the ground though there was nowhere to run at least she would have had the satisfaction of making him sweat everything jake had said was true about the gold about her fathers death sarah had no doubt that the man responsible for it all was sitting behind her at first she thought he was taking her into the hills or to the desert where he could kill her and leave her body hidden but she saw with some confusion the graceful lines of the carlson ranch house in the shallow valley below it was a peaceful scene lovely despite the waves of radiant heat rising up from the ground she heard a dog bark as they approached samuel burst out of the house hatless and pale to stare at his brother what in gods name have you done jim loosened the rope around the saddle horn then lifted sarah to the ground brought you a present sarah my dear his mouth grim carlson tugged at her bonds im speechless theres no way i could ever he let his words trail off and began to massage the raw skin of her wrists he must be drunk stable that horse damn you he shouted at jim then come inside youve a great deal to answer for it stunned her left her limp when jim merely shrugged and led his horse away it must be a joke a bizarre joke she thought bringing her trembling hands to her lips but it wasnt she knew it was much too deadly to be a joke samuel my dear i dont know what to say he slipped a supporting arm around her waist i cant begin to apologize for my brothers outrageous behavior are you hurt dear lord your dress is torn he had her by the shoulders then and the look in his eyes froze her blood did he touch you molest you she managed to shake her head once then twice then the words came samuel he killed my father it was for the gold theres gold in the mine he must have found out and he he murdered my father she was breathless now her hands clinging to his trim black vest he only stared at her stared until she wanted to scream samuel you must believe me youre overwrought he said stiffly and no wonder come in out of the heat but he you neednt worry about jim he led her inside the thick adobe walls he wont bother you again you have my word i want you to wait in my office his voice was quiet soothing as he led her past his mothers portrait and into a room try to relax ill take care of everything samuel please be careful he might he could hurt you no he patted her hand as he eased her into a chair hell do exactly what i tell him when the door shut she covered her face with her hands for a moment she let the hysteria shed fought off take control hed intended to kill her she was certain of it from the way hed looked at her the way hed smiled at her why in gods name had he brought her here where she would be protected by samuel protected after letting out a shaky breath she waited until her heartbeat leveled and the need to scream passed she was safe now but it wasnt over she closed her eyes briefly it was far from over it was madness jim carlson was as mad as his poor mother had been but instead of killing himself he had killed her father she wanted to weep to let the new aching grief come but she couldnt she couldnt weep and she couldnt sit rising she began to pace the room was small but beautifully furnished there were delicate porcelain figurines and a painting in fragile pastels it reflected samuels elegant taste and eye for beauty how unalike the brothers were she thought cain and abel with a hand on her heart she rushed to the door she could never have borne the guilt if one brother killed another over her but the door was locked for a moment she thought it was only her nerves making her fumble after a deep breath she tried the knob again it resisted whirling around she stared at the room locked in but why for her own protection samuel must have thought she would be safer behind a locked door until he came back for her and if it was jim who came back with the key her heart thudding in her throat she began a frantic search for a weapon she pulled out desk drawers pushing ruthlessly through papers if not a pistol she thought then a knife even a letter opener she would not be defenseless not again she tugged open the middle drawer and the brass pulls knocked against the glossy mahog any her hand froze when she saw the miniature her miniature like a sleepwalker she reached for it staring blindly it was the selfportrait that she had painted the year before the one she had shipped to her father for christmas the one sarah realized as her fingers closed over it that he had shown with pride to his friends in town the one that had been missing from his possessions missing because it had been taken by his murderer when the key turned in the lock she didnt bother to close the drawer or to hide what she held in her hand instead she rose and faced him it was you she murmured as samuel carlson closed and locked the door behind him you killed my father chapter fifteen carlson crossed the room until only the desk was between them sarah his voice was almost a sigh a sigh touched with patience in his hand he carried a delicate cup filled with fragrant tea but she noted that he had strapped on his gun i realize how upset you must be after jims inexcusable behavior now why dont you sit down compose yourself you killed my father she repeated it was rage she felt now waves of it thats ridiculous the words were said gently i havent killed anyone here my dear ive brought you some tea it should help calm you the quiet sincerity in his eyes caused her to falter he must have sensed it because he smiled and stepped forward instantly she backed away why was this in your desk carlson looked at the miniature in her hand a woman should never intrude on a mans personal belongings his voice became indulgent as he set the cup on the desk but since you have ill confess i can be faulted for being overly romantic i suppose the moment i saw it i fell in love with you the moment i saw your face i wanted you he held out a hand palm up as if he were asking for a dance come sarah you cant condemn me for that confused she shook her head tell me how this came to be in your drawer when it belonged to my father impatience clouded his face and he dropped his hand to his side isnt baring my soul enough for you you knew right from the beginning you knew the way i felt about you you deceived me there was more than impatience in his face now something else was building in him something that had the bright hot taste of fear clogging her throat i dont know what youre talking about samuel she spaced her words carefully and kept her eyes on his but youre right im upset and im not myself id prefer to go home now and discuss all of this later with the miniature still clutched in her hand she stepped around the desk and toward the door the violence with which he grabbed her and shoved her back against the wall had her head reeling its too late jims interference has changed everything his interference and your prying i was patient with you sarah now its too late his face was close to hers close enough for her to see clearly what was in his eyes she wondered as the blood drained slowly from her face how it was that shed never seen it before the madness was bright and deadly she tried to speak and found she had to swallow first samuel youre hurting me i would have made you a queen he took one hand and brought it up to stroke her face she cringed but his eyes warned her not to move i would have given you everything a woman could want silk he traced a finger over her cheekbone diamonds then he ran it lightly down her throat gold his hand tightened abruptly around her windpipe before she could begin to struggle it was loosened again gold sarah it belonged to me truly to me my grandfather had no right to lose that part of my heritage and your father he had no right to deny me what was already mine he did it for me perhaps she could calm him if only she could remain calm herself before it was too late he only wanted to see that i was taken care of of course he nodded as if he were pleased that she understood of course he did as i do it would have been yours as much as mine i would never have let you suffer because i had taken it back as my wife you would have had every luxury we would have gone back east together that was always my plan i was going to follow you back east and court you but you stayed you should never have stayed sarah this isnt the place for you i knew it the moment i saw your picture it was there in that miserable little cabin beside the cot i found it while i was looking for the deed to the mine his face changed again he looked petulant now like a boy who had been denied an extra piece of pie i was very annoyed that my brother and donley killed matt clumsy they were only to convince him to turn over the deed then of course it was up to me to think of causing the cavein to cover up what theyd done i never found the deed but i found your picture she didnt think he was aware of how viciously his fingers were digging into her arms she was almost certain he was no longer aware of how much he was telling her she remained silent and still knowing her only hope now was time delicate he murmured such a delicate face the innocence shining in the eyes the soft curve of the mouth it was a lie wasnt it sarah the violence sprang back into his face and she could only shake her head and wait there was no delicacy no innocence you toyed with me offering me smiles only smiles while you gave yourself to redman like a whore he should be dead for touching what belonged to me you should both be dead she prepared to scream she prepared to fight for what she knew was her life sam the banging on the door brought with it a mixture of fear and relief swearing carlson dragged sarah to the door to unlock it goddamn it i told you to go back and get rid of the wagon and team riders coming in the sweat on jims face attested to the fact that he had already ridden and ridden hard its redman and the sheriff with some men from town he glanced at sarah theyll be looking for her when sarah tried to break away samuel locked an arm around her throat youve ruined everything bringing her here i only did it cause you wanted her i couldve taken care of her back on the road hell i couldve taken care of her the night we torched her shed but you said you didnt want her hurt none carlson tightened his grip as sarah clawed at his arm her vision grayed from lack of air as if from a distance she heard the voices one mixing into the other how long ten minutes no more kill her now not here you idiot hold them off in the hills sarahs last thought before she lost consciousness was that jake was coming but too late you listen to me barker stopped the men on the rise above the carlson ranch but it was jake he was looking at i know youd like to ride in there hellbent but you take a minute to think if theyve got her weve got to go slow theyve got her in his mind the carlson brothers were already dead then lets make sure we get her back in one piece will i want you to break off ease on over to the barn john id be obliged if youd circle around the back i dont want any shooting until its necessary with a nod he spurred his horse jim watched them coming and wiped the sweat off his brow his men were all out on the range not that theyd have been any good he thought the only one whod have backed them against the sheriff was doney and he was dead wetting his lips he levered the rifle in the window he had to wait until they got close that was what sam had told him wait until they got close then he was to kill as many as he could starting with redman sweat dripped down into his eyes his fingers twitched sam had sent donley to kill redman jim remembered but it was donley whod been buried now he was going to do it he wet his lips when he caught jake in the sight he was going to do it right but nerves had his finger jerking on the trigger jake felt the bullet whiz past his cheek like lightning he kicked one foot free of the stirrup to slide halfway down the side of his horse gun drawn he rode toward the house while barker shouted orders he could hear the men scrambling for cover and returning fire but his mind was on one thing and one thing alone getting inside to sarah outside the doors he leaped off when he kicked them open his second gun was drawn the hall and the foyer were empty he could hear the shouts of men and peppering gunfire with a quick glance for any sign of her he started up the stairs jim carlsons back was to him when he broke open the door where is she jake didnt flinch when a bullet from outside plowed into the wall beside him from his crouched position jim turned slowly sams got her with a grin he swung his rifle up for months hed wanted another chance to kill jake redman now he took it he was still grinning as he fell forward jake slid his smoking guns back in their holsters moving quickly he began to search the house barker met him on the steps she aint here i found this on the floor in his hand he held sarahs miniature jakes eyes flicked up to barkers they held there only seconds but barker knew he would never forget the look in them later he would tell his wife it was the look of a man whose soul had gotten loose turning on his heel jake headed outside with barker close behind oh god for the first time since jake had known him barker moved with speed pushing past jake he raced to where two of his men were carrying will metcalf he isnt dead john cody laid will down and held his head but we have to get him back to town to the doc barker crouched down as wills eyes fluttered open youre going to be all right son took me by surprise will managed struggling not to gasp at the pain as cody pressed a pad to the hole in his shoulder was sam carlson sheriff he had her i saw he had her on the horse think they headed west good job will barker used his own bandanna to wipe the sweat off his deputys brow one of you men hitch up a wagon get some blankets you get this boy to the doctor john redman and ill go after carlson but when he stood all he saw of jake was the dust his mustang kicked up as he galloped west sarah came to slowly nausea rising in her throat moaning she choked it back and tried to lift a hand to her spinning head both wrists were bound tight to the saddle horn for a moment she thought she was still with jim then she remembered the horse was climbing picking its way up through dusty dungcolored rock she watched loose dirt and stones dislodged by the horses hooves fall down a dizzying ravine the man behind her was breathing hard fighting for calm she tried to mark the trail they were taking and remember it when she escaped and she would she didnt intend to wander helplessly through the rocks he stopped the horse near the edge of a canyon she could see the thin silver line of a river far below an eagle called as he swooped into the wide opening then returned to a nest built in the high rock wall samuel please she cried out when he pulled the rope from around her wrists and dragged her roughly to the ground one look warned her that the calm sane words she had meant to use would never reach him there was a bright glazed light in his eyes his face was pale and drenched with sweat his hair was dark with it she watched his eyes dart here and there as if he expected something to leap out from behind a huddle of rock the man who had swept off his hat and kissed her fingers wasnt here with her now if he had ever been part of samuel carlson he had vanished the man who stood over her was mad and as savage as any beast that lived in the hills what are you going to do hes coming still breathing rapidly carlson swiped a hand over his mouth i saw him behind us when he comes for you ill be ready he reached down to drag her to her feet im going to kill him sarah kill him like a dog he pulled out his gun and rubbed the barrel against her cheek gently like a caress youre going to watch i want you to watch me kill him then youll understand its important that you understand a man like that deserves to die by a gun hes nothing less than nothing a crude gunslinger with indian blood he put his hands on you a whimper escaped her as he dragged a hand through her hair im going to kill him for you sarah then were going away you and i no she wrenched free the canyon was at her back when she faced him if she had stumbled another step she would have fallen back into nothing there was fear the taste of it was bitter in her throat but it wasnt for herself jake would come she knew and someone would die i wont go anywhere with you its over samuel you must see that they know what youve done and theyll hunt you down a potbellied sheriff he laughed and before she could evade him closed his hand over her arm not likely this is a big country sarah they wont find us i wont go with you the pain when he squeezed her arm nearly buckled her knees ill get away if i must ill keep you locked up the way my mother was locked up for your own good she heard the horse even as he did and screamed out a warning no jake hell kill you then she screamed again this time in pain as carlson bent her arm behind her back calmly he put the gun to her temple its her ill kill redman come out slow and keep your hands where i can see them or the first bullet goes in her brain he twisted her arm ruthlessly because he wanted jake to hear her cry out again he wanted jake to hear the pain now redman or ill kill her and toss her body over the edge no oh no tears blurred her vision as she watched jake step out into the open please dont it wont gain you anything to kill him ill go with you she tried to turn her head to look into carlsons eyes ill go anywhere you want not gain anything carlson laughed again and it echoed off the rocks and air satisfaction my dear ill gain satisfaction are you hurt jake asked quietly no she shook her head praying she could will him back behind the rock back to safety no he hasnt hurt me he wont if you go back but youre wrong my dear quite wrong carlson bent his head close to hers amused by the quick fury in jakes eyes when he brushed his lips over sarahs hair ill have to you see because you wont understand unless i kill him for you you wont understand your gunbelt redman carlson drew back the hammer for emphasis and kept the gun tight against sarahs temple take it off slowly very slowly and kick it aside no she began to struggle only to have him drag her arm farther up her back ill kill you myself she wept in rage and fear i swear it when im done here my dear youll do exactly what i say when i say in time youll understand this was for the best drop the belt redman carlson smiled at him and jerked his head to indicate that he wanted the guns kicked away thats fine he took the gun away from sarahs temple to point it at jakes heart you know ive never killed a man before it always seemed more civilized to hire someone someone like yourself his smile widened but i believe im going to enjoy it a great deal you might jake watched his eyes he could only hope sarah had the sense to run when it was over barker couldnt be far behind maybe youll enjoy it more when i tell you i killed your brother the muscles in carlsons cheek twitched you bastard sarah screamed and threw her weight against his gun hand she felt the explosion as if the bullet had driven into her then she was on her knees life poured out of her when she saw jake sprawled on the ground blood seeping from his side no oh god no carlson threw back his head and laughed at the sky i was right i enjoyed it but hes not dead yet not quite yet his lips stretched back from his teeth as he lifted the gun again she didnt think there was no room for thought in a mind swamped with grief she reached out and felt the smooth grip of jakes gun in her hand kneeling in the dirt she balanced it and aimed samuel she murmured and waited for him to turn his head the gun jumped in her hand when she fired the sound of the shot echoed on and on and on he just stared at her afraid shed missed sarah drew back the hammer and calmly prepared to fire again then he stumbled he stared at her as his hand reached up to press against the blood that blossomed i on his shirtfront without a sound he fell back he groped once in the air then tumbled off the edge and into the canyon her hand went limp on the gun then the shudders began racking shudders as she crawled to jake hed pushed himself upon one elbow and he held his knife in his hand she was weeping as she tore at her petticoats to pad the wound in his side i thought hed killed you you looked there was so much blood she thought frantically as she tore more cloth you need a doctor ill get you on the horse as soon as she broke off again as her voice began to hitch it was crazy absolutely crazy for you to come out in the open like that i thought you had more sense so did i the pain was searing centering in his side and flowing out in waves of heat he wanted to touch her just once more before he died sarah dont talk tears clogged her throat his blood seeped through the pad and onto her hands just lie still im going to take care of you damn you i wont let you die he couldnt see her face tired of the effort he closed his eyes he thought but couldnt be sure that he heard horses coming youre a hell of a woman he murmured and passed out when he awoke it was dark there was a bitter taste in his mouth and a hollow throbbing at the base of his skull the pain in his side was still there but dull now and constant he lay still and wondered how long hed been in hell he closed his eyes again thinking it didnt matter how long hed been there since he wouldnt be leaving then he smelled her smelled the soft scent that was sarah though it cost him dearly he opened his eyes again and tried to sit up no dont she was there murmuring to him pressing him gently back on a pillow then laying a cool cloth against his hot face how long he could only manage two whispered words before the strength leaked out of him dont worry cradling his head with her arm she brought a cup to his lips drink a little then youll sleep again im right here with you she continued when he coughed and tried to turn his head away cant he tried to focus on her face but saw only a silhouette it was sarah though cant be in hell he murmured then sank back into the darkness when he awoke again it was daylight and she was there leaning over him smiling murmuring something he couldnt quite understand but there were tears drying on her cheeks cheeks that were too pale she sat beside him took his hand and held it against her lips even as he struggled to speak he lost consciousness again she thought it would drive her mad the way he drifted in and out of consciousness that first week with the fever burning through him and the doctor giving her no hope hour after hour day after day she sat beside him bathing his hot skin soothing when the chills racked him praying when he fell back into that deep silent sleep what had he said that day when hed awakened pacing to the window the one maggie had told her jake had sometimes sat in she drew the curtain aside to look down at the empty street hed said it couldnt be hell but hed been wrong sarah thought it was hell and she was mired in it terrified each day that he would leave her so much blood hed lost so much blood by the time barker had ridden up shed nearly managed to stop it but the ride back to town had cost him more she had stanched still more while the doctor had cut and probed into his side to remove the bullet she hadnt known that watching the bullet come out of him would be as bad as watching it go in then the fever had raced through him vicious and merciless in a week hed been awake only a handful of minutes often delirious sometimes speaking in what lucius had told her was apache if it didnt break soon she knew no matter how hard she prayed no matter how hard she fought it would take him sarah moved back to the bed to sit beside him and watch over him in the pale light of dawn time drifted for her even as it did for him she lost track of minutes then hours then days when morning came she held his hand in hers and thought over the time theyd had together his hands had been strong she thought biting back a sob she laid her forehead on his shoulder and gentle too she remembered when hed touched her when hed taught her with him shed found something lovely something powerful a sunrise a fast river a storm she knew now that love desire passion and affection could be one emotion for one man from that first frantic discovery in the hay to the soft sweet loving by the stream hed given her more than most women had in a lifetime but im greedy she murmured to him i want more jake dont leave me dont cheat me out of what we could have she blinked back tears when she heard the door open behind her how is he the same sarah roseand waited while maggie set a tray on the bureau shed long ago stopped arguing about eating it had taken her only a few days to realize that if she wanted the strength to stay with jake she needed food dont worry none about this breakfast because anne cody made it up for you sarah dashed away the hated weakening tears that was kind of her she asked about our boy here and wanted you to know that alice is doing just fine im glad without interest she folded back the cloth so that steam rose fragrantly from the biscuits looks like carlotta skipped town it doesnt matter with no more interest than she had in the biscuits she looked at her own face in the mirror behind her reflection she could see jake lying motionless in the bed the damage is done child you need sleep and not what you get sitting up in that chair all night you go on and use my room ill stay with him i cant sarah ignored the biscuits and took the coffee sometimes he calls for me and im afraid if im not here he might slip away thats foolish i suppose but i just cant leave him maggie i know because she did maggie set a comforting hand on sarahs shoulder the noise at the door had her turning back what are you doing sneaking around here young john cody johnny slipped into the doorway and stood with his hat crushed in his hands just wanted to see him is all a sickroom aint no place for nasty little boys its all right sarah waved him in and summoned up a smile im sure jake would be pleased that youd taken the time to visit him he aint going to die is he sarah no she found the confidence shed lost during the night no he isnt going to die johnny ma says youre taking real good care of him he reached out a hand then balled it at his side again its all right boy maggie said softening you can pet him as long as he dont know it i do it myself gingerly johnny stroked a hand along jakes forehead hes pretty hot yes but the fevers going to break soon sarah laid a hand on johnnys shoulder very soon wills better he said giving sarah a hopeful smile hes got his arm in a sling andall but hes getting around just fine and dandy wont even let liza fuss no more before long jake wont let me fuss either hours later she dozed lulled by the afternoon sun she slept lightly her head nestled against the wing of the chair and her hands in her lap on top of her journal shed written everything she felt hoped despaired of on those pages someone called her name and she lifted a hand as if to brush the voice away she only wanted to sleep sarah now her eyes flew open and she bolted out of the chair jake was half sitting up in bed his brows drawn together in annoyance or confusion and his eyes she noted were focused alert and direct on hers what the hells going on he asked her then he watched astonished as she collapsed on the side of the bed and wept it was three weeks before he had the strength to do more than stand on his own feet he had time to think perhaps too much time but when he tried to do anything he found himself weak as a baby it infuriated him disgusted him when he swore at maggie twice in one morning she told sarah their patient was well on the road to recovery hes a tough one jake is maggie went on as they climbed the steps to his room together said he was damn sick and tired of having females poking him pouring things into him and trying to give him baths so much for gratitude sarah said with a laugh then she swayed and clutched the banister for support maggie grabbed her arm honey are you all right yes silly shrugging it off sarah waited for the dizziness to pass im just tired yet i think one look at maggies shrewd face had her giving up and sitting carefully on the riser how far along are you it surprised sarah that the direct question didnt make her blush instead she smiled about a month she knew the exact moment when she had conceived jakes child on the riverbank under the moon i had the obvious sign of course then for the last few days i havent been able to keep anything down in the morning i know pleased as a partridge maggie cackled honey i knew you were breeding three days ago when you turned green at the sight of anne codys flapjacks aint jake just going to fall on his face i havent told him sarah said quickly i dont want him to know until hes until weve she propped her chin in her hands not yet maggie thats for you to decide yes and you wont say any thing to anyone not a peep satisfied sarah rose and started up the stairs again the doctor said hed be up and around in a couple of days we havent been able to talk about anything important since hes been healing she knocked on the door to his room before pushing it open the bed was empty what maggie he was there an hour ago i dont know where but she was talking to air as sarah was flying down the stairs again sarah sarah his hand wrapped around a licorice whip johnny raced toward her i just saw jake riding out of town he sure looked a lot better which way she grabbed the surprised boy by the shoulders which way did he go that way he pointed i called after him but i guess he didnt hear me damned hardheaded man maggie muttered from the doorway so he thinks he can just ride off sarah said between her teeth well jake redman is in for a surprise i need a horse maggie and a rifle hed thought it through hed had nothing but time to think over the last weeks shed be mad he figured he almost smiled mad enough to spit he imagined but shed get over it in time shed find someone who was right for her who was good for her talking to her wouldnt have helped hed never known a more stubborn woman so hed saddled up and ridden out of lone bluff the way hed ridden out of countless towns before only this time it hurt not just the pain from his stillhealing wound but an ache deeper sharper than anything that could be caused by a bullet hed get over it too he told himself hed just been fooling himself letting himself pretend that she could belong to him hed never forget how shed looked kneeling in the dirt with his gun in her hand his gun and there had been horror in her eyes hed taught her to kill and he wasnt sure he could live with that the way he figured it shed saved his life the best he could do for her was return the favor and get out of hers she was rich now jake remembered how excited lucius had been when hed come to visit talking on and on about the mine and how the gold was all but ready to fall into a mans hands she could go back east or she could stay and build that big house with the parlor shed told him about and he would he would go on drifting when he heard the rider coming instinct had him wheeling his horse around and reaching for his gun he swore rubbing his hand on his thigh as sarah closed the distance between them you bastard he acknowledged her with a nod there was only one way to handle her now one way to make certain she turned around and left before just looking at her made him want to crawl didnt know you could ride duchess you come out all this way to tell me goodbye i have more than that to say her hands balled on the reins while she fought with her temper not a word jake to me to anyone just saddle up and ride out thats right when its time to move on you move so youre telling me you have no reason to stay thats right he knew the truth sometimes hurt but he hadnt known a lie could youre a mighty pretty woman duchess youll be hard to top he saw the hurt glow in her eyes before her chin came up thats a compliment well youre quite right jake ill be very hard to top youll never love another woman the way you love me or want one she said more quietly or need one go on back sarah he started to turn his horse but stopped short when she drew the rifle out of its holster and aimed it hearthigh you want to point that someplace else for an answer she lowered it a few strategic inches smiling when his brow lifted ever hear the one about hells fury jake i get the idea he shifted slightly duchess if its all the same to you id rather you pointed it back at my chest get off your horse damn it sarah i said off she cocked the lever in two sharp movements now he leaned forward in the saddle how do i know thats even loaded how do you know its loaded she smiled brought it up to her eye and fired his hat flew off his head are you crazy stunned he dragged a hand through his hair he could almost feel the heat you damn near killed me i hit what i aim at isnt that what you said i should learn to do she cocked the rifle again now get off that horse before i shoot something more vital off you swearing he slid down what the hell are you trying to prove with all this just hold it right there she dropped to the ground giddiness washed over her and she had to lean one hand against her mount sarah i said hold it right there she shook her head to clear it are you sick no steady again she smiled ive never felt better in my life just crazy then he relaxed a little but her pallor worried him well if youve a mind to kill me after spending the better part of a month keeping me alive go ahead youre damn right i kept you alive and i didnt do it so you could leave me the minute you could stand up i did it because i love you because youre everything i want and everything i intend to have now you tell me you stand there and tell me why you left i already told you it was time youre a bar worse youre a coward her words had the effect shed hoped for the cool almost bored look in his eyes sizzled into heat dont push me sarah i havent begun to push you ill start by telling you why you got on that horse and rode away you left because you were afraid of me no not even of me of yourself and what you feel for me her chin was up a challenge in her eyes as she dared him to say it was untrue you loved me enough to stand unarmed in front of a madman but not enough to face your own heart you dont know what i feel dont i if you believe that youre a fool as well as a liar the fresh flash of fury in his eyes delighted her dont you think i knew every time you touched me every time you kissed me he was silent and she drew a long breath well you can get on that horse and you can ride you can run into the hills to the next town you can keep running until youre hundreds of miles away maybe youll be fast enough just fast enough to get away from me but before you do youre going to tell me tell you what i want you to tell me you love me he studied her her eyes glowed with determination and her cheeks were flushed with anger her hair caught by the wind was blowing back he should have known then and there that hed never had anywhere to run a manll say most anything when a womans pointing a rifle at his belly then say it he bent to pick up his hat slapping it against his thighs twice to loosen the dust idly he poked his finger through the hole in the crown i love you sarah he settled the hat on his head now do you want to put that thing away the temper went out of her eyes and with it the glint of hope without a word she turned to secure the rifle in the holder well i had to threaten it out of you but at least i heard you say it once go ahead and ride off i wont stop you no ones holding a gun on you now she wouldnt cry no she swore to herself she wouldnt hold him with tears fighting them back she tried to struggle back into the saddle he touched her arm lightly not holding when he wanted more than anything hed ever wanted in his life to hold her i love you sarah he said again more than i should a hell of a lot more than i can stand she closed her eyes praying that what she did now would be right for both of them slowly she turned toward him but she kept her hands at her sides if you ride away now ill come after you no matter where you go ill be there ill make your life hell i swear it he couldnt stop the smile any more than he could stop his hand from reaching up to touch her face and if i dont ride away ill only make your life hell some of the time i guess thats a better bargain he lowered his head to kiss her gently then with a groan he crushed her hard against him i dont think idve gotten very far even if you hadnt shot at me no use taking chances lucky for you i was trying to shoot over your head he only sighed and drew her away you owe me a hat duchess still amazed he drew it off to poke at the hole i guess id have to marry any woman who could handle a gun like that is that a proposal he shrugged and stuck his hat back on his head sounded like it she lifted a brow and its the best you can do i havent got any fivedollar words disgusted he started back to his horse then he stopped and turned back she was waiting her arms folded a half smile on her face so he swore at her theres a preacher comes into town once every few weeks he can marry us proper enough with whatever kind of fuss you figure would satisfy you ill build you a house between the mine and the town with a parlor if thats what you want and a wood floor and a real bedroom to her it was the most eloquent of proposals she held out her hands well need two two what two bedrooms she said when his hands closed over hers again listen duchess ive heard theyve got some odd ways of doing things back east but im damned if my wife is going to sleep in another room oh no her smile lit up her face im going to sleep in the same room the same bed as you every night for the rest of my life but well need two bedrooms at least we will by spring i dont see why then he did so abruptly so stunningly that he could only stare at her if she had taken the rifle back out and driven it butt first into his gut he would have been less shaken his fingers went slack on hers then dropped away are you sure yes she held her breath theres going to be a child our child he wasnt sure he could move and was less sure he could speak slowly carefully he framed her face with his hands and kissed her then when emotions swamped him he simply rested his forehead against hers two bedrooms he murmured to start content she wrapped her arms around his waist yes to start
