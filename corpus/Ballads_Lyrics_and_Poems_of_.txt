that in my heart has taken root sad are the buds and blooms thereof and bitter sorrow is its fruit yet since it was a tender shoot so greatly hath its shadow spread that underneath all joy is dead and all my pleasant days are flown nor can i slay it nor instead plant any tree save this alone ah yet for long and long enough my tears were rain about its root and though the fruit be harsh thereof i scarcely looked for better fruit than this that carefully i put in garner for the bitter bread whereon my weary life is fed ah better were the soil unsown that bears such growths but love instead will plant no tree but this alone ah would that this new spring whereof the leaves and flowers flush into shoot i might have succour and aid of love to prune these branches at the root that long have borne such bitter fruit and graft a new bough comforted with happy blossoms white and red so pleasure should for pain atone nor love slay this tree nor instead plant any tree but this alone lenvoy princess

of his grace the rain out of heaven has washed us clean the sun has scorched us black and bare ravens and rooks have pecked at our eyne and feathered their nests with our beards and hair round are we tossed and here and there this way and that at the wild winds will never a moment my body is still birds they are busy about my face live not as we nor fare as we fare pray god pardon us out of his

hands prisoning would rather that it still abide in your ungentle comforting than change its faith and seek to her that is more kind but not so fair deadly kisses ronsard all take these lips away no more no more such kisses give to me my spirit faints for joy i see through mists of death the dreamy shore and meadows by the waterside where all about the hollow land fare the sweet singers that have

shade while you beside the fire a grandame grey my love your pride remember and regret ah love me love we may be happy yet and gather roses while tis called today on his ladys waking ronsard my lady woke upon a morning fair what time apollos chariot takes the skies and fain to fill with arrows from her eyes his empty quiver love was standing there i saw two apples that her breast doth bear none such the close of the hesperides yields nor hath venus any such as these nor she that had of nursling mars the care even such a bosom and so fair it was pure as the perfect work of phidias that sad andromedas discomfiture left bare when perseus passed her on a day and pale as death for fear of death she lay with breast as marble cold as marble pure his ladys death ronsard twain that were foes while mary lived are fled one laurelcrowned abides in heaven and one beneath the earth has fared a fallen sun a light of love among the loveless dead the first is chastity that vanquished the archer love that held joint empery with the sweet beauty that made war on me when laughter of lips with laughing eyes was wed their strife the fates have closed with stern control the earth holds her fair body and her soul an angel with glad angels triumpheth love has no more that he can do desire is buried and my heart a faded fire and for deaths sake i am in love with death ladys tomb ronsard as in the gardens all through may the rose lovely and young and fair apparelled makes sunrise jealous of her rosy red when dawn upon the dew of dawning glows graces and loves within her breast repose the woods are faint with the sweet odour shed till rains and heavy suns have smitten dead the languid flower and the loose leaves unclose so this the perfect beauty of our days when earth and heaven were vocal of her praise the fates have slain and her sweet soul reposes and tears i bring and sighs and on her tomb pour milk and scatter buds of many a bloom that dead as living she may be with roses shadows of his lady jacques tahureau within the sand of what far river lies the gold that gleams in tresses of my love what highest circle of the heavens above is jewelled with such stars as are her eyes and where is the rich sea whose coral vies with her red lips that cannot kiss enough what dawnlit garden knew the rose whereof the fled soul lives in her cheeks rosy guise what parian marble that is loveliest can match the whiteness of her brow and breast when drew she breath from the sabaean glade oh happy rock and river sky and sea gardens and glades sabaean all that be the faroff splendid semblance of my maid moonlight jacques tahureau the high midnight was garlanding her head with many a shining star in shining skies and of her grace a slumber on mine eyes and after sorrow quietness was shed far in dim fields cicalas jargoned a thin shrill clamour of complaints and cries and all the woods were pallid in strange wise with pallor of the sad moon overspread then came my lady to that lonely place and from her palfrey stooping did embrace and hang upon my neck and kissed me over wherefore the day is far less dear than night and sweeter is the shadow than the light since night has made me such a happy lover love in may passerat off with sleep love up from bed this fair morn see for our eyes the rosy red new dawn is born now that skies are glad and gay in this gracious month of

honey sweet and all the spirits fleet do suffer a skychange more strangely than the dew to gods own angels new the grave said to the rose the genesis of butterflies victor hugo the dawn is smiling on the dew that covers the tearful roses lo the little lovers that kiss the buds and all the flutterings in jasmine bloom and privet of white wings that go and come and fly and peep and hide with muffled music murmured far and wide ah spring time when we think of all the lays that dreamy lovers send to dreamy mays of the fond hearts within a billet bound of all the soft silk paper that pens wound the messages of love that mortals write filled with intoxication of delight written in april and before the may time shredded and flown play things for the winds playtime we dream that all white butterflies above who seek through clouds or waters souls to love and leave their lady mistress in despair to flit to flowers as kinder and more fair are but torn loveletters that through the skies flutter and float and change to butterflies more strong than time victor hugo since i have set my lips to your full cup my sweet since i my pallid face between your hands have laid since i have known your soul and all the bloom of it and all the perfume rare now buried in the shade since it was given to me to hear one happy while the words wherein your heart spoke all its mysteries since i have seen you weep and since i have seen you smile your lips upon my lips and your eyes upon my eyes since i have known above my forehead glance and gleam a ray a single ray of your star veiled always since i have felt the fall upon my lifetimes stream of one rose petal plucked from the roses of your days i now am bold to say to the swift changing hours pass pass upon your way for i grow never old fleet to the dark abysm with all your fading flowers one rose that none may pluck within my heart i hold your flying wings may smite but they can never spill the cup fulfilled of love from which my

and sea winds moan and golden fruits make sweet the golden air in gardens where the apple blossoms were in these old springs before i walked alone i pass among the pathways overgrown of all the former flowers that kissed your feet remains a poppy pallid from the heat a wild poppy that the wild winds have sown alas the rose forgets your hands of rose the lilies slumber in the lily bed tis only poppies in the dreamy close the changeless windless garden of the dead you tend with buds soft as your kiss that lies in over happy dreams upon mine eyes metempsychosis i shall not see thee nay but i shall know perchance thy grey eyes in anothers eyes shall guess thy curls in gracious locks that flow on purest brows yea and the swift surmise shall follow and track and find thee in disguise of all sad things and fair where sunsets glow when through the scent of heather faint and low the weak wind whispers to the day that dies from all sweet art and out of all old rhyme thine eyes and lips are light and song to me the shadows of the beauty of all time carven and sung are only shapes of thee alas the shadowy shapes ah sweet my dear shall life or death bring all thy being near lost in hades i dreamed that somewhere in the shadowy place grief of farewell unspoken was forgot in welcome and regret remembered not and hopeless prayer accomplished turned to praise on lips that had been songless many days hope had no more to hope for and desire and dread were overpast in white attire new born we walked among the new worlds ways then from the press of shades a spirit threw towards me such apples as these gardens bear and turning i was ware of her and knew and followed her fleet voice and flying hair followed and found her not and seeking you i found you never dearest anywhere a star in the night the perfect piteous beauty of thy face is like a star the dawning drives away mine eyes may never see in the bright day thy pallid halo thy supernal grace but in the night from forth the silent place thou comest dim in dreams as doth a stray star of the starry flock that in the grey is seen and lost and seen a moments space and as the earth at night turns to a star loved long ago and dearer than the sun so in the spiritual place afar at night our souls are mingled and made one and wait till one night fall and one dawn rise that brings no noon too splendid for your eyes a sunset on yarrow the wind and the day had lived together they died together and far away spoke farewell in the sultry weather out of the sunset over the heather the dying wind and the dying day far in the south the summer levin flushed a flame in the grey soft air we seemed to look on the hills of heaven you saw within but to me twas given to see your face as an angels there never again ah surely never shall we wait and watch where of old we stood the low goodnight of the hill and the river the faint light fade and the wan stars quiver twain grown one in the solitude hesperothen by the example of certain grecian mariners who being safely returned from the war about troy leave yet again their old lands and gods seeking they know not what and choosing neither to abide in the fair phaeacian island nor to dwell and die with the sirens at length end miserably in a desert country by the sea is set forth the vanity of melancholy and by the land of phaeacia is to be understood the place of art and of fair pleasures and by circes isle the places of bodily delights whereof men falling aweary attain to eld and to the darkness of that age which thing master francoys rabelais feigned under the similitude of the isle of the macraeones the seekers for phaeacia there is a land in the remotest day where the soft night is born and sunset dies the eastern shores see faint tides fade away that wash the lands where laughter tears and sighs make life the lands beneath the blue of common skies but in the west is a mysterious sea what sails have seen it or what shipmen known with coasts enchanted where the sirens be with islands where a goddess walks alone and in the cedar trees the magic winds make moan eastward the human cares of house and home cities and ships and unknown gods and loves westward strange maidens fairer than the foam and lawless lives of men and haunted groves wherein a god may dwell and where the dryad roves the gods are careless of the days and death of toilsome men beyond the western seas the gods are heedless of their painful breath and love them not for they are not as these but in the golden west they live and lie at ease yet the phaeacians well they love who live at the lights limit passing careless hours most like the gods and they have gifts to give even wine and fountains musical and flowers and song and if they will swift ships and magic powers it is a quiet midland in the cool of twilight comes the god though no man prayed to watch the maids and young men beautiful dance and they see him and are not afraid for they are near of kin to gods and undismayed ah would the bright red prows might bring us nigh the dreamy isles that the immortals keep but with a mist they hide them wondrously and far the path and dim to where they sleep the loved the shadowy lands along the shadowy deep a song of phaeacia the languid sunset mother of roses lingers a light on the magic seas the wide fire flames as a flower uncloses heavy with odour and loose to the breeze the red rose clouds without law or leader gather and float in the airy plain the nightingale sings to the dewy cedar the cedar scatters his scent to the main the strange flowers perfume turns to singing heard afar over moonlit seas the sirens song grown faint in winging falls in scent on the cedar trees as waifs blown out of the sunset flying purple and rosy and grey the birds brighten the air with their wings their crying wakens a moment the weary herds butterflies flit from the fairy garden living blossoms of flying flowers never the nights with winter harden nor moons wax keen in this land of ours great fruits fragrant green and golden gleam in the green and droop and fall blossom and bud and flower unfolden swing and cling to the garden wall deep in the woods as twilight darkens glades are red with the scented fire far in the dells the white maid hearkens song and sigh of the hearts desire ah and as moonlight fades in morning maidens song in the matin grey faints as the first birds note a warning wakes and wails to the newborn day the waking song and the dying measure meet and the waxing and waning light meet and faint with the hours of pleasure the rose of the sea and the sky is white the departure from phaeacia the phaeacians why from the dreamy meadows more fair than any dream why will you seek the shadows beyond the ocean stream through straits of storm and peril through firths unsailed before why make you for the sterile the dark kimmerian shore there no bright streams are flowing there day and night are one no harvest time no sowing no sight of any sun no sound of song or tabor no dance shall greet you there no noise of mortal labour breaks on the blind chill air are ours not happy places where gods with mortals trod saw not our sires the faces of many a present god the seekers nay now no god comes hither in shape that men may see they fare we know not whither we know not what they be yea though the sunset lingers far in your fairy glades though yours the sweetest singers though yours the kindest maids yet here be the true shadows here in the doubtful light amid the dreamy meadows no shadow haunts the night we seek a city splendid with light beyond the sun or lands where dreams are ended and works and days are done a ballad of departure fair white bird what song art thou singing in wintry weather of lands oer sea dear white bird what way art thou winging where no grass grows and no green tree i looked at the far off fields and grey there grew no tree but the cypress tree that bears sad fruits with the flowers of may and whoso looks on it woe is he and whoso eats of the fruit thereof has no more sorrow and no more love and who sets the same in his garden stead in a little space he is waste and dead they hear the sirens for the second time the weary sails a moment slept the oars were silent for a space as past hesperian shores we swept that were as a remembered face seen after lapse of hopeless years in hades when the shadows meet dim through the mist of many tears and strange and though a shadow sweet so seemed the halfremembered shore that slumbered mirrored in the blue with havens where we touched of yore and ports that over well we knew then broke the calm before a breeze that sought the secret of the west and listless all we swept the seas towards the islands of the blest beside a golden sanded bay we saw the sirens very fair the flowery hill whereon they lay the flowers set upon their hair their old sweet song came down the wind remembered music waxing strong ah now no need of cords to bind no need had we of orphic song it once had seemed a little thing to lay our lives down at their feet that dying we might hear them sing and dying see their faces sweet but now we glanced and passing by no care had we to tarry long faint hope and rest and memory were more than any sirens song circes isle revisited ah circe circe in the wood we cried ah circe circe but no voice replied no voice from bowers oergrown and ruinous as fallen rocks upon the mountain side there was no sound of singing in the air failed or fled the maidens that were fair no more for sorrow or joy were seen of us no light of laughing eyes or floating hair the perfume and the music and the flame had passed away the memory of shame alone abode and stings of faint desire and pulses of vague quiet went and came ah circe in thy sad changed fairy place our dead youth came and looked on us a space with drooping wings and eyes of faded fire and wasted hair about a weary face why had we ever sought the magic isle that seemed so happy in the days erewhile why did we ever leave it where we met a world of happy wonders in one smile back to the westward and the waning light we turned we fled the solitude of night was better than the infinite regret in fallen places of our dead delight the limit of lands between the circling ocean sea and the poplars of persephone there lies a strip of barren sand flecked with the seas last spray and strown with waste leaves of the poplars blown from gardens of the shadow land with altars of old sacrifice the shore is set in mournful wise the mists upon the ocean brood between the water and the air the clouds are born that float and fare between the water and the wood upon the grey sea never sail of mortals passed within our hail where the last weak waves faint and flow we heard within the poplar pale the murmur of a doubtful wail of voices loved so long ago we scarce had care to die or live we had no honey cake to give no wine of sacrifice to shed there lies no new path over sea and now we know how faint they be the feasts and voices of the dead ah flowers and dance ah sun and snow glad life sad life we did forego to dream of quietness and rest ah would the fleet sweet roses here poured light and perfume through the drear pale year and wan land of the west sad youth that let the spring go by because the spring is swift to fly sad youth that feared to mourn or love behold how sadder far is this to know that rest is nowise bliss and darkness is the end thereof verses on pictures colinette for a sketch by mr g leslie ara france your country as we

out between thee and me the wind is up and the weather broken blue seas blue eyes are grieved and grey listen the word that the wind has spoken listen the sound of the sea a token that summers over and troths are broken that loves depart as the hours decay a love has passed to the loves passed over a month has fled to the months gone by and none may follow and none recover july and june and

boughs of the apple tree a step i know is at the gate ah love but it is long to wait until nights noon bring thee between larks song and nightingales a silent space while dawning pales the birds leave still and free for words and kisses musical for silence and for sighs that fall in the dawn twixt him and me love and wisdom when last we gathered roses in the garden i found my wits but truly you lost yours the broken heart july and june brought flowers and love to you but i would none thereof whose heart kept all through summer time a flower of frost and winter rime yours was true wisdom was it not even love but i had clean forgot till seasons of the falling leaf all loves but one that turned to grief at length at touch of autumn tide when roses fell and summer died all in a dawning deep with dew love flew to me love fled from you the roses drooped their weary heads i spoke among the garden beds you would not hear you could not know summer and love seemed long ago as far as faint as dim a dream as to the dead this world may seem ah sweet in winters miseries perchance you may remember this how wisdom was not justified in summer time or autumntide though for this once below the sun wisdom and love were made at one but love was bitterbought enough and wisdom light of wing as love goodbye kiss me and say goodbye goodbye there is no word to say but this nor any lips left for my lips to kiss nor any tears to shed when these tears dry kiss me and say goodbye farewell be glad forget there is no need to say forget i know for youth is youth and time will have it so and though your lips are pale and your eyes wet farewell you must forget you shall bring home your sheaves many and heavy and with blossoms twined of memories that go not out of mind let this one sheaf be twined with poppy leaves when you bring home your sheaves in garnered loves of thine the ripe good fruit of many hearts and years somewhere let this lie grey and salt with tears it grew too near the sea wind and the brine of life this love of mine this sheaf was spoiled in spring and overlong was green and early sere and never gathered gold in the late year from autumn suns and moons of harvesting but failed in frosts of spring yet was it thine my sweet this love though weak as young corn withered whereof no man may gather and make bread thine though it never knew the summer heat forget not quite my sweet an old prayer greek text which cannot be reproduced odyssey xiii my prayer an old prayer borroweth of ancient love and memory do thou farewell till eld and death that come to all men come to thee gently as winters early breath scarce felt what time the swallows flee to lands whereof no man knoweth of summer over land and sea so with thy soul may summer be even as the ancient singer saith do thou farewell till eld and death that come to all men come to thee loves miracle with other helpless folk about the gate the gate called beautiful with weary eyes that take no pleasure in the summer skies nor all things that are fairest does she wait so bleak a time so sad a changeless fate makes her with dull experience early wise and in the dawning and the sunset sighs that all hath been and shall be desolate ah if love come not soon and bid her live and know herself the fairest of fair things ah if he have no healing gift to give warm from his breast and holy from his wings or if at least loves shadow in passing by touch not and heal her surely she must die dreams he spake not truth however wise who said that happy and that hapless men in sleep have equal fortune fallen from care as deep as countless careless races of the dead not so for alien paths of dreams we tread and one beholds the faces that he sighs in vain to bring before his daylit eyes and waking he remembers on his bed and one with fainting heart and feeble hand fights a dim battle in a doubtful land where strength and courage were of no avail and one is borne on fairy breezes far to the bright harbours of a golden star down fragrant fleeting waters rosy pale fairy land in light of sunrise and sunsetting the long days lingered in forgetting that ever passion keen to hold what may not tarry was of old in lands beyond the weary wold beyond the bitter stream whose flood runs red waisthigh with slain mens blood was beauty once a thing that died was pleasure never satisfied was rest still broken by the vain desire of action bringing pain to die in languid rest again all this was quite forgotten there where never winter chilled the year nor spring brought promise unfulfilled nor with the eager summer killed the languid days drooped autumnwards so magical a season guards the constant prime of a cool june so slumbrous is the rivers tune that knows no thunder of heavy rains nor ever in the summer wanes like waters of the summer time in lands far from the fairy clime yea there the fairy maids are kind with nothing of the changeful mind of maidens in the days that were and if no laughter fills the air with sound of silver murmurings and if no prayer of passion brings a love nigh dead to life again yet sighs more subtly sweet remain and smiles that never satiate and loves that fear scarce any fate alas no words can bring the bloom of fairy land the faint perfume the sweet low light the magic air to eyes of who has not been there alas no words nor any spell can lull the eyes that know too well the lost fair world of fairy land ah would that i had never been the lover of the fairy queen or would that through the sleepy town the grey old place of ercildoune and all along the little street the soft fall of the white deers feet came with the mystical command that i must back to fairy land two sonnets of the sirens les sirenes estoient tant intimes amies et fidelles compagnes de proserpine quelles estoient toujours ensemble esmues du juste deuil de la perte de leur chere compagne et enuyees jusques au desespoir elles sarresterent a la mer sicilienne ou par leurs chants elles attiroient les navigans mais lunique fin de la volupe de leur musique est la mort pontus de tyard i the sirens once were maidens innocent that through the watermeads with proserpine plucked no firehearted flowers but were content cool fritillaries and flagflowers to twine with lilies woven and with wet woodbine till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers and their bright mistress fled from summer hours with hades down the irremeable decline and they have sought her all the wide world through till many years and wisdom and much wrong have filled and changed their song and oer the blue rings deadly sweet the magic of the song and whoso hears must listen till he die far on the flowery shores of sicily ii so is it with this singing art of ours that once with maids went maidenlike and played with woven dances in the poplarshade and all her song was but of ladys bowers and the returning swallows and springflowers till forth to seek a shadowqueen she strayed a shadowy land and now hath overweighed her singing chaplet with the snow and showers yea fair wellwater for the bitter brine she left and by the margin of lifes sea sings and her song is full of the seas moan and wild with dread and love of proserpine and whoso once has listened to her he his whole life long is slave to her alone a la belle helene after ronsard more closely than the clinging vine about the wedded tree clasp thou thine arms ah mistress mine about the heart of me or seem to sleep and stoop your face soft on my sleeping eyes breathe in your life your heart your grace through me in kissing wise bow down bow down your face i pray to me that swoon to death breathe back the life you kissed away breathe back your kissing breath so by your eyes i swear and say my mighty oath and sure from your kind arms no maiden may my loving heart allure ill bear your yoke thats light enough and to the elysian plain when we are dead of love my love one boat shall bear us twain theyll flock around you fleet and fair all true loves that have been and you of all the shadows there shall be the shadow queen ah shadowloves and shadowlips ah while tis called today love me my love for summer slips and august ebbs away sylvie et aurelie in memory of gerard de nerval two loves there were and one was born between the sunset and the rain her singing voice went through the corn her dance was woven neath the thorn on grass the fallen blossoms stain and suns may set and moons may wane but this love comes no more again there were two loves and one made white thy singing lips and golden hair born of the citys mire and light the shame and splendour of the night she trapped and fled thee unaware not through the lamplight and the rain shalt thou behold this love again go forth and seek by wood and hill thine ancient love of dawn and dew there comes no voice from mere or rill her dance is over fallen still the ballad burdens that she knew and thou must wait for her in vain till years bring back thy youth again that other love afield afar fled the light love with lighter feet nay though thou seek where gravesteads are and flit in dreams from star to star that dead love shalt thou never meet till through bleak dawn and blowing rain thy fled soul find her soul again a lost path plotinus the greek philosopher had a certain proper mode of ecstasy whereby as porphyry saith his soul becoming free from his deathly flesh was made one with the spirit that is in the world alas the path is lost we cannot leave our bright our clouded life and pass away as through strewn clouds that stain the quiet eve to heights remoter of the purer day the soul may not returning whence she came bathe herself deep in being and forget the joys that fever and the cares that fret made once more one with the eternal flame that breathes in all things ever more the same she would be young again thus drinking deep of her old life and this has been men say but this we know not who have only sleep to soothe us sleep more terrible than day where dead delights and fair lost faces stray to make us weary at our wakening and of that longlost path to the divine we dream as some greek shepherd erst might sing half credulous of easy proserpine and of the lands that lie beneath the days decline the shade of helen some say that helen went never to troy but abode in egypt for the gods having made in her semblance a woman out of clouds and shadows sent the same to be wife to paris for this shadow then the greeks and trojans slew each other why from the quiet hollows of the hills and extreme meeting place of light and shade wherein soft rains fell slowly and became clouds among sister clouds where fair spent beams and dying glories of the sun would dwell why have they whom i know not nor may know strange hands unseen and ruthless fashioned me and borne me from the silent shadowy hills hither to noise and glow of alien life to harsh and clamorous swords and sound of war one speaks unto me words that would be sweet made harsh made keen with love that knows me not and some strange force within me or around makes answer kiss for kiss and sigh for sigh and somewhere there is fever in the halls that troubles me for no such trouble came to vex the cool far hollows of the hills the foolish folk crowd round me and they cry that house and wife and lands and all troy town are little to lose if they may keep me here and see me flit a pale and silent shade among the streets bereft and helpless shrines at other hours another life seems mine where one great river runs unswollen of rain by pyramids of unremembered kings and homes of men obedient to the dead there dark and quiet faces come and go around me then again the shriek of arms and all the turmoil of the ilian men what are they even shadows such as i what make they even this the sport of gods the sport of gods however free they seem ah would the game were ended and the light the blinding light and all too mighty suns withdrawn and i once more with sister shades unloved forgotten mingled with the mist dwelt in the hollows of the shadowy hills ah would t were the clouds playtime when the sun clothes us in raiment of a rosy flame and through the sky we flit and gather grey like men that leave their golden youth behind and through their winddriven ways they gather grey and we like them grow wan and the chill east receives us as the earth accepts all men but we await the dawn of a new day sonnets to poets jacques tahureau ah thou that undeceived and unregretting sawst death so near thee on the flowery way and with no sigh that life was near the setting tookst the delight and dalliance of the day happy thou wert to live and pass away ere life or love had done thee any wrong ere thy wreath faded or thy locks grew grey or summer came to lull thine april song sweet as all shapes of sweet things unfulfilled buds bloomless and the broken violet the first spring days the sounds and scents thereof so clear thy fire of song

bequeath hast sung sweet answer to the songs that breathe through ages and through ages far away yea and in thee the pulse of ancient passion leaped and the nymphs amid the springwater made bare their
