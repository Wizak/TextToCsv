 to my father city of mirrors we fell easttowest dipping toward the moon in the usual shallow graceful arc our pilot had turned off the cabin lights to give us a view the sun set as we fell i peered past tom reinecke and let my eyes adjust it was black below there wasnt even earthlight the new earth was a slender sliver in the eastern sky the black shadows of mountains emerged from the western horizon and came toward us reinecke had fallen silent that was a new development tom reinecke had been trying to interview me even before we left outback field australia thus what was it like out there among the flying mountains had i really killed an organlegger by using psychic powers as a man of many cultureskansas farm boy seven years mining the asteroids five years in the united nations policedidnt i consider myself the ideal delegate to a conference to review lunar law how did i feel about what liberals called the organ bank problem would i demonstrate my imaginary arm please et cetera id admitted to being a liberal and denied being the solar systems foremost expert on lunar law inasmuch as id never been on the moon beyond that id managed to get him talking about himself hed never stopped the flatlander reporter was a small rounded man in his early twenties brownhaired and smoothshaven born in australia schooled in england hed never been in space hed gone from journalism school straight into a job with the bbc hed told me about himself at length this young and he was on his way to the moon to witness deliberations that could affect all of future history he seemed eager and innocent i wondered how many older more experienced newstapers had turned down his assignment now suddenly he was quiet more he was leaving fingerprints in the hard plastic chair arms the black shadows of the dalembert mountains were coming right at us broken teeth in a godlings jaw ready to chew us up we passed low over the mountains almost between the peaks and continued to fall now the land was chewed by new and old meteorite craters light ahead of us became a long line of lighted windows the west face of hovestraydt city slowing we passed north of the city and curved around the city was a square border of light and peculiar reflections flashed from within the border mostly greens some reds yellows browns the ship hovered and settled east of the city at the edge of grimaldes rim wall no dust sprayed around us as we touched down too many ships had landed here over the last century the dust was all gone tom reinecke let go of his chair arms and resumed breathing he forced a smile thrill a minute hey you werent worried were you you cant even imagine the real problems with making this kind of landing what what do you mean i i laughed relax i was kidding people have been landing on the moon for a hundred and fifty years and theyve only had two accidents we fought politely for room to struggle into our pressure suits if garner had given me a little more warning i would have had a skintight pressure suit made at the taxpayers expense but skintight suits have to be carefully fitted and that takes time luke garner had given me just ten days to get ready id spent the time on research i was half certain that gamer had picked someone else for the job and that he or she had died or gotten sick or pregnant be that as it may i had bought an inflated suit on the expense account the other passengers reporters and conference delegates were also getting into inflated suits half dozen people lunies and belters waited to greet us when we climbed down from the airlock i could see fairly well into the bubble helmets taffy wasnt among them i recognised people id seen only on phone screens and a familiar voice cheerful cordial mildly accented welcome to hovestraydt city said the voice of mayor hove watson youve arrived near dinner time by the city clocks i hope to show you around a bit before you begin your work tomorrow i had no trouble picking him out of the crowd a lunie over eight feet tall with thinning blond hair and a cordial smile showing through his helmet and a flowering ash tree on his chest youve already been assigned rooms andbefore i forgetthe city computers command name is chiron it will be keyed to your voice shall we postpone introductions until we can get into shirtsleeves he turned to lead the way so taffy hadnt made it i wondered if shed left a message and how long it would be before i reached a phone we trooped toward the lights a few hundred yards away no moondust softened our footfalls my first look at the moon and i wasnt seeing much black night around us and a glare of light from the city but the sky was the sky i remembered the belters sky stars by the hundred thousand so hard and bright you could reach up and feel their heat i lagged behind to get the full effect it was like homecoming we were belters and flatlanders and lunies and there was no problem telling us apart all the flatlanders including me were wearing inflated suits in bright primary colors they hampered movement made us clumsy even i was having trouble id talked to the other united nations delegates just before the flight jabez stone was a cross between tall black watusi and longjawed white new englander hed been a prosecution lawyer before he went into politics he represented the general assembly octavia budrys of the security council had very white skin and very black hair she was overweight but with the muscle tension to carry it well you sensed their awareness of their own power on earth they had walked like rulers here their dignity suffered budrys bounced like a big rubber ball stone fought the lower gravity with a kind of shuffle they veered from side to side and into each other i heard their panting in my earphones the belters found their stride easily through the bubble helmets you saw belter crests on both men and women hair running in a strip from forehead to nape of neck the scalp shaved on both sides they wore silvered cloaks against the cold of lunar night under the cloaks were skintights membranous elastic cloth that would pass sweat and that fitted like a coat of paint paintings glowed across their chests and bellies a belters pressure suit is his real home and he will spend a fortune on a good torso painting the brawny redheaded woman wearing the gold of the belt police had to be marion shaeffer her torso showed an eagleclawed dragon stooping on a tiger a broadshouldered blackhaired man chris penzler wore a copy of a bonnie dalzell griffon the one in the new york metropolitan mostly gold and bronze with a cloudy earth clutched in one claw i had abandoned a belter suit when i returned to earth the chest painting showed a great brassbound door opening on a lush world with two suns i missed it the lunies wore skintights but they would never be taken for belters they stood seven and eight feet tall their suits were in bright monochrome colors to stand out against a bright and confusing lunar background their chest paintings were smaller and generally not as good and tended to feature one dominant color as mayor watsons ash tree painting was mostly green the lunies hardly walked they flew in shallow arcs effortlessly and it was beautiful to watch one hundred and fiftyseven years after the first landing on the earths moon you could almost believe that mankind was dividing into different species we were three branches of humanity trooping toward the lights most of hovestraydt city was underground that square of light was only the top of it three sides of the square were living quarters i had seen light spilling through windows but the whole east face of the city was given over to the mirror works we passed telescope mirrors in the polishing stage with mobile screens to shield them silicate ore stood in impressively tall conical heaps spindly lunies in skintights and silver cloaks stopped work to watch us pass they didnt smile under a roof that had rock and moondust piled high atop it for meteor protection a wide stretch of the east face was open to vacuum here were big fragile paraboloids and lightweight telescope assemblies for belter ships widgetry for polishing and silvering mirrors and more widgetry for measuring their curvature garage space for widewheeled motorcycles and bubbletopped busses and special trucks to carry lenses and radar reflectors there were more lunies at work id expected to see amusement at the way we walked but they werent amused was that resentment i saw within the bubble helmets i could guess what was bothering them the conference tom reinecke veered away to peer through a glass wall i followed him lunie workmen were looking this way i was afraid hed get in trouble he was looking down through thick glass beyond and below an assembly line was birthing acresized sheets of silvered fabric rolling the fabric into tubes with the silvering on the inside sealing the ends and folding it into relatively tiny packets city of mirrors tom said reflectively you know it said a womans voice belt accent specifically confinement asteroid i found her at my shoulder within the bubble helmet she was young and pretty and very black watusi genes sunblackened further in the unfiltered sunlight of space she was almost as tall as a lunie but the style of her suit made her a beter i liked her torso painting against the pastel glow of the veil nebula a slender womans silhouette showed in uttermost black save for two glowing greenishwhite eyes city of mirrors there are hove city mirrors everywhere in space everywhere you look she told us not just telescopes you know what theyre doing down there those are solar reflectors theyre shipped out flat we inflate them then we spray foam plastic struts on them they dont have to be strong we cut them up and get cylindrical mirrors for solar power ive been a belt miner i said she looked at me curiously im desiree porter newstaper for the vesta beam tom reinecke bbc gil hamilton arm delegate and were being abandoned her teeth flashed like lightning in a black sky gil the arm i know about you she looked where i was pointing and added yah well talk later i want to interview you we jumped to join the last of the line as it cycled through the airlock we crowded into different elevators and rejoined on the sixth level the dining facility mayor watson again took the lead you couldnt get lost following mayor watson eight feet two inches tall topped with ash blond hair and a nose like the prow of a ship and a smile that showed a good many very white teeth by now we were talking away like old friends some of us anyway clay and budrys the other un delegates still had to keep all their attention on their feet and they still bounded too high and i got my first look at the garden but i didnt get a chance to study it till we were seated we were three delegates from the united nations three from the belt and four representing the moon itself plus porter and reinecke and mayor watson as our host the dining hall was crowded and the noise level was high mayor watson was out of earshot at the other end of the table hed tried to mix us up a little the reporters seemed to be interviewing each other and liking what they learned i found myself between chris penzler fourth speaker for the belt and a tycho dome official named bertha carmody she was intimidating seven feet three with a spreading crown of tightly curled white hair a strong jaw and a penetrating voice the garden ran vertically through hovestraydt city a great pit lined with ledges a bedspringshaped ramp ran up the center and narrower ramps fed into it at all levels including this one the plants that covered the ledges were crops but that didnt keep them from being pretty melons hung along one ledge a ledge of glossy green ground cover turned out to be raspberries and strawberries there were ledges of ripe corn and unripe wheat and tomatoes the orange and lemon trees lower down were blooming chris penzler caught me gaping tomorrow he said youre seeing it by sunlamps now by daylight ifs quite beautiful i was surprised didnt you just get here like the rest of us no ive been here a week and i was here at the first conference twenty years ago theyve dug the city deeper since the garden too penzler was a burly belter nearing fifty his immense sloping shoulders made his otherwise acceptable legs look spindly he must have spent much of his life in free fall his belter crest was still black but it had thinned on top to leave an isolated tuft on his forehead his brows formed a single furry black ridge across his eyes i said id think direct sunlight would kill plants when penzler started to answer bertha carmody rode him down direct sunlight would the convex mirrors on the roof thin the sunlight and spread it about we set more mirrors at the bottom of the pit and the sides to direct the sunlight everywhere every city on the moon uses essentially the same system she refrained from adding that i should have done my research before i came but i could almost hear her thinking it lunies were bringing us plates and food special service the other diners were all getting their own from a ledge buffet style i plied my chopsticks they had splayed ends and they worked better than a spoon and fork in low gravity dinner was mostly vegetables roughly chinese in approach and quite good when i found chicken meat i turned again to the garden there were birds flying between the ledges though most had settled for the night pigeons and chickens chickens fly very well in low gravity a darkhaired young man was talking to the mayor i admit to being abnormally curious but how could i help but stare the kid was the mayors height a couple of inches over eight feet and even thinner age hard to estimate say eighteen plusorminus three they looked like tolkien elves elvish king and elvish prince in wellmannered disagreement they were not enjoying their inaudible conversation and they cut it short as quickly as possible my eyes followed the kid back to his table a table for two across the width of the garden his companion was an extraordinarily beautiful woman a flatlander as he sat down the woman darted a look of pure poison in our direction for an instant our eyes locked it was naomi home she knew me our eyes held and we broke the lock and went back to eating it had been fourteen years since i last felt the urge to talk to naomi home and i didnt have it now we ended with melon and coffee most of us were heading for the elevator when chris penzler took my arm look down into the garden he said i did it was another nine stories to the bottom i counted a tree was growing down there its top was only two levels below us the ramp spiraled down around the trunk that redwood chris said was planted when hovestraydt city was first occupied it s much taller now than it was when i first came they transplant it whenever they dig the garden deeper we turned away i asked whats it going to be like this conference less hectic than the last one i hope twenty years ago we carved out the general body of law that now rules the moon he frowned i have my doubts some of the lunar citizenry think we are meddling in their internal affairs theyve got a point of course they do we face other opportunities for embarrassment too the holding tanks were expensive worse the lunar delegates are in a position to claim that they serve no useful purpose chris im a lastminute replacement i only had ten days to bone up ah well the first conference was twenty years ago it wasnt easy finding compromises between three ways of life you flatlanders saw no reason why lunar law shouldnt send all felons to the organ banks belt law is considerably more lenient the death penalty is so damned permanent suppose it turns out that you broke up the wrong person i know about the holding tanks i said they were our most important point of compromise six months isnt it the convict stays in suspended animation for six months before they break him up if the conviction is reversed hes revived thats right what you may not know chris said is that no convict has been revived in the past twenty years the moon had to pay half the cost of the holding tanks well we could have made them pay the whole bill and there were some bugs in the prototypes we know four convicts died and had to be broken up at once and half the organs were lost we crowded into the elevator with the rest we lowered our voices and all for nothing by lunie standards yes but how diligently were the rights of the convicts guarded well as i say the conference may be more hectic than one would hope we all got off on zero level i gathered that few lunies wanted to live on the surface these rooms were mostly for transients i left penzler at his door and walked two down to my own view through a window wherever you go in space shirtsleeve environments tend to be cramped my room was bigger than i expected there was a bed narrow but long and a table with four collapsed chairs and a tub there was a phone screen and i made for that taffy wasnt in but shed left a message she wore a paper surgical coverall and sounded a bit breathless gil i cant meet you youll get in about ten minutes after i go on duty i get off at the usual ungodly hour in this case city time can you meet me for breakfast ten past six in ohfiftythree in the north face on zero level theres room service isnt garner lovely the picture smiled enchantingly and froze chiron asked will there be an answer sir and beeped i was still feeling ruffled and mean i had to force the eager smile chiron message ten past six your room ill come to you by earthlight though hell should bar the way called off the phone and lost the smile lucas garner was in his hundredandseventies he had a face to scare babies he was confined to a wheelchair because half his spinal cord had died of old age he delegated a lot of authority but he led the united nations policestill called the amalgamated regional militia the armand he was my boss and for getting me this chance to see taffy again after two and a half months of separation yeah garner was lovely taffy and i had been roommates for three years when she got this chance to practice surgery on the moon exchange program it wasnt something she could turn down too useful to her career and too much fun theyd been rotating her among the lunar cities shed been in hovestraydt city almost two weeks now shed taken to dating a lunie gp mccavity by name i refuse to admit that that irritated me but the way her schedule had messed up our first meeting did so did the thought of the conference meeting tomorrow at nine thirty id heard angry voices at dinner clay and budrys hadnt mastered the art of walking yet and it would affect their tempers and my own feet kept getting tangled what i needed was a soak in a hot bath the bathtub was strange it was right out in the open next to the bed with a view of the phone screen and the picture window it wasnt long but it stood four feet high with a rim that curved inward and the back rose six feet before curving over the overflow drain was only halfway up i started water running then watched fascinated the water looked like it was actively flying to escape i tried some commands the door lock the closet lock the lights all responded to my voice and the chiron command the water closet lock was manual presently the bath was full to the overflow line i got in carefully and stretched out the water dipped in a meniscus around me reluctant to wet me until i added soap i played with the water jetting it up between my hands watching it slowly rise and slowly fall back i stopped when id got too much on the ceiling and it was dripping back in fat globules i was feeling a lot better i found tiny holes under me and tried calling chiron activate spa water and air bubbles churned around me battering muscles strained by low gravity walking the phone rang taffy i called chiron spa off answer phone the screen rotated to face me it was naomi in low gravity her long soft golden hair floated around her with every motion her cheekbones were high in an oval face she was made up in recent flatlander style so that her blue eyes were patterns on the wing of a great gaudy butterfly her mouth was small her face just a touch fuller than i remembered her body was still athletic tall and slender by flatlander standards her dress was soft blue and it clung to her as if by static electricity shed changed in fourteen years but not much not enough it was unrequited love and it had lasted half of a spring and all of summer until the day i invested my scanty fortune to loft myself from earth and outfit myself as an asteroid miner the scar on my heart had healed over of course it had but id known her across a crowded restaurant at that distance a stranger would barely have known her for a flatlander she smiled a bit nervously gil i saw you at dinner do you remember me naomi home hi hi naomi mitchison now what are you doing on the moon gil she sounded a bit breathless shed always talked like that eager to get the words out as if someone might interrupt conference to review lunar law i represent the arm how about you im sightseeing my life kind of came apart awhile back i remember now you were on the news youd caught some kind of organlegging kingpin anubis right pause can we meet for a drink id already made that decision sure well squeeze it in somewhere i dont know just how busy ill be see i actually came here following my exroommate shes a surgeon on loan to the hospital here between taffys weird hours and the conference itself youre likely to meet yourself in the halls yes i see but ill call you hey who was your date she laughed alan watson hes mayor hoves son i dont think the mayor approves of his dating a flatlander lunies are a bit prudish dont you think i havent had a chance to find out i cant seem to guess a lunies age hes nineteen she was teasing me a little they cant tell our ages either hes nice gil but hes very serious like you were uh huh okay ill leave a message if i get loose would you object to a foursome for dinner sounds good chiron phone off i scowled at the blank screen i had an erection under the water she still affected me that way she couldnt have seen it the camera angle was wrong chiron activate spa i said and the evidence disappeared in bubbles strange she thought it was funny that a man would want to take her to bed id told myself that fourteen years ago but i dont think i believed it id thought it was me and strange naomi was clearly relieved when i told her about taffy so why had she called not because she wanted a date i stood up in the tub a halfinch sheath of water came up with me i scraped most of it back into the tub with the edges of my hands then toweled myself off from the top down the picture window was jet black but for a small glowing triangle chiron lights off i said blind i took a chair and waited for my eyes to adjust gradually the view took form starlight glazed the battered lands to the west dawn was creeping down the highest peak a floating mountain seemed to flame among the stars i watched until i saw a second peak come alight then i set the alarm and went to bed phone call mr hamilton a neuter voice was saying phone call mr hamilton phone c chiron answer phone i had trouble sitting up there was a broad strap across my chest i unfastened it the phone screen showed tom reinecke and desiree porter bending low to put her face next to his it better be good i said its not good but its not dull tom said would an arm be interested in the attempted murder of a conference delegate i rubbed my eyes he would who chris penzler fourth speaker for the belt does nudity offend you desiree laughed tom said no it bothers lunies okay tell me about it i got up and started putting clothes on while they talked the screen and camera rotated to follow me were next to penzlers room desiree said at least tom is the walls are thin we heard a kind of godawful sloshthump and sort of a feeble scream we went and pounded on his door no answer i stayed while tom phoned the lunie cops i phoned them then marion sheaffer tom said shes a belter too the goldskin delegate okay she showed up then the cops and they talked the door open penzler was face up in his bathtub with a big hole in his chest he was still alive when they kicked us out my fault desiree said i took some pictures i had my clothes on and hair brushed ill be there chiron phone off penzlers door was closed desiree said theyve got my camera can you get it back for me ill try i pushed the bell and the pictures ill try marion shaeffer was in uniform she was my height muscular with broad shoulders and heavy breasts her ancestors would have been strong farm wives her deep tan ended sharply at the throat come in hamilton but stay out of the way its not really your territory nor yours hes one of my people chris penzlers room was much like mine it seemed crowded three of the six people present were lunies and that made a difference i got an impression of too many elbows flashing in my personal space one was a redheaded heavily freckled lunie policeman in orange marked with black he was working the phone the blond man in informal pajamas was just watching and he was mayor watson himself the third was a doctor and he was working on penzler theyd wheeled up a mobile autodoc a heavy dauntingly complex machine armed with scalpels surgical lasers clamps hypos suction tubes sensor fingers ending in tiny bristles all mounted on a huge adjustable stand that took up mom too the lunie was hard at work monitoring the keyboard and screen set into the doc sometimes typing rapidfire commands with his long fragilelooking fingers penzler was on his back on the bed the bed was wet with water and blood a pressure bottle was feeding blood into penzlers arm you cant use gravity feed on the moon we watched as the autodoc finished spraying foam over penzler until it covered him from his chin to his navel i swore under my breath but i couldnt really claim they should have waited for me here marion schaeffer elbowed me in the ribs and handed me three holograms the reporters took pictures good thing nobody else had a camera the first picture showed penzler on the bed his whole chest was an ugly deep red beginning to blister around the edges but burned worse than that in the center white and black showed where a charred hole had been burned deep into the bone of the sternum an inch wide and an inch deep the wound must have been sponged out before the picture was taken the second holo showed him face up in bloody bathwater the wounds were the same and he looked dead the third was a shot through the picture window taken over the rim of the tub i dont get this i said penzler turned his head a bare minimum and looked at me with suffering eyes laser shot me through the window most laser wounds dont spread like this the wound would be narrower and deeper wouldnt it doctor the doctor jerked his chin down and up without looking around but penzler made a strong effort to face me the doctor stopped him with a hand on his shoulder laser i saw stood up in the tub saw someone out there on the moon penzler stopped to pant a bit then red light blast bounced me back in the water laser chris did you see only one person yah he grunted mayor watson spoke for the first time how its night out there how could you see anything i saw him penzler said thickly three hundred four hundred meters past the big tilted rock i asked what was he lunie belter flatlander what was he wearing couldnt see it happened too fast i stood up i looked out then flash i thought for a second i couldnt tell let him rest now the doctor said nuts penzler should have seen that much not that it would prove anything a belter could wear a pressure suit a flatlander could get a skintight made though youd expect to find records a lunie well there exist short lunies shorter than for instance desiree porter who was a belter i stepped past the tub to reach the window the tub was still fill of pink water penzler would have bled to death or drowned if tom and desiree hadnt acted so quickly i looked out on the moon dawn had crawled down the peaks to touch their bases most of the lowlands were still puddles of black and the shadow of hovestraydt city seemed to stretch away forever out of the citys shadows a hundred and ninety yards away to left of center was a massive monolith that could be penzlers big tilted rock it was the shape of an elongated egg and smooth perhaps the surface had been polished by the blast that made grimalde crater its a wonder he saw anything at all i said why didnt the killer just keep to the shadows the sun wasnt up yet nobody answered penzler was unconscious now the doctor patted his shoulder and said three or four days the foam will start to peel off he can come to me then and ill remove it itll be longer than that before the bone heals though he turned to us it was close a few minutes later and he would have been dead the beam charred part of the sternum and cooked tissue underneath i had to replace parts of his esophagus the superior vena cava some mesentery scrape out the charred bone and fill it full of pins it was a mess on earth he wouldnt move for a week and then hed want a wheelchair i asked suppose the beam had been three inches lower heart cooked pleural cavity ruptured are you gil hamilton he stuck out a hand i believe we have a friend in common im harly mccavity i smiled and shook his hand my thoughts were only mildly malicious doctor mccavity wasnt with taffy either tonight mccavity had fluffy brown hair and a nose like an eagles beak he was short for a lunie but he still looked like hed grown up on a stretch rack only lunies look like that belters raise their children in great bubblestructures spun up to an earth gravity places like confinement and farmers asteroid mccavity was handsome in an elvish eery fashion in no way did he seem freakish weird he said do you know what saved his life he jerked a long thumb at the bathtub he stood up and a lot of water came up with him the laser beam plowed into the water live steam exploded all over his chest but it saved his life too the water spread the beam it didnt go deep enough to kill him right away the steam explosion threw him back in the tub so the killer didnt get a second chance i remembered how the water had sheathed me when i stood up in the tub butwould it spread that much mayor could the glass in the window cut some of the light the mayor shook his head he said red light the window wouldnt stop red light it filters raw sunlight but mainly in the blue and ultraviolet and xray range we ought to let him sleep mccavity said we followed him out the corridor was high because lunies are high and wide for a touch of luxury windows looked down into the garden the newstapers were waiting desiree porter confronted marion shaeffer id like my camera back please shaeffer handed over the bulky twohanded instrument and my holos she jerked a thumb at the freckled sevenfoothigh lunie cop captain jeffersons got em theyre evidence tom reinecke confronted harry mccavity doctor what is chris penzlers condition is it murder or attempted murder mccavity smiled attempted hell be all right he should rest tomorrow but i think hell be well enough to attend the conference afterward mayor are you through with me im tired captain jefferson said well need your evidence on the nature of the wound but not just now mccavity waved and departed leaping down the corridor like a frog both feet pushing at the floor at the same time mayor hove watson watched him go his face was puzzled thoughtful he came to himself with a start what about it gil what would the arm be doing if this were los angeles nothing murder isnt arm business unless it involves organlegging or esoteric technology ive investigated some murders though mainly wed by to track the weapon well do that chris said red light that probably means it was a message laser and theyre guarded the police use them for weapons as well as senders guarded how i noticed that both newstapers were listening quietly the locks are controlled by the same computer that operates your own apartment including the door lock its a different program of course okay what about opportunity there was a killer out on the moon he cant stay out forever mayor hove turned to the lunie cop we have no secrets jefferson yessir we were lucky jefferson told us first its city night and lunar night well predawn most of the population is in their apartments and we can account for some of the rest one flatlander tourist is out on the moon and nobody else as far as we can tell were checking the night shift at the mirror works if it were daylight wed have hundreds of suspects second the watchbird two satellite rose ten minutes ago ive had the projection room made ready for us very good mayor hove rubbed his eyes proceed with your investigations captain detectives hamilton and shaeffer may accompany you if they wish the reporters well use your own judgment he dropped his voice to tell me i thought if politic to let mr penzler see me concerned in his behalf but id be of no more use here and he jumped off down the corridor the rest of us followed jefferson to an elevator the projection room the projection room was a big box let into levels six and seven underground in the south side the police had a projection going when we arrived they were wading knee deep in miniature lunar landscape i think the newstapers were jolted i know i was jefferson beamed at us the watchbird two satellite is just over us now it sends us a picture and we project it in real time he waded out into the moon and we followed thigh deep and a hundred feet tall i could see my feet through the flat stone surface of grimalde crater if i concentrated dawn had fully arrived the sun glared on the eastern horizon not far below the crescent earth the craterpocked landscape west of us was all glaring ridges and black shadow hovestraydt city was a doll house tiny figures in bright orange skintights with police insignia were leaving an airlock in the south face on the road that led across the badlands to the belt trading post someone was walking toward them down the middle of the mad i bent close above the dollfigure looking for details an inflate suit sky blue shorter than the approaching iunie cops blond hair in the bubble helmet i heard a satisfied ah when i turned marion shaeffer added was pretty sure it would be a flatlander penzlers room be second from the end in the west face i picked it out then traced a line to a tilted rock like an elongated egg past that point it was mostly shadows i saw nobody anywhere in that whole stretch of moonscape save for a sky blue suit and four orange ones converging we seem to have only one suspect captain jefferson said even a puffer wouldnt take a killer out of range that fast shaeffer asked puffer basically two wheels and a motor and a saddle we use them a lot ah what about a spacecraft we checked of course the only spacecraft in the vicinity came nowhere near here i was thinking along different lines whats a message laser look like our little blue suspect doesnt seem to be carrying anything wed see it a message laser is about yay long jeffersons hands were a yard or meter apart and masses nine kilos well those shadows could hide anything mind if i feel around in there i might turn up the weapon tom and desiree grinned at each other shaeffer stared jefferson said what what did you say the newstapers laughed outright desiree said hes gil the arm havent you ever heard of gil the arm hes got an imaginary arm tom added with impressive restraint jefferson said oh combination of psychic powers i told him i lost my arm to a meteor asteroid mining eventually i came back to earth and got it replaced from the organ banks but before that happened i found out that ive got a couple of the recognised psi powers esper sense i can feel around inside a closed box and reach through a wall and feel out the wiring behind it psychokinesis i can move things with my mind if theyre not too heavy but its all limited by my imagination as if i had a ghost arm and hand i didnt bother to add that psychic powers are notoriously undependable what gave me confidence this time was that i was already trying it running my imaginary hand lightly over the smooth surface of the grimalde plain feeling its texturecooled magma cracked everywhere the cracks filled by moondustthen plunging my hand in and running the ghostly rock between my fingers like water hard rock here pools of moondust in the rough land beyond grimaldes rim wall here beneath the dust an oxygen tank split down the middle by internal pressure itd help if i knew what a message laser looks like i added captain jefferson used his belt phone to summon someone with a message laser while were waiting he said maybe youd like to feel around in here he patted at the southeast corner of the hologram city i reached into the wall i found a small room cramped lined with racks the only door felt thick massive it opened into the mirror works in vacuum i found varied equipment on the racks armored inflated suits personal jet packs a heavy twohanded cutting torch i described what i was finding my audience could be expected to include skeptics and i tried not to think about what was actually happening my own disembodied sense of touch reaching through rock walls to roam through a locked room seven floors above me if i stopped believing it couldnt happen the racks held a score of thing like bulky rifles i pinched one between my thumb and two fingers riflestock frame compact excitation barrel tingle of battery power and a scope just big enough to feel as a bump the message laser felt both light and heavy no mass at all yet impossible to move a cop came in carrying the real thing i held it in my hands and ran my imaginary hand over it then through it there was a dimmer switch and a cord that would plug into a pressure suits microphone you could talk with it i wouldnt have been surprised either way calling a deadly police weapon a message laser could have been no more than good public relations i waded west into the choppy cratered land our wouldbekiller must have fired from the newstapers and lunie cops were watching me intently god knows what they expected to see i swept my imaginary hand back and forth through the landscape like sifting intangible sand the killer might well have dumped his weapon into a dust pool he might equally well be hiding in one of those shadows i thought with a stock of air tanks and spare batteries i sifted them pools and lakes of shadow felt very cold and showed nothing though i could feel the shapes of the rocks once i felt something like a twelvefoot artillery shell smashed against a crater rim i asked jefferson about it he said it was probably from the rescue attempt after the blowout eighteen years ago it would have held water or air there was a high ridge a crater wall i felt around in the shadows behind it the killer couldnt have been placed further back than this the ridge would have blocked him and it was already further than chris penzlers three hundred four hundred meters i turned and went back over the same territory again by now i was feeling foolish no laser no hidden killer and the beginning of a headache the neon orange dolls had collected the blue doll and were going through the airlock i waded back to where the others waited i said i quit the others didnt hide their disappointment then desiree brightened and said youll have to testify wont you no weapon and no other suspect i guess i will lets go see who theyve got the desk sergeant was a lunie woman with rounded oriental features and big boobs forgive me later i got to know laura drury fairly well but i was seeing her for the first time and i admit i stared on her spare attenuated frame her attractive ample breasts became her dominant feature you dont picture a tolkien elf that way we stopped in the doorway not wanting to interfere sergeant drury asked is this your first visit to the moon ms mitchison and i went numb naomis eyes flicked to us and away it was the desk sergeant who concerned her she knew she was in trouble and it made her voice brittle no i was at the museum in mare tranquilitatis four years ago did you see much of the moon then the shock was getting through to me one suspect had been in position to fire through chris penzlers window i would have to testify that nobody was hiding out there in the shadows id eliminated everyone but naomi it was insane what could naomi have to do with chris penzler but i remembered a vindictive glare directed toward our dinner table last night for penzler her golden hair was still rumpled from the pressure suit helmet the rest of the suit was still on her the big gaudy blue butterfly still covered her eyelids she sat on the forward edge of a web chair i only stayed a week that time she said i was in the mood for a dead world but i was wrapped up in myself too my husband and my little girl had just died i guess i spent most of my time staring out the window of my room you left hovestraydt city alone this evening the desk sergeant said youve been out four and a half hours for a tourist that is reckless did you keep to known paths no i played tourist i wandered i spent some time on the big road but i ducked into the shadows and the craters every so often why not i couldnt get lost i could see earth did you take a signal laser no nobody told me to have i broken some fool regulation sergeant the lunie womans lips twitched in a manner of speaking you are accused of having stationed yourself several hundred meters west of the city of having located fourth speaker chris penzlers window and kept watch until he stood up in his bathtub at which time you fired a signal laser into his chest did you do that naomi was amazed then horrified or she was a fine actress no why would i she turned gil are you in on this only as an observer i halflied marion was looking at me with distrust clearly the suspect knew me the desk sergeant asked ms mitchison do you know chris penzler i used to hes a belter my husband and i met him on earth almost five years ago he was negotiating with the un about some kind of jurisdictional problem is he dead no he is badly injured and youre really accusing me of attempted murder with a message laser we are yes but i dont have any reason i dont have a message laser either why me her eyes flicked about the room a butterfly fluttering against a window gil i flinched im not in this its not my jurisdiction gil is attempted murder an organ bank crime on the moon sergeant drury answered for me why would we give a clumsy killer a second chance you can refuse to answer questions i said naomi shook her head thats all right but is that a news camera jefferson crooked his finger at tom and desiree the newstapers looked at each other and somehow agreed that resistance would be futile they followed jefferson out the desk sergeants eyes flicked to marion who might you be marion shaeffer captain belt police the man who was shot is a belt citizen drurys eyes questioned me and i answered gil hamilton operative arm here for the conference i know ms mitchison id like to stay have you any suggestions yes naomi one problem is that we cant find anyone else who could have been in the right place you were youve said you didnt shoot chris with what who cares if youre not our clumsy killer then youre our only witness did you see anything unusual out there she thought about it im handicapped gil i dont know the moon and it was night i didnt see anyone else did you drop anything or brush against anything or break anything is there some way we could tell just where you were you could examine my suit hostility was creeping into her voice oh well do that wed also like to examine your route youd have to lead us we cant make you do that gil can i get some sleep first i looked at the sergeant drury who said of course you may find it easier when the suns higher she sent naomi off with another cop weve got men out there she said briskly there wont be anyone tampering with evidence what do you know about her i havent seen naomi in ten years i wouldnt have said she was the killer type when you take her outside may i go along well alert you and you ms shaeffer thanks make that marion okay im laura drury make it laura we waited for the elevators marion said gil what do you consider the killer type yeah thats a hard one isnt it but naomi strikes me as more the murder victim type what do you mean she sounded like she was questioning a suspect i put it down to habit i said once upon a time i might have killed her myself naomi has a way of inviting a pass then slapping the passer down hard i really think she gels a charge out of leaving a man horny and frustrated this isnt just subjective marion ive heard other guys talk about it still it was ten years ago and she got married somewhere in there and had a little girl so your guess is as good as mine the elevator came we got in marion said i dont have to guess she was the only one out there and shes a flatlander so she smiled the wound was too high eight nine centimeters above the heart why the rim of the tub was too high right now there arent any tubs in the belt except in the bubble worlds a flatlander wouldnt expect a lunie bathtub to stand so tall when it came time to make her move naomi couldnt see penzlers heart she just took her best shot i shook my head a lunie would know how tall the tub was but he wouldnt expect penzler to be so short he must have seen penzler sure and naomis seen lunie bathtubs too while she was mulling that i added maybe it was a belter you said it yourself the only tubs in the belt are in the bubble worlds you spin those for an earth gravity belt bathtubs are just like earths marion grinned got me and were still missing the main point why didnt the killer just wait till penzler got out of the tub if it was naomi shed already been waiting most of four hours now that is a damn good question marion said and we parted on that note her to her room me to mine i could catch two or three hours on my back before at exactly i rang taffys doorbell gil are you alone the long stretch of hall was quite empty at this hour what sane man would be up chiron open door i walked in and she was already in flight i leaned far forward to catch her weight and managed not to bounce back into the hall we took a long time over our first kiss tasting each other by and by i noticed that she was wearing a surgeons paper coverall those things are intended to be used only once can i rip this off you be my guest i tore it off in handfuls with sound effects the roar of an unendurably frustrated male the paper was tough a lunie couldnt have done it i swept her in my arms and leapt for the bed and bounced off again pulled my own clothes off more sedately moved back to the bed and had some trouble she whispered in my ear let me dominate okay ive had some practice the missionary position doesnt work at all what do i have to know partly she told me partly she showed me we had to use our muscles to keep us together gravity wouldnt help we bounced we spent considerable time above the bed taffy told me not to worry about falling off and i didnt old and accustomed partners danced a new dance with taffy leading we rested then i made love to her standing up with taffys strong legs wrapped around my hips one arm out to clutch the edge of the tub in lunar gravity that position is almost restful and i studied her face joyful glowing familiar we rested again sweat stayed where it was it wouldnt drip taffy stirred in my arms and asked hungry yes there was a tray on the table scrambled egg chicken wimp toast coffee it may have cooled off she said it had to get here before you did otherwise wed have to be dressed we ate i asked what is it with lunies i keep hearing remarks its the kind of thing youd expect in the eighteenth century with social diseases and no contraceptives she nodded and swallowed and said harry tried to explain it to me people have been living on the moon for a hundred and twenty years or so but even eighty years ago there were only a few hundred human beings havent really adapted biologically to having children in low gravity maybe someday but for now they marry early and have two or three children and never use a contraceptive at all two or three children and a dozen or two dozen pregnancies that dont come to term the children are precious its very important who the father is uh huh thats the official position but there are contraceptives and somebodys buying them and long engagements are normal and children born seven or eight months after the ceremony are also normal id guess they try each other out just like we do but one at a time and what theyre looking for is fertility not compatibility and they dont talk about even that except harry she nodded harry likes flatlander women society kind of frowns on that but harrys too good a doctor to be fired she grinned at me thats his story hes actually damned good and hes sterile guaranteed there are a fair number of men like that and women too theyre in a special position not really considered a threat if you follow i wanted to know more about that relationship i tried an oblique approach would you recommend that i take a lunie lover she didnt smile dont fail to seduce a lunie gil what i mean is dont fail dont ask unless the answer is yes in fact now she smiled dont ask you can let yourself be seduced everyone knows flatlanders are easy are we sure now would you like to meet harry mccavity is that what you were getting at youd like him and he doesnt consider you a threat quite the reverse what youre a good cover you and i are roommates of long standing hove city society would really prefer that harry keep his relationships purely social oh okay id like to meet him socially i met him officially last night he was repairing a hole in a belt delegate i told her about penzler she didnt like it gil if someones shooting at offworld conference delegates shouldnt you start wearing a mirror vest and me too not to worry theyve got a suspect thats a relief the right suspect she was the only one out there i discovered that i didnt want to talk to taffy about naomi theyll be expecting to call me in my room and i need some sleep when shall we twain meet again it looks like thursday same time unless someone changes my schedule again same time lord i thought you were used to my funny hours look ill leave you a message if it looks like we can get together with harry lunch or dinner okay okay it was nine when i reached my room i called the mayors office got his secretary and was told that the conference had been postponed for that day but the conference room would be open for informal discussions interesting chris was that important but two other delegates had been up late into the night and others could be suffering from time lag i was just as glad theyd called it off i slept till noon then laura drury called she was just going off duty and a team of lunie police were leaving with naomi in ten minutes the cratered lands i got into my suit in a hell of a hurry then stopped and made myself go through the checkout routine i was long out of practice i reached the south face airlock and found the rest of the party still in sight on the road i bounced after them there were seven of us naomi marion shaeffer me and four tall lunie cops the freckled redhead was jefferson the face above the tallest of the orange suits was also familiar id seen him talking to the mayor last night at dinner alan watson yes thats right youre one of the conference delegates gil hamilton arm we shook gloves he was a thin young man with straight black hair a narrow nose thick shaggy eyebrows bluntfingered hands as strong as mine he couldnt make himself smile frightened for naomi the smallish painting on his chest showed an esoteric spacecraft nearing the north america nebula all in reds and blacks we set off naomi leading the road west was a trade road it sometimes carried heavy equipment up to the size of a damaged spacecraft it was broad and smooth but not straight follow it far enough and you would reach the belt trading post we had come four or five hundred yards without much conversation when naomi said i turned off here i wanted to climb that rock she was pointing at a faceted lump a considerable distance away it was the tallest point around i had first seen it glowing in darkness lit by imminent dawn when i looked out my window last night we followed naomi toward it marion asked did you climb it yes the sun was only six degrees up the sky we walked in shadow most of the time it would have been like wading through ink but for our headlamps the footing was chancy naomi stumbled as often as i did more often than the lunies marion had trouble too she stopped naomi at one point where our only route of approach would round a spur of black volcanic glass okay whats around this turn i dont know naomi said it was dark it was all different im not even sure this is the way i came the peak was a thousand feet high and not particularly steep it would give a good view of hove city i thought but we were north of where chris penzler had spotted his assassin a cop directed naomi to climb it she wasnt exactly agile in unfamiliar gravity with the inflated suit restricting her movements but she didnt have any trouble till she was three hundred feet up then she started yelping she came down dangerously fast its hot she complained it burned me right through the suit where alan watson demanded my chest and arms its okay now i think but i cant climb it in daylight shall i try the other side marion said no skip it where next naomi led us south i wondered if we would learn anything this way whether or not she was lying her answer would be the same it was dark i dont know the moon this probably isnt the way i came tentatively she had lied already when id climbed out of my tub the peak was sunlit for the upper hundred feet why had she tried to climb the sunlit side today if shed had the chance to learn better last night of course she could have started earlier yesterday and climbed in total darkness i didnt like that either and i hated where she was leading us this was familiar territory i had sifted it in miniature felt its contours with my imaginary hand i half remembered landmarks large or strange and so it seemed did naomi like a hillsized boulder that had split nicely down the middle leaving flat planes uppermost naomi described it before we reached it she pointed out one half of the split monolith and said i climbed up on that one i lay on my back and looked at the stars and sometimes at hove city more than half the windows were dark by then there was nice backlighting from behind from the spaceport and the mirror works she moved to climb up on it but marion yanked her back the orangeciad cops searched with headlamps and powerful flashlights for bootscrapes footprints anything naomi might have dropped when they gave up on the sides watson and jefferson reached the top in one leap and searched that slanted sunlight made the lamps unnecessary marion jumped up and joined them she balanced on boottoes and fingertips and searched with her face two inches from the rock nothing she said are you awe you were in this territory i was right up there on that rock marion looked satisfied jefferson looked grim alan watson had a haunted look i climbed up after them knowing it was roomy and almost flat it would be a good place to stretch out and watch stars i looked toward the city and chris penzlers tilted rock was almost in lineofsight assuming i had the right rock i could look right into chriss window around four hundred yards away the sun made me squint but at night that window would make a fine shooting gallery i thought it over for a few seconds then i said hamilton speaking id like to try a couple of things if nobody has any objection first id like to test fire a messenger laser i used jeffersons he showed me how to hook the transceiver cable into my helmet mike and how to aim the thing first making sure the dimmer switch was at full dim if you turned it up the safety gave you five minutes and then turned it down again otherwise you could accidentally vaporize whoever you were trying to call you never used fall power for anything closer than an orbiting spacecraft he showed me how to find and call the watchbird one satellite using the scope i got a computer it gave me a news update spacecraft chili bird had safely departed the belt trading post for confinement asteroid sunspot activity was on the increase but no solar flares had yet formed i asked jefferson these things do function as weapons dont they in an emergency yes how he showed me how to turn the dimmer switch to full brighti fired at a darkish rock i got a halfsecond burst of red flame and a hole three inches deep and a quarter of an inch wide half a second isnt much of a message i said so he showed me how to override the safety it burns out the sender of course and you get just enough time to yell help blowout that can be enough i handed it back second i said id like to go straight back to hove city from here and id like to take an escort officer watson would you care for a stroll he said all right see you later naomi and dont worry she nodded jerkily wearing the same stony expression shed worn all this time we hadnt gone far when watson said operative hamilton we can adjust our helmet mikes so we wont disturb the others i know how call me gil im alan we set our radios for privacy i said it finally hit me that i was missing the point you and i arent looking for the same killer as the rest of them we think naomis not guilty right shed never kill a man from ambush so were looking for someone else sticking to naomis route wont give him to us she never saw him he bought it he relaxed just a little she cant even tell us where he wasnt that place where she watched the stars he could have come after she left penzler saw his killer didnt he jefferson says he did id known naomi ten years ago but alan watson knew her now he believed her could i be wrong i filed the question penzler says he saw something but he cant even describe the suit something human past the tilted rock so lets walk toward the tilted rock taking our time and looking around we walked through pools of glare and shadow with almost no inbetween the colors were mostly browns and grays and whites alan said i wish i knew what to look for its a shame she didnt lose something i shrugged that off we arent looking for anything naomi dropped this is where the killer had to be we check the high points because he had to have a view of chriss window we look for tracks of a vehicle or burn marks from a rocket anything that could get him out of here before the police started looking for him he had ten minutes or more and look for pieces of a laser i would have found a laser but it could have been broken up your imaginary arm skeptical hed have his chance to sneer at my imaginary arm when i testified for the prosecution against naomi the thought of naomi being broken up for spare parts gave me the creeps i could never be neutral where naomi was concerned but say that love and hate could add to make indifference say i could feel nothing for naomi it would still be like taking scissors to a george barr painting vandalism alan said that flattopped rock where she watched the stars would have been perfect wouldnt it yeah a beautiful view of chriss window what i dont believe is that shed lead us there alan would a lunie go sightseeing on the moon at night he laughed a lunie can always wait two weeks a tourist has to go home the grim look returned most tourists pick daytime it does look funny dammit light and shadow all moonscape and no clues every time we walked into full sunlight i had to blink against the glare my visor took a fraction of a second to darken and it was too long we took the easy paths but we stopped to climb obvious vantage points the silence was getting to me i asked was your father named after the city itself oh partly the jacob hovestraydt the man who founded the city was my greatgrandfather and he had two daughters and one didnt have children did the other had dad and my three aunts so were the direct genetic line dad was practically born mayor weve talked about it how he grew up hey stay away from there you dont know how deep it is id been about to wade through a dust pool scuffing my feet looking for pieces of a laser but he was right of course i said id like another crack at the projection room could you get me that i think so did you ever show naomi the projection room he stopped walking howd you know i just wondered we marched our crooked path in silence for a time then alan said every time some offworlder bigwig showed up he had to meet the kid me once upon a time i told dad i didnt like it he said he went through the same thing when his grandfather was mayor and his mother picked his school courses for him political science air cycle engineering ecology economics his first job was in the garden then he was in maintenance tending the air system and you are you being groomed for mayor maybe dad was in the police too for awhile im not sure ill ever want to run hovestraydt city and im sure dad wouldnt force me and im not sure i could i dont want to now i want to travel look gil weve almost reached the tilted rock thats too close i wonder in the first place i dont trust a belters sense of distance on the moon mmm yes in fact the closer the killer was the better the chance penzler would see him and naomi wouldnt have because she was further west he could have been just behind the rock yeah and well look hed have had to be in sunlight wouldnt he for penzler to see him alan squatted then leapt soared graceful as all hell his parabola peaked at the rocks rounded tip and he clutched it with all four limbs then began his own investigations to me it seemed a precarious perch for an aspiring marksman from chriss window the tilted rock had looked like an elongated egg but the side in darkness was almost flat i played my headlamp over it the surface was rough and white i scraped my gloved fingers over it crumbly white stuff adhered to my fingers it disappeared as i watched what the hell no laser parts no footprints no puffer tracks nothing alan said and theres too much dust around if he has any brains the killer wouldnt have been walking where theres dust gil well have to backtrack i dont think so i dont think chris saw his killer what why would the killer be in sunlight hed be half blind in the glare it was just dawn with most of this region in shadow hed have had to go looking for sunlight to stand in so chris could see him its plain silly then what did he see i dont know yet i want another look at chriss room gil whats your stake in this aesthetic shes too beautiful to be broken up too flippant i tried again i loved her once and i hated her once now shes an old friend in trouble you i love her we werent looking for clues now the tilted rock was behind us penzler couldnt have seen anything here like the keeneyed indian in his forest or the streetwise mugger on his home turf alan watson knew this part of the moon hed see anything worth seeing to me it was all moonscape i did get him talking about the conference six out of ten of you are offworlders he said we dont even have a voting majority i can see why some citizens dont like that but theyre wrong the moon is a kind of halfway house between the mud and the sky between earth and the belt we gain some advantages from that but we have to keep you both satisfied too the organ bank problem doesnt make that any easier his lecturers manner made him seem older somehow if he went into politics hed succeed at it might i ask are these your fathers views too weve talked about it but im not just quoting him he smiled the last conference established the holding tanks even if naomis convicted she still goes into a holding tank for six months six months to prove shes innocent and im very glad of that wups alan does she know that she may be more scared than she has to be oh good lord he was horrified so you never told her so make an opportunity can she have visitors shes in her own room with the phone turned off and the door geared to reject her voice im sure a policeman could visit her i just didnt think the trials set for day after tomorrow and she thinks thats it the end ill tell her gil gil what are you doing we had reached hovestraydt city and i was hard up against chris penzlers window i said checking the scene of the crime from the other side kid i noted with approval that i was in the fields of three cameras our clumsy killer might conceivably want to plant a small bomb on the window i peered in chris was on his back on the bed covered with foam plastic from chin to navel and armpit to armpit the mobile autodoc was standing above him like a polished steel nursemaid alan come here a second do you see anything like a miniature hologram in there on a wall or the table no neither do i dammit why maybe it was moved i still cant see our halfcompetent marksman sticking his face into sunlight blinding himself just before he fired i thought maybe chris had a holo of his mother or someone on the wall and he saw it reflected in the window just before he got shot but theres nothing the door opened and closed behind harry mccavity the doctor prodded his unconscious patient for a bit then moved to the autodoc screen and typed read the screen for a bit typed again ran his hands through his fluffy brown hair in a swift gesture that changed nothing turned around and jumped a yard in the air when he saw faces peering in the window i gestured in a curve to the left well come through the airlock he glared and gestured back up uranus a few minutes later we knocked at the door and he let us in we were looking around alan said lamely for what mccavity demanded i said a hologram portrait my idea have you seen anything that might fit no it s important no can he answer questions i waved at chris penzler no let him alone hes doing fine hell be mobile tomorrow not comfortable but mobile ask him then gil are you booked for dinner no what time do you like say half an hour we can check with ms grimes see if shes off duty perhaps she can join us the conference table wed chosen a table in a far corner of the dining level lunie diners tended to cluster around the garden we could barely see the garden and nobody was in eavesdropping distance it isnt just that we arent man and wife mccavity said stabbing the air with splayended chopsticks we cant even keep the same hours we enjoy each other dont we taffy nodded happily i need constant reassurance my dear gil we enjoy each other but when we see each other its generally over an open patient im glad for taffy that youre here isnt this kind of thing supposed to be normal on earth well i said its normal where ive lived california kansas australia over most of the earth we tend to keep recreational sex separate from having children there are the fertility laws of course the government doesnt tell people how to use their birthrights but we do check the babys tissue rejection spectrum to see which father has used up a birthright dont get the idea that earth is all one culture the arabs are back to harems for gods sake and so were the mormons for awhile harems what about the birthrights the harems are recreation as far as the shiek is concerned and of course he uses up his own birthrights when theyre gone the ladies take sperm from some healthy genius with an unlimited birthright and the right skin color and the shiek raises the children as the next generation of aristocrats harry ate while he thought then it sounds wonderful by allah but for us having children is a big thing we tend to stay faithful im the freak and i know of a lunie who fathered a child for two good friends but i could maybe get killed for naming them i said okay were a menage a at least trois but you would like it noised abroad that taffy and i are steady roommates it would be convenient would it be convenient for me harry i gather lunies dont like that sort of thing there are four lunie delegates in the conference i cant alienate them taffy was frowning futz i hadnt thought of that harry said i did gil itll help you what the lunie citizen really wants to know is that you arent running around compromising the honor of lunie women i looked at taffy she said i think hes right i cant swear to it okay we ate it was mostly vegetables fresh with good variety i had almost finished a side dish beef with onions and green pepperover rice before i wondered beef i looked up into harrys grin imported he said and laughed as my jaw dropped no not from earth can you imagine the deltav imported from tycho theyve got an underground bubble big enough to graze cattle it costs like blazes of course were fairly wealthy here dessert was strawberry shortcake with whipped cream from tycho the coffee was imported from earth but freezedried i wondered if they saved anything that way given that the water in coffee beans had to be imported anyway then kicked myself lunies dont import water they import hydrogen they run the hydrogen past heated oxygenbearing rock to get water vapor so i sipped my coffee and asked may we talk business none of us are squeamish mccavity said the wound then would a layer of bathwater spread the beam that much i dont know nobody knows its never happened before your best guess then gil it had to be enough unless youve got another explanation mmm there was a case in warsaw where a killer put a dot of oil over the aperture of a laser the beam was supposed to spread a little just enough that the police couldnt identify the weapon it would have worked fine if he hadnt got drunk and bragged about it mccavity shrugged his eyebrows not here any damn fool would guess it was a message laser we know the beam spread were speculating harrys eyes went distant and dreamy would the oil vaporize sure instantly the beam would constrict in midburn that would fit the hole in penzlers chest looked like the beam changed width in the middle of the burn it constricted it constricted or expanded or theres something we havent thought of futz okay do you know naomi mitchison vaguely harry seemed to withdraw a little not intimately no taffy was looking at him we waited i grew up here harry said abruptly i never make proposals to a woman unless i have reason to think theyll be accepted okay i must have read the signals wrong she reacted like an insulted married lunie woman so i apologized and went away and we havent spoken since youre right flatlanders arent all the same a week ago i would have said we were friends now no i dont know the lady do you hate her what no taffy said maybe your killer doesnt care if penzler lives or dies maybe its naomi he wants to hurt i mulled that i dont like it first how would he know he could make it stick there might have been someone else out there second it gives us a whole damn city full of suspects i noticed or imagined harrys uneasiness not you harry you sweated blood to save chris it would have been trivial to kill him while the doc was cutting him up harry grinned so what it was already an organ bank crime for naomi yes but he saw something he might remember more tally asked who else wouldnt want to frame naomi im really not taking the idea too seriously i said but i guess id want to know who she insulted who made passes and got slapped down and who took it badly harry said you wont find many lunie suspects the men are too careful that and no offense my dear but naomi isnt beautiful by lunie standards shes stocky what wondered tally does that make me harry grinned at her stocky i told you i was a freak she grinned back at that tall narrow offshoot of human stock and i found myself grinning too they did get along it was a pleasure to watch them we broke it up soon afterward tally was on duty and i needed my sleep the city hall complex was four stories deep with the mayors office on the ground level a room on the second level was reserved for the conference i got there at eightfoottall bertha carmody was in animated discussion with a small birdlike belt woman in late middle age they broke off long enough to introduce the stranger hildegarde quilting fourth speaker for the belt government chris penzler was in a bulky armchair equipped with safety straps and a groundeffect skirt soft foam covered his chest he seemed to be brooding on his wrong i said hello anyway he looked up youll find coffee and rolls on the side table he said and tried to wave in the right direction ouch hurts yah i got coffee in a smallmouthed bottle with a foam plastic sleeve other delegates trickled in until we were all present a lunie i hadnt met charles ward of copernicus moved to elect a chairman then nominated bertha carmody of tycho dome with four lunies out of ten delegates the chairman was bound to be a lunie so i voted for bertha so did everybody else the lunies seemed surprised at their easy victory but bertha was a good choice she had the loudest voice among us we spent the morning covering old ground belt and moon and united nations had each their own axes to grind officially the moon was a satellite of earth and was subject to the united nations law in which even minor crimes carried the death penalty laws designed not only to punish the guilty but also to supply transplant organs to the innocent voting public the ethical gap between earth and belt was as vast as the physical gap on earth the hospitals had been supplied by criminals for well over a hundred years when luke garner was young the death penalty had been revived for murder kidnapping treason and the like as medical techniques improved and spread to the havenot nations demands on the public organ banks had grown the death penalty was imposed for armed robbery rape burglary a plea of insanity became worthless eventually felons died for income tax evasion or driving while high on funny chemicals belt hospitals kept organ banks but there were major differences the belt used fewer transplants belters tend to let evolution take care of the careless ones they are not egalitarians space accidents dont tend to leave medical cases anyway the belt didnt perform its own executions up to twenty years ago their practice had been to ship convicts to earth and buy the organs back in theory their law would not be affected by the flatlanders greed for life the moons shallower gravity well made it a far better choice as the belts place of execution so the first conference was called and strange were the results there had been major compromises at the conference of the biggest was the holding tanks they were unique throughout the solar system the belt had insisted that they be built and the un had capitulated the holding tanks would hold a convict inactivated but alive and healthy for six months if new evidence was found the convict could be revived twenty years later that solution was under fire hildegarde quilting wanted a rundown on the past twenty years of lunar jurisprudence in particular had the holding tanks ever been forced to disgorge a living felon charles ward obliged he was six eleven or so in his late thirties a frail dark man with a receding hairline in a colorless voice he told us that over the past twenty years some six thousand felons had passed through the lunar courts and hospitals just under a thousand were lunies the belt felons had been convicted by belt courts lunar hospitals served only as execution grounds no conviction had yet been reversed ward represented copernicus dome actually a complex of domes plus a metals mine the site of one of the moons three major hospital complexes ward had come armed with graphs and maps and statistics average of a hundred and twenty executions a year mostly belters shipped in via the belt trading post and the mass driver in grimalde crater the hospital took nearly four hundred patients a year mostly lunies the numbers rising over the years as the lunar population increased i listened carefully copernicus was where naomi would be sent if she was convicted lunch was delivered around noon we talked in low voices while we ate until carmody called us to order at once marion shaeffer demanded to know whether the lunar hospitals shipped as much transplant material out as came to them through the belt courts ward answered a bit superciliously that belt transplants tended to be not quite the right shape that bones and muscles from belter arms and legs for instance would be drastically too short for a lunie this seemed obvious enough but it wasnt what marion meant she wanted to know how much transplant material the moon shipped to earth quite a lot the conference was polarizing belters and flatlanders were opposite poles with the lunies in the middle to frail old hildegarde quilting our approach to the organ bank problem was monstrous death penalties imposed at every opportunity to keep the voting citizens alive and healthy to jabez stone of the general assembly a criminal was lucky to redeem himself in any way and belters need not act so damn superior when a man orders a steak a steer must be mutilated then murdered how many transplants were keeping quilting alive carmody ruled that out of order quilting insisted on answering it anyway she had never had a transplant she said belligerently i noticed uncomfortable expressions among the delegates maybe they noticed mine it was a long session the break for dinner came none too soon i fell in beside chris penzlers softly whispering aircushion chair you didnt say much are you up to this oh im up to it he smiled a passable smile that faded i feel mortal he said having a hole shot through him can make a man think i could die i have one daughter i never had time for more i was too busy making money making a career and then there was a solar flare while i was en route to mercury and now im sterile when i die shell be all thats left of me almost i said the quality of their lives is as important as their number trite but he nodded thoughtfully then somebody hates me enough to kill me does naomi mitchison hate you that much he scowled she has no reason oh shes strange enough and she doesnt like me but i wish i knew i hope to god its her of course if it wasnt naomi then the clumsy killer was still loose i asked do you keep holograms in your room or statues of any kind he stared no futz is your phone working all right yah its working well why just a thought now you said you were looking past a big tilted rock when you saw somebody which side of the rock i dont remember he considered thats very strange i dont remember mayor hove he bellowed hove was just coming up a spiral stairwell at the end of the hall he turned startled hello chris gil hows the conference going i said theres a certain amount of friction chris interrupted can you let us into your office of course why i want to look out the window he seemed feverishly excited the mayor shrugged he led the way upstairs his office was big roomy the computer terminal built into the desk hooked into the hologram wall and into two more screens there was a foot and a half of keyboard with a rolltop cover a hologram wall looked out on jovian storms seen from closer than amalthea swirling like a million shades of paint poured into a whirlpool endless storms big enough to swallow the earth hovestraydt watson must have a big ego i thought how else could he live and work next to that the picture window looked south into a blazing moonscape chris edged as close as he could to the window i cant see it well have to go to my room whats it all about the mayor asked i was looking past a large boulder just before the beam burned me i must have seen the killer to one side or the other but i cant are you sure he wasnt closer than the rock penzler screwed his eyes shut after a moment he said almost hed have to be a midget to show that small that close i wish i could be sure i said chris i thought maybe you saw a reflection from a small hologram in your room or maybe from the phone screen is that possible chris shrugged mayor hove said the phone would have to be on wouldnt it it would have been facing chris if it was working right chris did you call anyone while you were in the tub no and my phone system is working so we went down the hall to chriss room all three of us chris pointed out the tilted rock alan watson and i had investigated we studied it for a good minute before he said i simply cannot remember but he was almost twice as far as the rock i called from my room i want to talk to naomi mitchison i told the desk sergeant preferably in person he looked at me youre not her lawyer i didnt claim to be he took his time thinking it over ill put you through to her lawyer he rang waited then said mr boone isnt there his answering bug says hes in conference with a client so let me talk to them both he went into a brown study i said then put me through to sergeant drury if thats possible his relief showed he made the call the phone screen went blank and laura drurys voice said just a minute gil hamilton isnt it yes im trying to get permission to talk to ms mitchison the desk sergeant is giving me static lets see her lawyer is supposed to be with her ill call him on her phone hes a public defender artemus boone lunie yes did you learn anything from going over her course nothing conclusive the screen lighted laura drury was just completing the act of zipping up a pale gold jump suit i gathered the picture had caught her a split second too soon the zipper had hesitated at her bosom and well it might she looked flustered she tugged hard the zipper went up i repressed a smile jefferson thinks she was lying she said but he cant tell what she was lying about i thought so too id like to know more about that trek myself i said i have to go through this boone is that right if you cant convince him may i talk to him myself id like to help her ill find out stand by she put me on hold she called back a minute later they wont see you they wont talk to you either im sorry futz is that just her lawyers word i think he talked to her first off camera thanks laura i called the phone off i debated schemes for getting through to her anyway and gave up on them i didnt really have a lot to say to naomi the lunar law the committee met again at id had breakfast with taffy but the rest of us were sipping and munching when bertha carmody called us to order charles ward asked for the floor it strikes me that our differences are all concerned with matters of the lunar law and the manner in which it is enforced is this the case he got noises signifying agreement then let me remind you all said that frail dark beanpole that the trial of naomi mitchison for the attempted murder of chris penzler begins in one hour some of us are likely to be called as witnesses mr penzler in particular is still recovering from his wounds his mind is likely to be on the trial chris nodded and winced in pain you may be right i wouldnt be concentrating ward spread his hands wide then in the interests of actually observing lunar justice in action why dont we all adjourn to the courtroom we voted eight to two in favor we adjourned to the courtroom the courtroom was a place of beauty its design was standard high podium for the judge rails separating the spectators from the accused and the jury it was the thousandyearold english courtroom design originally intended to protect the accused from the victims family but one whole wall was glass and it overlooked the garden mirrors caught the raw lunar sunlight and diffused it down upon dozens of ledges of plants down along the great redwood to its long tangled roots the air was lull of wings no plant grew that didnt have a use but the prettiest plants artichokes and apple trees and so forth were the most accessible and the dancing fountains werent only for irrigation and the winding paths werent only for the farmers the garden was designed for pleasure i thought how terrible it must be to look out on the garden and wait to be condemned to death naomi was watching the garden her golden hair was piled high in a coiled arrangement that must represent hours of work she had taken particular care with dress and cosmetics the butterfly tattoo was gone she seemed composed with terror hiding underneath when her lunie lawyer whispered to her her answers were curt she must know that if she started screaming they would fill her full of tranquilizers was she guilty my judgment could never be impartial where naomi was concerned chris penzler thought she was he watched naomis eyes while he gave his testimony i was taking a bath i stood up and reached for a towel i thought i saw something outside the window a man or a woman then there was a flare of red light it struck me in the chest threw me back in the water and knocked me unconscious the prosecuting lawyer was a pale blond woman over seven feet tall massing no more than i do she had an elvish triangular face quite lovely quite perfect and quite without human weakness she asked what color was the suit did it have markings on it penzler shook his head i didnt have time to see but you saw only one person yes he said and looked at naomi she probed was it a local we tend to be taller and thinner chris didnt laugh though others did i dont know it was less than a second then it was like being run through with a red hot jousting lance how far away three to four hundred meters i cant judge distances here would naomi mitchison have any reason to hate you ive wondered about that chris hesitated then said four years ago mrs mitchison applied for emigration to the belt her application was turned down again he hesitated by me naomis surprise and anger were obvious prosecution asked why i knew her she wasnt qualified the belt environment kills careless people she would have been a danger to herself and everyone around her chris penzlers ears and neck were quite pink prosecution was through with him naomis lawyer crossexamined him briefly you say you knew mrs mitchison how well i knew naomi and itch mitchison briefly five years ago when i was on earth we attended a few parties together itch wanted to know about buying mining stocks and i got him some details naomi was moving her lips without sound i read the words on her lips liar liar you believe you saw your assassin out on the moon could you be mistaken or could you have missed others out there chris laughed i saw a human shape blazing against the dark it was night on the moon there could have been an army hidden in the shadows for that matter perhaps i only saw a pattern of reflections i only saw it for a split second then bang prosecution dismissed chris and called a lunie cop i didnt know he testified that there was indeed a message laser missing from the weapons room defense tried to get him to say that the door would open only to the police what the cop said was that the lock responded to voice and retinae prints and that it was governed by the hovestraydt city computer the same that operated every door and sat и lock in the city not to mention the water and air prosecution then asked that naomis records beamed from earth be read into the record i remembered naomi had been a computer programmer the elf woman turned with floating grace in lunar gravity call gilbert hamilton i was aware that i moved to the witness chair with a flatlanders clumsiness treading air and half falling at every step your name and occupation gilbert gilgamesh hamilton im an arm are you here on the moon in that capacity its not my regular beat i said and got suppressed laughter im here for the conference to review lunar law she didnt need to go into that the judge and three jurors were all lunies theyd have been following the conference via the boob cube she led me through the details of tuesday night the midnight call the scene in penzlers room the trek to the projection room then she asked are you sometimes called gil the arm ive got an imaginary arm i had to smile at the baffled looks its a combination of psychic powers during the years i spent asteroid mining i lost my right arm i got it replaced eventually in what fashion its a transplant no telling who it belonged to it came out of the stock in trade of a captured organlegger please continue with just the stump left i found i was using a kind of ghost arm it works best in low gravity ive got two of the recognised psychic powers esper and telekinesis but theyre restricted by my imagination i cant reach further than the stretch of a real arm returning to the projection room she said did you search the landscape in an attempt to find any suspect who might have been overlooked for a suspect or for a discarded weapon yes in what fashion did you search i ran my imaginary fingers through the projected moonscape there was a whisper of giggling from the audience id expected that i sifted shadows dust pools anything big enough to hide a message laser or a human being would you have found a human being or were you let us say tuned only to the shape and feel of a message laser id have found a human being she turned me over to defense artemus boone stood seven feet plus with craggy features a full black beard and thick black hair to me he looked like a wandering ghoul but i was biased the lunie jurors might be seeing an elongated abe lincoln you came for the conference to review lunar law when did it begin yesterday have you revised many of our laws yet hed decided i was an adverse witness we havent had time to revise anything i said not even regarding the holding tanks hey werent our doings supposed to be secret but nobody objected i said that one may never be settled how were you chosen to represent the united nations viewpoint mr hamilton i was a belt miner for seven years now im an arm it gives me two of the three crucial viewpoints im picking up the lunie viewpoint as best i can as best you can boone said dubiously well then the pleasantly convenient manner in which naomi mitchison has supplied us with exactly one suspect may have led us to overlook something you were present when she was brought in was she carrying a weapon no you say you searched for a message laser just how much imaginary moonscape did you run your imaginary fingers through i searched the badlands west of the city the area chris penzler could have seen from his bathtub i searched as far as the western peaks and some of the far slopes you found no weapon none psychic powers have always been undependable havent they science was reluctant even to recognize their existence and the law was slow in allowing psychics to testify tell me mr hamilton if your unusual talent missed finding a message laser could you not have overlooked a man its possible certainly defense was through with me the coldeyed elf woman asked me what if the gun had been broken up and the pieces discarded would you have found it i dont know they let me go and i sat down prosecution called an expert witness an orientalseeming man who turned out to be a lunie cop he was actually shorter than i am he testified that he had examined naomis pressure suit and found it to be working satisfactorily in the course of tests he had worn the suit outside it was a tight fit he said did you notice anything else i noticed the smell the suit is some years old and the molecular filter badly needs cleaning after some hours of wear certain fatigue poisons build up in the recycled air and it begins to smell they called octavia budrys and i started to catch on the police handed me a pressure suit she said and told me to gear up i did i suppose they chose me because im not used to space i barely know how to put on a pressure suit did you notice anything yes there was a faint chemical smell not so much unpleasant as well ominous i would have had it repaired before i tried to wear it outside the killer fired as soon as chris penzler stood up in his tub hed already waited a good long while why not wait a moment longer while penzler got out because the smell in naomi mitchisons suit made her think her air supply was going bad she was afraid to wait i wasnt convinced any given killer might have lost patience waiting in lunar discomfort while chris wallowed in his tub but it was a point against naomi the court broke fur lunch after lunch the defense called naomi mitchison boone kept it short he asked naomi if she had stolen a message laser and tried to kill chris penzler with it she swore she hadnt he asked her what she was doing during the period in question she told the court more or less what shed told us adding details she swore that she had never had any reason to dislike chris penzler until now boone mentioned that he might have further questions and turned her over to the prosecution the elf woman did not waste our time on september did you apply for emigration to the asteroid belt society i did why things had gone all wrong naomi said i wanted out how did they go wrong my husband tried to kill me i got to one of the bathrooms locked the door and went out the window he killed our little girl and then himself that was in june why did he do it i dont know ive thought about it i dont know let me see if i can help the elf woman said the records show that itch mitchison was a professional comedian the basis of his humor was an image that used to be called macho a man who expects sexual exclusivity from his woman and who expects of himself unlimited potency and attractiveness to women was that the case more or less what was he like in his private life pretty much the same some of that was a puton but i think thats the way he was you had a little girl miranda born january she was four and a half years old when he killed her her calm had cracked had you and your husband applied fur a second child yes but by then itchs grandmother was in the organ banks she is this necessary no it will be read into the record just say she went crazy then the fertility board decided it was congenital they had his record of asthma trouble childhood diseases the upshot was that i could have children but itch couldnt and he bloody well didnt want me to we talked about my using artificial insemination he got terribly angiy that old macho image wasnt just about seduction did you know that brittle laughter when you sire a lot of babies then youre macho was your love life affected by these developments it was killed dead and he did have that congenital tendency eventually he he snapped three months later you applied to the belt yes and chris penzler blocked you i didnt know that i never had reason to hate chris penzler she said i didnt know why my application was turned down but that vindictive bastard had reason to hate me he made a pass at me once and i slapped him down good physically did you actually strike him no of course not i told him to go to hell i told him that if he ever came near me again id tell itch itch would have knocked him silly thats macho too i guessed shed made a point in her favor lunies wouldnt be familiar with open marriages the elf woman thought differently very well mr penzler made indecent proposals to you a married woman surely that might be reason fur you to hate and despise him especially after what later happened to your marriage naomi shook her head he didnt cause that the prosecution dismissed her and called alan watson of the team that had tried to follow naomis illtimed attempt to play tourist three were called as witnesses they did naomi little good naomi had led them straight to the scene of the crime her knowledge of the terrain was spotty at best the best reason for believing her was that she would have had to be crazy to lie i ate dinner alone and went back to my room it was my mind that was exhausted id had no exercise yet i felt like sleeping for a week but i checked my phone before i dropped off i had messages from taffy and from desiree porter taffy and harry were both free friday they planned to explore the shops of the belt trading post would i like to join them feel free to add a friend female preferred i phoned back but taffy wasnt in and neither was harry i left a message sorry i was tied up in the conference and a murder trial i tried to call naomis room her phone refused my call i wasnt up to fighting with artemus boone and i didnt want to talk to a newstaper i called off the lights and flopped back and the phone said phone call mr hamilton pho chiron answer phone tom reinecke was standing behind the seated desiree their faces level it was a nice effect and they knew it i said what do you two want news said desiree are you getting anywhere with the conference secret anyway we postponed it we heard that do you think naomi mitchison will be convicted up to the jury youre a big help tom cut in smoothly its the speed of the trial that impressed us why do you suppose it went so fast oh hell i was fully awake they think theyve got a locked room murder one suspect locked out on the moon if they could eliminate naomi theyd invent themselves a real problem no suspects so they arent really trying how would you go about it tom asked while desiree was saying would you change the law theyd caught me half asleep and got rue talking it served me right changing the law wouldnt make anything different how would i get her off id prove she wasnt there or id prove someone else was or maybe id prove the killer wasnt where we thought he was tom asked how would you do that im tired go away and leave me alone desiree asked is she guilty chiron phone off no calls for eight hours i didnt know getting to sleep took a long time last night and morning after we discussed the trial over our rolls and coffee next morning belters and flatlanders both expressed surprise at its speed and at the number of jurors the lunies took affront they asserted that the accuseds agony of anticipation should be as brief as possible as for the jury the moon had never had a large population with vast leisure three were enough a larger jury would only get tangled in a dozen different viewpoints like any committee like our own it got rather heated chris penzler was out of his travel chair but foam bandaging still bulked out his shirt and he moved like an old man he wasnt inclined to join the discussions neither was i once i tried to suggest that the length of a trial should depend on the complexity of the case nobody much liked that and in fact marion shaeffer insisted that i was biased in the accuseds favor i dropped it presently bertha carmody called us to order said a few words intended to soothe ruffled feeling and adjourned us to the courtroom i wasnt called again chris penzler was he testified at length as to his relationship to itch and naomi on earth he said he had seen naomi when she arrived at hovestraydt city she had given him a cold glare and he had returned it and they had avoided each other since he repeated that he couldnt describe what he saw before he was shot lunie belter flatlander he couldnt say he didnt seem to be trying to hurt naomi it was as if he was trying to work out a puzzle with the courts help defense called dr harry mccavity who testified that from the nature of the wound the beam must have spread abnormally asked to agree that something other than a message laser had been usedsomething cobbled together by an amateur for instance so that it didnt collimate very wellmccavity dithered the hole in penzler was not that much too big and damn him he raised my suggestion of a drop of oil on the aperture they wrapped it up faster than i would have believed at eleven hundred the elf woman started her summingup she pointed out that naomi had motive method and opportunity jurisprudence did not require that motive be proved but naomi had motive enough circumstances had struck naomi a terrible blow she had made a halfmad attempt to escape an intolerable environment chris penzler had blocked it for his own motives prosecution made no excuse for penzler but his vindictive act had been the straw that broke her mind method naomi had been a top computer programmer breaking the code of the hovestraydt city computer wouldnt be easy but her needs were not great she needed only to enter a computerguarded gun mom without leaving a record in the computer memory opportunity someone had fired at penzler from the badlands west of hovesfraydt city penzler had seen her a known psychic had testified that nobody else was in the vicinity had naomi mitchison fired that beam who else during his own summingup boone made a big thing of the missing weapon the jury must disregard gil the arms testimony as to the absence of other suspects or accept that there was no weapon either and thus no murder the nature of the wound indicated that the weapon was homemade using skills naomi mitchison didnt have gil hamiltons talent had missed it and the killer too prosecutions counterargument was concise there had been a laser ignore the nature of both weapon and wouldbekiller if hamilton couldnt find it the weapon must have been broken up there were dust pools to hide the parts jury must disregard the absence of the laser and consider the presence of a suspect caught out on the moon with an air system going sour by shortly after noon the judge was instructing the jury by thirteen hundred the jury had retired we straggled off to lunch i wasnt hungry of course but i managed to get bertha carmody talking around her sandwich i wonder if theyve really got enough information to make a decision i ventured the summingup seemed so quick theyve got everything they need bertha said theyve got a computer with access to all the records of the trial dossiers for everyone who was so much as mentioned and anything in the city library if a point of law comes up they can call the judge day or night until they bring in a verdict what more do they need they needed to have been in love with naomi mitchison i couldnt concentrate during the afternoon session i was trying to outguess a jury several floors away talk flowed past me i wonder if youre not a bit quick to convict octavia budrys said knowing that a conviction can be reversed youve watched a trial bertha carmnody said did you have any quarrel with the proceeding only that it was so quick ill admit that the case seems openandshut what will happen to her now the delegate from clavius said weve been through that shell spend six months in the holding tank its the same technology used on the slowboats the interstellar starships and its quite safe then barring a reversal shell be broken up she wont be touched until then barring an emergency no what does the lunar law call an emergeney that was the question that snapped me wide awake ward gave us details there had been emergencies six years ago a quake had ripped one of the domes open at copernicus the doctors had used everything they could get their hands on including holding tanks theyd preserved the felons central nervous systems until their grace time was up theyd done the same after the blowout of eighteen years ago two years ago there was a patient whose odd tissue rejection patterns matched a holding tank felons rare and unlikely events yeah maybe we didnt really have six months there were calls waiting on my phone from sergeant laura drury and artemus boone i took drurys call first she was sitting crosslegged on a bed quite naked i hadnt thought lunies were that casual naked she was sheer delight brown hair three feet long floating in the moms air currents a long slender graceful body with lines of hard muscle heavy breasts that floated too and legs that went on forever but her words drove all prurient thoughts out of my mind gil forgive the voiceonly i called to tell you the jurys come back she said i thought you should hear it from someone you know its a conviction shell be flown to copernicus tomorrow morning im sorry there was no shock id been expecting it the phone asked will there be a reply chiron record reply thanks for calling laura i appreciate it chiron phone off i stared out the window for a minute before i remembered the other call the blackbearded lawyer was seated behind an ancient computer terminal in an equally ancient windowless office his message was short my client has asked me to ask you to call her her number is twosevenoneone you may have to get it through the police i apologise for refusing your calls earlier but in my judgment it was best her timing was silly the trial was over oh well chiron phone call twosevenoneone please identify yourself gilbert hamilton i waited while the city computer compared voice prints while it called naomis room while naomigil hello she looked awful she looked like a once lovely woman coming out of a year on the wire her gaiety was a brittle mask i said hello isnt your timing a little off i might have been able to do something she brushed it off gil will you spend my last night with me we used to be good friends and i dont want to be alone i would have preferred a night on the rack theres alan watson theres your lawyer ive seen enough of artemus boone to lastgil hes all tied up in my mind with the trial please she hadnt even mentioned alan ill call you back i said a last night with naomi the thought terrified me taffy wasnt answering her phone i tried harry mccavitys room and got harry shes in a brushup class on trace element dietary deficiencies he said i took it last year flatlanders dont need it except in places like brazil whats up naomi mitchisons been convicted is she guilty for all i know shes been lying about something she wants me to spend her last night with her well youre old friends arent you how would taffy feel about that he looked puzzled you know her she doesnt think she owns either of us anyway its a mission of mercy youre sitting up with a sick friend there isnt anyone sicker than naomi mitchison right now when he got no response he asked what do you want to hear i want someone to talk me out of it he thought it over then taffy wouldnt try but shell want to hold your hand when its over i think ill tell her maybe she can get some time early tomorrow shall i let you know futz witness is unresponsive does it help if i tell you i empathize ill get drunk with you if shes not free i may need that chiron phone off chiron phone call twosevenoneone futz i was going to have to go through with it i found a cop outside her door he took my retinae prints and checked them with the city computer he grinned down at me and started to say something looked again and changed his mind he said instead you look like theyre about to break you up it feels like they already did he let me past it was party time naomi wore floating luminous transparencies blue with flashes of scarlet the butterfly fluttering on her eyelids had iridescent blue wing she smiled and ushered me in and for a moment i forgot why i was here then her eyes flicked to the clock and mine followed city time city time early morning two orange hemispheres looked me in the eye as i emerged i looked up the cop guarding naomis door had been replaced by laura drury i asked how long has she got half an hour futz i already knew that the landscape within my skull was blanketed in fog later i remembered the chill in drurys voice i was in no shape to notice then i said i hate to let her sleep and i hate to wake her up what do i do i dont know her if she went to sleep happy let her sleep happy i shook my head she hadnt been happy should i wake her no i said i want to thank you for calling it was kind thats all right i considered telling laura that shed better get her phone fixed or stop mumbling the commands i was almost that woozy tell a lunie shed exposed her nakedness to a flatlander not me i waved and turned away and staggered to the elevators at the ground floor level i decided i wanted to be alone i aimed myself toward my room i changed my mind before i got there taffy studied me for a moment then she pulled me in worked my rumpled clothes off got me face down on the bed poured oil on me and started a massage when she felt some of the tension leaving me she spoke do you want to talk about it um i dont think so what do you want coffee sleep more massage i said she was the perfect hostess it was her last chance it was reminiscence time she wanted to cover a ten year gap in one night we did a lot of talking she said nothing taffy do you want to have children her hands stopped then resumed kneading my calf muscle and achillies tendon some day with me what brought this on naomi chris penzler they both waited too long i wouldnt want to wait too long she said pregnant women dont make good surgeons they turn clumsy id have to drop my career for six or seven months id want to think about that right and id want to finish my tour here right id want to get married a fifteen year contract i wouldnt want to raise a child alone in my fatiguedoped state i hadnt thought that far fifteen years still sounds reasonable how many birthrights do you have just the two good me too why dont we use them both more efficient she kissed the small of my back then went back to working the bones and joints of my feet she asked what did she say that got you so worked up about children i tried to remember naomi fluttered around the bar in a cloud of blue and scarlet transparencies she made navy grog in huge balloon glasses with constricted rims i gathered we werent expected to stay sober she asked what have you been doing for ten years i told her how i had fled earth for the belt emphasizing her part in it i thought shed like that i told her how wed set a bomb to move a small asteroid how the asteroid had shattered and a rock splinter had driven through the ships hull through my right arm through cubes forsythe i usually just say a meteor got me but it was our own meteor she wanted me to show her my imaginary arm in lunar gravity it was possible to heft the weight of the glass now that it was nearly empty she told me about life with itch he was savagely jealous and an inconsiderate lover and he slept with women who looked like genetic failures next to naomi herself he had the fragile ego of any halfsuccessful comic so why did you many him she shrugged i spoke before i thought did you like him being jealous maybe it kept other men at just the right distance i didnt like being slapped around for it i was looking for a change of subject when she added when i was climbing out of that bathroom window i swore id never let a man father a child on me again that was even before i knew miranda was dead its a big thing to give up for an instant her look was wary secretive then maybe im a loser in the evolution game you dont have children yourself do you not yet are you out of the evolution game not yet i hefted my empty glass in my imaginary hand every so often someone almost kills me maybe maybe its time naomi got up so energetically that for a moment she floated futz this lets see whats for dinner there were subjects she shied away from i told taffy she was working on my shoulders thats not surprising granted the organ banks penzler getting shot at and children she chopped that off fast and thats not surprising either i guess gil you didnt gril her did you no but id flinched guilt i only noticed thing i think she lied on the stand i know she did but why shed have had to be crazy yeah i asked her why she came back to the moon she said she was in a black mood and the lifelessness of the moon suited her fine but she only went out that once hovestraydt city isnt lifeless at all and she wasnt staying in her room all that time either so i didnt have an answer taffy said ill be leaving for mare orientale this evening marxgrad wants a futz a surgeon with specially training in the autonomic muscle system i can learn a lot there im sorry gil futz im just glad you didnt go yesterday ill get drunk with harry turn over do you want to go to sleep here i dont know what i want i thought i didnt want to talk the lights dimmed i barely noticed they brightened again half a minute later and suddenly i was sitting upright bugeyed sweating taffy said the linear accelerator yes shes on her way when luke garner was a boy that flicker would have been the electric chair the what skip it lie down she went to work on my abdomen i dont see why youre quite this shook up i had the idea she never even slept with you no well once when about two this morning id been a little startled when naomi raised the subject id have thought sex would be the last thing on your mind but its our last chance unless you wait six months and then buy the appropriate she stopped horrified not funny i said no im sorry maybe youd rather just be held cuddled no she was out of her dress in an instant i plucked it out of the wind on its way to the air circulation unit then i turned to look at her i had never seen her naked before it took my breath away i caught myself thinking where were you ten years ago when i needed you and was ashamed she opened a drawer in the bed table and took out a tube of jell she was frigid she was expecting to be frigid she kept that tube very handy this was normal to naomi i couldnt bring her to climax she faked it very nicely and didnt i owe something to the gil hamilton often years ago wouldnt he have given up a testicle for this night i made myself enjoy it i moved from love into massage taffy had taught me massage both sensual and therapeutic i managed to relax her a little naomi was on her back staring at the ceiling while i worked on her hands when she said id love to have another baby but you said never mind what i said suddenly she was enraged i turned her over and went back to work till i had her relaxed again we made love or i did she couldnt concentrate i didnt try again i told her stories from my time in the belt she talked about her days in college she asked about my life as an arm and cut me off when i spoke the word organlegger and she kept glancing at the clock what time is it oheightten taffy said time to go to the conference youre a basket case ill call them and tell them youll make the afternoon session oh no let me make that call my reputation i got up then put some clothes on too she said sharply i got bertha carmody worse luck and told her the situation i sat down on the bed and flopped back and found my head in tallys lap i halfwoke when a pillow was substituted for the lap then taffys phone was saying time to wake up ms grimes its twelve hundred time to wake up i called it off but it wouldnt obey my voice i swore and rolled off the bed i should have smashed the phone instead or else i should have made the morning session the other crime the morning session that fourth day of the conference was when they started getting specific about lunar laws naomi or no naomi i should have been there by the time carmody called the afternoon session to order all i could do was listen and learn what the fighting was about item death penalties on the moon included murder attempted murder manslaughter rape armed theft theft involving betrayal of trust and assault a similar arm list would have included far more minor crimes but what constituted assault we ran that around for a good hour armed theft and rape were covered by other laws what about a simple brawl to belters a barroom brawl classed as recreation corey metchikov from mare moscoviense explained that lunies were more fragile than belters or flatlanders and their longer reach gave a fighter extra leverage a brawl among lunies was likely to be lethal he claimed marion shaeffer expressed doubt that a lunie had the muscle to hurt even a lunie bertha carmody offered to indian wrestle marion accepted we moved some chairs they looked ridiculous marion wasnt even shoulder high to bertha bertha turned marion in a complete cartwheel and it was done purely by leverage stone repeated an earlier demand for a legal definition of rape that started an uproar there were statutory penalties to protect minors and the marriage bond and four outnumbered lunies looked ready for murder or war to preserve them to budrys and shaeffer and quifting such laws added up to murder plus invasion of privacy i could see their point but we were not here to start a war i was glad when we got off that subject manslaughter on the moon that covered a variety of sins sabotage criminal carelessness arson any act which by damaging a local life support system said marion shaeffer could have caused deaths or injuries is that right essentially correct said ward that goes a little far said marion wed execute someone who botched repairs on an air recycler if someone died for it but if nobody actually gets hurt why not just assess him for damages ward was on his feet by now towering over the seated goldskin you go a little far yourself he told her twenty years ago the moon became the execution grounds for every planet moon and rock in the solar system barring earth itself we allowed that it was a needed source of income but we will tolerate only limited meddling in our affairs beyond that you may kill your own or ship them to earth bertha carmody broke the angry silence were all here to make that step unnecessary the last conference left us with a considerable expense in research and construction and maintenance the holding tanks have cost us well over three billion un marks to date we dont want to eat the cost agreed we looked at each other at least nobody disagreed your suggestions ms shaeffer marion looked uncomfortable ill make it a motion alter the law fines for accidental damage to equipment unless the damage causes death or injury anyone who ruins something vital when he cant pay the damage gets broken up we can live with that and ill move to table the motion till we work up a proposed program of changes that passed jabez stone had some details on the holding tanks and wanted them read into the record in particular there had been a power failure at copernicus in four belt criminals had had to be broken up at once and almost half the organs had been lost there are safeguards now ward told us it couldnt happen again remember holding tank technology was somewhat primitive twenty years ago we were made responsible for developing it thats reassuring but it wasnt what i was getting at shouldnt those felons have been revived they were too badly damaged only organs could be saved ward told him it bothers me said stone never a reversal of sentence either this is an admirable record stone for gods sake should we have convicted some innocent just to satisfy you by reviving him can you name one single sentence which should have been reversed stone said case of hovestraydt city vs matheson co its in the city computer memory and everybody groaned if what i needed was something to take my mind off naomi then for four days i got my wish days we spent arguing we spent a full day on hovestraydt city vs matheson co not to mention the night i spent reviewing the case allegedly the companys carelessness had contributed to the blowout of two matheson co employees had gone to the organ banks penzler and i got metchikov to admit in private that they might have been scapegoats that the case should have been reviewed after the hysteria died down publicly forget it late afternoons i watched the news steeping myself in lunar culture was worth a try but the lunie commentators didnt make it easy they used unfamiliar slang they gave excessive detail they droned evening i met with stone and budrys to discuss policy the belters clearly saw their right nay their duly to make the lunar law more humanitarian the moon didnt see it that way i made a long phone call to luke garner for instructions all i could get out of him was that the arm would support any decision i made so i backed budrys and stone to us the lunar law had its peculiarities but it wasnt unduly harsh cultures are entitled to their varietyan attitude youd expect from a club whose members have been battling with words and weapons and economic pressures for close to two hundred years the drive that spread mankind through the solar system should have given belters the same attitude and i said so during a morning session it fell flat chris penzler spoke to me afterward he wasnt moving like a cripple any more and some of the foam had sloughed off his chest leaving bare pink skin bordered by thick black hair he was a lot more cheerful now kansas boy you didnt see variety in the belt you saw customs different from kansas customs what would happen to a belt woman who wanted to raise her children in free fall how do belters treat a miner who neglects his equipment or a naderite he patted the crown of his head where what remained of his belter crest started we all cut our hair the same way doesnt that tell you something it should i admitted we committee members were all politicians of a sort arent we natural meddlers but what if the un was meddling with belt law he laughed i dont have to wonder about that too right you dont it happened and you seceded from earth how do you feel about arm law he told me what i already knew the laws of earth made us not much better than organleggers i said why dont you do something about it how yeah you dont have the power to pressure earth but you think youve got the lunar economy by the throat gil i push where i think something will give the moon might be stronger than you think or more determined you could win a war if it comes to that but will you like yourselves afterward and can you keep the un neutral belt ships using asteroids as missiles we wouldnt like that this close to earth these casual conversations were getting to be more important than the sessions we took to adjourning in midafternoon we formed dinner triads a lunie a belter and a flatlander meeting to seek compromise while full bellies made us mellow for some of us it worked some got indigestion a nightmare started me off again that fourth day with three hours to go before dinner with charles ward and hildegarde quifting i had gone to my room and flopped on the bed to watch the news i remember this item mary de santa rita lisboa the brazilian planetologist was doing some excavating south of tycho early that morning she had waded into a dust pool to place some equipment her feet grew cold then numb she grew frightened almost too late by the time she reached the edge her legs were frozen to the knees before help reached her she had fallen hard enough to break ribs and rip a pinhole leak in her suit ten minutes passed before she recognised the pain in her ears for what it was she had slapped a patch on the gash and kept going on frozen legs with both ears and one lung ruined by decompression a basically interesting tale yes but what i remember is the patronizing tone as if nothing above the level of a plains ape would have done such a damnfool thing the rest of the news was local and dull presently it put me to sleep i shouldnt sleep in the afternoon wandering through a dark blurred forest i found naomi asleep in an ornate twentieth century coffin the kind with a mattress i knew just how to wake her i approached her coffin bed bent and kissed her she fell apart i tried to put her together with my hands and woke with questions chasing each other through my head why would anyone lie herself into the organ banks it was her own business i told myself shed made that clear but what could she be hiding that would be worth that another crime she had phoned me my first night on the moon why not because she was eager to see me again she knew i was an arm was she checking up on me to see what i suspected she had claimed to be exploring the badlands west of the city call that her alibi alibi for what where could she have gone in four hours on foot i was hooked in my copious free time with ten minutes to go before a dinner session with charles ward and hildegarde quifting i tried to call laura drury her phone told me that she was asleep please call back after tomorrow my answer wasnt recorded i hope late that night i summoned up a map of the city environs and spent some time studying it i called laura again after the next days morning session laura was in uniform but she hadnt left her room i said i cant stand the suspense any more did naomi in fact reach a holding tank she blinked of course is this of your own knowledge i havent seen her lying in the tank no id have heard if there was an escape she studied my image it wasnt just casual sex was it i left earth to mine the asteroids because naomi married someone else im sorry we tend to think i mean i know flatlanders are easy have you got a minute to talk gil why dont you stop tormenting yourself i got to wondering naomi was a computer programmer it was one point against her the jury assumed she could have got to the message lasers without leaving a record in the computer do you believe that i dont know how good she was do you no i got to wondering if a computer programmer that good could steal a puffer again withno records she sat down to think presently she nodded anyone that good could have stolen a puffer too no wonder you didnt find the weapon okay though that wasnt exactly what i was after hold it with a puffer she could have reached the belt trading post she could have taken a ship out gil wed have found her anyway but at least she would have had a chance why would she come back yeah youre right it was just a thought thanks i called the phone off and her puzzled frown vanished then i started laughing some alibi and perfectly genuine too naomi could have been committing an entirely different crime at the belt trading post i was going to have to walk softly i would have to find chriss failed killer without showing the lunie police where naomi actually was i was stripping for a bath when laura called me back that evening i said chiron voice only hi laura im glad you called has anything unusual happened lately at the belt trading post nothing ive heard about and there werent any puffers missing that night what how sure are you mesenchev was on duty he says there were no puffers checked out and no slots no computer program could keep him from noticing one empty slot and is that finally the end of the naomi mitchison case yes and if it isnt ill at least quit bugging you ive done too much of that she studied me thoughtfully no she must have been studying a blank screen shed better because i was just climbing into the tub she said did i louse up a voiceonly command a few days ago eeeyess i wasnt about to be the one to tell you well youre a gentleman she said and called off leaving me bemused what did lunies consider a gentleman no puffers missing futz while water and air bubbles churned around me i called up the map again and traced the trade road west roads branched off to the waterandoxygen works to the abandoned metal mines to a linear accelerator project that had gone bankrupt i was back to assuming naomi was on foot could she have met someone somewhere within reach the air works required sunlight at night they might be deserted or what about the old strip mine the screen blinked and laura drury glared out of it now what are you doing with that map again watery amoebae left the tub with the force of my flinch hey are you sure thats your business and how do you break into a computer display without permission anyway i knew how to do that when i was ten gil will you give up on her maybe she wasnt out there when penzler got shot maybe she researched it somehow gil if she wasnt shooting at penzler she must have been committing an organ bank crime somewhere else you saw that huh i went to the wrong person well if you must know i cant leave puzzles alone long silence then want help not from a cop if you found a crime youd have to report it she nodded reluctantly hey why did you call me a gentleman well you didnt if a lunie saw a a person naked on his phone screen she stopped hed crawl out of the screen at you drooling and leering hed think it was an invitation she was blushing darkly oh hahaha no if a lady wants to give me an invitation i expect her to say so flatlanders dont hint i stood up especially on the moon i was told never to make advances to a lunie i started scraping the halfinch of water off me with the edges of my hands then i saw her eyes bugging have you got vision she was stricken caught serve you right i reached for a towel i used it on my hair concealing my grin concealing nothing else why shouldnt a lunie be curious and shed given me the same privilege inadvertently gil yeah it was an invitation i looked at her over the towel her lids were lowered and her blush was darker yet okay come on up okay it took her forty minutes she might have been changing her mind over and over again she arrived still in uniform carrying a briefcase id put clothes on in case anyone was in the hall even so she looked everywhere but at me nervous her eye caught the phone display she studied the map on foot for four hours well what was she doing for four hours its like this i said if naomi wasnt out there shooting at chris penzler then someone else was wed both like to find him right because were cops but youre a cop so i cant tell you what i think naomi was doing she sat down stiffly on the edge of the bed say she met someone maybe a man who works at the air works married would she protect him i had to laugh naomi with her life no anyway what kind of assignation is that as soon as they take off their clothes poof explosive decompression laura how do i go about relaxing you she smiled flickeringly talk to me this is unusual for me you can change your mind at any second just say the word the word is halogens thanks then you have to list them a short silence which i had to break if she wasnt out there it makes her useless as a witness doesnt it what she swore she didnt see doesnt count and chris said there could have been an army out there hiding in the shadows he wasnt even sure he saw a human being she turned to look at me that leaves your testimony in my mind i flexed my imaginary hand remembering the feel of miniature moonscape there wasnt anyone out there by the time i looked laura what about mirrors the laser could have been somewhere else and the killer too but there wasnt any mirror either i wasnt looking for one wed have found it it was impossible i scowled at the map i wanted to ignore the facts and just start toting up suspects according to motive what stopped me was my first suspect any lunie angry enough about our meddling in lunar affairs and clever enough to have worked some kind of trickery laura picked up her case and went into the water closet i was having trouble keeping my priorities straight first i hadnt touched a woman in several days second i didnt want laura hurt damaged or embarrassed third my own part in the conference could be endangered fourth i wanted laura drury in my bed and that was part lust part spirit of adventure how to reconcile all that hold it down to talk for now let her list her own priorities on her own time she came out wearing a garment the likes of which id never seen before it was sexy and strange floor length shoulderless and not quite opaque the thin creamcolored fabric hugged her body by static electricity it could almost have been a dress but it looked too fragilethere was a lot of laceand much too thin to hold heat what is it she laughed its a nightgown quite suddenly she came into my arms i found myself standing fully upright and nuzzling her throat the garment was nicely tactile silky smooth over warm skin i felt her goosebumps through it whats it for its to sleep in for now i guess its to take off carefully or do i rip it off jesus carefully gil its expensive lunie customs sooner or later theyd get me a sensible man wouldnt have invited a lunie to his room i knew it and didnt care the trading post it was amazing how good we felt on a couple of hours sleep laura was glowing she kept picking me up in her arms rhett butler style shed jump when i goosed her then steady herself with a hand on my head and let me lift her onehanded i played tricks with my imaginary arm we went formal and cautious when it came time to leave i left first desiree porter and tom reinecke were coming down the hall they hailed me and swept me up and tried to pump me for news on the conference i sidestepped what have you two been doing all this time just waiting for one of us to crack tom said there was penzler there was the trial weve been interviewing lunies too you know a lot of them arent going to be happy no matter what you do and we screw a lot desiree said that i kind of assumed hey did you two know each other before you got here nope it was just one of those thing lust at first sight i think its his legs i like best belt men have their muscles mainly in the arms and shoulders so you only love me for my legs huh and your mind didnt i mention your mind we had reached the elevators i started to step in then told them id left something in my room which was true enough now the hall was empty i called the door open laura joined me and we went down to breakfast we werent even holding hands but our hands brushed sometimes and laura kept suppressing a smile and i wondered just how much we were hiding for that matter id seen reineckes oddly sardonic smile as the elevator doors closed at breakfast i told laura i wanted to check out a puffer she didnt like it isnt there a committee meeting ill skip a day hell this is committee business if the courts have convicted an innocent person she shrugged angrily if she didnt try to murder penzler then she was doing something else the idea percolated through to me that as a man newly in love i was supposed to forget old loves entirely laura didnt want to hear that i still hoped to save naomi mitchison i sidestepped again i left a case half solved once i said and i told her how raymond sinclairs surrealistic death scene was linked to two organleggers found with their faces burned down to the bone i had nearly reached the morgue in the same condition maybe she bought it she did help me check out a puffer the puffers were racked along one wall of the mirror works today there were several gaps the only difference between the orange city police puffers and the rentals was that the rentals came in all colors i chose a police puffer it was a lowslung motorcycle with a wide padded bucket seat and a cargo framework behind there were three tanks the motor had no intake an exhaust pipe forked to left and right just under the seat the shock absorbers were huge and the tires were great fat soft tubes laura showed me how to get it going and tried to tell me how to run it how to maneuver how to steer where not to steer i could cross a dust pool she told me like a bat out of hell and if you slow down youll turn over and if the wheel hits a submerged rock youll be under the dust trying to figure out which way is up you stay away from dust pools dont hit any rocks if you fall get your arms over your helmet ill stick to the road i said thats safe isnt it i guess so she was reluctant to admit that anything was safe why are there three tanks oxygen hydrogen water vapor we dont throw away water gil the exhaust is just a safety valve and of course it powers the side jets you shouldnt have to use them but do it if you think youre falling over i climbed on i could barely feel the vibration it isnt puffing i noticed its not supposed to if it starts puffing steam somethings wrong thats why theyre called puffers if it happens slow way down and check your air because you may have to walk home she insisted on showing me how to bleed oxygen from the puffer tank into my backpack have you got all that yup keep it slow till you learn how to steer this is the moon youll have to lean further than you think okay i dont get off till will you be back by then im bound to we clinked helmets in lieu of a kiss and i went from the citys east face the mirror works the trade road hooked around and aimed straight west i bounced along at a fair rate for an offroad vehicle i marked the tilted rock far off to my left and a road that wound uphill to my right up to the air and water plant i had seen it from a height miniaturized in the projection room mirrors mounted around the rim of a fairsized recent crater focussing their light down onto a pressure vessel filled with redhot lunar rock pipes to lead hydrogen in water vapor out i was tempted to go up and look at the real thing maybe on the way back to my left was the land naomi had tried to lead us through and the peak naomi had tried to climb i kept going the road twisted like an injured snake a broad road led left toward the strip mines that had made hovestraydt city rich when they played out the city had turned to mirror making naomi wasnt a native to meet someone out here she would need some obvious landmark the same would hold if someone had simply left a puffer parked somewhere for her the mines she couldnt get last witnesses were unlikely and the tailings might fool radar for a small vehicle shed led us a merry dance the day after the attack on chris penzler alan watson must have given her what she needed when he showed her the projection room and shed danced her way right into the organ banks to hide what or else the jury was right presently i was bouncing downhill beyond the region id searched with my imaginary hand beyond anywhere naomi could have reached on foot far ahead was a line of silver the mass driver built to supply ore for the l project of the s the company had gone bankrupt and the mass driver was half built and long obsolete i kept checking my watch there was the trading post ahead unused to picking out details in moonscape my eyes had been missing it for some time i found the shapes of two spacecraft first then the outline of the spaceport then the crescent of stoneandglass building around it the road became a circle between the building and the spaceport i had made the run in just thirtyfive minutes the trading post was strange by anyones standards there was no dome oblong buildings were individually pressurized sometimes they were linked by tunnels in selenes bar and grill where i stopped for lunch i found racks for fishbowl helmets but none for pressure suits the customers kept their credit coins in outside pockets selenes bar and grill mare serenitatis spa the man in the moon hotel aphrodites all the place names were moonrelated half the people i saw were lunies aphrodites rented sexual favors the waitress at selenes told me it catered specifically to lunies i was a little shocked the administration building was all the way around the circle it was big enough to get lost in the police licensing and port administration were scattered through the building i finally found the goldskin offices arm business i told the only clerk in sight he was watching a foldup d screen propped in front of him he didnt look up yah last wednesday someone shot a belt delegate to the conference on now he looked up we heard about that didnt they solve that one i heard look theres a possibility that our suspect was here at the time that would mean she wasnt shooting at penzler we never found the weapon either that adds up to a would be killer with a message laser still hunting a belt delegate see your point what do you need were there any crimes committed here between tuesday and wednesday naomi would have had to walk to where someone left a puffer for her then drive here at least half an hour coming and half an hour back later id have to pace it off on foot he set aside his foldup screen and tapped at a computer keyboard the screen lit mmm we had a fight at aphrodites about that time a lunie dead two belters and a lunie under arrest all male but youre looking for something premeditated right zip futz how about disappearances he summoned up the missing persons records nobody had been reported missing since wednesday it seemed that naomi had not been committing a crime of violence how well do you keep track of your puffers theyre licensed generally the residents own their own he was typing as he spoke the screen filled these are rentals chili bird the name rang a bell two puffers charged to the chili bird account for two days well thats reasonable antsie had passengers tell me more he scowledi was inventing work for him and he would have preferred not tobut he typed and more data appeared antsie de campo owner and pilot of chili bird out of vesta arrived april left april passengers dr raymond forward and a fouryearold girl ruth hancock cowles cargo he had a light load monopoles he took off with some chicken and turkey embryos maybe thats why the doctor was along april was the day after the attempt on penzler where are they now headed for confinement asteroid probably because of the little girl he typed i remember her now she was a doll interested in everything she loved low gravity she was bouncing around the screen responded chili birds almost to confinement now is this any use to you i hope so where can i send a message to chili bird he told me how to find interplanetary voice on a peak outside the city circle there would have been several minutes lightspeed delay m conversation i sent a straight gram to dr raymond forward naomi mitchison tried and convicfed for attempted murder commitied hovestraydt city wednesday april execution pending if you know of her movements during relevant time call merovestraydt city gilbert hamilton arm i didnt stop on the way home i couldnt guess where someone might have left a puffer for naomi maybe i had already wasted time i couldnt afford i felt times hot breath on the back of my neck an unreasonable conviction that naomi didnt have months but only hours mccavity hailed me in the hail hello gil the offers still open he said offer someone to get drunk with oh i may need it yet let me buy you a drink now i havent seen a bar there arent any we tend to keep our own supplies and drink in our rooms come on ive got a good stock mccavitys quarters were near the bottom level of the city he didnt have any kind of bartending device the drinks were going to be simple he offered me something he called earthshine poured over ice and i took it smooth distilling is dirt cheap here harry said heat cold partial vacuum theyre all just outside the wall do you like it yeah it tastes like a good bourbon i got a call from taffy she reached marxgrad okay she says she left you a message too good i gather you got together okay yes thank god i was a basket case she reassembled me i sipped again i wish i had the time to get drunk in good company it might be just what i need harry do you know of a belt doctor a raymond forward mccavity scratched his head rings a bell yeah hes got some lunie clients specialist in fertility problems futz naomi didnt suffer from infertility he was on the moon for a few days maybe he had a lunie client thered be records we dont have restrictions on fertility except the natural ones okay i can check that out whats it all about he was here at the right time and he came in with a light cargo maybe there were ulterior motives right time for what naomi maybe im going at this wrong end round i should be looking for whoever shot at chris penzler but if naomi wasnt where she said she was well its one handle on a puzzle i can track that down she could have been meeting someone maybe antsie de campo maybe forward could there be two raymond forwards both belt doctors well its possible he sipped at his own drink was naomi infertile she was fertile shed also sworn never to have another kid then thats out by another man what she swore shed never have children by another man this forward he solves infertility problems right youve got something dont you cloning if all else fails he can grow a clone for a patient its hellishly expensive can i borrow your phone ill call for you what number i told him artemus boone stood frowning in the doorway of his office i was just closing up i can meet you tomorrow at unless its urgent it feels urgent i told the phone image do you still regard naomi mitchison as your client certainly i need to discuss her case confidentially he sighed come to my office ill wait i turned to harry mccavity thanks for the drink ill be pleased to get drunk with you when this is all over but just now he waved that off will i ever know what this was all about theres more than one kind of crime i said cryptically and left artemus boone sat behind his ancient lovingly maintained computer terminal and propped his beard on his folded hands now whats this all about mr hamilton i want a legal opinion on a hypothetical situation go on a flatlander woman hires a belt doctor to take a clone from her and grow it to term the operation takes place on the moon the woman returns to earth the child is raised in the asteroids four years later they meet again on the moon the woman is still on the moon when it all becomes public knowledge boone stared as if id sprouted horns damnation sure now the united nations fertility laws would have our hypothetical flatlander woman sterilized if she had an illegal baby theyd sterilize the baby too but this particular woman still has one birthright so she could have a baby with no problem but what about a clone boone shook his head he was still thunderstruck i dont know my field is lunar law would the un try to extradite the woman would the moon let them get away with it would they try to extradite the baby too or are they both safe because the crime took place off earth again i dont know id want research this in some legal respects the moon is part of the united nations damnation why didnt she discuss this with me she could have been scared to she never mentioned any such situation he smiled like a man in pain never damnation im nearly certain that the baby could not be extradited if only shed asked hamilton is our hypothetical baby still on the moon no good he stood up abruptly ill be able to give you a better answer tomorrow call me i reached my room expecting to spend some time on the phone getting budrys to tell me what went on at the conference could take up to an hour i wanted to check dr forwards credentials and recent movements and taffys message was waiting i dropped onto the bed and pulled my shoes off and said chiron messages and laura drurys image in full pressure suit said gil youll have to have dinner without me im going out with a search party i dont know when ill be back chris penzlers turned up missing the tilted rock i wasted a few seconds cursing the urgency id felt hadnt been for naomi mitchison naomi was feeling no impatience death had been hunting chris penzler i called lauras room and got no answer i called the police and got jefferson he left about sixteen twenty this afternoon the freckled lunie told me he checked out a puffer i said idiot right how well do you know him could he think hes playing detective why not somebody wanis him dead and it bothers him hes not likely to be out there playing tourist well thats what i thought jefferson said i sent a search party west to the area where penzler testified he saw something laura drurys with them in case you were wondering a trace of disapproval in his voice what the futz but they havent found him and theyve been out over an hour set the area up in the projection room and search that we have got to have another watchbird satellite jefferson said there used to be three the replacement keeps getting proxmired in the budget hearing hamilton weve been waiting for the watchbird one to rise why dont you meet me down in the projection room good tom reinecke and desiree porter were waiting outside the projection room theyd heard chris penzler was missing jefferson wanted to tell them to go to hell until i said we can use some extra eyes yet again we waded out into the hologram knee deep in miniature moonscape jefferson and reinecke and i fanned out into the choppy lands west of the rim wall and the city porter searched the crater itself because nobody else had partly to honor her theory i stopped at the tilted rock jeffrrson and tom reinecke kept going they glanced back at me then resumed their search by eye alone three to four hundred yards from the west wall of the city i looked around the tilted rock was small enough to heft in both arms except that it wouldnt have moved of course i saw tiny orange suits with bubble helmets scattered over the rocks to my west i called what kind of suit would chris be wearing blue skintight with a gold and bronze griffon on the chest jefferson called back there were annoying blank spots in the landscape where the watchbirds cameras werent reaching i tried to feel around in them but my talent wasnt up to that i felt nothing i found no blue skintight suits vertical or horizontal where reinecke and jefferson were searching bright orange puffers were parked in a ring on flat ground none in my area there was a deep dust pool twenty yards south of the tilted rock the surface looked roiled i ran my imaginary hand beneath the surface and flinched violently then i made myself touch it again i called ive found the puffer its under the dust one and all they abandoned their own search desiree reached me first they watched while i let go of the puffer and searched further i found it almost at once i said god desiree said what penzler i closed my hand around it it felt light and dry like a dead lizard left in the sun somebody a suit with somebody inside i made my imaginary fingertips follow the contours of the thing though there was nothing less i wanted in the world god his hand is gone my hand stopped sending my talent had quit imaginary hand hell its my mind my unprotected mind that feels out the textures of what i touch i can only take so much of that well have to check this out jefferson said use your belt phone send the search party that way tell them well join them as soon as we can it took almost an hour i was twitchy with impatience when we finally set forth our team included jefferson both newstapers dredging machinery and a couple of orangeclad operators the earth was a broad crescent not quite half full the sun was well up the sky leaving fewer shadows but these were impenetrably black our headlamps didnt help our bubble helmets had darkened and our eyes had adjusted to lunar day the dozen cops on the original search team were already waiting at the dust pool laura drury bounced up to me do you really think hes down there i felt him i said she grimaced sorry well we found this it was just under the dust just at the edge she held an elastic strap with a buckle the kind that locks when you pull it fight we use them on puffers to hold small stuff on the frame behind the seat does it mean anything to you not a thing i said maybe the killer dumped the body in the dust laura speculated and then found the strap he just stuck it under the dust with his band that would mean he was in a hurry i thought it would also mean the strap was evidence of something otherwise hed have just kept it jefferson called laura and she waved and went i noticed alan watson by his height while the cops were getting the equipment ready alan and i adjusted our radios for privacy ive got news i said maybe good maybe bad about naomi right she wasnt here when someone shot penzler in his bath she wasnt anywhere near here she was at the belt trading post then shes innocent but why wouldnt she say so she thought she was committing an organ bank crime alans face twisted that isnt a whole lot of help the dredge moved into the dust sinking the dust was deep id felt it it could help i said we have to prove that someone else tried to shoot chris without showing what naomi was actually doing then we could get her revived by god we could if thats penzler down there then the original assassin got him maybe not his methods seem to have turned crude wed still want to show how he could fire a laser at chris penzlers window from out here and then get back into the city or wherever he did go and why i didnt find him in the projection room and after all that might not even be penzlers body all i know is theres someone down there um what id rather do is show that what naomi was doing wasnt an organ bank crime she shouldve discussed it with her lawyer what i think she the dredge came out of the dust and i dropped the conversation and loped over the corpse wore a blue skintight suit the right hand had been sliced off cleanly four inches above the wrist the face seemed shrunken but i would have recognised him even without the torso painting the bonnie dalzell griffon clutching earth in its claw i opened my radio band and announced its chris penzler jefferson examined the severed forearm clean cut message laser on high he said the beam must have sliced right through if there was rock behind him well find the marks he set some of the cops to searching we didnt bother to look for bootprints the search party had left too many but they hadnt left puller tracks we found a set of puffer tracks and followed them backward from the pool until they disappeared on bare rock someone behind us announced that he had found the hand jefferson went back i didnt those tracks could lead from the general direction of the tilted boulder six nights ago chris penzler had glimpsed someone through his picture window only for an instant and afterward he couldnt decide which side of this particular boulder hed been looking past maybe hed come out to see the flat side of the rock was in deep shadow i stepped close to the rock out of the sun and waited for my darkened helmet to clear again and my eyes to adjust then i played my headlamp over the rock my yell brought them running they clustered around me to look at chris penzlers dying message big malformed letters scrawled across the rock black in the light of the headlamps nakf he must have written it in his own bloodjefferson said in shadow so the killer wouldnt notice he must have been jetting blood from the severed artery but that isnt a name is it desiree said it isnt anything i think the strap laura cried in the joyful tones that go with the eureka sensation the strap he must have used it for a tourniquet he must have known he was dyingmaybe he had to hide from the killer her voice dropped its awful isnt it take a scraping of that blood jefferson ordered at least well find out if it was penzlers he must have had something in mind i got back to my room around midnight i set it up on my phone screen nakf so heres chris penzler out there on the meteortorn moon looking for clues maybe he remembers something maybe he finds something maybe not but a killer finds him a lunie citizen would be more likely to know it when chris penzler checked out a puffer assume he followed immediately on foot unless he was an idiot id ask the computer if someone checked out a puller right after chris did some killers are idiots if christ had recognised his killer hed have written a name id get the computer to search the city directory offhand i didnt know anyone on the moon whose name started with nakf or withi started filling in letters written in haste in jetting blood and possibly in darkness a k could be a ruined r f could be e n could be m or w narf nake nare makf make mare wakf wake ware no names sprang to mind and chris wasnt a lunie here on the moon i knew everyone he did nakf naomi it was a bad fit and naomi had one hell of an alibi i should be able to persuade the lunar law to disgorge her on the strength of penzlers murder if there were indeed two killers after chriss bloodnaomi the clumsy one somebody else the skillful or lucky or more straightforward one naomi could be returned to the holding tank i called chiron phone get me alan watson and my nasty suspicious mind gave me nakf alan watson wats alan was out on the moon at the time in the search party looking for chris penzler himself so maybe he found him how much would alan do for naomi would he murder a stranger who had done her harm if it would buy her life alans long blackbrowed lace appeared on the phone screen he was easier to take his height didnt show hello gil an n could be a w with the first vertical botched but an f could not be a botched s i decided i said i wondered if we can get naomi out of copernicus now ive already filed with the court all we can do now is wait i expect theyll revive her but it would help if we could tell them where she actually was gil where was she i should know that within a few hours i didnt add that i might not tell him then assume chris didnt recognise his killer he couldnt give us a name if all he saw was a pressure suit short medium or lunie inflated or skintight chris hadnt bothered to tell us could he have had something more specific in mind like a torso painting lunch was a long time in the past i had seen corpses uglier than chris penzlers maybe i could have done something to save his life but i still had no idea what it might be i phoned down for a chickenandonion sandwich then i put the display back on the phone screen and stared at it he must have known he was dying hed have kept it short unless i was overlooking some significance to nakf he had still run out of tithe or blood try nake then snake but if i made the f an unfinished e then he wasnt writing backward and why should he so try nakf naked for a torso painting that wouldnt help much naked ladies were very popular as torso painting in the belt at least try something else picture a vindictive dedicated killer tracking chris across the moon bareassed but for his trusty laser taking his vengeance just before internal pressure rips him apart in a gust of cold scarlet fog no then how about a vehicle with a transparent bubble cockpit park it in shadow with the cockpit lights on and chris would see only the killer but i didnt know of any such vehicle a custom job and it would have shown on radar if it flew would have left tracks if it didnt i tried some other words my door announcer said gil are you there its laura chiron door open shed showered away the sweat secretions that accumulate on your skin when youre in a pressure suit i hadnt suddenly i felt grimy she said weve made a little progress i thought youd want to know what have you got she sat down on the bed beside me comfortably close nobody checked out a puffer after penzler did not till the search party went out that puts our killer on foot it would slow him down maybe maybe he can get a puffer without leaving a computer record wouldnt he have to do that to get at the lasers or if he was a cop with the search party that would get him the puller and the laser too she scowled skip it what have you got on the body harry mccavitys doing an autopsy outside the mirror works the condition of the body well its freezedried harry got positively nasty when i wanted a time of death and the tanks bled empty within half an hour and his watch didnt conveniently stop either laura can i ask you some questions about lunar customs she looked down at me go ahead i already know that people here are supposed to share a bed only when theyre married to each other what i want to know is if two unmarried people did share a bed would they be expected to share a bed only with each other her voice turned brittle and she sat very straight on the bed what started you on this ive been getting some funny vibrations i didnt name jefferson yes well i havent been bragging about the short strong fellow i managed to entrap if thats what youre thinking i dont know how anyone would know about us maybe lunies tend to know each other better than flatlanders do smaller population smaller cities and there is such a thing as telepathy and laura had been smiling and sparkling as we left her apartment this morning someone might have noticed what is it you want to know should you resume your relationship with dr grimes did you think you needed my permission i think there are five lunies i dont want to offend i said you and four committee delegates from four lunar cities if you and i are now supposed to be monogamous i want to know it i came to the moon largely because taffy was here should i now stop seeing taffy in private or at all come on give me some help if the committee is too busy fighting to make decisions everybody loses she screwed her eyes almost shut this is all new to me let me think pause i want you for myself is that immoral depends on where you are silly but true i am flattered all right stop seeing her in public by now she was on her feet and pacing like a tiger even in the halls in private make sure its private no phone calls no room service breakfast for two taffys gone to marxgrad what shes got her own career to pursue now shes pursued it to the back of the moon but i had to know these things for future reference laura are you angry she looked at me she turned to the door i said remember im likely to believe anything you tell me call me ignorant are you angry shall we avoid each other from now on she turned back im angry i made the same mistake anyone else would have i want you back in my bed as soon as i get over this she swung around to the door and back again hesitated finally she dropped back on the bed just behind my shoulder it wasnt me that had stopped her i think it was the display nakf narf nake nare makf make mare wakf wake ware nakf naomi nakf wats naked snake snare waken see anything beware i said hed have to add on at both ends that applies to ms and ws too oh i see if he missed a stroke right at the beginning yeah do lunies tend to put nudes in their torso paintings no do lunies use any kind of vehicle with a lot of glass in it a full bubble cockpit do the belters at the trading post i dont think so why naked and now im stuck futz maybe he was trying to describe a torso painting laura said he must have got away from the killer maybe he ducked into the shadows and tied a tourniquet and kept going otherwise its too easy for the killer a second swipe with the laser cuts him in half maybe whats your point he knew hed die when he took the tourniquet off he would have thought it through in detail before he wrote any message she studied the screen she reached past me and typed nakf chemistry sodium potassium flourine what does it mean what do you do with those three elements i dont know gil the door announcer said room service laura yelped in an instant she was behind the door flattened against the wall i stared then i went to the door called it open stepped into the hall and took the tray said thank you good night and closed the door in the bemused waiters face laura exhaled i was trying not to laugh i took a huge bite out of a sandwich and spoke around it i need a bath almost as much as i need food im hoping youll stay im just telling you ill do your back laura said good the empty room i was half awake my mind idling in neutral played word games nakf laura drury desk cop nakf i couldnt make it fit lauras foot was hooked under mine when she tried to turn over i came fully awake i worked my foot free and she rolled just to the edge of the bed nakf drury what the hell was i doing properly horrified i pushed the whole topic way down to the bottom of my mind and left it there but i couldnt get back to sleep i finally moved to the foot of the bed and said chiron low volume chiron messages taffy looked good brisk and happy i like marxgrad she said i like the people im brushing up on my medical russian but everyone speaks enough english for social purposes i miss you mostly at night i hope you havent changed your mind about having children i can find the time starting a year from now we do have a problem neither of us intends to drop his career right and were both subject to emergency calls that could be tough on children another complication i hadnt dealt with yet so think it over the recording said we may want to go into a multiple marriage think about the people we know is there anyone we can both stand to live with for the first oh five to ten years for instance how do lila and jackson bera feel about children do you know think it over and then call me my love to you and harry she said and was gone laura was watching me she started to say something but the next message beat her to it the picture was fuzzy two men and a laughing little blond girl floated in free fall at skew angles the man holding the little girls hand was a rotund cheerful man with thick white hair the other was short and dark and very round of face partly or wholly eskimo i guessed i didnt know any of them i am howard de campo called antsie citizen of vesta the smiling eskimo said you called to be informed of the motions of mrs naomi mitchison during certain hours from tuesday to wednesday the lady in question was in chili bird visiting i and my passenger dr raymond q forward the purpose of the visit is secret but we will tell if necessary of course if you have to know more call us at confinement please the picture blinked out by god you were right laura said i could probably even guess the crime they havent admitted anything i said but the blond blueeyed little girl must have been included deliberately she was naomi at age four laura said love to you and harry no lunie could ever have said that she meant it suppose shed known i was listening would you object to my telling her some day please dont said laura she controlled it well but the idea upset her are you thinking of having children by taffy grimes yes what about us i hadnt thought of that at all i wouldnt be here to act like a father and ill be sterile for another four months anyway would my genes be right i didnt mean never mind she roiled over and came into my arms the rest of our conversation was nonverbal but what had she meant shaeffer and quifting had called ceres to ask that a third belter be chosen and sent to the moon as quickly as possible meanwhile the conference would continue without chris penzler a nervous urgency was apparent while we were still involved with coffee and rolls charles ward tried to assure us before anyone else had suggested the possibility that chris had not been murdered by local terrorists bent on disrupting or exterminating the conference the other lunies were quick to agree sure where were they getting their data just before i phoned the mayors office from the conference mom youve heard about chris penzler yes a very sticky situation gil the mayor was perturbed and it showed were doing all we can of course i imagine this will disrupt the conference well see that might have been the whole idea has naomi mitchison been released from the holding tanks no why not releasing a convict from a holding tank isnt done by a wave of the hand the medical mayor your holding tanks arent that different from the ones on the slowboats the interstellar colony ships crew members go in and out of the holding tanks a dozen times during any trip hoves eyes flicked past my shoulder i glanced back and found that i had an audience several conference members were following our conversation that was all to the good i thought hove was saying you know nothing about the medical complexities furthermore mrs mitchison is a convicted criminal reversal of her sentence will not be accomplished by a wave of the hand either in that case im going to raise some hell i said how do you mean that i said the proceedings of the conference have been confidential so far and should be bertha carmody barked in my ear futz bertha this is at the heart of whats been blocking us all along mayor theres some question as to whether your law gives adequate protection to the defendant trials are over almost before they begin and in twenty years not one sentence has been reversed naomi mitchisons trial is the first to be investigated by outsiders we now have evidence that someone else wanted chris penzler dead all along your son has filed to obtain mrs mitchisons release but when a committee member me checks with the mayor of hovestraydt city it turns out the conviction isnt even under review damn it gil the conviction is under review right now good how long would you expect it to take i have no idea a reversal may have to wait until the new investigation is over fine in the meantime get her out of the holding tank why chriss death may be unrelated to the first attempt granted i wont try to guess the odds ill put it to you that naomi is likely innocent likely is too strong a word and a possible witness aside from that the committee may want to call her to testify firsthand on how shes been treated weve examined exactly two trials under lunar jurisprudence and the other one matheson and company stone put in helpfully yeah that one looks kind of funny too and naomi is still in a holding tank waiting to be broken up how will all of this look to the newstapers bertha roared these proceedings are confidential hamilton how can you think of exposing our deliberations to the news media i said all right bertha ill stick to my opinions on the mitchison case i hope that that will not be necessary the mayor said i intend to order naomi mitchison revived at once she will be returned here under arrest to play her part in the investigation into chris penzlers death is that satisfactory mr hamilton yes thank you i called off the phone and bertha called the meeting to order when we broke for lunch i suited up and headed for the mirror works i found harry mccavity just outside the airlock waiting for it to cycle im beat he said its been a long night morning gil no let me show you something first and then im for bed he led me through the mirror works penzler died from loss of blood he said he was wearing a skinlight suit cutting his hand off didnt release the pressure on his skin but the blood must have jetted like a fire hose he used it to write with drury told me hed have had to write fast penzlers corpse was outside in vacuum under a silvered canopy to keep it cold the dry remains had been sliced to obtain cross sections they looked like petrified wood penzlers skintight pressure suit was next to it opened along the back and spread like a pelt the golden griffon glowed on its chest harry picked up chriss hand a withered brown claw with four inches of wrist attached he held it against the severed forearm what with the shrinking of the flesh it was hard to tell whether they belonged together look at the bones he said the ends of the bones were quite smooth and fitted perfectly and here he picked up the right glove from the pressure suit his hand was in it now look he held it against the sliced fabric of the pressure suits forearm there was almost no material missing the laser had sliced through cleanly at very high energy density and no thicker than a fishing leader even laser beams spread with distance they must have been close together when it happened i said too right penzler and his killer couldnt have been more than three feet apart huh i tried to scratch my head through the helmet harry i dont know what it means yet we went back inside and harry headed for his bed i called artemus boone and got him to join me for lunch we moved down the buffet table collecting dollops and samples of everything in sight the food on boones plate became a precariously balanced cone with a hard boiled pigeons egg at the apex he lowered it to the table slowly with both hands its not bad he told me its only complicated i could argue either way that mrs mitchison is subject only to the lunar law or only to united nations law whichever she likes so united nations law would sterilize her i think she is both the father and mother one could argue that she has used two birthrights sterilization wouldnt stop her from growing another clone so she might not object for the same reason the law might demand the right to execute her but i think i could block that how sure are you not very un law isnt my home turf id rather work within lunar law as for the child she cant be extradited but she should never visit earth whats the position under lunar law lunar law includes nothing like your fertility quotas women who bear children without previous marriage are on their own unless the father sues for his rights well that doesnt apply but de campo and mrs mitchison have violated lunar medical restrictions id think we want to stand trial here then claim double jeopardy before the un shed be safe then up to a point boone coughed delicately the ladys attitude toward men might hamper her popularity with a jury and there is still the matter of an attempted murder charge yeah i need to talk about the murder i said and ive run out of people to talk with have you got some free time some you dont propose to solve both crimes yourself this afternoon do you why not boone smiled why indeed for my defense of mrs mitchison i needed a suspect other than mrs mitchison my main obstacle was your testimony i cant change it there wasnt anyone else out on the moon and no message laser well i keep thinking in terms of mirrors boone i wish to hell i could put a mirror out there that way the killer and the weapon could both be somewhere else boone had been eating talking between mouthfuls he had a voracious appetite for so lean a man he chewed and thought and swallowed and said but the mirror would have to be in place remember how chris acted when we asked him what kind of pressure suit the killer was wearing he sweated he dithered he said he might have seen an optical illusion a terrible experience he might have blocked the memory sure then six days later he left us a dying message do you know about that nakf meaningless ive been assuming he died before he could finish what was he trying to tell us naked on the moon boone smiled naked to vacuum i said chris stood up in his bath and saw someone out on the moon without a pressure suit dont you see he was looking in a mirror but what was he seeing himself no he saw the killer the killer must have been in one of the other apartments poor chris he must have thought he was going crazy no wonder he wouldnt talk about it boone ate quietly for a time then he said mrs mitchison was on the second floor we tend to put outworlders on the ground floor were all the ground floor apartments full this is something we can check but you see the implications the killer is not a native that didnt fit my other assumptions but yeah check those records youve got the authority i will boone smiled now tell me why the mirror wasnt found by the police when they searched for an abandoned message laser what about a mirror in low orbit mirrors dont have to be opaque to radar a plane mirror with the right rotation might give the killer a couple of minutes to pick his shot and we know he was hurried boone snorted ridiculous an orbiting mirror would have had to be large enough for the killer to see penzler and vice versa it would probably have been in sunlight since the assault took place just before dawn anyone could have seen it blazing like a beacon all right its a stupid suggestion but its the best ive got if we can put a disappearing mirror out there weve cleared naomi havent we absolutely i think we have enough to get her out of the holding tank now pending a second trial get together with the mayor i told him i expect hes inclined to be reasonable good boone went back to eating he had nearly finished that huge plate i said a mirror can be a thin film stretched on a frame cant it if the killer was a lunie cop he could just pull it apart and stash it penzler said three hundred to four hundred meters from his window but the mirror would be only half that far hey that tilted rock was a hundred and ninety meters away and everyone else would be searching in the wrong place tilted rock futz yes theres a big boulder out there a hundred and ninety meters from his window chris thought he was looking past it but he couldnt say which side the mirror was probably propped on the rock boones deepset eyes seemed to withdraw further he ate steadily while he thought then very good did you have a particular suspect in mind i knew of a policewoman who had been involved in yesterdays search for chris penzler i knew she had a liking for flatlanders in her love affairs she was possessive in a fashion more typical of lunie than flatland custom she might have involved herself with chris penzler then been rejected by him at least by her own standards she was thoroughly familiar with the hoveslraydt city computer from age ten if naomi could have taken a message laser without leaving a record why not laura drury she could get into an empty apartment the same way a lunie cop could have committed the later successful murder the moon was swarming with them the killer could have joined the swarm before or after the murder given that we didnt have an exact time of death but laura had been at the desk the night penzler was shot in his bath hadnt she when had she come on duty would she have had time to go outside for a folding mirror the killer had been in a hurry that night hamilton sorry yeah ive got suspects but i still dont have a disappearing mirror this isnt courtroom i know keep thinking about the mirror im not a lunie im handicapped i returned to my room after the afternoon session outside my window the dreadful alien light of lunar noon was somewhat softened by filter elements in the window it was still too bright i tried commands on the window until i got it dimmed a bit by now i could have picked out the tilted rock while blind drunk a hundred and ninety yards away chris had seen a human figure three to four hundred meters away past the tilted rock i looked out at the tilted rock and tried to recall the darkness of a week ago when chris penzler had glimpsed what an image in a mirror the distances were close enough one hundred and ninety meters to a mirror on the tilted rock another hundred and ninety back chris had said three to four hundred meters more reason to think hed seen a lunie a lunie taller than the belters penzler was used to would seem closer hed gone out to look at the tilted rock had he found what he was after before someone had found him probably not hed left us only a puzzle written in frozen blood alan watson and i hadnt found much either my phone was calling me it was boone the court has ordered the lady revived he told me shes already out shell be returned to hovestraydt city around noon tomorrow i was told she would need to recuperate overnight in the copernicus hospital why but she was out that was what counted is she awake now yes ive talked to her okay ill please dont call her hamilton she sounded tired she wouldnt give me visual urn okay whats the situation with apartments boone looked cautiously triumphant theres some inconsistency in the records mrs mitchison was given a room on the second floor because the computer registered all ground floor rooms as occupied i got a printout of the occupants as of that date the computer does not list room ohfortyseven as empty or occupied have you tried to look in ohfortyseven not yet ill need a court order no you wont have naomi ask for that room if anyone flinches it may tell us something he smirked an unlincolnesque smirk i like it okay now tell somebody about this will you get the judge in charge of reviewing naomis conviction and tell him about that disappearing room or tell anyone at all surely youre being overdramatic you know too much to be safe were dealing with someone who can control the lock on your apartment look do it just to make me happy all right mr hamilton smiling he called off i went back to the window a mirror would reflect a laser beam for only an instant no mirror is perfectly reflective of course in the first instant of a laser burst the face of a mirror would already be vaporizing getting concave defocussing the beam and it had defocussed in midburn but where had the mirror gone the case was loaded with traditional elements locked room inverted with the failed murderer locked out on the moon cryptic dying message now i was looking for mirror tricks what next disappearing daggers of memory plastic broken clocks giving spurious alibis the moonscape blazed at me through the window i rubbed my fingers together remembering alan was on top of the tilted rock finding nothing id scraped at the shadowed back of the rock with my gloves white stuff had come off id watched it disappear from my fingertips frost of course water ice but on the surface of the moon it had startled me then now suddenly it made sense and now suddenly i had half of the puzzle solved the traditional elements phone call mr hamilton phone call mr oh futz milton phone call chiron answer phone i disengaged the strap across my chest and sat up hello gil the screen was blank but the voice was naomis she sounded tired there was none of the jubilation youd expect of someone raised from death hello you going to give me vision no something like postoperative depression maybe where are you calling from here hovestraydt city they say im still under arrest had she arrived early but my clock said noon id been a long time falling asleep have you talked to boone yet we still have an attempted murder to deal with wed like to pin both murders on someone go ahead are you under drugs no but nothing seems to matter much who got me out of the freezer mostly alan watson i said for sweet charitys sake naomi we know where you were when someone shot chris penzler in his bath boone and i discussed it over the chili at lunch yesterday over the oh she thought it out clearly i knew and didnt trust the phone system all right now what youre still a suspect wed like to produce an actual killer but he wasnt outside after his first try at penzler we have to explain why or else we have to show where you were at that time boone says thats not as bad as it sounds you should talk to him all right wed like to see you in your apartment gil id rather not see anyone bitterly i was just getting used to the idea of being dead so youre not dead now what i dont know i couldnt tell her why we had to see the apartment not by phone in her present state would she take orders call boone i said tell him ill meet him in your apartment its ohfortyseven isnt it tell him to get the police to let us in then order us breakfast plenty of coffee there were several seconds of dead air then for the first time i heard emotion in her voice all right gil she purred and was gone bitter satisfaction that was what it sounded like but why the lunie cop guarding room was a stranger i had to nerve myself to turn my back on him paranoia naomi ushered me in boone was already there seated at the breakfast table i didnt understand why he watched me so intently i was concentrating on what i bad to say not on what i was seeing but it seemed to me that my eyes blurred when i looked at naomi she seemed distorted somehow she had recovered some of her selfpossession i thought but she seemed clumsy and she moved with care id thought she was used to lunar gravity she said surprise and then i saw when youre in the holding tanks theyre not supposed to touch you except in emergencies she said did you know that i had trouble getting my breath i knew it weve been discussing it in the conference what do lunies consider an emergency aye theres the rub said naomi they apologised of course they did the best they could seems a brazilian planetologist waded into a dust pool near copernicus its a wonder she got out at all with her legs frozen solid she managed to fall and rip her suit too vacuum ruptured both eardrums and one lung and an eye and the fall broke two ribs guess who happened to have the right rejection spectrum to help her out her legs werent bad but they didnt look quite right her face didnt look quite right either and something about her body maybe the way she carried herself shes famous i gather this mary de santa rita lisboa all hell would break loose if she couldnt get adequate medical treatment at copernicus terrible publicity for gods sake tell me how i look just about the same i said it was true she seemed just faintly distorted surgery on her inner ears twice had changed the outline of her face her eyes werent quite the same color how could i have missed that her torso seemed twisted shed cure that when she learned to walk again after all her legs were changed too they were too thin not lunie legs thank god shed have looked like a stork theyd probably come off a belter somehow the doctors had found parts that matched almost that didnt alter the fact that they had raided a holding tank ill want you to testify before the committee i told her im going to raise hell good she said venomously boone did you explain the legal situation boone nodded naomi said i wish id known all of this before the trial i dont much like the thought of going through two more trials you know one to get me clear of this attempted murder charge one to nail me for having a clone made will you do it i suppose so i was fighting the abstract horror of knowing that lunie hospitals had been raiding the holding tanks and a purely personal horror that it could happen to naomi naomi was changed she wasnt unsightly just changed patchwork girl this was not the woman whose untouchable beauty had sent me fleeing to the asteroid belt long ago reversing the judgment against you may be more difficult than you think boone said no judge enjoys ruling that another judge was wrong we which reminded me boone ive found the disappearing mirror what how water you pour a big flat pan full of water you freeze it you take it outside into vacuum and shadow out on the moon itll stay at a hundred degrees below zero or less as long as you keep it in shadow now you use the mirrormaking facilities to polish it optically flat and silver it would it work boone gaped it made him look a lot less like abe lincoln he said yes itd work my god thats why he was in such a hurry he wanted to kill penzler just before the sun touched the mirror i smiled the eureka sensation but chris wouldnt cooperate he liked playing with the water when the sun touched the mirror it would just disappear almost i said when it evaporated some of the water vapor wound up on the back of the tilted rock in shadow i found frost there itll be gone by now but weve got other evidence harry mccavity says the beam either spread or constricted during the burn the ice was vaporizing thats what really saved chriss life i turned to naomi who was looking bewildered what all of this means is that the murder attempt happened here in this room boone have you had a chance he shook his head nothing odd here at all these rooms are kept clean by automatics i expect we wont find anything gil the problem is that any citizen of hovestraydt city could use some corner of the mirror works without being noticed we even let boy scout troops run projects there i know too many suspects there ought to be some way to narrow it down how am i fixed for lawsuits nonsense youre an arm trying to solve a murder im a lawyer in conference with my client id like to know more about chriss love life i said naomi he made a pass at me rather crude she said would he want to sleep with a lunie woman that i dont know some men like variety itch did so did i futz so try the phone laura was busy i got her by belt phone voice only gil i couldnt make it last night im short of sleep now it was the penzler case no sweat i was playing detective im playing detective now do you know anything about chris penzlers taste in women even by hearsay mmm hearsay maybe do you remember the prosecution attorney from naomi mitchisons trial the elf woman face of cold perfection i remember carolines fiancee got drunk with some friends and was going to go looking for penzler they had to talk him out of it thats all i know it might have nothing to do with caroline at all he wouldnt say anything else nothing i can think of thanks when can i call you back im off duty at noon with luck but i need sleep gil sometime this evening i called off the phone i thought hard then i called the mayors office mr hamilton i wasnt gil any more not since yesterdays power play youll find that naomi mitchison is out of the holding tank and has been returned here im with her now shes got a few parts missing did you know that missing and replaced i was told hove said i wont take responsibility for that i can guess what your attitude will be is that why you called no right now im more concerned with keeping her out of the holding tank hove youre a politician you have to deal with all kinds of people do you happen to know if chris penzler was attracted to lunie women he stiffened a little i presume he wouldnt show it an offworld diplomat wouldnt jeopardize his position in such a fashion was hove that naive we know damn well he offended somebody hove and weve got good reason to think it was a citizen of hovestraydt city you were here twenty years ago werent you and so was penzler did you hear any rumors then were there complaints that had to be settled quietly or yeah did he make regular trips to the belt trading post that stopped suddenly i know the place you mean hove said reluctantly aphrodites they don t keep records i can look up records of puffer rentals from twenty years ago if its important to you good it is gil why do you think a local man killed chris nobody else could have made the mayor its too easy to plug into the phone system ill get you your data hove said and called off boone and naomi were both looking at me i said if chris had an affair with a lunie woman she might be annoyed when he went off with someone else lunie customs are funny flatlander customs are funny boone corrected me but you may be right who oh its just a possible situation i got up to pace i was going to hate it if it was laura heres another i know a couple of newstapers who might commit a practical joke for kicks and news value the belter arrived early she came to meet our ship maybe she had time to make the mirror and place it she could pass for a lunie her torso painting is a naked lady didnt they actually save penzlers life itd still be a very rough practical joke chris might have brought his own enemies from the belt either of the two could know enough programming to steal a message laser boone was nodding theyre living like a married couple they must have known each other for some time i grinned at him theyre not lunies boone i just dont know there are two other belters on the committee they could have had something against him naomi had a thoughtful puzzled look i assumed she was confused not following our line of thought i hardly noticed when she went to the phone this case does have its traditional elements i said what time is it in los angeles i have no idea boone said i should call luke garner hes got a tape library of old mysteries hed love this dying messages locked moms tricks with mirrors we dont have to produce a killer you know thats for the police now that we know how the mirror trick was worked we can clear mrs mitchison boone i get edgy when ive solved twothirds of a puzzle thats the time when you can get killed naomi tapped at the keys hologram headandshoulder portraits appeared in a quartered screen i stepped behind her for a better look a woman id never seen before and chris penzler and mayor watson the door announcer said mayor watson speaking id like to talk to mr hamilton if hes still there may i come in chiron door open naomi said without looking up then no i looked around as hove came in he came in fast close the door he told naomi he was carrying a police message laser i went for my gun arms carry a tiny twoshot hand weapon at all times it fires a cloud of anaesthetic needles id turned it in on arrival of course if that first reflexive move hadnt slowed me maybe i could have done something boone halfreclining in a web chair hadnt had a chance to move at all now he raised his hands so did i naomi said i should have thought i just futz the mayor told her close the door or ill kill you naomi called the door closed good enough hove said and he slumped a little im not sure what to do next perhaps you can help me with my problem if i kill all of you what are my chances of getting away with it boone smiled slowly speaking as your lawyer please said the mayor the little glass lens in the end of the gun wavered about pointing at us all he could chop us all up before we could do more than twitch how had he slipped it past the cop if you dont speak ill kill you if i catch you in a lie ill kill you do you understand boone said consider the political repercussions of three more murders youll destroy hovestraydt city i saw it in hoves face that shot drew blood but he said youre in a position to convict the mayor of murdering a belt politician how would that affect the city i cant allow it gil why did the killer have to be a resident were talking about the bathtub attack remember chris saw the killer too close that makes him tall it took a resident to borrow the facilities in the mirror works and know how to use them he also had to futz with the city computer a lot of residents seem to be good at that and the mayor i thought suddenly would have to be even better so you know about the mirror can you tell me how chris was able to see me i wasnt fool enough to leave the room lights on while i waited for him to stand up huh you werent i thought about it oh his lights were on you were lighted by the mirror he nodded thats bothered me ever since was it me you suspected im flabbergasted hove why and then i saw why out of the corner of my eye on naomis phone screen hove seemed almost disinterested twice he came to the moon to meddle with our internal affairs first to impose the holding tanks on us then to criticize the way we use them never mind can you think of any way in which the police can trace me without your help of course the guard at the door he didnt see me he wont see me leave i couldnt think of a thing naomi said mayor do you see where my finger is now it was on the return key for the phone keyboard i saw that much and then i stepped between naomi and the gun hove didnt react fast enough to stop me youll have to shoot through me i said youll never make it naomi said one tap of this key and these four faces appear on every phone screen in the city we can negotiate i said quickly soothingly i hoped hoves eyes were going desperate you tried to kill chris penzler for political reasons fine so say we all you sliced his hand off six days later fine do you want to tell us how you managed that hed been about to fire perhaps he still was when did it happen he asked chris could have died any time in a five hour period you cant possibly have an alibi you must have posed as a policeman the computer would have issued you a police skintight suit and lost the records yes certainly and chris left a dying message that points toward you i saw the intensity setting on the laser start to unwind and saw hove thumb it back to maximum hove said did he did he really thats very interesting it points toward you i said but not directly chris was only three feet away when the laser sliced his hand off he must have seen his killers face and his chest symbol too why didnt he just write tree or mayor somebodys bound to wonder of course if you just turn yourself in the case is solved hove seemed lost in thought then gil do you understand what this affair could do to my city its bad now it could get much worse if things run their course yes god yes he drew himself up and looking down on us from a great height he said here are my terms i want an hour to escape alter that you can tell the police all that weve discussed agreed your word of honor yes i said yes said boone naomi hesitated for several nerveshattering seconds her hand was starting to tremble where she held it poised above the return key she said yes that on the screen goes back into storage yes said naomi open the door the mayor said the laser was under his coat as he stepped into the hall naomi called the door closed then she said well i mopped away sweat with a napkin my word of honor is good boone faintly smiling was looking at his watch and so say we all naomi said the bastard where will he go someplace where he cant be questioned i said hell get a puffer and go till hes out of air then find a dust pool you think so she looked at the hologram portraits four of them chris penzler and mayor hovestraydt watson and alan watson and a very tall elvishly beautiful young woman with long light brown hair i could guess who she was from context naomi said i wonder how she died you think he killed her maybe it hardly matters now right naomi typed rapidly the screen cleared we waited penalties we found the guard snoring outside naomis door hove had fired a cloud of soluble anaesthetic crystals into him from an arm issue handgun it was mine id turned it in on arrival hove must have persuaded the computer to release it hove well we waited it out more or less grimly he had checked out a puffer and gone we searched the projected moonscape while we could he probably hid until watchbird ii set jeffersons police searched old mines and known cave systems nothing he certainly hadnt reached the belt trading post the belters were looking for him too jefferson sent men to search the launch head of the grimalde mass driver their mistake i think was in assuming hove was desperate to live hoves problem was to hide a puffer and a corpse his own my own theory is that he blew them both to bits by exploding the puffers fuel and oxygen alan watson cane in late that night looking used up he came back to life when he saw naomi they talked seriously for awhile and then she went off under his long arm i didnt see them again until next morning by then i had talked to harry mccavity again alan and naomi were eating a huge breakfast together on the dining level i managed to be at the buffet when alan went for more coffee i have to see you in private i said coffee sloshed i startled him i think he asked isnt it over yet mostly its about you and your father a momentary wariness showed in his face then all right i ate breakfast while i waited presently naomi left and alan came to join me she told me about yesterday he said he could have killed you all i wish none of it had happened so do i alan youre leaving the moon his mouth opened he stared what come on youre not that surprised i made some promises to mayor hove but i made them at gunpoint be off the moon within a week dont ever come back or ill break those promises he studied my eyes no he wasnt that surprised youll have to spell it out for me im not enjoying this i said ill try to keep it short chris penzler was close enough to get a good look at the man who killed him we know it was a lunie even if penzler didnt know his name he could have tried to describe the chest emblem instead he left a reference to the attempt to kill him in his bathtub a week earlier why would he protect the man who murdered him well youre his son naomi finally saw it and i should have youre hove watsons height and i took that for genes but it isnt you were raised in lunar gravity otherwise you look a lot like chris penzler and somewhat like your mother and not at all like hove watson alan was looking down into his coffee he was quite pale this is all pure speculation isnt it its the kind of speculation that could finish hovestraydt city i think youre supposed to be the mayors son the heir apparent its bad enough if hove killed penzler for political reasons i know you could be right anyway i did a little more speculating then last night i got harry mccavity out of bed and made him check a certain pressure suit helmet for traces of dried blood alan looked up i might have stepped out of a nightmare the way he looked at me i said what did he do offer to legitimize you offer alan laughed out loud an ugly sound then looked quickly around him faces had turned alan lowered his voice he insisted he was going to name me as his heir and bastard did you kill him to get naomi off the hook no no i wouldnt have hurt him at all if id had time to think i could have explained it to him couldnt i he just didnt know what hed be doing to me he said he was my father he said he was going to announce it he wouldnt listen and i was holding the laser i lost my head it was all over in a thousandth of a second i sliced his hand off and he pointed at me and sprayed blood in my face blinded me when i wiped it off the glass he was gone i looked for him to get his suit sealed and get him to a hospital when i found him he was dead uh huh alan was very pale he wasnt seeing me at all he said his wrist was still bubbling i said you could blame chris for letting his gonads lead him around you could blame hove for frying to kill him it didnt work but thats what started chris thinking about his children sure youre bound to blame yourself but alan it wasnt all your fault all right now what if the truth came out hell wouldnt hold the political repercussions and youd be broken up for parts i dont want that but i wont have you in a position of political power and theres no way you can stay on the moon without becoming mayor get off the moon within a week or ill start talking i suppose you left a letter somewhere in case something happens to you get stuffed he stared but youre giving me a week to kill you i got up youre not the type and i meant it i meant it all i said and left the rules the committee laid down during the following week included provision for periodic review of lunar legal practice none of the delegates were especially happy with the new laws the lunies liked it least but how could they object after naomis testimony they compromised we were wrapping up the conference the day alan watson left for ceres id have preferred to see him go but it didnt matter given who he was he got a police escort he was definitely gone laura told me about it that evening naomi mitchison went with him she said good do you mean that sure i like to keep thing tidy naomi had asked for her belt citizenship a few days ago and hildegarde quilting was glad to ram it through for her naomi would be an embarrassment on earth or on the moon moving her to the belt let everyone breathe easier including naomi old friends on earth could remember her as she used to be she neednt stand trial for illegal cloning her little girl would be waiting for her she might even be in love with alan watson futz i even like the idea let it stand
