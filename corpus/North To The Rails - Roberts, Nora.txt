north to the rails chapter they could call it running away if they wanted to but it made no sense to kill a man or risk being killed over something so trivial he had never used a gun against a man and did not intend to begin now he glanced back but the town lay far behind him and there seemed to be no reason for pursuit dawn would be breaking soon and they would be expecting him on the street to face dutch akin and dutch would certainly be there right in the middle of that las vegas street a gun ready to his hand it was a savage custom a ridiculous custom his mother had been right to take him away from it back to the eastern city where her family lived she had never loved the west not really he had been a fool to come west even on business but how could he have imagined he would run into trouble though he rarely took a drink and was not inclined to argue he had taken a drink while waiting for either pearsall or sparrow and he had gotten into an argument all right he had made a mistake but how was he to know they would make so much out of so little to hell with dutch akin and with las vegas he would be damned if heвђd get himself killed over a few careless words in a saloon it made no senseвђno sense at all what would they say when they realized he was gone when he failed to appear at the thought his ears reddened and he felt uncomfortable to hell with them it was better to be a live coward than a dead hero coward the word rankled was he a coward had he been afraid he searched himself for an answer and found none he did not believe he was a coward he had come away to avoid a ridiculous situation or was he just telling himself that was he not actually afraid he seemed to feel his fatherвђs eyes upon himвђ those cool thoughtful eyes that knew so well how to measure a man and judge what he had in him he remembered his father the day they brought him home on a shutter still alive but badly shot up there had been three men one of them had taken a drink waved a bottle and staggered but when borden chantry had come to arrest him the man suddenly dropped his bottle and two other men stepped from ambush and his father had gone down in a wicked crossfire he got off one shot that was all the three men had then fled the town his father had lived for two days in considerable pain before the doctor arrived from the fort by the time he got there his father was dead it was as his mother had told him if you lived by the gun you died by the gun but he remembered overhearing someone say as they left the cemetery вђњiвђd hate to be in their boots when tom chantry grows upвђќ his father had been a cattleman reasonably successful by any manвђs standards but then had come the great freezeup and when the snow melted his father was a poor man and so were a lot of others cattlemen could always get credit and when they sold their herds they paid up only pa had no herd to sell the men of the town respected him knew he had a family to feed and they also knew that he was a man good with a gun so they offered him the job of town marshal for six years he ran the town and kept it free of serious trouble he rarely had to draw his gun and several times he held his fire to give the other man a chance to drop his and they usually didвђall but one that man elected to fire and missed borden chantry did not miss that was the shooting that led to his death for the men who came up the trail to kill him were friends of the dead man and they staged the ambush that wiped out borden chantry it did no good to remember all that tom chantry touched his horse with a spur it would soon be light and he wanted to be far away before they discovered he was gone he had been a fool to come west in the first place both ma and doris had tried to talk him out of it but there was a shortage of beef in the east and he had argued with earnshaw that they could buy it on the plains no use dealing with a middleman dorisвђ father was robert earnshaw a dealer in livestock in new york city lately he had branched out into real estate and banking although livestock was still the backbone of his business he had been quick to recognize the profit to be had if tom chantry could go west buy cattle on the plains and ship them east and tom had come west with his blessing beef had been scarce in kansas but a cattleman told him of a herd that was being held outside of las vegas new mexico that still might be had the owners pearsall and sparrow had been holding the cattle to speculate but now were in a bind for money tom chantry had immediately left for las vegas sending a message ahead to make the appointment with the prospective sellers he had registered at the hotel and gone at once to the saloon where cattlemen were known to gather and where sparrow had said they would meet while he waited he had a drink dutch akin had come in bumping him hard as he lurched up to the bar then turning to glare at him with a muttered reference to a вђњdudeвђќ tom chantry ignored the rudeness although he felt irritation mounting within him he edged over a little without seeming to do so giving akin more room he knew he should go but he had come all this way to see sparrow and the man was expected it was simple courtesy for him to wait so he waited chantry had finished his drink hesitated then ordered another he had not eaten since early that morning and knew that he should not have that second drink but he was embarrassed to stay at the bar without ordering by the time he had finished his drink sparrow had not come so he started to turn away from the bar without warning a rough hand grasped his shoulder suddenly furious chantry turned around sharply akin was grinning at him вђњdude diden you hyar me i invited you to drink wiвђmeвђќ вђњsorry i didnвђt hear but iвђve had enough thank youвђќ вђњвђќiвђve had enough thank youвђќвђќ akin put his hand on his hip and aped the words in a falsetto then his voice changed вђњiвђll tell you when youвђve had enough now belly up to the bar anвђ drinkвђќ вђњnoвђќ the room was quiet every eye was on them the drunken man suddenly seemed to be no longer drunk вђњwhen dutch akin invites a man to drink he damn well better drinkвђќ akin said evenly вђњyou drink misterвђќ вђњnoвђќ it was foolish a ridiculous situation tom chantry was irritated with himself for remaining long enough to get involved but there was no help for it now вђњi am sorry my friend but i have no wish for another drink i was just leavingвђќ вђњyouвђll leave when i get damn good anвђ ready for you to leave now belly up to the barвђќ chantry merely glanced at him then turned to leave the room again he felt the hand touch his shoulder and this time his reaction was swift he swung around quickly and throwing his left hand back took hold of the grasping arm and jerked hard dutch akin hit the floor with a crash and as he realized what had been done to him his hand swept back for his gun вђњdutchвђќ the sharp voice cut through the haze of anger in dutch akinвђs brain a short slender man in a business suit and a white hat was holding a gun in his hand вђњthe gentleman isnвђt armed dutch if you havenвђt noticed that youвђd better you draw that gun and iвђll put a hole into youвђќ вђњthis ainвђt none of your affair sparrow this is just me and himвђќ sparrow chantry turned his head to look a man of about fortyfive welldressed cool competentlooking this was the man he had come to see вђњit is any manвђs affair as long as this gentleman is not wearing a gun if you shoot an unarmed man youвђll hang for it dutch iвђll see that you doвђќ dutch got up slowly holstering his pistol вђњall rightвђќ he said calmly вђњall right sparrow but iвђll be on the street at daybreak wearinвђ this gun and he better be armed because if he ainвђt iвђll break both his legsвђќ dutch turned sharply and walked from the room chantry held out his hand вђњtom chantry here mr sparrow thank youвђthank you very muchвђќ they walked back to the hotel together вђњbad case that akinвђќ sparrow commented вђњa real troublemaker but heвђs good with a gun so be carefulвђќ chantry shrugged вђњi doubt if i ever see him again actually you are the man i came to see i understand you have a herd of beef outside of town that you might sellвђќ вђњi mightвђќ they had reached the deserted porch of the hotel sparrow bit the end from a cigar вђњbut you are mistaken if you think akin wonвђt show the man may be a troublemaker and a loudmouth but heвђs got sand and heвђs killed a man or two you can expect himвђќ вђњitвђs absurd mr sparrow the whole affair was uncalled for he will have forgotten all about it in the morningвђќ sparrow lighted his cigar threw the match into the dust and then spoke around the cigar вђњno mr chantry he will not have forgotten it nor will anyone else come hell or high water dutch akin will be in the street tomorrow and if you donвђt own a pistol you had better buy or borrow one youвђll need itвђќ вђњare you seriously suggesting that i be out there in the street that i engage in a duel with thisвђthis apeвђќ sparrow glanced at him вђњare you by any chance related to borden chantryвђќ вђњi am his sonвђќ вђњthen i would thinkвђвђњ suddenly tom chantry was impatient вђњmr sparrow i came to las vegas to see you to make you an offer for your cattle the firm i represent earnshaw and company is an eastern firm and until now we have done our business through others weвђve hoped to set up some business connections out here and buy cattle at the source we had hoped to buy your herd i did not come out here to be involved in brawls or shootings or anything of that sort i dislike violence and will have nothing to do with this affairвђќ вђњi seeвђќ sparrowвђs manner had grown cool вђњi knew your fatherвђќ he said after a minute вђњand i respected him i was not interested in selling cattle at this time and weвђre holding them on good grass so there is no need however i thought that the son of borden chantry and i might strike a bargainвђќ вђњand we are ready sirвђќ вђњyou went east soon after your fatherвђs death didnвђt youвђќ вђњyes sirвђќ вђњthe situation back east is very different from out here mr chantry money is not always the only consideration out here we place emphasis upon the basic virtues and i have noticed that the more organized our lives become the less attention we pay to such things as courage and loyalty organization seems to eliminate the necessity for such things but out here they are the very stuff of lifeвђќ вђњand what does that meanвђќ вђњsimply this that a manвђs courage or lack of it is a matter of economic importance in the west there are few ventures that can be attempted out here where courage is not a necessity and anyone engaged in such a venture has a right to know the courage of those who are to share the riskвђќ вђњwhat you are saying is that if i do not meet dutch akin tomorrow i had better go back eastвђќ вђњexactly that we will agree the circumstances are disagreeable but such things cannot be avoided and you have no choiceвђќ вђњi donвђt believe thatвђќ sparrow shrugged вђњit does not matter what you believe your father understood and he lived by the codeвђќ вђњand died by itвђќ вђњthat sometimes happensвђќ вђњthenвђќ tom chantry replied quietly вђњi am in the wrong country i have no desire to kill or to be killed i shall go to dutch akin and apologizeвђќ вђњhe will despise youвђќ вђњvery well but that will be the end of itвђќ sparrow drew on his cigar then took it from his mouth as though it suddenly had a bad taste вђњno mr chantry that will not be the end it will be only the beginning the bullies will know you are fair game that you will not fight and therefore are to be bullied with impunity the decent people will simply ignore you the bullies will hunt you down and some of them will keep on pushing just to see how much you can take before you do fight вђњunderstand this mr chantry the love of peace and the unwillingness to fight never kept anyone out of troubleвђќ they left it at that but during the night tom chantry made his decision turning now in the saddle he looked back again there was nothingвђnothing at all all around were the vast sky and the open prairie to the north there were mountains ahead was a broken rugged country it was not until then that he realized what he had done he had ridden west not east chapter to the east lay home friends security from all this his mother and doris were in the east his job and his future were there yet he had ridden west why what impulse had caused him to turn west when east was the logical direction was there some urge within him to avoid security to avoid escape his choice back there had been simple to use a gun or not to use it he did not think he had actually been afraid but how was he to know sparrowвђs attitude could be that of everyone west of the mississippi and of many of those east of it such a story would get around of course and even those who commended him for good judgment would suspect his courage by turning west he had escaped nothing but the immediate meeting with dutch akin for the situation might arise again if so would he run again how often could he run but that was not the important thing now he had come west to buy cattle that could be shipped east if he could not get them in las vegas he must find them elsewhere and that meant he might ride north to the wyoming country and ship over the union pacific earnshaw had advanced the money for his trip west and he carried a draft against earnshawвђs bank with which to pay for the cattle it was his duty to complete the business that had brought him here earnshaw was depending on him tom chantry considered the situation santa fe lay to the west not over three daysвђ ride he believed it was doubtful if the required cattle could be found there and if found they must be driven to the railhead which meant a drive through las vegasвђsomething he could not consider at this time his logical course was to strike north but first he must have bedding supplies and a pack horse the horse he had purchased at the livery stable seemed a good one and tom chantry was an experienced judge of horseflesh he had bought and sold stock for earnshaw long enough to be ahead of him lay the stage station at kearneyвђs gap lights showed in the windows although the sky was gray with dawnвђs first light he turned his mount and rode up to the hitch rack behind the house he heard the squeak and complaint of a windlass he walked to the edge of the porch and looked past the corner a man with rumpled hair his suspenders hanging loose had just drawn a bucket of water вђњhowdyвђќ he said cheerfully вђњcoffeeвђs on be fryinвђ eggs come in anвђ setвђќ how much time did he have traveling would begin at daybreak and the stage would be coming from las vegas shortly after he did not want to be here when it arrived over coffee he spoke of santa fe and socorro вђњifвђn youвђre headinвђ for socorro nowвђќ the stage tender said вђњyouвђre headinвђ right but a man who wanted to get to santa fe ahorseback is a plumb fool to ride the trail right yonderвђќвђhe pointedвђвђњis a good horseback or pack trail across the mountains rougher but a whole sight shorter thisaway you swing south and take a big bend no need you headinвђ for santa feвђќ вђњsocorroвђќ chantry said вђњbut iвђm traveling light you havenвђt got any trade goods have youвђќ вђњa mite sell some of the injuns once in a while what was you needinвђвђќ less than half an hour later with two blankets a sack of grub and a bowie knife to cut firewood chantry headed west when out of sight of the station he turned abruptly from the road and cut back into the brush to find the other trail he found it at agua zarca and followed it toward the crossing of the tecolote at san geronimo without leaving the saddle he removed his coat stripped off his white shirt and donned a dark red shirt bought at the stage station then he tied his coat behind his saddle at noon well back in the scattered pinions he unsaddled watered his horse at a seep made coffee and ate a couple of dry biscuits slowly the tension left him the smell of the pinons and juniper the coolness and quiet of the day the slow circling of faroff buzzards the cloud shadows on the hills began to soak into his being and left him rested and at peace when he mounted up and started on once more he was at one with the land his first desire had been to get away from las vegas but now that he was away he knew his best bet would have been to ride north toward mora and thence to cimarron where there would be a lot of cattle he reached the santa fe trail again near glorieta skirted santa fe and took the trail for taos the way he had left las vegas rankled he did not like being considered a coward and he did not believe he was one but a good many people would believe so but that was behind him once in cimarron he would buy the cattle drive them to the railhead and within a few hours after that he would be on his way back to doris doris he took his time he camped when the mood was on him and rode on again when he grew restless when possible he avoided the main trail he was somewhere south of etown when he heard the horse it was coming fast and he pulled over to be out of the way the horse was a blazefaced roan and it was carrying double the riders pulled up when they saw him вђњhowdy there stranger cominвђ ferвђќ вђњsanta feвђќ he replied they were young roughlooking and one man had a bandaged arm вђњsee many folks on the trailвђќ вђњnobodyвђќ вђњyouвђll likely see some by this time thereвђs aplenty of folks headinвђ our way we was in a shootinвђ back yonder in elizabethtown hank got himself winged and got his hoss kilt right under him good hoss tooвђќ вђњbudвђќ hank said вђњyou notice somethinвђ peculiar this gent ainвђt wearinвђ no gunвђќ вђњrough countryвђќ bud commented вђњifвђn i was you mister iвђd wear a gun you never know who youвђll meet up withвђќ chantry shrugged вђњi donвђt wear a gun if youвђll pardon my saying so i think guns lead to troubleвђќ вђњyou hear that bud he ainвђt wearinвђ no gunвђќ вђњmaybe guns do lead to troubleвђќ bud said seriously вђњbut theyвђs times when not wearinвђ one willвђќ suddenly he held a pistol вђњgit down off that hoss misterвђќ вђњnow see here iвђвђњ вђњyou git down off that hoss or iвђll shoot you off anвђ i ainвђt goinвђ to tell you againвђќ hank was grinning at him his lean unshaven face taunting вђњheвђll do it too stranger bud hereвђs kilt four men heвђs one up on meвђќ вђњthereвђs no need for thisвђќ chantry said вђњiвђve done you no harmвђќ he felt the sting of the nicked ear and then heard the blast of the pistol although probably everything happened at onceвђthe stab of flame the report the flash of pain from his ear вђњmister i ainвђt atalkinвђ just to hear the wind blow you git downвђќ slowly carefully tom chantry swung down from his horse inwardly he was seething but he was frightened too the man had meant to kill him hank quickly dropped from his seat in back of bud and swung up on chantryвђs horse with a wild derisive yell they rode off and he stood in the trail staring after them the place where they had come upon him was among scattered trees but before him the country opened wide it was high lonely country and ice still lay in the lake beside the trail as far as he could see there was nothingвђno house no animal no man but he was alive had he been wearing a gun they might have killed him or he might have killed one of them an hour later he was still alone still in wide open country but he seemed to be a little nearer the mountains that rimmed the high basin that man had not missed by intention he had wanted to kill he had meant to kill it was a shocking thing an unreal thing chantry had held no weapon had made no threatening gesture and yet the men who had stolen his horse and his outfit would have killed him and could have would they have robbed him had he been armed his mind refused to acknowledge the thought but there was that doubt that uncertainty had he been armed they might have tried to get the drop on him to take his gun and then rob him suddenly he saw a thin distant spiral of dust it drew nearer and nearer dissolved into a dozen hardriding men they drew up the dust swirling around them вђњdid you see two menвђќ one of them asked вђњtwo men on one horseвђќ вђњthey are on two horses now they stole mine at gun pointвђќ вђњyou mean you let вђem have it those were the talrim boys they murdered a man back yonder and it ainвђt the firstвђќ вђњi had no choice i wasnвђt armedвђќ they stared at him the bearded man shrugged вђњthis hereвђs no country to travel without a weaponвђќ he turned in his saddle вђњtell you what you doвђќ he pointed вђњover the hill yonderвђmaybe three milesвђthereвђs a shack and a corral youвђll find a couple of horses there вђњyou take one of them and ride on to cimarron leave a note on the table in there thatвђs the andress cabin and the old man will understand you can leave the horse for him in cimarron or just turn him loose heвђll go homeвђќ and then they were gone and he was alone on the road with the dust of the posse drifting around him it was coming on to sundown when he reached the andress cabin and caught up one of the horses he found there there was no saddle but he had ridden bareback before this he twisted a hackamore from some rope and mounted up then remembering the note he swung down tied the horse and went inside the cabin it was still and bareвђa table two chairs a bunk in a corner a few dogeared magazines and some old books it was neat everything was in its place he sat down and searching in vain for paper finally took an envelope from his pocket and scratched a brief note on the back with a pencil he carried he weighted the note down with a silver dollar to pay for the use of the horse pulled the door shut after him mounted again and rode out on the trail to cimarron his face itched and putting up a hand he found there was dried blood from the nicked ear he rubbed it away then felt gingerly of the ear the bleeding had stopped but the ear was very tender moistening his handkerchief at his lips he carefully wiped the dried blood away from the ear that had been a narrow escape it was pure luck that the shot had not killed him and pure whim on the part of bud talrim that he had not fired a second shot to better effect tom chantry shuddered it was the same sudden reaction one has that usually draws the remark вђњsomebody just stepped on your graveвђќ he might have been dead and he might have been robbed leaving no identification with nothing to tell who he was or why he was here it was appalling to consider how close he had come to an utterly useless death and a nameless grave back home nobody would ever have known what happened to him he made his decision then he was going to get out of this country and he was going to get out by the first stage the very first train he was going back east and he was going to stay there and live in a civilized community since the shocking death of his father there had been no violence in his life he had grown up first in a small new england village going to school fishing along the streams hunting rabbits squirrels and then deer he had gone to church and had taken for granted the welldressed quiettalking people the neat streets the wellordered little town he had been aware of the town officials the local constable and the talk of courts and trials he knew the town had a jail although it was rarely occupied by more than an occasional drunk later in new york the police had been more obvious there were fire companies and workmen to repair damage to the streets with these memories in his mind he had also been conscious now for several minutes of the drum of a horseвђs hoofs on the trail behind him he turned to see a rider on a bay horseвђthe very bay he had seen in the andress corral when he caught up the horse he was riding the rider was a tall straight old man with a white mustache and clear blue eyes вђњhowdy chantryвђќ he called вђњiвђm luke andress no need to leave that dollar in this country if a man needs a horse all he needs to do is let a body knowвђќ вђњthank youвђќ briefly tom chantry explained вђњmurderersвђќ andress said вђњsavages but you ought to carry a gun if youвђd had a gun theyвђd never have tried it not to your face anyway those talrims are backshootinвђ murderers at least those two areвђќ вђњdo you think the posse will catch themвђќ вђњthem no they wonвђtвђnot by a durned sight those talrims are a bad lot but theyвђre mountain men with two horses under them and what grub you had theyвђll lose themselves in the mountains west of here theyвђre better than injuns when it comes to runninвђ anвђ hidinвђвђќ andress glanced at him вђњyou figuring on ranchinвђ itвђќ вђњno i came out to buy cattle and after whatвђs happened in the last few days i canвђt get out of here fast enoughвђќ andress was silent as they rode on for a short distance and then he said вђњitвђs a good country chantry itвђs like any country when itвђs young and growinвђ it attracts the wild spirits the loosefooted some of them settle down and become mighty good citizens but thereвђs always the savages you have вђem back east tooвђќ вђњnot like hereвђќ вђњjust like here only youвђve got an organized society a police department and law courts the bad actor there knows he ainвђt goinвђ to get far if he starts cuttinвђ up folks wonвђt stand for it but you walk down the street back there and you can figure maybe two out of every five folks you pass are savages they may not even know it themselves but once the law breaks down youвђd find out fast enough first theyвђd prey on the peaceful ones then on each other itвђs jungle law boy and donвђt you forget it вђњout here thereвђs nothinвђ but local law and a man can be as mean as he wants to until folks catch up with him or until he meets some bigger tougher man this is raw country the good folks are good because itвђs their nature and the bad can run to meanness until somebody fetches them up the short thatвђs why youвђd better arm yourself if youвђre goinвђ to be in this country youвђll need a gunвђќ вђњguns lead to troubleвђќ вђњwellвђќ andress said dryly вђњi can see where not havinвђ a gun led you to troubleвђќ he paused a moment вђњthe thieves and the killers are goinвђ to have guns so if the honest men donвђt have вђem they just make it easier for the vicious but you hold to your way of thinkinвђ boy if youвђve a mind to itвђs your way and you got a right to itвђќ cimarron showed up ahead lights appearing although it was not yet dark вђњgo to the st jamesвђќ andress said вђњthere are some cattlemen there almost every night they come in to play cards or to set around and talk youвђll find some cattle but if youвђre not goinвђ to carry a gun youвђd better talk soft and stay clear of whiskeyвђќ a room a bath and a good dinner made a lot of difference tom chantry stood before the mirror and combed his dark hair then he straightened his tie and shrugged his coat into a neater set on his shoulders now for business a thousand head of steers and the crew to drive them to the railhead with any kind of luck he could be on the train for new york within a matter of a few days the saloon at the st james was not crowded for the hour was early but it was at this hour that most of the business was conducted by the clientele the western saloon tom chantry knew was more than merely a drinking room it was a clearing house for information as to trails grazing conditions indian attitudes and business and political considerations generally at the bar tom introduced himself to henry lambert who owned the st james lambert had once been chef at the white house brought there originally by grant for he had cooked for grant during part of the war вђњi am interested in buying cattle mr lambert my name is tom chantry if you know of anyoneвђвђњ вђњmr chantryвђќвђlambertвђs face had stiffened slightly at the nameвђвђњi do know of cattle that might be for sale but i would not advise you to buy themвђќ surprised tom turned toward him вђњwould you mind telling me why buying cattle is why i came to cimarronвђќ вђњmr chantry i am a frenchman but i have become acquainted with the customs here to buy the cattle would be easy but you must get them to the railroad i do not believe you could hire the men to do itвђќ вђњyou mean there arenвђt any at this time of yearвђќ вђњthere are men but they would not work for you mr chantry i hope you will not take offense for i am only telling you what is true you see there are no secrets in the west and there has been talk here in this bar about how you failed to meet dutch akinвђќ вђњbut what has that to do with hiring a crewвђќ вђњmr chantry it is a long hard drive from here to the end of the track much of it is through country where roving bands of cheyenne comanche and kiowa may be found and the arapahoes too i think it is a hard country without much water with danger of sandstorms stampedes and other troubles men do not want to trust themselves to the leadership of a man whose courage is in questionвђќ tom chantry felt himself turn cold he stared at the cup of coffee before him for several minutes before he spoke вђњmr lambertвђќ he said finally вђњi am not a coward i simply do not believe in carrying guns and i do not believe in killingвђќ lambert shrugged вђњi do not believe in killing either and yet a dozen men have died in this very room died with guns in their hands в actually men are said to have been killed in that room during the wild days вђњthere is too much killing yet the fact remains that we live in a wild country and one relatively lawless and no man is willing to attempt a cattle drive that may demand the utmost in courage with a man whose courage is suspectвђќ when chantry spoke his voice was hoarse вђњthank you mr lambertвђќ he said he sat alone staring at the coffee as it grew cold in the cup chapter after a short time the depression left him he would not be defeated if there were cattle for sale he meant to buy them and somehow or other get them to market luckily the talrim boys had not thought to rob him of anything but his horse and his outfit that was what they needed and the thought of going through his pockets had not occurred to them he still had his letter of credit and the money he had been carrying he was considering his next move when luke andress came over to the table carrying a beer вђњmind if i sit downвђќ вђњplease doвђќ вђњhad any luckвђќ вђњno and from what lambert tells me i couldnвђt get the hands to drive a herd if i bought oneвђќ вђњso what are you goinвђ to doвђќ he considered that for a moment and then said вђњmr andress i am going to buy cattle and i am going to drive them through if i have to do it myself aloneвђќ andress chuckled вђњyou may have to but iвђll tell you what see that big gent over there at the bar the one with the elkвђs tooth on his watch chain heвђs got maybe five or six hundred head you could buy lee dauber has eight or nine hundred head i think you can dicker for вђemвђќ вђњthanksвђќ вђњnow hereвђs another thing see that tall goodlookinвђ fellow at the table yonder thatвђs french williams heвђd sell you beef heвђll have seven or eight hundred head but youвђd better leave вђem aloneвђќ вђњwhyвђќ вђњfrench is a mighty peculiar man heвђs a smilinвђ easytalkinвђ friendly man almighty friendly he sells a lot of beef one time or another he must have some uncommonly good bulls because judginвђ by the amount of beef he sells each cow must be havinвђ three calvesвђќ вђњi donвђt want any brands that could be questionedвђќ вђњnobody will question frenchвђs brand anyway he never puts a brand on anything thatвђs ever been branded beforeвђќ andress turned his beer stein on the table and said вђњboy i donвђt know why but i like you what iвђve told you about french could get me killedвђќ вђњi wonвђt repeat itвђќ they sat silent for several minutes and then tom chantry said вђњi know what i am going to doвђќ вђњwhatвђќ вђњiвђm going to buy cattle from those men if they will sell and then i am going to hire french williams to take them through for meвђќ luke andress stared at him then began to chuckle вђњboy youвђve got nerve iвђll say that for you but you be careful of french he wonвђt go into any deal unless he figures to come out aheadвђќ there was no use wasting time if the word had gotten around they all knew he had backed out of a fight with dutch akin and the only thing left for him was either to skip the country or take the bull by the horns he got up excused himself to andress and walked across the room two men sat with french williams and they all looked up when he stopped at their table вђњfrench williams i am tom chantryвђќ french looked up lazily вђњiвђve heard of youвђќ вђњthen they have told you that i backed down for dutch akin the simple facts of the case are that i havenвђt time to go around shooting every tom dick and harry who wants to get drunk and start a fight i came here to buy cattle i hear that you and some of these other gentlemen have cattle for sale iвђve also been told that iвђll never be able to hire a crew to take my herd to the railhead but i donвђt believe it вђњi want to buy what cattle you have for sale and iвђll pay cash for them i will also buy whatever cattle are for sale by any of the other gentlemen in this room on the same termsвђќ вђњand how do you figure to get them to marketвђќ french had scarcely moved he was sitting back in his chair staring up at chantry cool and calculating almost insolent вђњi have been told by various people that you are a shrewd dealer and that you are not to be trustedвђќ his voice was loud enough for others to hear and they were all listening вђњi have heard that anybody who gets into a cattle deal with you will lose his eyeteeth i donвђt believe itвђќ french williamsвђ expression had tightened a little as chantry talked but his eyes had never left tomвђs face вђњyou donвђtвђќ вђњno i do not that is why i am offering you onethird of the sale price of the herd if you will drive my cattle to the railheadвђќ for a moment there was silence in the saloon and then french williams chuckled вђњsit downвђќ he said вђњi want to buy you a drinkвђќ вђњall right and iвђll buy you oneвђќ chantry sat down and williamsвђ black eyes glinted with amusement вђњyou donвђt think iвђll rook youвђќ вђњno i think youвђre a man of your wordвђќ french eyed him curiously вђњyouвђre either a damn fool or youвђre pretty smart well weвђll see whoвђs smart and who isnвђt you think iвђm honest and i think youвђve got sand so iвђll tell you what iвђll do вђњi will take your herd to the railhead for expenses if you will come with us and stay all the way through if you donвђt stay with it i take it all every last steerвђќ french was smiling his black eyes taunting вђњthatвђs the deal take it or leave itвђќ chantry pushed the bottle toward him вђњpour your drink french weвђre in businessвђќ вђњyouвђll take itвђќ вђњof courseвђќ chantry turned toward the bar вђњmr dauber letвђs talk about cattleвђќ lee dauber walked over to the table a glass in his hand вђњi can deliver how do i know you can payвђќ tom chantry placed his letter of credit on the table вђњthere it isвђќ dauber dismissed it with a gesture вђњa piece of paper i go by a manвђs word you backed down for dutch akin how do i know your word is goodвђќ french williams looked up вђњlee i say his word is good any argumentвђќ lee dauber shrugged вђњyour funeral french all right weвђll dicker iвђve got a thousand head give or take a fewвђќ for an hour the talk went on and at the end of it tom chantry held title to twentytwo hundred head of cattle stock for which he had paid with sums drawn from his letter of credit of the money behind that letter of credit only a little of it was his own the remainder belonged to earnshaw and company with luck the drive would take them thirty days perhaps a bit more or less and if he made it through he would have a herd whose price would not be less than fifty thousand dollars of which twothirds would be sheer profit on the other hand if he failed he would lose everything and earnshaw would take a heavy loss he was guessing on the time it would take to get the herd to the railhead for he had never made a drive with cattle although he knew something of the problems involved moreover the railroad was moving west he was not sure french williams knew that and he did not intend to tell him the railroad had been stalled at dodge city for several years because of the financial depression and the inability to raise money for the investment now the rails had started moving again and when he left the railroad he had been assured they could hold to a speed of about a mile a day laying track that might be optimistic what he was going to need was information information for himself alone there was always the chance of some casual traveler relaying the knowledge for it was certainly no secret but rumors had been flying during all the time since construction stopped and many western men had simply given up believing anything until they saw it alone that night in his room tom chantry stretched out on his bed hands clasped behind his head and thought the thing through he was under no illusions about french williams the man was hard as nails and dangerous as a rattler but he was a man of fierce pride and chantry knew he had touched it when he called him a man of his word obviously french was a gambler it was a game of winnertakeall and french was not the kind of man to enjoy losing what he was gambling on was in essence chantryвђs staying quality tom chantry was no fool and he knew that french williams would make it very rough did williams believe him a coward that remained to be seen more likely than not he had no thoughts on the matter and cared less he would test chantryвђs nerve with sadistic pleasure and would be an interested observer of chantryвђs reactions actually french williams was risking only his time and he might like a ride to dodge anyway the risk was all for tom chantry the gain if he won would be great but had he any right to take such a risk with another manвђs money they needed beef badly if they were to continue operations as planned tom chantry considered the gamble he had taken and admitted reluctantly that he had been foolish he had been challenged and like any green kid he had accepted the challenge now he must plan he must try to foresee what french would do the most obvious thing was the old western trick of giving him a bad horse to ride and this he had every right to expect it was usual for any tenderfoot on a cow ranch or a cattle drive to be given a bad horse just as a joke well let them try he had been riding horses since he was a child and even back east he had never quit riding he had handled some pretty bad ones but he doubted that he had tangled with anything like what they could give him out here and he was sure they were even now planning on that he knew it was going to be rough especially as he had taken water for dutch akin no cowhand would consider that anything but cowardice and they would have nothing but contempt for him at daybreak he was up and after a quick breakfast he went to the livery stable and bought two horses both were tough and wellseasoned and he paid premium prices for them he bargained but the horse dealer knew he wanted horses and knew what he wanted them for he got good horses and the price he finally paid was not as bad as he had expected one was a lineback dun the other a blue roan both bigger than the usual cow horse but agile enough the dun was an excellent cutting horse the blue roan was fair both had the look of possessing staying quality вђњwhich iвђd better have myselfвђќ he said to himself he bought a used saddle a blanket and all the essential gear at the general store he bought a slicker a bedroll and a little other equipment вђњyou better have yourself a gunвђќ the storekeeper suggested chantry shook his head smiling вђњi doubt if iвђll need it i will have a winchester though iвђve never killed a buffalo and we might need the meatвђќ he bought a winchester вђ and four hundred rounds of ammunition вђњif i am going to use thisвђќ he commented вђњiвђd better have some practiceвђќ вђњbetter not try it near a cattle herdвђќ the storekeeper said dryly вђњor youвђll have a stampedeвђќ they all thought him a tenderfoot he reflected and in one sense it was true but he was westernborn and a lot had soaked in that stayed with him one did not live in the environment during the impressionable years and not retain something from it his father had been a man who talked of his work and his life and he was a man who had known men and stock who had pioneered in wild country had he been trying even then to instruct his son after all what did a father have to pass on to his children but his own personal reaction to the world of what use was experience if one could not pass on at least a little of what one had learned for the first time tom chantry thought of that and suddenly he was seeing his father in a new light like many another son he had failed to understand the true nature of the man who was his father until he himself began to cope with the problems of which life is made up they were to make their gather and pool the cattle on the vermejo river east and a bit north of cimarron and their drive would begin from there he would go there and join them he would ride his own horses but if they suggested a bad one he would try it he could be thrown but he could also get back on tom chantry decided he knew what to expect and he was prepared for it the trouble was he did not know french williams he knew little enough about the vermejo river only that it began somewhere in the sangre de cristos and flowed down from the mountains across the old santa fe trail to lose itself so far as he knew somewhere in the open country beyond riding the blue roan and leading the dun he started for the camp on the vermejo he told himself he was ready for anything and he was still telling himself that when he spotted the camp under some cottonwoods there was already a good gathering of cattle and he could see various riders bringing in more he passed near one rider a tall lean man with red hair but the rider seemed not to notice him although chantry spoke he rode up to the chuck wagon and swung down french williams was leaning back against his bedroll smiling and it was not a pleasant smile it was taunting challenging showing something that might be contempt and might be curiosity as tom chantry walked forward and started to speak a man came from behind the chuck wagon he stepped out and stopped waiting the man was dutch akin chapter for a moment all action was suspended tom chantry could feel the heavy pounding of his heart and his mouth was dry but when he spoke his voice was clear and steady вђњhello dutch want some coffeeвђќ this was what chantry had not expected yet it was what he might have expected from french williams and it was an indication of the extent to which williams was prepared to go вђњdonвђt mind if i doвђќ dutch said chantry picked up the pot and filled dutchвђs cup then his own вђњsorry about the other night dutchвђќ he said вђњbut i had no reason to kill you and i had no wish to dieвђќ dutch shrugged uncomfortably sober he was not a belligerent man nor was he given to talk if you had a job to do you did it if you had a man to shoot you shot him but talking about it made him uneasy wanting to be away and finished with it вђњвђso all rightвђќ he said gulping the coffee вђњi got no argument with youвђќ french williams sat up if he was disappointed it did not show and tom chantry doubted that he was it had been in the nature of an experiment and had they killed each other he would have been no more disturbed chantry indicated the cattle вђњtheyвђre in good shape some of your stuffвђќ вђњuhhuhвђќ french said вђњtheyвђve been held in the high meadows where thereвђs lots of good gramaвђќ he glanced toward the horses вђњi see you got yourself some horses two wonвђt be enough you knowвђќ chantryвђs expression was bland вђњi had an idea youвђd already selected some mounts for me french so i only bought twoвђќ вђњyouвђd ride a horse iвђd pick for youвђќ вђњwhy not well letвђs just say iвђd tryвђќ the other hands who had been loafing about obviously to see what would happen when he met dutch akin now drifted off about their work tom chantry drank his coffee slowly studying the various men watching the work and enjoying the brief respite from what was to come he was no cowhand and would not attempt to compete with them on their own ground he could round up cattle he could read brands and so could make himself generally useful he would not be an idler it would be wise to move slowly at first to see who could do what and generally become acquainted he had gained no ground by facing dutch he had simply done what had to be done and he knew the hands would be waiting to see what kind of a man he wasвђand most of them he felt sure had made up their minds about that as he watched the cattle the enormity of what he had undertaken slowly came over him his own capital he was free to do with as he saw fit but he had gambled a large sum that belonged to earnshaw and company therefore there was no choice the herd must go through and it must arrive in good shape and be sold to advantage no matter what the cost to him riders were bringing in small bunches of cattle from draws and breaks saddling the dun he rode out and helped here and there at the same time noting the brands all of those being held had come from french williamsвђ own outfit some of the brands were fresh but he saw no evidence of reworking at daybreak he was on the range with the others and was there when lee dauberвђs cattle began to arrive they came divided into three herds for easy handling and dauber moved them along at a good clip these were big rangy steers older than most of williamsвђ stuff and in not as good shape during the following days while the cattle were being brought together for the drive to the railhead he worked hard harder than he had ever worked before he was up before the first streak of light in the morning sky and tumbled into his bedroll when supper was over with the others he stood night guard and in many ways that came to be the best time only three men rode night guard at a time and they were scattered meeting only at intervals as they rode around the sleeping herd it was a time for thinking a time for remembering yet oddly he rarely thought of doris and rarely of his home in the east his thoughts kept reaching back into his boyhood before his father was killed he remembered the hot still hours in the town walking barefooted up the dusty street seeing the tall stillfaced men in boots and spurs sitting along the boardwalk in front of the hotel or seeing them leaning on the corral bars watching the horses the parched brown prairie long without rain the tumbleweeds rolling before the wind under dark rainfilled clouds the blue streaks of a distant rainstorm viewed from far off the call of quail at sundown his father washing his face and hands in the tin basin outside the kitchen door sleeves rolled up showing the white of his arms where the sun never reached he remembered the indians who came to the ranch squatting around near the corral and his father feeding them carrying the food to them himself and the night the wounded brave had ridden up to the house clinging onehanded to his horseвђs mane that was on the old ranch before pa lost it in the big freeze where had that ranch been anyway his memories were mostly from the later period when pa was marshal they had gone back to the ranch once all of them driving in a buckboard вђњthere it is helenвђќ pa had said вђњfifteen years of brutal hard work and a lot of dreams all gone in one freezeвђќ tom chantry remembered the tall old cottonwoods around the house the log cabin his father had built then added to the cold water from the handdug well вђњi planned all this for you tomвђќ his father had said вђњbut i reckoned without the snow and the coldвђќ the old ranch had been somewhere east of here he believed a boy doesnвђt have much sense of location when he is six suddenly he remembered the hole at least that was what he called it there had been a small spring about a mile from the ranch and he had ridden over there once when he was about six the spring came down from under an overhang of rock about two feet off the ground and the water fell into a rock basin trickled over its lip and down into the meadow below where it was again swallowed up some dirt had fallen into the spring from one of the overhanging banks and he was scooping it out with his hands when at the back of the spring where the water ran down from the darkness under the rock he saw the hole actually it was where the water came from but the opening was much bigger than the space taken up by the trickle of water peering back into the deepest shadow he could see the hole was about three feet across and almost that in height he stood barefooted in the cold water and could look back into the hole but could make out nothing looking down at his feet he could just see the light across the water evidently spring rains had shot out of the hole with some force and had gradually worn the rock back until there was space enough for a boy to stand with a long stick he poked into the darkness there was a pool of water where it trickled over the edge but his stick could not reach either wall or roof later with a longer stick he probed the darkness and succeeded in touching rock on the right side of the stream overhead he could find nothing but there was a rock floor on the left of the stream from outside there was no indication of anything like the cave there was only a dip in the prairie a natural runoff for water and a slab of rock was exposed from under which the water ran anyone stopping by for a drink would suspect nothing although a man might enter the opening once he knew of it only a child or a small animal would be likely to find it he named the place the hole and told his father about it all that was long ago he had not thought of the hole for twenty years that he could recall tom chantry gave no orders if he saw anything that needed doing he did it himself or reported it to french he had no friends in the outfit although french talked to him occasionally chantry was puzzled by him of frenchвђs background he knew nothing but somehow the man gave him the impression that he had education and a better background than most of the men in the outfit but french volunteered nothing and tom chantry knew better than to ask in general the men ignored him oddly enough when he did begin to make a friend it was dutch akin of all people it began casually enough he was riding back to the chuck wagon when he saw another rider following a route that would bring them together not until they were too close to turn aside did either recognize the other it was dutch вђњbeautiful country dutchвђќ chantry said dutch merely grunted then after a few minutes of silence he said вђњyou better not rest too easy french is a holy terror heвђs a good man to work for genвђrally speakinвђ but heвђd rather stir up trouble than eat you let down one minute anвђ heвђll be all over youвђќ вђњthanks heвђs not an easy man to understandвђќ вђњthat he ainвђtвђќ dutch agreed dryly вђњbut he knows cows and no man alive is better on a trail than himвђќ then he said вђњmr chantry i ainвђt one to stick my nose in but if we all come up to trouble youвђd best run it french will shoot you right into a range war heвђs quick and he goes hogwild anвђ mean iвђve seen itвђќ вђњthanks againвђќ the horses walked a dozen yards before chantry spoke again вђњdutch do you think iвђm yellow iвђm asking a question not trying to invite a fightвђќ dutch grinned and then he said soberly вђњno i donвђt think nothinвђ of the kind i might have but not after the way you come up to me back there iвђd say you used better judgment than me back in las vegas вђњthe only thing isвђќ he added вђњyou not carryinвђ a gun makes a lot of them think youвђre scared and believe me it wonвђt keep you out of troubleвђќ вђњbut weвђre both alive dutchвђќ вђњuhhuh and if it wasnвђt for you one of us would be dead but that cuts no ice you just plain lucked out with the talrim boys theyвђd shoot you soon as look at youвђќ when they rode into camp together several heads turned but there was no comment french noticed it without smiling he gave the impression of being coiled ready to lash out he was eating when suddenly he put his plate down вђњwe got twentytwo hundred head chantry you want moreвђќ вђњno letвђs move вђem outвђќ вђњdaybreakвђќ вђњyesвђќ вђњfor dodgeвђќ вђњnoвђќ they all looked up then surprised french was the most surprised of all chantry thought for until that time chantry had left all the handling of the cattle to him вђњweвђll take the longer routeвђќ chantry said вђњby way of clifton houseвђќ he realized he could not hope to compare his information about the area with that of french williams but they would not know how much or how little he knew and must proceed accordingly вђњhave it your wayвђќ french said mildly вђњthereвђs more water easier drivesвђќ he grinned at him вђњand it will take longerвђќ tom chantry lay that night looking up at the stars and tired as he was there was little sleep in him the way they would follow had been traveled by cattle herds occasionally more often by pack trains army commands and mountain men but every foot of it was alive with danger and trouble the men with whom he rode were silent toward him they did not trust his courage and were not prepared to respect his leadership most important perhaps he had a partner in whom he must trust to some extent but who had everything to gain by not getting the cattle through on time or at all lying there in the darkness he felt suddenly very much alone but he remembered something his father had said вђњdonвђt ever be afraid of being alone boy the strongest man is he who stands aloneвђќ and then pa had added вђњto just that extent that you lean on somebody or rely on them to that extent you are a weaker manвђќ chapter when the herd moved out in the morning tom chantry rode on ahead the stars were still in the sky and the cattle were a bobbing mass of black without shape or substance then as the gray sky grew paler here and there a horn glistened in reflected light or a balky steer moved out from the herd and had to be shoved back slowly a few of the cattle moved out ahead and the herd strung out along the trail not an impressive sight to anyone who had seen buffalo in their great masses on this same grass but this slim northpointing finger was a symbol of change in the west the cattle could not exist here until the buffalo were gone but in their time many of the cattle would go too even as they displaced the buffalo the forerunners of their own replacements were building shacks and stringing fences west of the mississippi lone cabins appeared with occasionally a barn and a field plowed up better than the others chantry knew what that meant for he had lived in the east the buffalo had to give way to cattle to feed the growing population of eastern cities in their turn the cattle would go because farmers wanted to grow crops they wanted to plant corn wheat and rye on the ground where the grazing grass grew nor could the indian freeroving as he was compete in his hunting and foodgathering existence with the farmer for the indians needed thousands of acres for even a small group to exist and on much less ground the farmer could grow crops for himself and for shipment east tom chantry thought of the disappearing buffalo with regret but he could not deny the inevitable french moved up beside him вђњtheyвђre stringing out well chantry weвђre off to an easy startвђќ after a momentary pause he said вђњwhyвђd you choose the long way the cutoff is much the fastest itвђs drier but we could make it were you scared or just cautiousвђќ вђњmaybe a little of both why take the chanceвђќ french glanced at him вђњit doesnвђt seem to bother you much that the boys think youвђre yellowвђќ chantry felt a quick surge of anger but fought it down his voice was calm when he replied вђњit does bother me thereвђs still enough of the kid in me for it to bother a lot but iвђve got enough man in me not to be a damn fool about itвђќ вђњyou canвђt duck a showdown you can only postpone itвђќ вђњmaybe but when the showdown comes youвђll be the first to knowвђќ french looked at him sharply вђњare you saying that when you have a showdown itвђll be with meвђќ вђњthatвђs hardly likely i need you to get to dodge anyway iвђm not a gunfighting man remember thatвђќ вђњiвђll be damned if i can figure you out chantry you talk like a man with sand but you sure donвђt act up to itвђќ вђњfrench this will be a long drive you know that better than i do if iвђm to get these cattle through iвђd better stay alive and i want you alive tooвђќ вђњwhat if it comes to gun troubleвђќ вђњthey tell me youвђre the fastest man in the country iвђll leave the gunfighting to youвђќ french williams couldnвђt leave it alone вђњbut you can shoot i mean youвђre packing a winchester whyвђќ вђњmeat weвђve men to feed and i donвђt want to butcher my own cattle if i can help itвђќ вђњcan you hit anythingвђќ вђњwellвђќ chantry said seriously вђњthe man who sold me the rifle said that if iвђd point it in the right direction iвђd have a pretty good chance of course he said iвђd have to hold steady iвђll give it a try sometimeвђќ french was silent uncertain whether chantry was serious or not вђњwhat else did they tell you about meвђќ he asked finally вђњyou know what theyвђd be likely to say that your cows were the best in the country giving you four or five calves a year that sort of thingвђќ french grinned вђњmaybe iвђm just luckyвђќ he said he stood in his stirrups to scan the country ahead вђњwhyвђd you pick me thenвђќ вђњbecause they said you might steal a manвђs cows but youвђd never cheat at cards they said whatever else you were you were a man of your word also they said you had guts and knew cattle i decided you were the man i wantedвђќ french swung his horse and rode back along the line of the drive chantry after a moment of hesitation rode on ahead at a fast trot he wanted to see the country and if anybody was coming down the trail he wanted to see them first he needed to know needed desperately to know about that railroad he topped out on the low ridge that crossed the trail far off to the east he could see a moving black patch some scattered black spots that must be buffalo nearer there was nothing the sky was fantastically clear no clouds and a view that carried the eye away to a vast distance the roan tugged at the bit eager to be moving but chantry waited studying the land this was what he must do he must learn to see not merely to look we must learn to recognize the things at which he looked and to draw conclusions from them out here a manвђs life might depend upon it despite his feelings about carrying a gun he found himself occasionally wishing he had one it was a kind of insurance now feeling alone upon the plains facing the situation in which he had placed himself he had time to be afraid he could not help but think of what he was risking for himself and for earnshaw gambling that he could stay with the herd to its shipping point the presence of dutch akin was a hint as to the lengths to which french williams would go to drive him off had french expected him to turn tail and run it was more than likely but he had not run and now the next move was up to french turning in his saddle he looked back at the long line of cattle he was more than a mile in advance of the drive and from where he sat he could see it to advantage the men riding drag appeared only occasionally through the dust but the flankers on either side he could see easily and the two men riding point off to the east was the chuck wagon and not far behind it the wranglers with the horse herd twentytwo hundred head give or take a few and fifteen men to ride herd on themвђ sixteen including himself and ahead of them twenty to thirty daysвђ drive depending on conditions and on how far west the railroad had progressed aside from choosing the destination he could do little in the way of planning their final destination was in his hands the management of the herd and the men was up to french the season was well along here and there water holes would be drying up but for most of the early part of the drive they would be near the canadian or some of its branches to the east was buffalo country and indian country as well and before very long they must turn east at no time would they be safe either from indians or from rustlers chantry did not believe french would try to steal the herd too many people knew the circumstances of their bargain and french would deem it a personal failure to win by any means other than driving chantry from the herd or so chantry believed for that reason he must be wary of tricks searching back into his childhood he tried to remember the tricks played by cowboys on trail drives or roundups the bucking horse was the first and most obvious and chantry was sure that would come his way again the rattlesnake in the blankets was another or something that might appear to be a snake worst of all he had no friends in the crew and akin was the only one who even took the time to talk to him but that might change slowly he studied them in his mind trying to pick out the ones who might at least stand for fair play mckay a short stocky man with a shock of rusty brown curls and a hardboned face he was twentyfour or comfive a firstclass bronc stomper and a good hand with cattle a steady man asking no favors of anyone doing his share of the work and a little more he packed a gun and by all accounts could use it helvie a quietmannered man somewhat reserved and four or five years older than mckay a good hand from illinois four years a soldier in the frontier cavalry a year as a freighter and four years a cowhand hayden gentry called hay gent from uvalde down in texas his family among the first settlers west of the neuces long lean and tough as mule hide easygoing full of humor and fast with a gun so it was said nobody wanted to be known as good with a gun around french not unless he was a troublehunter rugger kincaid and koch were good hands but they were cronies of french and probably not one of them had been born with the name he was using a bad lot as were most of the others chantry rode on the grass was dry but there was plenty of it twice he saw buffalo but only a few and those were scattered out evidently they were on the outer edges of the great herd or were forerunners of the herd the country was open slightly rolling ahead loomed eagle rock near where they expected to bed down for the night twice chantry drew up he had the eerie uncomfortable feeling of being watched but he could see nothing hear nothing nor was there any movement within sight only the brown grass on an occasional slope being bent by the wind there were no fresh tracks suddenly wary he swung his horse and rode off to the west scouting for sign he found nothing tracks of buffalo occasionally old horse tracks he stood in his stirrups and looked off toward the breaks of the canadian not far to the east the creeks that flowed into the river had cut deep at places and the sides were lined with heavy growth of trees and brush in those breaks chantry reflected an army could be hidden it was something to consider he was high on a grassy hill with nothing in sight for a far distance when he heard the cryвђa faint choking cry like nothing human and it came from not far off the roan head up ears pricked looked off toward the right toward the breaks of the canadian chantry waited listening had it been human or animal and if an animal what kind could make such a sound suddenly he was sure the cry was human turning his horse he started in the direction the roan had looked and peered ahead for the first glimpse of whatever it was he looked around slowly studying the surroundings with infinite care it might be a trap he did not believe all he had heard of indians but he was cautious by nature his horse walked forward taking each step gingerly as if ready to bolt obviously the roan did not like what it sensed was near chantryвђs inclination was to turn and ride away swiftly for what lay before him was terror perhaps horror instinctively he knew he should escape while it was still possible but something urged him on to see what for a moment chantry thought he could ride back warn them of something ahead and then approach this place with a dozen riders yet what if there was nothing he would have shown himself to be both a coward and a fool no he knew he could not go back and he rode on walking his horse he could feel its reluctance in the tenseness of its muscles its urge to turn away suddenly they topped the low rise and he was looking into a shallow place that sloped away with increasing steepness toward the river but chantry did not see that all he saw was the man staked out before him he dismounted and took a step nearer the man was stripped naked hands and legs outspread each ankle and each wrist tied to a stake already the sun had turned the white flesh a deep red in ugly burns but burns could be as nothing to him for he had been horribly mutilated in each thigh there was a deep gash along the top of the muscle from the hip to the knee his stomach had been cut open and piled full of rock the sides of his face were cut and the muscles of his biceps for a frozen moment tom chantry stared shocked motionless and then of a sudden his horse shied violently turning sharply he saw himself facing half a dozen indians he saw them saw their hands still bloody from the deed before them and realized his rifle was in its scabbard on the saddle it was no more than six feet away but it might have been as many miles if he made a move toward it they could kill him would they before him was the evidence they had killed this man no doubt he had fought them no doubt he was an enemy taken in battle as for himself if he was to survive he must face them down he spoke suddenly keeping his tone moderate вђњthis was not a good thing to doвђќ he said speaking carefully вђњone man could do you no harmвђќ one of the indians spoke surprisingly in english вђњhe do nothing to us we find track we follow we killвђќ вђњwhyвђќ the indian appeared to think the question foolish he replied simply вђњwhy notвђќ вђњg i will bury himвђќ вђњall rightвђќ the indian said something to the others and they chuckled вђњall right you bury only him not dead yetвђќ then admiringly вђњhe strong man he no cry no beg he laugh he swear strong manвђќ what was he saying the tortured man was not dead вђњi will bury himвђќ he repeated вђњyou goвђќ вђњwe watchвђќ the indian replied then he said вђњyou strong like himвђќ вђњgoвђќ he said fighting down the horror and the fear that crept up within him вђњgвђќ and surprisingly they went he stood for a moment staring after them not willing to accept what his eyes told him then from behind him there was a shuddering groan chantry turned sharply the tortured man said вђњif you got any water iвђd like itвђќ the tone was calm controlled вђњyouвђyouвђre aliveвђќ вђњit ainвђt for long you git me that water and iвђll be obligedвђќ chantry turned swiftly to his horse and the canteen on the saddle horn kneeling beside the man he held it to his lips feverishly the man drank for a moment he lay quiet and then he said вђњi reckon thatвђs the best thing i ever tastedвђќ вђњiвђll untie you iвђllвђвђњ вђњno donвђt you pay it no mindвђќ the eyes opened and looked at him calmly вђњiвђm dead man canвђt you seeвђќ and then he added вђњi beat вђem i beat those red devils at their own game i never whimpered вђњyou tell вђem that at the fortвђќ his voice was suddenly hoarse вђњyou tell вђem mcguinness never whimpered tell вђem thatвђќ вђњthe chuck wagon is comingвђќ chantry said вђњwe have medicine weвђвђњ вђњdonвђt be a damn foolвђќ the man said вђњyou tell вђem at the fort you tell вђemвђвђњ his voice faded away and his eyes suddenly were still chantry straightened to his feet the man was dead chapter вђњis he goneвђќ chantry faced sharply around french williams dutch akin gent helvie and koch were on the rise behind him all carried rifles вђњhow could he be aliveвђќ вђњthere wasnвђt much give in himвђќ hay gent commented вђњa man like that might live through anythingвђќ вђњride to the wagon dutchвђќ williams said вђњand bring up a shovel weвђll do the honorsвђќ he glanced at helvie вђњyou want to say the words or shall we let chantryвђќ вђњnoвђќ koch shouted вђњiвђll be damned if he will not over a man who died like thatвђќ chantry felt himself go sick with shame then fury suddenly he was in a killing rage вђњkochвђќ he said вђњiвђllвђвђњ вђњshut upвђќ french laid his voice across them like a lash вђњhelvie will read chantry youвђd better get back to the wagon while youвђre all togetherвђќ chantry stood stiff his anger vanished in the cold awareness that only williamsвђ intervention had saved him from another shooting situation вђњall right but i hope you will notice that i was unarmed yet the indians did not attack me if this man had done the same perhapsвђвђњ helvie interrupted impatiently вђњhe was unarmed too canвђt you see it didnвђt save him if youвђll look at the tracks we followed them here they raced beside him striking bedeviling him then they began the torture вђњthis man was a soldierвђa deserter perhaps he had no gun they killed his horse didnвђt you hear what the indian said the man had done nothing to them he was a stranger therefore an enemy they were kiowas it did not matter that this man was a white man had he been a ute he would have fared no betterвђќ вђњyou heard them you were hereвђќ вђњwhy do you think they rode away because you were nice and peaceful they left because they saw our guns on them from right over that ridge we werenвђt begging a fight and under the conditions neither were theyвђќ french turned his back on him and walked away as akin appeared with a shovel tom chantry hesitated then swung into the saddle he had made a fool of himself had not the others come when they did he might now be lying dead beside that dead man still how could he know nonetheless he was displeased with himself in their eyes he had come off badly at best he had been inadequate and he did not like the feeling that he was despised they were competent men who knew their jobs men of proven courage and stamina accepted by each other he had proved nothing to anyone not even to himself in their eyes he was a man who failed to measure up they did not think him worthy to read the final words over a dead man it was hard to take and he rode back to camp ate and turned in clifton house lay ahead and there might be news with luck the drive might be a short one clifton house was a stage stop and a gathering place for cattle suddenly before falling asleep he made up his mind he would ride on ahead reach clifton house well before the herd and gather what information was available undoubtedly the herd would stop for the night not far from there but he might learn whatever was known in time to change their route at daybreak he told williams вђњiвђm riding to clifton house iвђm expecting mail thereвђќ вђњbetter take somebody along to wipe your noseвђќ koch remarked вђњthereвђs some mighty mean men hang out at cliftonвђќ from one of the others he might have ignored it but koch was a sour mean man with no breath of goodness in him and after his remark of the day before tom chantry was in no mood for any more of it he put down his cup вђњkochвђќ he said вђњi donвђt believe in killing men iвђve no such feelings about giving one a whipping when he asks for itвђќ for a moment the camp was slackjawed with amazement koch stared at him вђњyou gone crazy are you talkinвђ to meвђќ вђњto youвђќ chantry got to his feet вђњjust take off your gun beltвђќ koch had the reputation of being a fistfighter and he liked to be known for it he put down his plate and unbuckled his belt вђњthis hereвђќ he said вђњis goinвђ to give me pleasureвђќ he got up placing his gun belt on the ground and he swung from that position the blow was totally unexpected and caught chantry on the chin his heels flew up and he hit the dust on the back of his shoulders koch rushing up to stamp on him the cowpuncherвђs first kick was launched too soon and caught chantry on the shoulder it was the first time he had ever been kicked and suddenly he realized that all he knew of fighting would do him no good unless he got into action fast rolling over he lunged to a crouching position and dived at koch the cowboy had been expecting chantry to try to stand erect and the sudden lunge made him step back quickly on his highheeled boots he staggered and chantry smashed into him tom chantry was lean and strong and in good shape he had boxed and wrestled a lot but simply for fun he had had only two fights since he was a man both of them in the stockyards where he bought cattle but the men with whom he had boxed and wrestled had been above average and he knew how to handle himself ugly with anger at being knocked into the dust koch was up quickly he swung a looping right chantry saw it coming and stepped inside smashing a right to the ribs that made the larger man gasp koch grabbed him tried to butt then stamped on chantryвђs instep with his boot heel a stabbing pain went through chantryвђs foot and jerking back he threw the cowhand over his hip with a rolling hiplock koch sprang to his feet and came in fast he hit chantry high on the cheek bone splitting the skin another blow caught chantry on the chin tom staggered blocked a blow with his elbow and countered with a stiff right to the body he was warmed up now and suddenly he felt good this was something he could do and he liked to do it koch at about oneninety was twenty pounds the heavier man but he was slower a skilled roughandtumble fighter he knew nothing of boxing and less of defense tom chantry had caught three brutally hard punches and was still on his feet he had been down but he had gotten up he was sure koch had hit him as hard as he was likely to and he had taken the punches and was still coming he sidestepped as koch swung and hit the bigger man in the belly but made no effort to follow it up koch wheeled and came in slowly looking for an opening tom feinted at the ribs and when koch dropped his hand he hit him on the ear splitting it and showering him with blood when kochвђs hands came up tom whipped an uppercut to the wind his timing was right now koch might be a good man with a gun and a brawler with some success but tom was realizing now that boxing was not in kochвђs experience he struck a stiff left to the face and repeated it he feinted another then struck to the wind koch moved in and suddenly kicked for the groin chantry saw it just in time and stepping back tripped over an extended leg whose leg he did not know he staggered and fell and koch stamped at his head rolling away from kochвђs boot heel chantry caught a vicious backward kick from kochвђs mexican spur driven into the face chantry lunged up from the ground the viciousness of the attack appalled and infuriated him he brushed a punch aside and smashed both hands to kochвђs face in short wicked hooks and then as the man staggered back chantry broke his nose with an overhand right blood was running down the side of his face but tom chantry had no thought now but to destroy he feinted smashed another right to the already broken nose then hooked both hands to the wind in short lifting punches and an overhand right to the side of the neck koch staggered and chantry moved in left and right to the face koch fell back against the chuck wagon and tom uppercut to the wind then smashed another right to the face koch started to fall but chantry caught him by the shirt and held him while he hit him in the face then he dropped him into the dust chantry turned looking at the men crowded around вђњi donвђt believe in killingвђќ he said вђњbut that doesnвђt mean i am yellow or afraid to fight if anybody has any argument they can step out nowвђќ french had been sitting back one leg crossed over the other he uncrossed them now and stood up вђњyouвђll leave us shorthanded chantry so you better leave it as it isвђќ he looked at the holes in chantryвђs face made by the spur вђњhe drove it deep you better have that looked atвђќ chantry went to his horse and leaned his head into the saddle his breath coming in great tearing gasps slowly his breathing came back to normal and he began to feel the cuts and bruises he took water from the barrel on the chuck wagon and bathed his face and his raw knuckles he had nothing with which to treat the deep cuts in his cheek so he bathed it with whiskey then he returned to his horse swung into the saddle and rode away his knuckles were raw and bleeding when out of sight of the herd he turned toward the canadian and at a small branch that flowed down to the river he dismounted to wash the blood from his hands suddenly he looked up and saw an indian in a black hat standing on the other bank watching him his rifle was still in its scabbard a dozen yards away in his confusion after the fight and in his desire to bathe his knuckles he had not remembered to keep the rifle with him the indian had he wanted to could have killed him by now tom got slowly to his feet and the indian said вђњme pawnee friendвђќ chantry jerked his head to indicate the cattle out of sight and some distance away вђњi ride with the cattleвђќ вђњyou have fightвђќ вђњyesвђќ and with satisfaction he added вђњi wonвђќ the pawnee sat down on a rock and took out the makings when chantry refused them he began to build a cigarette he gestured with the cigarette вђњthat is french williamsвђќ вђњyesвђќ вђњhis herdвђќ вђњmine if i get to the railroad on time if i donвђt stay with him all the way it becomes hisвђќ the pawnee looked at him вђњhe do thisвђќ вђњno a man named koch i brought it on myselfвђќ вђњmaybeвђќ the indian lit his cigarette вђњkoch a bad man i knowвђќ tom chantry was trying to remember what he knew of the pawnees great fighting men among the best trackers and they worked with white men as allies he studied the indian but his decision was already formed and he liked what he saw вђњyou gamble bigвђќ the pawnee said and added вђњyou do not go to dodgeвђќ вђњwilliams wanted to but iвђve heard the railroad was coming on west i did not tell him that and i do not believe he knows they have started building again i think if we drive north then east we will meet itвђќ the pawnee considered вђњbut they are his men i think he will leave you he will take his men what you do with cattle thenвђќ вђњiвђll drive the herd aloneвђќ he was talking nonsense and knew it вђњor find some other ridersвђќ he got to his feet вђњare you riding toward cliftonвђsвђќ вђњyesвђќ вђњride with me tell me about the countryвђќ and he added вђњmy father used to tell me the pawnees were the bravest of warriors he told me of the fight at pawnee rockвђќ вђњit was a fightвђќ вђњi am tom chantryвђќ вђњsun chiefвђќ they rode for over an hour in silence and when cliftonвђs was in sight chantry said вђњyou want to work for meвђќ вђњto herd cattle with french williams noвђќ вђњto scout for meвђќ he drew up вђњfind the railroad and tell me where it is check the water holes and tell me where there is water i would not want you to come into camp at all report to me when you can but where no one will seeвђќ he smiled вђњsun chief i want you to be my ace in the holeвђќ вђњall right i doвђќ tom chantry reached in his pocket and withdrew a gold piece вђњyou ride for me and you will get another like thisвђќ вђњi do you keep you pay all when finishвђќ he pulled off вђњi ride nowвђќ clifton house loomed ahead and tom chantry trotted his horse toward it the stage had just stopped and some people were getting down one of them was a girl chapter tom chantry rode up to clifton house and left his roan at the hitching rail he glanced at the other horses six saddled horses and a buckboard he had not yet acquired the westernersвђ habit of noting brands he went up the steps to the firstfloor porch and entered the door several men standing at the bar turned to glance at him but none offered a greeting or comment what his business was remained his business no matter how curious they might be chantry ordered a beer then turned to the man beside him вђњjoin meвђќ вђњthanksвђќ he was a longgeared man in shotgun chaps and denim jacket a faded blue shirt and a tieddown gun вђњitвђs a dry countryвђќ the man added вђњiвђm heading north do you know the country along the picketwireвђќ вђњsome i just come over itвђќ вђњwater up thereвђќ вђњenough but no more than enough the range is dryinвђ upвђќ he lifted the beer вђњsaludвђќ вђњcheersвђќ chantry drank then said вђњiвђm tom chantry driving north with a trail herdвђќ вђњbone mccarthy iвђm driftinвђвђќ they talked in a desultory fashion but with half his attention chantry was listening for mention of the railroad вђњseems a shameвђќ mccarthy was saying вђњwhatвђќ вђњthem injuns takinвђ the country off вђem in good times it mustвђve been a fine life they had huntinвђ and fishinвђ or driftinвђ down the country on the trail of the buffalo i ainвђt sure what weвђll do to the country will be any betterвђќ вђњhave you lived among themвђќ вђњbrought up around вђem iвђve fought вђem off anвђ on since i was a kid and theyвђre good fighters maybe the bestвђќ вђњbut weвђve whipped them the army has i meanвђќ вђњlucked out iвђd say mighty few injuns have rifles and never enough ammunition to last out a fight but you never seen their like for creepinвђ crawlinвђ beinвђ where they ainвђt expected вђњit wonвђt be at war that the white man whips вђem heвђll beat them with his storebought things when the injun made all he needed he had no troubles to speak of but the white man showed him all sorts of things he was greedy for and now he wants вђem he has to get вђem by war or by tradeвђќ вђњwhiskeyвђќ вђњthatвђs the least of it believe me knives guns pots pans and such the indian was whipped the first time a white trader came amongst them to trade with things the injun couldnвђt make with his own handsвђќ вђњi hadnвђt looked at it that wayвђќ bone mccarthy took a swallow of his beer вђњyouвђre ridinвђ with a herd whoseвђќ вђњmine if i can stay with it to the railhead french williams is trail bossвђќ вђњwilliams you got you a live one amigo heвђs hell on wheels with a gunвђќ вђњdo you know himвђќ вђњcanвђt say i do but thereвђs talk goes up the trail what did you mean when you said it was your herd if you stayed with itвђќ chantry explained and to leave nothing out he coolly told why he was forced to make such a deal and also spoke of his feelings about guns mccarthy listened in silence it was obvious that the others at the bar or some of them heard what chantry was saying he did not care he had acted as he saw fit вђњyouвђre carryinвђ some bruises did you get throwedвђќ вђњno because i wasnвђt anxious to shoot a man named koch questioned my courage we had a bit of a goaround i whipped himвђќ he drank his beer the conversation along the bar began again and chantry asked mccarthy вђњdid you ever run across a pawnee named sun chiefвђќ вђњuhhuh good man he was one of major northвђs pawnee scouts got wounded and had to drop out heard he was up and around againвђќ вђњi hired him to scout the trail for me the trail to the railheadвђќ вђњyou takinвђ on anybody else iвђm rustlinвђ workвђќ tom chantry drained his glass вђњmccarthy you heard my story iвђm not a man who believes in guns and there are some who think iвђm yellow you still want to join meвђќ mccarthy shrugged вђњevery manвђs entitled to think the way he chooses the way i see it i think youвђre wrong and i think the timeвђll come when youвђll pay for it what youвђre sayinвђ is that i got to take my own chances that youвђd back me up in a tight spot ainвђt that itвђќ chantry felt anger stir within him and with it a feeling of resentment why could things never be simple yet what would he do if it came to that supposing he was caught in a situation where he must fight or die or worse still where he must fight or one of his men would die вђњyouвђd have to gamble on it mccarthyвђќ he said вђњi believe a lot more can be done by reason than by gunsвђќ вђњall right you trust to reasonвђќ mccarthy said вђњbut you wonвђt mind if i wear my guns will youвђќ вђњas you like iвђm not a reformerвђќ mccarthy lifted his beer вђњluckвђќ he said вђњyouвђre sure agoinвђ to need itвђќ he ordered another beer вђњthisвђll have to be the lastвђќ he said вђњi ainвђt carryinвђ any more moneyвђќ when the beer arrived he said вђњnow that iвђm workinвђ for you what do i doвђќ вђњbring your beer alongвђќ chantry suggested вђњand weвђll sit over there at the table iвђm going to order us a couple of dinners and youвђre going to tell me every way you can think of that williams might use to drive me off the herdвђќ for an hour they talked bone mccarthy was a cool knowledgeable man with much experience on cattle drives and roundups he ran through the possible ruses one by one bad horses indian scares maybe a rattlesnake in the bed вђњhe may even have put koch up to jumpinвђ you itвђs the sort of thing he might doвђќ after a while mccarthy was silent but he seemed to have something on his mind that he hesitated to say вђњwhat is itвђќ chantry asked bone looked up at him then filled both their coffee cups вђњyou know damn well what heвђll do chantry heвђll have somebody brace you with a gun heвђll catch you when youвђre armed and youвђll have no excuseвђќ вђњi simply wonвђt shootвђќ bone stared at him вђњyou donвђt seem to read the signвђќ he said вђњif you donвђt shoot heвђll kill you whoever french williams gets to bully you into a fight it wonвђt matter one damn what you do whether you drop your gun or whatever heвђll shoot and shoot to killвђќ вђњheвђd kill me for that herdвђќ вђњyou must be dreaminвђ man of course he will heвђd kill his whole outfit for that herd right now iвђd say the odds are a hundred to one against you makinвђ the next fifty milesвђќ they stopped talking then but tom chantry considered the matter french williams was a known thief he had killed men he might offer an appearance of fair play for the look of the thing but bone was sure to be right somebody who rode with them would challenge him and at his first move would shoot and shoot to kill any move chantry made would be construed as a move for a gunвђa move to shoot the only thing he could do was avoid carrying any weapon at all he said as much mccarthy shrugged вђњworse comes to worst theyвђll get you out on the grass somewheres shoot you and plant a gun on you itвђs been doneвђќ he looked hard at chantry вђњcan you shoot i mean did you ever use a gunвђќ вђњi can shoot iвђve hunted a lotвђќ вђњhow about with a hand gunвђќ вђњyes iвђve used oneвђќ вђњcan you draw i mean can you get a gun out of your holster without dropping itвђќ вђњyes my father showed me when i was a youngster he had me practice but i never liked itвђќ вђњjust get it out and no matter what he does even if you get hit you level that gun and shoot take your time but make that first shot count you may never get another oneвђќ вђњthereвђs no use to talk of it i wonвђt be carrying a gunвђќ вђњwell in case you change your mind you make that first one do the job iвђve seen many a fastdraw artist who got his gun out quickerвђn scat anвђ then put his first bullet right out in the dust betwixt вђem anвђ never got another shotвђќ chantry pushed back from the table вђњhereвђs what i want you to doвђќ he put a twentydollar gold piece on the table вђњget yourself some grub and then you keep an eye on the herd you see whatever goes on but you keep out of sight if anything happens that you think i ought to know you get in touch with me iвђll be riding out from the herd every dayвђќ вђњall rightвђќ bone mccarthy stood up вђњyou watch yourself do you hearвђќ the tawny plains swept away in all directions a gently rolling stretch of grama and buffalo grass with patches of greasewood over some of the higher levels the plain was dotted with spanish bayonet or yucca far off the moving black mass of a small herd of buffalo showed against a brown slope and in a gully the stark white of scattered bones the herd was behind him again and he rode warily without his rifle carrying only the bowie knife he carried for work around the camp or casual use his eyes swept the horizon hesitating here and there but nothing moved the dust held no tracks and when he came up to the river bed he saw that it was dry and cracked into platesized slabs of gray mud baked and crisp no water chantry mopped the sweat from his face and squinted his eyes against the sun it was midafternoon and the herd had been without water since daybreak there had been an expectation of water at this place french williams had mentioned casually in an offhand manner that they would water here had he known the creek was dry chantry suspected it but had no way of knowing it was twenty miles to the next water which meant a dry camp tonight with a parched and restless herd hard to hold he glanced at the sun had they swung farther west williams was pointing the herd now this morning it had been koch williams knew far more about the ways of cattle on a drive than chantry would ever know and he had driven over this country before whether by this route or not chantry did not know undoubtedly the man had a plan of operation and was not proceeding in a haphazard manner he was a cool head seemingly reckless and careless but chantry had quickly divined that the gunman was basically cautious he scanned the horizon again here at the river bank there was a little brush and further away there were trees turning his horse down the dry watercourse he walked it slowly toward the trees there might be water down there some isolated pool where he could at least water his horse even while his senses were alert to the surroundings he was considering his problem he now had two assets in sun chief and bone mccarthy neither of them known to french williams but his greatest asset was the fact that french williams underrated him considered him a tenderfoot he on his part was aware that williams was a dangerous and treacherous adversary that is he knew from his own guesses and from what mccarthy had said and it was enough to make him cautious tall cottonwoods suddenly loomed ahead and the watercourse was so narrow that he could no longer proceed ahead of him it narrowed into a rocky channel impassable for a horse and fell off sharply into a canyon he rode up the bank and into the trees there in their dappling shade he paused to listen the cottonwoods rustled somewhere a crow cawed into the hot afternoon and then he heard a low murmur followed by a faint clink as of metal on metal dismounting he tied his horse with a slipknot and walked cautiously forward moving from tree to tree back in the east he had often stalked game in the woods and he knew how to move quietly suddenly the ground dropped away before him and he was looking into a small grassy park scattered with cottonwoods with willows growing along the streambed near the edge of the willows two men sprawled lazily near a dying fire they were too far off to identify them but he had no need for their horses were grazing nearby and one of them was the horse he had ridden out of las vegas the talrim boys hank and bud talrim who had taken his horse at gun point he drew back and carefully made his way to his horse mounting he rode back the way he had come what were the talrim boys doing here of course they might have gone anywhere but they were escaping from the law and one would imagine they would keep on running instead they had for some reason circled back and were now here close by his herd curious he rode back to the herd switched his saddle to his other horse and rode out again glancing back he saw williams staring after him but he rode ahead directly east from the herd cutting for sign he had gone only three miles when he found itвђthe tracks of two riders tracks not many hours old and one set was the tracks of his own horse all right so they had come up from the south but that was necessary for when he had met them they were heading south he backtracked them for several miles on a route parallel to the herd on at least one occasion they had ridden high enough on a low hill to look over and watch the herd in itself that meant nothing they could have heard the lowing of the cattle and simply come to take a look on the other hand it was worth thinking about was it simply coincidence he had to remember that french williams had gone to the trouble of locating and hiring dutch akin had he somehow gotten in touch with the talrim boys were they to be his ace in the hole they were known murderers wanted men would they kill for hire they would they would even kill simply to kill he swung his horse from their trail and started back to the drive for the first time he found himself wanting a gun he was a fool he told himself with such men as the talrims one did not reason one did not sit down and discuss their mutual problems because there were none these men were killers this was a different land from the east ruled by a different set of principles the circumstances and conditions were different it was a land to which law had not yet come nor the restraints that society can exercise upon its members heretofore he had been protected one man of many who were protected by law by the pressures of society by fear of retribution he had not had to fear for other men stood between him and danger but here there were no such men a man was expected to stand on his own feet to protect himself he was realizing how cheap are the principles for which we do not have to fight how easy it is to establish codes when all the while our freedom to talk had been fought forand bled for by others tom chantry was no fool he had won his battle with dutch akin by restraint and reason but he was wise enough to know that neither of these would prevail against such men as the talrim boys reason or restraint would seem weakness to them and they were the kind to strike quickly when they discovered weakness they had been quick to take his horse when they discovered he did not carry a gun and they had shot at him almost casually as an afterthought not caring greatly whether they killed or not he looked off in the direction in which his cattle had gone then touched his spur lightly to his horseвђs ribs he would go back it was time there were decisions to be made chapter the cattle moved north with the rising of the sun stirring the dust across the shortgrass prairies blue grama with occasional patches of little bluestem and curlyleaved sedge and on some slopes a scattering of prickly pear the cattle moved slowly grazing as they walked and tom chantry rode the drag considering his problem dutch akin switched horses and rode back to join him lifting a hand as he passed hitching his bandana over his nose to keep out the dust it was very hot mckay went by circling to bring a bunchquitter back to the drive when he had driven the steer where he belonged he dropped back riding beside chantry they had fallen back to be clear of some of the dust and to keep an eye on any laggards that might cut out for the flanks вђњquite a whippinвђ you gave kochвђќ mckay commented вђњanвђ he had it cominвђвђќ вђњthereвђs a differenceвђќ chantry said вђњbetween a man who doesnвђt want to kill anybody and a man whoвђs afraid he just wasnвђt reading the sign rightвђќ вђњyou be carefulвђќ mckay said вђњheвђs been talkinвђ that it ainвђt overвђќ at the nooning chantry rode in to switch horses and got his saddle on the little buckskin that was one of the horses allotted for him to ride he planned to scout wide of the herd that day as he went to the wagon for his rifle as he stepped up to the wagon he heard koch grumbling about something nearby then heard his voice suddenly grow quiet he read nothing into it but had just drawn his rifle clear of the wagon when koch said вђњall right you blasted tenderfoot now you got a gun turn anвђ start shootinвђвђќ the rifle barrel was in tomвђs left hand which gripped it close to the foresight koch was not more than a dozen feet from him and tom wheeled sharply swinging the rifle as he came around he let it go sending it flying toward the big manвђs face koch ducked and tom chantry lunged at him the big man staggered caught his balance and swung the gun around but it went off of itself before he brought it into line with the smashing report the cattle suddenly lunged and were running chantry hit koch with his shoulder knocked him sprawling then fell on him knees in the big manвђs belly without moving a knee chantry swung two hard punches at his face then he leaped back and as koch started to rise smashed him in the face with his knee men had leaped to the saddle and were plunging after the stampeding cattle which were frightened by the sudden shot chantry waited a moment for koch to get up but thoroughly angry now he walked up to him and struck him twice in the face before koch could lift his hands hit him in the belly and then when he started to fall forward brought a hammer blow down on his kidneys вђњyouвђre fired kochвђќ he said вђњget your outfit and get out i donвђt ever want to see you around again anywhereвђќ chantry picked up his rifle and walked to his horse he rode out swept wide and began gathering cattle pushing them toward the center he gathered about twenty head and then came upon a bunch that had slowed to a walk and started them all back hay gent joined him with a dozen head вђњwhat happened back thereвђќ gent asked вђњwith koch i whipped him again and then i fired himвђќ вђњwhat if he wonвђt stay firedвђќ вђњhe willвђќ вђњbut if he donвђtвђќ вђњthen iвђll whip him again and again until he stays firedвђќ gent made no comment and they drove the cattle in meeting mckay helvie and rugger also bringing in cattle it was the work of hours but slowly the cattle were all gathered вђњweвђll move onвђќ french said вђњmaybe thereвђs water up aheadвђќ he looked around вђњwhereвђs kochвђќ they were all listening вђњi fired himвђќ chantry replied вђњthat shot started the stampede this is no place to be settling personal grudgesвђќ williams looked at him thoughtfully вђњweвђll be shorthandedвђќ he said and he added вђњheвђll carry a grudge likely heвђll lay for youвђќ вђњheвђll have company thenвђќ chantry said вђњwhatвђs that meanвђќ williams asked quickly вђњmen leave tracks french iвђm not so much a tenderfoot that i canвђt read signвђќ they were all looking at him but he left it at that and the cattle started to move riding out from the herd he found a promontory and rode cautiously up the side to look over the ridge and survey the country a few miles ahead and off to the right of the trail there was a hollow with a touch of deeper green half an hour later he came up to it a wide slough boggy along the sides but with water aplenty skirting it he found it had a gravelly shore and turned back to guide the herd вђњwaterвђќ french was skeptical вђњi donвђt know of any water around hereвђќ вђњyou do nowвђќ chantry said вђњhay turn the herdвђќ hay gent glanced at williams who merely shrugged so the herd swung by the time the cattle had watered and a few head had been snaked out of the mud it was coming on to sundown and over by the chuck wagon there was a fire going there was little talk around the fire the men were dogtired and when they had eaten they hunted their bedrolls french alone loitered at the fire smoking from time to time he glanced across at tom chantry вђњyou are a difficult man my friendвђќ he said at last вђњwhatever else you may be you are not a cowardвђќ вђњthanksвђќ вђњi will win however itвђs a long way to dodgeвђќ вђњit is thatвђќ chantry looked up from his coffee вђњand when you get there iвђll be with youвђќ frenchвђs gaze hardened then he laughed вђњyou might be at thatвђќ he replied cheerfully вђњand if you are iвђll give you credit for itвђќ вђњyouвђll need the creditвђќ chantry replied вђњiвђll have the cashвђќ he got a plate and his food and sat down a bit away from the fire if they didnвђt accept him the hell with themвђhe could go his own way but there was something in him that was different now he had grown harder tougher the wide plains and the long winds of morning were having their effect but french williams the talrim boys and koch had contributed yes and sparrow back there at las vegas and bone mccarthy at cliftonвђs these men had experienced far more living in the west than he had perhaps he thought reluctantly perhaps his thinking needed a bit of revision how much of what he believed about not using guns was left over from that bitter day when they brought his father home on a shutter or was it what his mother had taught him deep in grief over the death of his father she had shrunk from the possibility of such an end for her son killing was wrongвђon that score he could not change however there was no law here except the law enforced by men with guns and did such men as the talrims and even such men as williams himself understand any other law if a man would not put restrictions upon himself if he would not conform to the necessary limits that allow people to live together in peace then he must not be allowed to infringe on the liberties of those who wanted to live in peace and that might lead to violence even to killing the trouble was that back east men had lived so long in a society that demanded order and conformity that they failed to understand that there were societies where violence was the rule and where there were men to whom only the fear of retribution placed a bridle on their license but tom chantry knew there was more than his father behind him for the fighting tradition of the chantrys did not begin with him nor with his grandfather who had stood with lafitte and jackson at the battle of new orleans there were generations before that who had crossed over from ireland the principal thing he had learned was that simply because he himself did not believe in violence was no reason that others would feel the same in the future he must be more wary but what if the talrim boysвђ presence was not coincidence what if french had arranged for them to be near what if french intended the talrim boys to eliminate him at daybreak he was out riding the drag and when he broke off he caught up another horse from the remuda this was a grulla mustang small but wiry вђњwatch him amigoвђќ dutch akin whispered вђњthat one is meanвђќ the little mousecolored horse stood quiet until saddled but just as chantry put his foot in the stirrup and rested his weight on it to swing to the saddle the little horse folded up like a closing knife and then snapped open viciously tom chantry slapped into the saddle as the horse came down was almost thrown as it sunfished wickedly then crowhopped for half a dozen jumps and switched ends suddenly more by luck than anything else tom stayed in the saddle he had ridden spirited horses but nothing that bucked like this just as he was sure he was going to have to grab for the pommel with both hands the grulla stopped bucking ran a few steps and settled down chantry rode over to the chuck wagon and taking his rifle shoved it into the saddle scabbard then he turned and rode out on the plains he had not ridden more than half a mile when he saw a rider emerge from a draw just ahead and stand waiting it was bone mccarthy вђњhowdy boss you huntinвђ compвђnyвђќ вђњwhy notвђќ вђњi ainвђt been up to you sooner because i figured you knew about them i mean i saw your tracks back yonderвђќ вђњthe talrims yes i saw themвђќ вђњi canвђt decide what theyвђre after theyвђre traveling too slow unless theyвђve got somethinвђ on their minds whatever it is concerns you or that herd every now and then they crest a ridge to study youвђќ chantry had his own ideas about the reason for their presence somehow he felt french williams had gotten word to them and they were lying in wait for their chance to kill him he might be mistaken but there was the presence of dutch akin as an indication that williams thought along such lines вђњtheyвђve dogged your trail a couple of times iвђd ride careful if i was youвђќ вђњany sign of sun chiefвђќ вђњnot hide nor hairвђќ mccarthy dug into his saddlebag for a strip of jerky and began chewing on it вђњchantry youвђre ahead of your time in this countryвђi mean you not wantinвђ to carry a gun this ainвђt the kind of world you came from and it wonвђt be for a few years whenever a man enters a new country like this his way of livinвђ drops back hundreds of years you ainвђt livinвђ in the nineteenth century here chantryвђќ вђњyou donвђt talk much like a cowhandвђќ вђњthatвђs nonsense whoever said a cowhand was any special breed cowhands like freighters bankers and newspaper editors are apt to come from anywhere they just like the life as i doвђќ chantry glanced at him вђњwhere did you come from mccarthyвђќ вђњireland where else twelve years ago i left there but at the end of the war between the states i went back for a few weeks and got into trouble againвђќ вђњagainвђќ вђњthe first time i was visiting a friend in glenveagh and there was trouble over an eviction i had to leave the country i joined up with the french as many a good irish lad has done over the years and after a bit i migrated to this country i had two years in the war then back there and straight away i got into the fenian troubles and was lucky to get out with a whole skin back here again and two years fightinвђ indians with the fifth cavalryвђќ вђњthe mccarthys are an old family iвђve heardвђќ вђњyes some say weвђre the oldest family in ireland we owned blarney castle at one timeвђќ вђњhow does it happen that sometimes you talk as if youвђd been born in the westвђќ mccarthy shrugged вђњsaves questions a good many men do it youвђll find they just fall into the habit as i have of talkinвђ the western way you put on a way of talkinвђ when you change your clothes itвђs as simple as thatвђќ they rode on scouting the country вђњby the wayвђќ bone mccarthy said вђњback there at cliftonвђs the day i met you there was a girl thereвђќ вђњi saw herвђќ вђњwell she saw you and sheвђs been askinвђ questions aside from the fact that youвђre a handsome upstanding man why would she be so allfired curiousвђќ вђњi donвђt know she was a pretty girl i remember thatвђќ вђњi remember it too but iвђve got an idea neither of us should iвђve got a nose for troubleвђќ вђњshe was asking questionsвђќ вђњshe was she was askinвђ the wrong questions too i mean not questions a girl would ask who was interested in a man but questions of somebody who wanted to know where you was goinвђ what route youвђd be likely to take and how many hands you had workinвђ for youвђќ вђњit doesnвђt make senseвђќ chantry commented вђњit did to herвђќ mccarthy said dryly chapter the girl did not concern him she would not be the first curious person he had encountered and women had a way of asking questions about strange young men who are or seem to be unattached and vice versa tom chantry was more concerned with the talrims and with worrying over when sun chief would reappear the cattle had moved slowly water holes were scarce and it seemed they came to them early in the afternoon when french williams invariably suggested it would be risky to drive on and make a dry camp twice at least his claims had undoubtedly been correct for they were followed by long dry drives on the drive itself all went well the cattle were well broken to the trail there was no friction among the riders and nobody was troubling chantry his two victories over koch seemed to have settled the matter of how much nerve he had and the stampede caused by koch had meant much additional work for them they wanted no repeat performance hard though the work might be it had settled into routine and this tom chantry knew increased his danger routine had a lulling effect upon the senses and he knew his security demanded that he be alert at any moment for whatever might come despite his impatience he had to recognize that the short drives were having their effect on the cattle settled down after their stampede the short days offered more time for grazing and they had gained weight if nothing happened to change their present rate of progress and if the grazing continued to be good the herd would arrive at market in excellent condition was this what williams was thinking of or was it something else why was he moving so slowly was he too waiting for word from the railroad there was no sign of sun chief bone mccarthy was close by and several times riding out from the herd chantry came upon his tracks as well as those of the talrims who seemed to have been joined by a third person the new set of tracks were those of a smaller shod horse trinidad was not far ahead and although it was only a small settlement it had already acquired a reputation as a tough place in gabriel gutierrez and his nephew had come up from new mexico with a herd of sheep the men built a cabin on the south bank of the river and settled down there grazing their sheep hunting and farming a few acres of land others moved in and the settlement was named for the daughter of trinidad baca one of the firstcomers was french williams waiting for something to happen at trinidad chantry told himself he was imagining things вђњi got to hand it to youвђќ williams said one night as they sat by the fire вђњyouвђve done your share youвђve stood up to the work better than i figured you would youвђve changed too these last days youвђve honed down and sharpened up considerablyвђќ вђњthanks youвђve done your job tooвђќ williams chuckled вђњbut we still havenвђt reached dodge and the railroadвђќ вђњcall it off if you want toвђќ chantry replied carelessly вђњiвђll pay you the going price for your herd on delivery at dodgeвђќ вђњyou quitting on me trying to welch on your dealвђќ вђњyou know better than that just trying to let you make a dollar donвђt worry french when we deliver these cattle iвђll be there to collectвђќ вђњyou got any idea whatвђs aheadвђќ williams studied him his amusement apparent вђњthe kiowas are out and believe me nobody is worse theyвђll give us bloody hellвђќ вђњand thereвђs been no rain so weвђll have water trouble and there are rustlers youвђve told me all thatвђќ chantry leveled his eyes at williams вђњand donвђt pull another dutch akin on me i wonвђt stand for itвђќ вђњwhat will you doвђќ chantry knew the hands around the fire were listening but he did not care вђњif anybody shows up hunting me french iвђll figure he was sent by youвђќ вђњand thenвђќ williamsвђ voice was low вђњiвђll take your gun away and break your neckвђќ williams laughed вђњiвђd kill you chantry nobody will ever put hands on me the way you did with koch gun or no gun iвђd kill youвђќ вђњbetter have your gun out when you see me coming then youвђll never get a chance to draw itвђќ he got to his feet and walked over to the chuck wagon for the coffeepot coolly he filled williamsвђ cup and then his own putting the pot down by the fire вђњand while youвђre at it french youвђd better tell those talrim boys to light a shuck they might lead to some misunderstandingвђќ he looked at french and suddenly he smiled вђњi wouldnвђt want to break your back and then find it was all a mistake you tell them to light out will youвђќ french williams shook his head вђњchantry if i wasnвђt so set on beating you out of that herd i could like youвђќ the next day broke cold and raw with a long wind in their faces and the cattle had to be forced into it and the wind did not let up as the sun rose behind the low gray clouds there would be water in the picketwire where they would camp and some shelter in the river bottom if they were lucky tom chantry rode the drag for a while spelling a rider there then he moved up into a swing position after the noon break he took the grulla from the remuda and went scouting it was still cold and he wore a buckskin jacket over his blue wool shirt he went directly east riding warily twice he came upon pony tracks each time they were several days old he held to low ground climbing the ridges only to peer over the crest showing himself as little as possible he was uneasy and after a bit he took his rifle from its scabbard and held it in his hand the wind was raw he turned up the collar of his jacket tucked his chin into it and pulled his hat low he was studying the ground then suddenly looked up to see he had ridden right into the bend of an elbow of hills he must either skyline himself by crossing the ridge or follow along the side until he could reach the cattle trail it was the country ahead he wanted to see but caution told him the longer way was best he had turned to ride along the side of the hill when he glimpsed a notch almost at the bend of the elbow a small gap by which he could get to the other side of the ridge without showing himself on top of it he swung his horse toward the notch his horse scrambled up the last few feet at the opening of the notch he could see only that it was a sort of cleft in the ridge that seemed to lead all the way through old tracks told him the buffalo used this route so it must go all the way through he walked his horse into the gap traveled about a hundred yards then suddenly rounded a low shoulder of the hill and emerged on the other side he never heard the shot but he felt the blow it was as if somebody had struck him suddenly across the side of the head with a whipstock he knew he was hit he felt himself falling he remembered the necessity of clinging to his rifle he hit the dirt smelled the dust that rose and then he neither felt nor heard anything but the vague sound of his horse cold icy teethchattering cold it was cold that brought him to consciousness it was cold that opened his eyes it was night cold and black and there was a smell of rain in the air and a distant rumble of thunder he was lying sprawled on the earth the smell of dust and parched grass in his nostrils he started to move a spasm of pain went through him he lay still wanting no more of that he had been shot he had fallen from his horse he had been shot sometime in the middle of the afternoon but if anybody was looking for him they could scarcely find him here a spatter of rain struck his shoulders shelter he must find shelter he risked the pain and tried to sit up on the third attempt he made it he was still at the cleft of the hills where he had been shot he felt around him for his rifle it was gone his knife gone he felt then for his money but it was gone too it was only then that he realized how cold his feet were his boots were gone gingerly he touched his head which throbbed with a dull heavy beat his hair was matted with blood he got to his knees then shakily to his feet he looked around slowly blinking against the pain his horse was gone too he remembered then that he had heard it running off it might not have gone far and he called out there was no sound in answer no sound and no movement but the falling rain he staggered to the lip of the cut and looked around but it was too dark to see anything the herd would be ahead and to his left taking a careful step at a time he moved slantingly down the hill toward the northwest he stumbled over a rock and fell when he got heavily to his feet he realized that the butts of his palms were bloody skinned in the fall whoever had shot him had left him for deadвђ or if not dead sure to be dead soon he fell three times before he reached the bottom of the slope and by then his socks were worn through and his feet were hurting he peered about trying in the distant flashes of lightning to see something he might use for shelter but there was nothing first of all rain or no rain he needed some protection for his feet fumbling in the debris at the foot of the rocky slope he found a jagged piece of rock and removing his buckskin jacket he sawed off the sleeves a little above the elbows he slipped these over his feet and used thongs made from the long fringes knotted together to tie the sleeves around his ankles putting on his coat again he moved out walking carefully trying to avoid the rocks and the patches of prickly pear a dark line ahead warned him of trees and he went even more slowly wary of indians who might be camped there under the cottonwoods he stood close to a tree trunk and listened to the falling rain and the rustle of water in the creek bed but he could hear no other sounds his eyes searched for a fire or some evidence of human life but there was nothing he worked his way among the trees until he found a place where several bigger ones were grouped together in such a way that their entwined branches made a sort of shelter here he leaned against a tree trunk and closed his eyes with weariness after a moment he opened them and his eyes now accustomed to the darkness saw a fallen limb from one of the cottonwoods he went to it and huddling there in its partial shelter he leaned back against the tree and slept around him the rain fell softly steadily overhead the cottonwoods rustled in the hollow of a tree not twenty yards away a squirrel peered out at the rain for a moment listening then tucked its bushy tail around it once more and went back to sleep in a saloon in trinidad a cowhand on the drift lighted a cigar and glanced at his cards вђњiвђll take two cardsвђќ he said more than a thousand miles to the east a girl in a white dress with lace at the throat looked down the table at her father and said вђњpa i havenвђt heard from tom it isnвђt like himвђќ earnshaw looked up and said quietly вђњi hope everything is all right with him i have written to him telling him what has happened here everything depends on him nowвђќ she was a gentleappearing and lovely girl but in the coolness of her eyes now and the set of her chin there was something that reminded her father that she came of pioneer stock вђњpa i want to go westвђќ she said вђњi want to go to himвђќ вђњthatвђs impossible heвђs out on the range from what i hear itвђs very wild countryвђќ вђњhe may need helpвђќ вђњwhat help do you think you could give you are a single girl and we have no friends there no one to whom you could go it would be unseemlyвђќ вђњnevertheless i want to goвђќ вђњwait we will hear from himвђќ chantry awoke shaking with a chill he was wet through to the skin without shelter without food without fire he had lost blood and he was very weak he had no shoes only the crude moccasins made from his sleeves he struggled to his feet and clung for a moment to the trunk of the cottonwood he was shaky and uncertain but he knew he must move he must get on a faint light under the trees indicated that daylight was not far off he picked up a broken branch from the ground it was almost straight and was about seven feet long and almost two inches in diameter using it for a staff he started to walk for the first time he realized how sore his feet had become but step by step he went through the cottonwoods to the far side by now the herd would be moving or about to move to overtake it in his present condition would be impossible he had left the herd by riding east and at a rough guess he must be about fifteen miles from trinidad the clouds were low the light still dim and there were no landmarks visible fisherвђs peak or the spanish peaks would have given him direction but they were out of sight behind the clouds yet there was something he could go by leaning on his staff in the partial shelter of a tree he furrowed his brow against the throbbing in his skull and thought of the purgatoire called by cattlemen the picketwire it lay ahead of him crossing his line of travel had he been with the herd the creeks in this area flowed north into the picketwire so the nearby creek would be flowing north or in that general direction to reach trinidad he must turn at right angles to the flow of the creek and keep it at his back and so go west nobody would be looking for him williams had everything to gain and nothing to lose if chantry never turned up again or if he failed to be riding with the herd when it reached the railhead his body was chilled through but he started on weaving a slow way among the trees he managed a dozen steps before he stopped then another ten ahead of him he could see the bank that marked the edge of the river bottom once he climbed that bank he would be in the open without any shelter at all yet he could be no wetter than he now was and not much colder his only hope lay in keeping moving ten steps then five the buckskin on his feet would not last long there was one thing to be thankful for no indian was fool enough to be out in the rain he came to the small bluff that marked the river bottom and blinking his eyes in the rain he looked for a path and found it slowly slipping and tugging at his staff he climbed the bank now for the first time he felt the wind it went through him with icy fingers probing at his strength clinging to the staff he plodded on turning occasionally to be sure the line of trees was at his back he thought of what had happened who had shot him an indian french williams one of the talrims or perhaps some stranger who needed a horse no matter there would be time to think about that when he was warm again and when he had eaten warm would he ever be warm again he hobbled westward depending on his staff and pausing every few steps to ease the pain in his feet the ground was muddy from the rain and he had to stop often to shake the mud from his foot coverings when he had gone scarcely a mile he found another creek bed and descended into it pushing through the brush he scooped up water and drank then crossed on scattered stones and climbed the far bank every step now was agony but he plodded on simply because he knew he must not stop he had thought at moments of giving up he had thought of surrendering to whatever ill fate awaited him but it had never really been in him to do so somewhere beyond the muddy plain across which he was slogging lay destination a place where there was food and warmth a solution to his immediate problem when he fell down again it was at the edge of some trees he had come to another creek and the water still ran north so he was on the right track he got up and stumbled to the flat ground under the trees and here he found the remains of an old campfire he searched the ground for something useful perhaps a broken knife blade something for a weapon but what he finally found was a shelter a leanto tightly made and with dry leaves and grass on the ground inside he fell to his knees rolled over and slept words awoke him he did not open his eyes for he heard the first words spoken вђњleave him be sarah heвђs as good as dead canвђt you seeвђќ вђњand if he doesnвђt dieвђќ вђњbut he willвђќ вђњiвђm going to make sure that he does paul i did not come this far to have anything else

thousand dollars with the outfitвђќ вђњten thousand you will have to pay the handsвђќ вђњyou talk like a fool paul let me have your gunвђќ вђњmy gun whyвђќ вђњbecause i am going to kill him with it then i am going to put the gun in his hand and when he is found they will think he shot himself because of the hopeless situation he was inвђќ the words of this creature called sarah came to him clearly and plainly he was to be murdered for some reason he did not know he was not sure whether he could move or not but he was about to try when paul spoke again вђњletвђs make a fire and have some coffee iвђm cold sarah we can take care of him any time he isnвђt going anywhereвђќ they moved off under a tree and the man built a fire when they had coffee on and both were sitting down tom chantry lifted his head the sleep and the emergency had brought clearness to his mind he looked around cautiously their horses were over there sixty or seventy yards off he eased slowly to his elbows and began to crawl moving with infinite care he made no noise on the sodden ground out of the leanto behind a tree then angling off to come at the horses from the other side there was talk between the two at the fire the smell of coffee he reached the horses pulled himself up he got to the brush where they were tied pulled the loose end of the slipknot and holding the reins he grabbed for the pommel the horse sidestepped away from the smell of him and he fell against the saddle he heard an exclamation and made a wild grab for the pommel and caught it the horse jumped and started to run as his foot reached the stirrup he fell into the saddle and then the horse was running and somebody was shooting chapter the horse was a good one a fast starter probably somebodyвђs cutting horse now it was frightened and it lunged into a dead run at the first jump it went through the trees like a jack rabbit hit the slope and was up it and topped out on the bank beyond before chantry could get settled in the saddle he took one quick look around and headed the horse westward where it seemed inclined to go anyway for half a mile he simply let it run then eased it down to a trot held for another halfmile then a walk and a trot again there was no trail that he could make out in the darkness but he was heading for trinidad and weak as he was he knew nothing under heaven was going to get him off that horse until he reached the town it was nothing much when he got there a few cabins a scattering of houses and corrals a few haystacks and then a saloon or two a twostory building with a sign that said hotel and a restaurant beyond a few other places of business were all closed and dark the street itself was empty still short of the lights he pulled up and swung down hit the borrowed horse a slap across the rump and went up the steps and into the hotel there were three men in the room a man wearing a green eyeshade and sleeve garters shuffled and dealt cards at a table alone another man was behind a desk and a third sat behind a newspaper at one side of the room they all looked up and stared at him he was sodden with rain his feet squished as he walked across the floor leaving mud and water behind him his hair streaked down over his head and his cheeks were haggard the wound on his scalp had reopened and bled вђњi want a roomвђќ he said hoarsely вђњa room and some foodвђќ вђњmisterвђќ the clerk protested вђњyou cominвђ here like this you got money to pay for itвђќ вђњi am owner of the herd french williams just drove through i was drygulched and left for dead i need that room mister and i can pay for it what i donвђt need is an argumentвђќ вђњnow see hereвђвђњ anger gave him strength anger and a desperate impatience for he felt that at any moment he might fall on his face he reached across the desk and took a handful of the clerkвђs shirt вђњgive me that roomвђand no more argumentвђќ вђњgive it to himвђќ the cool voice was familiar вђњiвђll stand good for itвђќ chantry released his hold and turned half around sparrow was walking toward him folding a newspaper вђњall rightвђќ the clerk said grudgingly вђњif you say so mr sparrowвђќ the cattleman held chantry by the arm and took the key the clerk held out вђњcome on young manвђќ he said вђњweвђve got some talking to doвђќ as they entered the hall to the groundfloor rooms he turned and called back to the gambler вђњmobile do me a favor and get hold of sam baker for meвђќ the man got to his feet and took his coat off the back of the chair sparrow walked chantry back to the room went in and closed the door behind them вђњget out of those wet clothesвђќ he said вђњyou need a stiff rubdown and a drink you get undressed iвђll get the drinkвђќ he went out and chantry dropped to the wooden chair and stooped to pull off the rags of buckskin that hung from his feet he got one off and then he pitched over on the floor but only for a moment slowly he pushed himself up there was so much to do he needed a horse he had to catch up with the herd he pulled off his buckskin coat and his shirt both heavy with water he took the rough towel and began to dry his head and his face and chest he sat down again unbuckled his belt and got out of the soaked pants torn and ragged from his struggles against the brush and the rocks sparrow came back bringing a bottle and a glass вђњget a jolt of this into you iвђm not much of a man for whiskey but in your condition itвђs what you needвђќ chantry took a gulp of the whiskey and felt the heat of it go all through him he waited a moment then took another вђњyou get some sleep nowвђќ sparrow said вђњwe can talk in the morningвђќ вђњweвђll talk nowвђќ chantry said вђњmorning may be too lateвђќ he took another gulp of the whiskey a small one this time вђњsomebody tried to kill meвђќ briefly he told of sarah and paul and the horse he had let loose вђњdo you know themвђќ sparrow asked вђњi donвђtвђќ вђњstrangers but they knew me they wanted meвђi donвђt know whyвђќ he added вђњthey didnвђt look or act like western people from the border states perhapsвђќ sparrow reached into his waistband he took out a shortbarreled вђњdo you still have a prejudice against using one of these theyвђll trace that horse and theyвђll find youвђќ вђњi just lost my prejudiceвђќ chantry replied shortly вђњgive me the gunвђќ вђњkeep it close byвђќ sparrow said there was a rap on the door the gambler named mobile and another man somewhat older stood there вђњcome inвђќ sparrow said вђњbaker this young man is a friend of mine heвђs going to need an outfit from the skin out and heвђll need it tonight heвђll also need a pistol and a winchester can you open up and get them for himвђќ вђњfor you youвђre damned rightвђќ baker turned away then he glanced over his shoulder вђњfrom the look of him what he needs is some hot soup a lot of itвђќ вђњiвђll get itвђќ mobile said вђњitвђll have some rain water in it by the time i get back but itвђll be soup and itвђll be hotвђќ chantry pulled a blanket around him the liquor and the warmth of the room were taking effect but he was feeling very tired вђњsparrow why are you doing this for meвђќ he asked вђњi thought you had no use for meвђќ sparrow smiled and took a cigar from his pocket вђњi didnвђtвђќ he said вђњbut youвђve been moving and youвђve been making friends i ran into koch down in las vegas he hates your guts but he carries the marks to show why that was part of it and then everybody is talking about your deal with frenchвђќ вђњyou know about thatвђќ вђњeverybody does thatвђs why i knew youвђd need an outfit iвђll have a horse for you too the best one i can findвђќ вђњdo you think french had me shotвђќ вђњno that doesnвђt sound like him heвђd have it done right out in the open where anybody could see it heвђs got his own sense of honor about things heвђll steal everything you own and heвђll get you killed in a gun fight if he can or by a bad hose or a steer but i doubt heвђd ever have a man drygulched of course thatвђs just one manвђs opinionвђќ mobile came in with the soup and he stayed behind after sparrow left вђњyou get some sleepвђќ he advised вђњiвђll kind of set around and keep an eye on thingsвђќ вђњyou donвђt even know meвђќ mobile shrugged вђњi donвђt have to i used to punch cows for sparrow i came up the trail with him from texas decided that was too rugged a life for a man and settled down here to deal cards contrary to what you might figure i donвђt make much more than i would punchinвђ cows but i sleep in a bed at night and i donвђt have to ride dragвђќ slowly carefully tom chantry stretched out on the bed and drew the covers over him his muscles stiffened by cold and weariness slowly relaxed вђњmobileвђќ his eyes opened вђњdo you know a couple of people named sarah and paulвђќ he went on to describe them and added вђњtheyвђll be hunting that horse but iвђve got an idea that horse came from town here sold to them or rented he sure wanted to come this way he was a big bay about sixteen hands with three white stockings it looked like a pitchfork brand i caught a glimpse as he ran offвђќ вђњthatвђs henry hazeltonвђs heвђs got a ranch outside of townвђdeals in horses and mules iвђve used that horse myselfвђќ he took a step toward the door вђњnow you get some sleep iвђll ask aroundвђќ the door closed and there was silence in the room for several minutes chantry lay quiet then he got out of bed and limped across the room and propped the chair under the knob it was an inside room with no window he closed his eyes nothing had ever felt so good as this bed nothing ever would he slept and outside rain fell upon the townвђa rain that drowned the sound of a horseвђs hoofs splashing through the mud it smothered the sound of footsteps of a man walking along the alley and trying the back door of the hotel then entering it did not wipe out entirely the sight of a young woman walking across the street and mounting the outside steps of the building across the way mobile shuffling cards at his table saw the girl dimly through the rain saw her put a key in the lock and enter the door mobile callahan trusted neither people nor the appearances of things of tom chantry he knew nothing beyond the fact that he was respected by sparrow two people had apparently tried to kill chantry one of them a girl one a man a girl had just mounted the stairs to the rooms and offices across the way and it was unlikely that there would be two young women out in the rain on such a night and where was the man this was the only hotel in town and anyone looking for a homeless man would be likely to come to it anyone wishing to kill such a man would not be likely to come by the front door for he would be seen and remembered mobile made a neat stack of his cards and got to his feet a glance told him the light in the back hallway was out and he could smell the faint fumes left by a coaloil lamp that has recently been blown out somebody wanted it dark and mobile callahan was not going to walk along a dark hallway looking for a killer his mother had raised no foolish children his own room was the first on the right side of the hall chantryвђs next to the last on the left side mobile stretched and yawned noisily вђњlooks like a chance to catch up on some sleepвђќ he said to the clerk вђњi think iвђll turn inвђќ he walked back to his room ignoring the bit of dark hall that lay beyond the light from the lobby and opened his door he went in closing the door then promptly eased it open a fraction of an inch standing in the darkness with a drawn gun mobile listened and heard a faint creak from down the hall then another gently he eased his door open a little more by standing tight against the wall he could look along the door and down the passage at first he could see nothing and then he made out a darker shadow and from it a hand that took hold of the knob on chantryвђs door and tried it ever so carefully turned it and pushed nothing happened mobile heard a muffled curse then the man put a shoulder to the door and lunged against it but it did not give chantry had put a chair under the knob and braced the door what happened next was completely unexpected and ready as mobile was for almost anything he was not ready for this the man stepped back drew his gun and suddenly opened fire he held his gun low and mobile saw the stab of flame in the darkness even as he heard the thunder of the gun in the narrow hall caught flatfooted it was an instant before he could react an instant in which the unknown gunman got off at least two shots leaping into the hall mobile fired the gunman wheeled fired one quick shot at him and fled mobile fired again as the man went through the door doors burst open the clerk came running sparrow gun in hand appeared in a door in his longjohns mobile ran to him вђњhe tried to kill himвђќ he said to sparrow iвђll light upвђќ he scarcely noticed the warmth of the lamp chimney as he removed it and applied a match to the wick of the hall lamp a dozen men were gathered outside chantryвђs door while sparrow hammered on it вђњchantry are you all rightвђќ he called the wall near the door was of oneinch pine boards and it held three bullet holes a could penetrate several inches of pine and the bullets had been fired to strike a man lying on the bed for a moment there was no sound inside the room then a chair scraped on the floor and the door opened tom chantry looked out вђњare you all rightвђќ sparrow asked again as chantry stepped back sparrow entered followed by mobile вђњiвђm all right i was lying on my back if iвђd been on my side heвђd have gotten meвђќ mobile glanced at the bullet holes then at the wall opposite in the light from the bedroom lamp he pointed out a bullet buried in a washstand another that had gone through the wall on the opposite side of the room when the others had left mobile told about the girl he had seen climbing the steps across the street вђњthatвђs webb taylorвђs officeвђќ sparrow said вђњheвђs an attorney but so far as i know heвђs out of townвђќ after the two men had gone chantry stretched out once more on the bed they would not try againвђnot right away hands clasped behind his head he tried to put things together to make sense out there in the woods the girl had said вђњi want french to have those cattle then thereвђll be just one manвђќ one man for what and why did she want french to have the cattle he thought and thought but found no answers and presently he fell asleep across the street in the upstairs office sarah looked at paul with disgust вђњyou fool now everybody will know somebody is trying to kill himвђќ вђњtheyвђll believe it was french or that other man we heard about kochвђќ she was silent for a few minutes and then she said вђњweвђve got to stay out of sight paul so you leave town nowвђќ вђњin this rainвђќ вђњtheyвђve seen you paul they caught a glimpse of you anyway go up the trail of the cattle you can be sure chantry will be coming along and you can kill him then but this time donвђt make a mess of it take your time and be sure you get him ten thousand dollars may not be all the money in the world but it is all weвђre likely to haveвђќ paul went to the door and peered out the night was veiled with rain вђњall rightвђќ he agreed reluctantly вђњi know where thereвђs a shack up the line iвђll stop thereвђќ he paused for a moment вђњwhat about youвђќ вђњthey know nothing about me i am just here visiting webb taylor and getting some legal advice you go aheadвђand be careful that nobody sees youвђќ paul opened the door quickly and went down the stairs turning at the foot of the steps to walk back to the barn where he had left his horse at the back of the building next door and some thirty yards away there were several old boxes and barrels crouching among them and sheltered from the rain mobile callahan gambler cowhand and drifter watched him go and looking through the open door of the barn he saw him lead his horse to the door paul was a slender man about five feet ten weighing perhaps a hundred and fifty pounds give or take a few he wore two belt guns and there was a rifle in the scabbard on his saddle this horse too was from hazeltonвђs place mobile watched him go and when he heard the hoofbeats die out he studied the rooms in the building opposite there was a lamp lighted now and occasionally somebody moved back and forth between the light and the window after a few minutes he got up and walked back to the hotel sparrow was waiting in the lobby mobile told him what he had seen and sparrow considered it taking two cigars from his pocket he offered mobile one of them then bit the end from the other вђњmobileвђќ he said slowly вђњiвђve heard it said around the cow camps that youвђre a good man with a gunвђќ вђњthatвђs a reputation i never hunted mr sparrow and itвђs one i donвђt wantвђќ вђњi understand that i donвђt want just a gun i want a man with judgment and you always had that i want you to ride up the trail and see that chantry stays aliveвђќ вђњheвђs already got one man heвђs got bone mccarthy working for himвђќ вђњhow do you know thatвђќ вђњi saw bone a while back he was askinвђ questions around i just put two and two togetherвђќ вђњjust the same i want you to help chantry get through iвђll pay you two hundred and fifty dollars to stay with him to the railheadвђќ mobile drew on his cigar and looked at sparrow he had known sparrow for going on eight years and had never known the man to make a foolish or an unnecessary move вђњwhatвђs your stake in thisвђќ he asked вђњtwo hundred and fifty dollarsвђthatвђs seven eight monthsвђ wages for a top handвђќ вђњi have my reasonsвђќ sparrow got to his feet вђњyou do that mobile i donвђt want you to get yourself killed just be around a little while i think tom chantry is riding into more trouble than he can handle heвђs a good man maybe as good a man as his father was i want to see him have his chanceвђќ after sparrow had gone to his room mobile sat alone in the lobby drawing on his cigar presently he crossed to his table picked up the deck and began to deal the cards he always thought better when he was handling cards he shuffled the deck and dealt a hand then turned them over and looked at them aces and eights black aces and eights the dead manвђs hand who was to die was it him was it chantry who chapter tom chantry opened his eyes and lay still slowly it came back to him the shot out of nowhere the missing horse knife and boots his struggle to make it through the rain and then the discovery by the two who intended to kill him why he didnвђt know he turned his head toward the door the chair was propped under the knob throwing back the covers he swung his feet to the floor but when he tried to stand the pain brought cold sweat to his forehead dropping to his knees he crawled to the door and removed the chair when he eased the door open he found several packages wrapped in brown paper he brought them into the room and opened them on the bed a dark red wool shirt a black handkerchief for his neck a pair of black jeans and a wide belt a couple of suits of underwear another shirt socks and boots there was also a gun belt and a holster containing a smith and wesson as well as several boxes of cartridges there was a black flatbrimmed hat and a fringed buckskin jacket obviously indianmade the man named mobile had brought him some salve and bandages the night before and chantry treated his feet now with the salve bandaged them and slipped on the socks the day clerk came down the hallway and rapped on the door chantry opened it his right hand holding the pistol вђњno need for thatвђќ the clerk said вђњi brought you this winchester mr sparrowвђs up and havinвђ breakfast if youвђd care to join himвђќ вђњis mobile aroundвђќ вђњhim heвђs around somewheres heвђs the kind you only see if heвђs a good mind to have you see himвђќ taking the rifle in his hand chantry went along the hall to the lobby and across to the dining room it was small with just six oilclothcovered tables one of them long enough to seat a dozen family style hobbling chantry crossed the room and sat down opposite sparrow вђњthanksвђќ he said to the cattleman вђњthanks for everything i donвђt know why youвђve done all this but i appreciate itвђќ вђњbetter eat while youвђve got the chance youвђre two maybe three days behind your herdвђќ вђњone good dayвђs ride if i have a good horseвђќ вђњyouвђll have one but donвђt forget you have enemiesвђќ he glanced at the gun on chantryвђs hip вђњyouвђre wearing a pistolвђќ tom chantry shrugged вђњmy sense of whatвђs right and just tells me i shouldnвђt but my sense of survival warns me iвђd betterвђќ he studied the cattleman вђњarenвђt you off your beat i mean i didnвђt think you operated this far northвђќ вђњletвђs just say i was curious stories get around you know and i heard about your runin with the talrims after our conversation i was wondering how your convictions were matching up with the situationвђќ вђњand now youвђve seen theyвђve failedвђќ вђњnothing of the kind you have merely learned that a situation observed from a distanceвђa safe distance i might addвђis never the same as when met face to face it is easy to say you do not believe in using guns when you have never faced a gun in the hands of another man and you unarmed вђњunderstand one thing mr chantry you can make laws against weapons but they will be observed only by those who donвђt intend to use them anyway the lawless can always smuggle or steal or even make a gun by refusing to wear a gun you allow the criminal to operate with impunityвђќ вђњwe have the lawвђќ вђњbut even the law cannot be in your bedroom at night but there are other things to consider if you are not to lose your herd you must overtake it and quickly believe me french williams will lose no time heвђll drive that herd as he never has beforeвђќ вђњthe worst of it is he may not have far to goвђќ sparrow looked at him sharply вђњwhatвђs that meanвђќ вђњthe railroad is building west and theyвђll be moving fastвђќ вђњyouвђre sure of thatвђќ вђњyes the only thing i am not sure of is where they are nowвђќ he glanced up from his pancakes вђњthat was my ace in the holeвђќ after that they ate in silence but when chantry finished his coffee and pushed back from the table sparrow said вђњunderstand me mr chantry i approve of your stand on guns many a man has shot too hastily or been roped into a killing he wishes had never happened you are wise to restrain your hand so continue to be wise but not foolishвђќ вђњwhat do i owe you i mean for the clothes the outfitвђќ вђњnothing if you lose your race put it down to the fact that i like a good contest if you win iвђll give you the bill now youвђd better be ridingвђќ the horse was a lineback dun and a good one by the look of it mobile callahan was idling nearby when chantry came to pick up the horse a slim attractivelooking man with cool gray eyes and black hair he wore a black suit a fresh white shirt with a black tie and a black hat he was wearing a pistol chantry noted вђњiвђve been through the town chantryвђќ he said вђњand that paul whateverhisnameis has flown the coop the girlвђs still here but iвђve a hunch if they tried twice they will try again so watch your stepвђќ tom chantry mounted and turned his horse toward the old santa fe trail the trail went north by east but french williams knew this country well and he might drive further to shorten the trail to dodge when he had gone scarcely more than a mile from town he swung from the trail but when he had again gone no more than a mile he swung back toward it scouting for sign as he rode but he saw no tracks made since the rain he was remembering things his father had taught him at the time he had not thought of it as being taught but on many occasions his father had often pointed out things along the trail or told him stories of indians and indian fighting and trailing вђњif youвђre in risky countryвђќ he used to say вђњdonвђt let вђem set you up swing off your trail change directions keep вђem worried so they canвђt lay for you and study the sign watch wild animals and birds theyвђll tell you plenty most of all trust to your horse particularly if heвђs from wild stock if thereвђs anybody around a horse will know itвђќ his father had never seemed to be teaching and yet when he thought of it now he realized that borden chantry had said things that counted вђњif you want to live easy in your mind sonвђќ he used to say вђњbe sure folks respect you saves a lot of troubleвђќ he was riding warily alive to every shadow every suspicion of movement he avoided places where a man might easily lie in wait and several times he changed direction so it was that he glimpsed the pony tracks they were off his line of travel but his eyes caught a certain roughness in the grass and he swung his horse over to have a better look unshod ponies at least six perhaps more he knew he was no match for six warriors of the kiowa or comanche tribes deliberately he turned his mount away backtracking them he had gone no more than a quarter of a mile when he saw where the riders had drawn up their horses and stayed for several minutes partly screened by a thick patch of willows and young cottonwoods they had all been facing toward the wall of brush obviously looking over it at what not at him for he had not come that way sitting his horse where they had sat theirs he looked over the brush and could see nothing but a barren slope empty of life he found an opening in the wall of brush worked his way through and scouted the slope sure enough he came upon the tracks of a lone horseman who had ambled along the slope unaware of the indians watching him from cover tom chantry backtracked the rider and saw that the tracks showed frequent hesitations as though the rider had somebody under observation or was scouting a trail suddenly tom realized the rider had been watching him and now that rider was being stalked by indians who could it be was this the man called paul whoever it was he now had problems of his own and tom chantry decided to let him deal with them as best he could keeping to open country avoiding possible ambush spots he rode hard occasionally veering to confuse any watcher his one idea being to catch up with the drive the herdвђs tracks were there but they were a day or two old it was difficult to tell for sure obviously french was taking advantage of chantryвђs disappearance and was making time tom chantry was becoming aware of something else there was movement among the indians he came upon their sign several times parties riding unshod ponies crossed the cattle trail riding east small parties riding to become one big party gathering in the direction to which the cattle must be driven was it the cattle they were after or a drive upon the buffalo hunters in the panhandle area or an effort a last effort perhaps to stop the rails he slowed his pace he must not encounter such a party for if they were bound for an attack for any of those reasons they would not hesitate to kill him en route by sundown the tracks of the cattle were fresher and the cattle drive had veered toward the east perhaps only to reach a water hole chantry circled a low hill studying carefully for tracks and when he saw none that went up the hill he made his way to the crest there were boulders and low brush as well as half a dozen trees there the only cover he had found in some distance from the summit he could study the country all about in the last light to the west there was nothing it was broken empty country with mountains rimming the skyline all around him the horizon was empty except that off to the northeast there was the faint glow of what must be a fire the cattle herd he was about to leave the hill when he heard off in the distance a burst of firing stare as he might he could make out nothing and he had swung into the saddle preparatory to riding off the hill when he heard a pound of hoofs for several minutes he saw nothing and then it was a lone rider coming fast low over his saddle he swept by turning toward the direction of the herd and was scarcely past when a band of indians riding hard followed there were at least six in the bunchвђin the now vague light he could not be sure of their number he waited a moment longer listening and then rode down the hill and headed north as he rode he made his decision the thing to do was not to join the herd but to let the herd join him he would ride ahead make a dark camp somewhere along the line of travel the drive must follow and when they came up to him he would join them in daylight when there would be no mistakes to the north there had seemed to be a low rim of darkness a line of trees the river he knew the purgatoire took a bend somewhere ahead of him and it was probably the trees along that stream partly hidden by the depth of the river bed how far had he come his route had seesawed back and forth so often that he had lost track of distance in his effort to avoid an ambush probably he was no more than sixteen or seventeen miles from trinidad in the gathering dark he continued his way north growing more and more wary as he neared the river several times he drew up to listen into the night but he heard no sound except the faint rustle of wind the first stars appeared the ground fell away slightly and he saw the dark wall of the trees descending into the river bottom he could feel the coolness rising from the water he walked his horse along in the darkness every sense keyed for trouble he had drawn his pistol as he went under the trees and he allowed the horse to go forward to find his own way which it seemed to be doing without hesitation ears pricked and alert he was apparently on some sort of trail for the horseвђs hoofs fell evenly and the dun held to a good fast walk suddenly water gleamed gray before him the dun stopped and its head came up it seemed about to whinny when chantry spoke sharply but softly вђњno steady boy steadyвђќ although the dun jerked its head impatiently it made no sound then he caught the smell woodsmoke somebody somewhere quite near had a fire going the smell was faint but with it there was something more coffee chantry gun in hand walked the dun forward toward the gray water toward the fire he could not see chapter there is a subtle awareness in the night the darkness around you does not sleep it is awake alert sensing it is alive to movement and feels the changes in the air the smell the temperature the trees are aware and the bushes the birds and small animals are aware and they listen hesitant suspecting awareness of danger is an element of their being it is like their breathing like the blood in their veins and one who lives much with the wilderness becomes so aware too living with stillness he detects sounds unheard by the casual passersby sees things they do not see catches odors too faint for their nostrils half of woodcraft is attention and all of survival tom chantry had been bred in the west and in the east he had spent much time in the woods but what was happening to him now was different strange and exciting for the first time he was not in the night but was a part of the night he had come in recent days of scouting riding suffering and struggle to a point where he belonged to all this only a short time ago he had ridden unseeing past things that seemed of no importance to him but now he sensed them his ear was learning the difference between a movement of the wind and that of a small animal or bird his eye was quick to catch the difference between a bird that flew up from fear and one going about its usual business he could detect by the changes in temperature hollows or creek beds before he came up to them for they were cooler in this weather more humid chantry walked his horse a few steps then drew up waiting he felt a faint stir from the wind lost the scent of coffee for a moment found it again he heard no sound and he felt that the man who had the fire was moving silently or was listening the scent of the coffee was enough to tell him the man was awake a slight dampness a coolness coming to his right cheek indicated a hollow or a spring close by he turned his mount ever so slightly and edged it through the trees his gun was still in his hand and he was ready it might of course be the talrims but he did not think so they would be closer to the herd watching for him or carrying out whatever they meant to do whoever it was he was prepared the gleam of the fire caught his eye and there it was not twenty feet off in a hollow below some brush he drew up again and waited when he at last heard a sound it was a voice вђњwelcome to my fire i am sun chiefвђќ the indian materialized from the shadows and tom chantry dismounted holding out his hand and the pawnee took it вђњthere is coffee in the light i would look for you but you find me firstвђќ he took chantryвђs dun and stripped the saddle from it picketing the horse in a small glade close by then he came back to the fire where chantry had already filled his cup вђњhow did you know i was aroundвђќ tom asked the pawnee shrugged вђњi know you come and on the road i met the man from trinidadвђthe one called mobyвђќ moby mobile but what would the gambler be doing out here вђњhe told me you were comingвђќ there were other things to consider and chantry put aside the question of mobile callahanвђs movements вђњwhat about the railroadвђќ he asked вђњthree days maybe for the cows the pawnee filled his cup and chantry shared the food from his saddlebags вђњif there is no troubleвђќ вђњwhere is the herdвђќ sun chief pointed вђњwhere the creek begins the creek called caddoaвђќ knowing nothing of that creek chantry inquired вђњhow far from hereвђќ the pawnee gestured toward the north вђњnot far i show youвђќ the campsite the indian had chosen was a good one it was under the edge of a cut that dropped off to a creek bed but was some twenty feet back from the river and at least ten feet above it there would have been room for one more man and his horse when the indian had smoked he crawled into his blankets and only then did he tell chantry one last thing вђњthere are kiowas at big timbers the cheyennes and arapahoes have goneвђќ kiowas at big timbers and big timbers lay between his herd and the railroad if the cheyennes and arapahoes had left such a favorable camping ground there must be a reason were the kiowas planning an attack in which the others did not want to be involved big timbers why did the name sound a bell perhaps because of a story his father had told him long ago or some chance phrase remembered from a conversation in his home when men had talked of the far plains and the shining mountains the forests where no man had walked the name had a special sound to it big timbers at breakfast they ate jerky and drank coffee chantry inquired about big timbers and listened to sun chief tell in a few phrases what he knew вђњbig trees what you call alamo cottonwood fourteen miles long it was but many cut for logs or fires no brush around only grass springs and streams a place the indian likes big powwows held there fights too it is a good place so it undoubtedly was but the troublehunting kiowas had taken away its charm for tom chantry they had ridden no more than a mile in the morning sunlight when sun chief pointed across the tawny slopes at black dots circling against the pale sky вђњbuzzards something deadвђќ вђњor dyingвђќ chantry said вђњwe will seeвђќ they rode on their horsesвђ hoofs beating on the drying turf when they topped out on the rise below the buzzards they saw a manвђs body stripped and bloody lying in the hollow beyond riding down swiftly they drew up close to it streaked with bloody gashes it lay there an ugly thing under the flat sky tom chantry passed the reins to sun chief and stepped down fighting his repugnance he turned the body over it was paul and he was not dead his body twitched and his fluttering eyes opened wide вђњi did not even see themвђќ he said distinctly вђњit was sundown and i was looking for youвђќ вђњweвђll take you to the herdвђќ chantry said вђњtheyвђre pretty handy with woundsвђќ paulвђs eyes stared blankly вђњi shouldnвђt have listened to her i should never have come i never wanted money that much but she did she wanted money or she wanted blood i was never sureвђќ chantry knelt and started to slip an arm under him вђњnoвђќ he stopped waiting but whatever paul had been about to say was smothered in the blood that came from his mouth he rolled over on his side choking and gasping вђњnoвђќ he managed again and died chantry pulled a handful of dry grass and wiped the blood from his fingers he looked at the body and then walked to his horse he started to speak вђњif we had a shovel вђќ вђњno timeвђќ sun chief said вђњwe rideвђќ he pointed two hills away were indians a dozen of them coming toward them chantry turned his mount and riding beside each other they moved away trotting their horses not running them the indians came on riding faster now chantry drew his rifle from the scabbard letting them see the shine of it вђњno shootвђќ sun chief said but he was showing his own rifle the indians came up to the body and drew up looking after them they saw the fire before they reached the cattle the herd was bunched for the night and the men were around the chuck wagon except for those on night herd and one man on a high knoll as lookout the herd was bunched in the open the remuda held near a small patch of trees and brush helvie was first to see chantry he looked from chantry to sun chief and back again вђњfigured weвђd seen the last of youвђќ he said dryly вђњwhat happenedвђќ вђњi got drygulchedвђќ chantry answered вђњit wasnвђt himвђќ helvie said quickly вђњhe ainвђt left the herdвђќ вђњdidnвђt think it was that doesnвђt seem to be his styleвђќ вђњyouвђre smarterвђn i thoughtвђќ french william was standing near the fire watching as they rode in вђњhowdyвђќ he said вђњbetter eat up weвђre making a night driveвђќ вђњwhere toвђќ вђњsouth and west thereвђs a bunch of kiowas north of hereвђќ вђњheard of themвђќ chantry poured coffee вђњthey got you buffaloedвђќ williams turned his head quickly вђњno itвђs the wisest thing to do thatвђs allвђќ chantry sipped his coffee вђњthey know youвђre hereвђќ he said вђњso you arenвђt fooling anybody they can catch up any time theyвђve a mind to andвђќ he added вђњthereвђs bunches of indians south of here tooвђќ вђњwhatвђs on your mindвђќ вђњgo northвђќ chantry said вђњright past big timbers no sense in letting them think weвђre afraid of themвђќ вђњall rightвђќ william replied carelessly вђњit might just work if they ride out to talk you going to make palaver with themвђќ вђњi mightвђќ chantry replied вђњyou do itвђќ william said вђњiвђd like to see how an eastern gent gets along with indiansвђќ he glanced at sun chief вђњwhereвђd you find himвђќ вђњheвђs been working for me right alongвђќ chantry answered calmly вђњhe was one of frank northвђs pawnee scoutsвђќ вђњi know himвђќ french williams said вђњheвђs a damn good manвђќ suddenly a thought came to chantry вђњfrenchвђќ he asked вђњdoes anybody want you deadвђќ вђњme maybe fifty people whyвђќ вђњsomebody tried to kill me somebody i donвђt know i donвђt have any enemies that i can think of and nobody stands to gain if i dieвђќ вђњwhy tie it to meвђќ вђњthere was a mention that if i was dead thereвђd only be one more now i donвђt share anything with anybody but youвђќ вђњthe herdвђќ chantry shrugged вђњi canвђt think of anything elseвђќ вђњwhat about your pa somebody killed him with you back west again they might think youвђve come out here to wind that upвђќ вђњit isnвђt likely that was a long time agoвђќ both of them were silent for a minute and tom listened abstractedly to the mutter of conversation around the fire вђњanywayвђќ he added вђњthe girl wanted money thatвђs what paul saidвђќ вђњpaulвђќ вђњthe girl called him thatвђќ then concisely chantry told his experiences of the past few days the dry gulching his escape the attempted killing in trinidad and sparrow вђњwhatвђs he doing in thisвђќ french williams asked вђњi donвђt figure sparrowвђќ вђњhe said he wanted to see how iвђd manage without using a gunвђќ вђњthat donвђt make sense i know sparrow heвђs a notimeforfoolingaround man i never knew him to do anything like this beforeвђќ french looked at him quickly вђњis he any relation of yoursвђќ вђњnoвђќ вђњthen it certainly donвђt make sense unlessвђќ he added вђњhe figures to pick up the herd himselfвђќ chantry got up and threw the dregs of his coffee into the buffalochip fire вђњi think it concerns you and meвђќ he said вђњand nobody elseвђќ as he walked to the wagon for his bedroll he glanced at the men somber over their coffee speaking little their roughhewn unshaven faces thrown into relief by the firelight they were a solid capable lot even the bad ones were good men with the cattle hard workers to a man suddenly for the first time he felt a kinship with these men who shared with him what would in the east be considered as nothing less than an adventure here it was the dayвђs work and little different from any other dayвђs all of them knew the kiowas were out there and every man among them knew the kiowas for fearless dreaded fighters yet they were prepared to ride on right past their encampmentвђor through it if necessary some of these men were of a sort he might never have encountered had he not come west and they were in some cases men whom he would not have chosen for friends but when trouble showed they would be men who would stand by until death if need be for the first time he clearly understood what sparrow had told him what lambert meant and the others who had tried to tell him what the west was like these were hard lonely men driven by no man knew what impulses what secret dreams or thoughts and they came from all walks of life all kinds of backgrounds there was no pattern beyond the one of hardihood and courage вђњyou know frenchвђќ he said when he went back to the fire вђњno matter how it turns out iвђll have learned a lot on this trip i wouldnвђt have missed it for anythingвђќ french looked up a sudden smile on his face вђњmaybe weвђll ride another trail my friend another trail besides this youвђve come a long way since that night in cimarronвђќ yes yes he had but how much further was he to go it might be no further than the camp of the kiowas nor as far as the railhead there was not much time left not many days not many miles and then he would know chapter dawn broke cold and gray tom chantry rolled out of his blankets scrambled into his clothes and tugged on his boots helvie and mckay were at the wagon plates held out for the cook chantry stood up stamped his feet into his boots and slung his gun belt around his waist helvie looked at it but made no comment rugger strolled up to the wagon throwing a sour glance at the gun вђњyou strap that on anвђ you may have to use itвђќ вђњif i have to i willвђќ chantry said and he added вђњwhen this driveвђs over rugger if you have any money to bet iвђll outshoot you for whatever youвђve gotвђќ rugger stared at him вђњhuh you must think youвђre good iвђll take that betвђќ french williams rolled out and sat up вђњyouвђd better not rugger i think chantry can shoot i think heвђll surprise the hell out of youвђќ rugger snorted but he was less confident if french thought chantry could shoot it was a good bet that he could for french williams made few mistakes in such matters вђњfrench do you know clay springвђќ chantry asked вђњi been there a time or two i guess everybody in this country knows itвђќ вђњhow about stopping there tonightвђќ вђњiвђd sort of figured on itвђќ williams was a neat natty man who looked well in whatever he wore this morning he wore a blue army shirt black jeans and a flatbrimmed hat his boots were almost new and were decorated with largeroweled mexican spurs he wore his gun tied down chantry suspected that williams had a better background than was implied by his conversation or by his way of life вђњthat man the indians killedвђќ william asked now вђњyou say his name was paulвђќ вђњyesвђќ williams walked away without comment within minutes the herd was on the move pointed east now the dust beneath the hoofs of the cattle rose in clouds the sky remained dull leaden clay spring if chantry remembered rightly what he had been told lay at the foot of a mesa where several runoff springs combined to form clay creek he had never been there but bone mccarthy had mentioned it from there they would drive to the vicinity of two buttes and this would be what the kiowas would expect but their next move would he believed surprise the indians it might also confuse them for instead of driving away to avoid the indians they would drive right toward them and he had his own ideas about what to do next oddly enough he had come to like french the arrogant gunman with his amused taunting eyes puzzled him but chantry wasted no time in trying to figure out his personality his liking stemmed from the fact that williams was good at his job and tom chantry always admired a man who knew what he was doing and did it well the thought came to him that he might have to kill williams but if so he would do it with regret that thought gave him pause he kill such an idea had been foreign to him but now he was considering the possibility if there was no other way out his readiness to accept the possible necessity of it worried him he must guard his emotions and his actions all the more now he must not only be wary of others but of himself in spite of the dust there was a feeling in the air that he liked a smell from the land eastward the rising sun shone in the faces of the cattle they walked stolidly on sometimes trotted a little then walked again today he stayed with the herd interested to see how easily his horse responded to the work and how accustomed to it he himself had become his hand was sure his movements easy he had changed but he must not permit the ready smile of french williams to put him off why had williams so easily accepted the idea of going north into the face of the kiowas did he think chantry would fail when he faced them and lose the herd there or had williams already approached the kiowas perhaps on a shareandsharealike basis it would not be the first time indians had raided a herd or a wagon train at the instigation of a white man as he rode his thoughts returned to the girl called sarah of the two the girl had been the stronger the most dangerous and she was an attractive woman with a good figure enough to take the eye of any man east or west but this was the west where women were scarce he had been thinking there must be some connection between them and williams but williams had seemed to know nothing about them the cattle went ahead steadily heads swinging to the rhythm of their walk the cowhands lounged in their saddles thinking of the campfire ahead the strong black coffee and the warm food tom chantry swung out from the flank where he had been riding and loped his horse along the slope of the low hill clay creek spring was not far ahead hidden in a notch of hills below it was a holding ground somewhat higher than the ground around it a pleasant place for the cattle a bird flew up from almost under his horseвђs hoofs the saddle creaked his spurs jingled and he topped out on the rise the three indians came out on the ground around him without warning they had been lying down horses concealed beyond the rise and their dusky bodies blended with the brown earth and the growing shadows he heard the explosion of a gun felt the jolt of it in his fist then the hammer fell again and he saw an indian spin and fall the knife dropping from his hand an arm came around chantryвђs throat from behind and he knew instinctively a knife would be in the other hand he kicked his boots free of the stirrups and threw himself from his horse hitting the ground with a thump he rolled over and jolted free of the indian he came to his feet quickly just as the warrior knife held low sprang at him he was a big man tall as chantry and equally broad in the shoulders the indian crouched then came in chantry moved swiftly and with the ease of long practice a practice he had never used until now except in friendly wrestling matches his left palm slapped the indianвђs knifewrist to his right and out of line with his body his right hand grabbed the wrist and he stepped across in front of the kiowa and threw him over hard the indian hit the ground but he retained his grip on his knife and came up fast the man was like a big cat his black eyes gleamed as he circled to come in again chantryвђs gun lay where it had fallen several feet away his horse the blue roan had trotted off to one side and stopped the red sunset on his saddle the indianвђs hand was lower now he was a wily fighter not to be taken by the trick again вђњyou are a brave manвђќ tom chantry heard himself say вђњi shall hate to kill youвђќ did the man understand chantry heard him suck breath and then he came in swiftly slashing right and left with the knife chantry sidestepped to his left to put the indian out of position but the warrior turned abruptly and lunged again chantry sprang back but in his boots he was not agile enough and as he went back he tripped over the body of one of the other indians his opponent lunged forward but off balance and tripped over chantry tom sprang to his feet more quickly this time and kicked savagely at the indianвђs head the boot heel glanced off the indianвђs temple and sent him rolling leaping on him chantry slipped an arm under him and across the warriorвђs throat clapping the palm of his right hand against the indianвђs skull his left hand grasping his own right arm in a strangle hold he knew he could kill the indian now and he put on pressure fighting for his life suddenly horses were all around them and williams was saying вђњstep back chantry iвђve got a gun on himвђќ slowly tom chantry released his hold and stepped away from the indian who lay gagging and choking and then slowly the brave got to his feet rugger was there and helvie and mckay there were four guns on the indian and rugger eared back his hammer вђњiвђll kill himвђќ he yelled вђњiвђllвђвђњ вђњnoвђќ chantry snapped the word вђњyou kill him and youвђll have to kill meвђќ he turned to face the indian вђњi am tom chantryвђќ he said вђњyou fought well go in peaceвђќ the indian looked at him then at the others вђњyou going to let him goвђќ helvie asked in astonishment suddenly sun chief was there beside them he held out chantryвђs pistol and tom took it dropping it into his holster вђњhe goes freeвђќ he said вђњheвђs too good a man to shoot downвђќ rugger swore вђњheвђs nothinвђ but a damn redskin heвђll kill you the first chance he getsвђќ вђњmaybe but in the meantime he goes freeвђќ he spoke to sun chief вђњtell him he can go tell him i shall come to the village under the big timbers to see him soonвђќ вђњno need to tell he knows what you sayвђќ the pawneeвђs rifle was in his hands вђњthatвђs hewhowalkswithwolves but often he is called wolf walker he is a big warriorвђќ вђњlet him goвђќ wolf walker looked at him a moment then deliberately he turned on his heel and walked away french williams looked at the two dead indians and commented dryly to rugger вђњyouвђd better copper your bets rug thatвђs as good shooting as iвђve ever seen left and right both dead centerвђќ вђњit was luckвђќ chantry said вђњthey surprised me came right up off the groundвђќ вђњso you just killed two of them with two shots and then whipped wolf walker barehandedвђand him with a knife mister you call it what you want to only donвђt call it luckвђќ sun chief caught up the blue roan and chantry swung into the saddle as they started back toward the herd helvie rode alongside chantry and held out his hand вђњwhatever i may have thought about you back at the start i take it back next time you need a hand you just call my name and iвђll come arunninвђ no matter where you want to goвђќ вђњbecause i was able to handle those indiansвђќ вђњno sir i donвђt regard that it was the way you let wolf walker go that shines misterвђќ the cattle passed over the end of the mesa in the last moments of light all shades of hide lost in a uniform darkness the hands circled them to a stop on the flat below clay creek spring and the chuck wagon lumbered over the rocks and swung into place while dutch unhitched for him the cook lowered the back of the wagon to make his table and began setting out the grub tom chantry gathered sticks from the remains of old campfires and using dry grass and leaves for tinder got a small fire started he added buffalo chips and hunted out some dried brush it was a good campвђthe best camp so far tom thought rugger was surly and kincaid still avoided him but dutch helvie and mckay were friendly and easy the fire burned brightly and the food tasted good for the first time in days tom was not hurting anywhere and now he had a good feeling about the fight with wolf walker he did not think about the two indians he had killed they had attacked him without warning and his reaction had been immediate and instinctive french williams was curious вђњnow that shootinвђвђќ he commented вђњsurely didnвђt look like the work of a man who never used a gunвђќ вђњi never said i had never used a gunвђќ chantry replied simply вђњpa was a good hand as you know and he started teaching me early iвђve always had a knack good coordination i guess iвђve hunted a good bit and shot up a lot of ammunition at targets up thereвђќвђ he jerked his head back toward the scene of the fight вђњwas the first time iвђd tried to get a gun out fast in a long timeвђќ вђњwe heard the shotsвђќ mckay commented вђњjust boomboom almost like one soundвђќ chantry glanced over at williams вђњhow far is it to two buttesвђќ вђњfourteen fifteen miles iвђd guess i never did ride directly from here to there weвђll make a proper day of itвђќ all the men were tired but the last events of the day had excited them and stirred them to conversation chantry leaned back against his bedroll and listened to helvie who was telling of a famous fight back in a running battle between indians and the riders of a stage headed for the big timbers station from that the talk continuedвђtalk of cattle and buffalo of the stage lines and the santa fe trail finally tom carried his bedroll into the shadows near the wagon and pulling off his boots and his gun belt he rolled in and slept his last memories were of the occasional crackle of the fire and the low murmur of conversation when he opened his eyes the fire was down to the last red coals all the men were asleep except those with the cattle he was about to turn over and go back to sleep when he saw rugger slip from his bed and move off into the darkness something about his manner moved chantry to watch him goвђnot toward the horses but off into the darkness obviously anxious not to be seen where was he going and for what reason chapter for a moment chantry thought of following him then decided the man was probably just going into the woods on some business of his own and chantry turned over and went to sleep again but in the morning he remembered this small incident and when he had belted on his gun and stepped into his boots he glanced around rugger was saddling a horse as were helvie mckay and kincaid getting ready to ride out and relieve the night guards he saddled his own horse and waited until they had gone then leaving the dun at camp he went into the woods where he had seen rugger go he had no trouble in picking up a track a heel print here a kicked stone there for a hundred yards he trailed him back into the brush and scattered juniper and then across the slope of a hill there the faint trail went down into the hollow beyond here the trail ended near a flat rock there were two cigarette butts for several minutes tom chantry stood there trying to puzzle it out rugger was not exactly a contemplative man not the sort who would walk all this way to be alone with his thoughts he had come for a reason chantry looked around due east lay the trail to two buttes an open stretch of valley two or three miles wide and easy going bordered on the south by two buttes creek about five or six miles away lay the santa fe trail or one branch of it two buttes the highest of which lifted about three hundred feet above the surrounding country were dimly visible on the horizon nothing else he had turned away when he saw in the shelter of another rock a place where a small fire had been built not for warmth for the man had not sat near it and it was built so that it would be visible only from the valley below a signal then but to whom there were no other tracks so if he had expected anyone to meet him that person had not arrived had he left any word there carefully searching with this fresh idea in mind chantry looked around and suddenly he saw it near where the fire had been a tobacco sack picking it up he felt something inside and opened it there was a page torn from a tally book and on it written in a clumsy hand these words butes big timbers kiwas at big timbers he returned the note to the sack and replaced it then he walked back to get his horse the others had eaten and the chuck wagon was packed and ready the cook turned to glance at him then gestured toward the seat вђњi put some grub anвђ coffee out for you figured youвђd be hungryвђќ вђњthanksвђќ the cook waited while he ate and presently he said вђњi like your style chantry canвђt say i cottoned to you right off but youвђve shaped upвђќ вђњthanksвђќ tom said again вђњwhatвђs goinвђ on i donвђt like it atall the way things are french ainвђt like himself anвђ thereвђs hard feelinвђ among the boys like they were up to something they didnвђt care forвђќ chantry finished eating cleaned the plate with sand and passed it to the cook вђњyou canвђt lose cookieвђќ he said вђњeither french or i will pay you boys off if we get through with the herdвђќ вђњthey tell me youвђre figurinвђ to drive right through big timbersвђќ вђњwhy not look if the kiowas want us they can ride up on us any time by driving in any other direction we still couldnвђt get awayвђ cattle move too slow if they mean to attack we canвђt avoid it so why not take the quickest way where thereвђs the best water and grass why not drive right at them so they know weвђre not afraid we know where they are and they know we know so theyвђll be wary of a trap theyвђll be sure weвђve got reason for being confident anyway i never found that a man could avoid trouble by running away from itвђќ he waited while the wagon pulled out and started over the ridge when it was lined out on the trail he rode south to the banks of a creek that flowed into the two buttes almost due south of clay spring the banks were cloaked with shrub willows many of them growing ten to fifteen feet high he went in among them drew up there and stepped down from the saddle searching for a vantage point from which he could watch the rock on the hillside where the message had been left from time to time he looked toward the herd now only a dust cloud down the long valley he drank at the stream and let his horse browse on the rich green grass along the bank an hour passed just as he was about to step into the saddle again he heard the beat of hoofs from over the ridge behind him came two riders who cantered down the slope splashed through the shallow stream and went up the opposite slope to where the message had been left they were some distance off but he needed no closer view to know who they were the talrims the talrims and rugger in this and who else but the message what did it mean butes was obvious enough and it was their next stop after that they were going to big timbers though not in one long drive and at big timbers there were kiowas rugger was apparently telling the talrims their direction of travel and warning them about the kiowas at big timbers but what else despite himself chantry was worried there might be some other meaning which he did not grasp some other reason for the message when the two riders had disappeared over the ridge in the direction of clay spring he rode out of the willows and followed the herd the drive to two buttes was an easy one and chantry rode the drag all the last half they bunched the cattle on the plain north of the buttes avoiding the breaks along the canyon that lay just to the south twice during the last part of the drive they saw indians two of them sat on a ridge watching apparently unworried about being seen that night the camp was quiet вђњwhat do you think frenchвђќ akin said at last вђњwill they tackle usвђќ williams shrugged вђњmaybe yes maybe no from what i hear that passel of kiowas shapes up like a war party and if they want beef there isnвђt any closer than we are the same goes for scalps they know theyвђve tackled my drives a couple of times with no luck so that may steer вђem off but i doubt itвђќ вђњi think weвђre in for a fightвђќ mckay agreed chantry sipped his coffee listened to the talk and watched rugger when he had finished eating rugger strolled over to where kincaid was repairing a broken bridle for several minutes they talked in low tones and nobody seemed to be paying any attention williams was lying on his back his hat over his eyes rugger and kincaid were two of williamsвђ boys did williams know what was going on was this a part of a plan the talrims had kept pace with them for days and chantry was sure they were williamsвђ ace in the hole a shootout at the last minute and with chantry dead the cattle belonged to williams suddenly he remembered the girl sarah where did she figure in all of this did she know that paul was dead had she given up whatever she was trying to do she had wanted tom chantry dead because then only one man would stand between her and what she wanted and that one man had to be french williams yet french professed to know nothing about her or was it paul had he ever mentioned sarahвђs name to french he suddenly said to french вђњweвђve never talked about your backgroundвђќ williamsвђ eyes were level and cold вђњand we are not planning toвђќ he said вђњi was thinking about paulвђќ chantry went on вђњwe need not talk about it but you had better do some thinking about itвђќ вђњi do not know anyone named paulвђќ вђњand there was the girl named sarahвђќ chantry continued williams stared at him вђњsarah sarah and paul it canвђt beвђќ вђњthose were the names they spoke of killing me and then added that there would be only one man left williams the only thing you and i have in common are those cattle if both of us die before we get to the railhead who gets the cattleвђќ the cynical amusement was gone from williamsвђ eyes his face looked drawn вђњyou wouldnвђt have gotten to dodgeвђќ he said вђњso the cattle would belong to me and if i died no it is absurd i canвђt believe itвђќ вђњsarah would be nineteen or twentyвђќ chantry said вђњpaul a few years olderвђќ вђњand paul is dead the kiowas killed himвђќ вђњyesвђќ вђњthen it is overвђќ he muttered half to himself вђњthat will be an end to itвђќ вђњi donвђt think soвђќ chantry insisted quietly вђњthe girl was the stronger one she was the one who was pushing hardest without her i donвђt believe paul would have done anything nor do i believe she will quitвђќ williams stared at tom вђњi thought they had forgotten meвђќ he said вђњnow they find me again and it is for thisвђќ they were aloneвђthe others had gone out on night guard or were asleep вђњi wanted to go back some dayвђќ williams said gloomily вђњit is not a place to forget my boyhood was there and where a man has lived as a boy he has feelings for itвђќ вђњmy first home was out here somewhereвђќ chantry said вђњi never knew exactly where i think it was over east of here you know how it is plains are plains and afterward my mother never would talk about it pa was welloff until that norther wiped him out and we had to move into townвђќ вђњi always wanted to go backвђќ williams said вђњi had a good time as a boyвђќ вђњyou can always go backвђќ вђњyou have much to learn my friend no one ever really goes back for when you return you are not the same as when you left and everything is different and strange you look about where everything ought to be familiar but nothing is right i know my friend but still i did want to go backвђќ вђњwhat have sarah and paul to do with itвђќ williams shrugged вђњperhaps nothing but i do not think there is much to go back to if they have come so far to kill me yes i know them they are the children of my cousin with me they are the last of our line my father always told me i should avoid them they were no good he said and he should know for he came of the same familyвђќ вђњwhat about your mother and fatherвђќ вђњdead my mother died when i was very smallвђ my father only a few years ago my mother was lovely she came of an old old line my father was a common soldier who rose from the ranks to become an officer that is not an easy thing to do in the french army as a boy he dreamed of going off to india of becoming a general вђњactually he served in africa and lost an arm there he came home then married my mother and bought a farm call it an estate if you will his own family he did not like and he avoided my motherвђs family as well вђњthey had refused to sanction the marriage until it became obvious that my mother would refuse to obey and then they sanctioned it but unwillingly later after my father was visited by some of franceвђs foremost military men their attitude changed but he was a proud man and would have none of it вђњhe had the devilвђs own temper and my own was like it when i was not yet sixteen the arrogant nephew of an important man demanded that i hold his horse and i refused he attempted to horsewhip me and although he was three years older and larger i pulled him from his horse and gave him a beating i thought iвђd killed him so i went home and put a few things together to run away вђњmy father came to stand in the door he asked me about it and i told him he said that if i wished to stay he would face them beside me but i refused then he offered me a dozen gold coins but i knew they were all he had and i refused that too finally we split them and i shook his hand and left i never saw him againвђќ вђњthat was in franceвђќ вђњyesвђќ вђњbut the name williams it doesnвђt fitвђќ вђњit was a name i took when i needed a name in a hurry thatвђs allвђќ вђњwhat do you think our chances are now with the kiowasвђќ вђњyou can never tell about indians they might attack and they might not they might try to stampede the herd and then get us one by one as we try to round them up this is a war party hunting trouble the other tribes who pulled out knew that and did not want to be involved if we put on a bold face we might ride right through themвђќ вђњiвђm going into their campвђќ chantry said french stared at him вђњyouвђre crazyвђќ вђњiвђve heard that an indian would never kill a man who came willingly into his camp maybe before or after but never in camp unless he is brought in as a prisonerвђќ вђњyes but you just might find an indian who didnвђt think that wayвђќ вђњin the meantime you boys can drive the cattle right on by going eastвђќ вђњi know where dodge isвђќ williams threw his cigar into the flames вђњif youвђve got nerve enough you might bring it off but i wouldnвђt want to bet on itвђќ chantry got to his feet вђњiвђm turning inвђќ he paused for a moment and then asked casually вђњhow much do you trust ruggerвђќ вђњrugger he works for me but i donвђt trust anybody including youвђќ вђњyou donвђt have to trust me you know what iвђm doing and what iвђm afterвђќ вђњwhat about rugger why do you ask about himвђќ вђњyou figure it out heвђs your manвђќ when tom chantry stretched out in his bed he looked up at the sky and started to think about what he would do next but somehow he fell asleep the fire crackled then hissed as a few drops fell it began to rain quietly and without waking up chantry burrowed deeper into his bedroll chapter the camp was quiet as the men climbed out of their bedrolls in the morning packed them up and stowed them in the chuck wagon the rain had stopped but the sky was gray and thunder rambled in the distant hills french williams chantry noted avoided him as if he regretted having talked so much the previous evening chantry took only coffee for breakfast saddled up and the herd was moving before the night guard had finished breakfast undoubtedly the kiowas knew of every move they made and would be discussing the sudden shift from driving east to pushing the cattle north to the big timbers sun chief had told him a good deal about the indian ways and it was this that had decided chantry on riding into the kiowa camp he would wait until almost the last minute so that his ride to the camp would take him only a little time during that time he would be in danger every yard he gained would be a yard won nobody talked and the cattle did not seem interested in grazing they seemed to want to move on and by now they were well broken to the dayвђs travel except for a couple of wellknown bunchquitters and they could be watched mckay dropped back beside chantry вђњweвђre goinвђ on past the bend of the clayвђќ he said вђњfrenchy says weвђll be drivinвђ sixteen to eighteen miles todayвђќ вђњthe clay does it swing this far eastвђќ вђњuhhuh anвђ then it points right north for the republicanвђќ mckay rode on and the herd moved ahead steadily occasionally trotting obviously williams was hoping to drive far enough so that he could hit the big timbers early in the day by midmorning they crossed the santa fe trail cut deep with the marks of freightersвђ wagons and the countless pack trains that had come this way once far ahead on a knoll they saw two mounted indians watching them but it was not the kiowas chantry was considering today he drew up mopping the sweat from his forehead and watching the cattle go by he was thinking of the note left by rugger and picked up by the talrims butes big timbers kiwas at big timbers what did it mean merely that their next stop was to be two buttes and that they were headed for big timbers from there or did the message mean something else apparently the talrims were watching the herd and would know where it was going perhaps the last phrase was the important one kiowas at big timbers was it a warning or was it a suggestion that if anything was to be done it must be done before the kiowas could beat them to it did they plan to kill him or to steal the herd if it was killing they wanted it would certainly be best for them to wait and see if the kiowas would not do it for them and if nothing happened at big timbers there was still a chance to do what they wanted and even blame the indians for it if it was the herd they wanted they had best steal it at once before the kiowas could act but three men could not take a herd from this crowd unless they had some others working with them was this a move planned by french williams himself still he had seemed genuinely puzzled over chantryвђs comment on rugger chantry let the herd move on ahead he was riding the blue roan and if trouble developed its speed would put him into the action without delay and by riding well back he was able to survey the entire herd as well as the hills around chantry decided he must watch rugger if anything was to happen the manвђs actions would betray him he let his eyes range the hills and sweep the draws on either side as much at least as he could see of them the country was deceptively openlooking but there were draws on either side the beds of intermittent streams that would make good places of concealment for an ambush he suddenly thought of bone mccarthy where was he had he simply pulled off on his own had he been ambushed perhaps to meet the same fate as paul several times during the morning chantry saw rugger and kincaid meet confer briefly and return to their jobs it was nothing to be remarked it happened a dozen times a day during such long drives but now his mind was alert with suspicion sun chief fell back beside him for a short time the pawnee had proved a good hand on the drive working along with the herd in between brief scouting forays into the hills alone on an isolated knob chantry stood in his stirrups and let his eyes range the country the feel of it was coming backвђthis was the land where he had been a boy and certainly the place could not have been far from here this was a land where a man could grow where he could build he found himself wishing he could have known it as the indians had he glanced again toward the herd rugger and kincaid were together again he was turning his mount to ride back to the drag when he saw the black muddy trail where a party of riders had gone down the draw to his right swinging his horse he rode down to read sign there had been perhaps five or six riders and they must have gone by only minutes before he had reached the crest of the knoll honest men did not avoid a trail drive they would ride down to pass the time of day at least he tried to single out tracks but he saw no evidence of the talrims but all were shod horses and by the length of their strides they were good stock running stock tom chantry skirted the knoll and cut down along the slope not heading for the drag but for french williams who was riding point williams turned as he approached no welcome in his eyes вђњkeep your eyes openвђќ tom said вђњweвђre riding into troubleвђќ вђњwhatвђs that meanвђќ french asked вђњi cut sign on half a dozen riders maybe more they passed us only a few minutes back and didnвђt come in to talkвђќ french williams rode a few minutes in silence вђњso you figure somethingвђs building upвђќ вђњyou bet i do i think somebody hopes to grab this herd before we get to big timbersвђќ вђњthat means tonightвђќ вђњor today or on the drive tomorrowвђќ williams said no more and rode on tom chantry dropped back and as he passed helvie he said again вђњkeep your eyes open weвђre riding into troubleвђќ вђњkiowasвђќ вђњmaybe somebody closer to homeвђќ helvie shot him a quick look вђњif you mean french i ride for the brandвђќ вђњbut who is the brand here is it french is it me or the herdвђќ helvie was silent a moment considering that then he said вђњthe herd iвђm a cattlemanвђќ вђњiвђll ask nothing more we both signed on to take this herd all the wayвђќ вђњmckay will standвђќ вђњi think so too and i think dutch willвђќ helvie glanced at him вђњdutch yes i think he will youвђre not mentioning rugger or kincaidвђќ вђњno iвђm not i donвђt know about them but theyвђve been doing a lot of getting together this morningвђќ and he told helvie about the note rugger had left and the talrims picking it up he also told him about the fresh trail just over the ridge from the herd вђњmaybe iвђm chasing wild geeseвђќ he said finally вђњbut iвђm going to ride loose and listenвђќ sun chief hung well back from the drag urging those steers that lingered behind but never closing in tight on the drag seeing him there gave chantry reassurance for he had great respect for the pawnee and his awareness of what went on but where was mccarthy twice they saw indians but they were only watching if they planned an attack they were content to wait until the cattle were driven to them were they aware of those other watchers chantry asked sun chief вђњthey knowвђќ he answered chantry pulled his horse around the herd and rode toward the point he drew up alongside rugger вђњhowвђre they goingвђќ вђњall rightвђќ rugger spoke sullenly not inviting conversation вђњkeep your eyes openвђќ chantry said вђњweвђre in kiowa countryвђќ вђњi know thatвђќ вђњthereвђs some outlaws around tooвђќ chantry added casually вђњbut we neednвђt worry about them we can handle themвђќ rugger stared at him narroweyed вђњoutlaws there ainвђt no outlaws around hereвђќ вђњwhat about bill coeвђs outfit from robberвђs roost or the talrim brothersвђќ вђњthey ainвђt likely to be aroundвђќ rugger said вђњnoвђќ as he turned his horse he smiled at rugger what he had hoped to accomplish was little enough but he might have sowed seeds of doubt in ruggerвђs mind at least he felt that he had worried him and rugger might attempt to call off the impending raid if that was what was planned but the day passed quietly and the herd had kept moving north it was sundown when they were circled and bedded down in a small bend of clay creek the creek was no longer running bank full but had dropped to a small stream at the bottom of the creek bed enough to water the cattle while the others watched over the cattle hay gent and chantry rode out to scout the country around sun chief had already vanished into the gathering dusk from the crest of the ridge a mile back from the camping ground and some two hundred feet higher they scanned the surrounding territory there was nothing to be seen вђњcould be an army out thereвђќ gent commented вђњthereвђs lots of dips and hollowsвђќ вђњsleep lightвђќ chantry advised вђњtonight and tomorrow will be the danger timeвђќ while rugger and mckay watched the cattle grazing on the easy slope along the stream the others ate hurriedly then helvie hay gent and akin went out while the others came in to eat tom chantry wasted no time he ate drank an extra cup of coffee and then rolled in his blankets the cook had promised to wake him at midnight but he awoke shortly before that for a moment he lay perfectly still listening he heard no sound not a snore not the crackle of burning wood nothing suddenly alert he strained his ears nothing very carefully he sat up the fire was there burned down to coals now the wagon was there the red light from the fire throwing black shadows of its spokes the bedrolls were there but all were empty he put his hand to his gun but there was no gun slowly he got to his feet and moved one quick step into the deeper shadow of the brush his mouth was dry his head throbbed dully he had been doped the coffee he stepped back to his bedroll and slid his winchester from the blankets that they had been unable to get for he had been almost lying on it holding it in one hand he picked up his boots with the other and stepped back into the shadows putting down the rifle he pulled on his boots shrugged into a coat and then took up his hat and rifle he edged around the fire and started toward the remuda it was gone all the horses gone he stood for a minute trying to clear his dulled mind he had suspected an attempt to stampede the herd and he had tied the lineback dun out in the brush saddled and ready now he slipped back there like a ghost the dun was there a good fifty yards back in the brush along the route by which they had come he tightened the cinch and stepped into the saddle coiling the picket rope as he sat there thinking then he rode out to the cattle and they were there bedded down and quiet but no riders rode around them no voices sang oddly at that moment he remembered his own curiosity about why cowpunchers sang to cattle the answer was simple enough the longhorn steer is a wild animal quick to stampede and the men riding herd at night sang so that the cattle would not be surprised at the sound of their approach hearing the familiar voices reassured the animals and they continued to doze or sleep trail drivers sang during the night watch more for the sake of the cattle than for their own amusement riding up to them now he began to sing softly just loud enough so they could hear him slowly he swung around the herd then made a second circle farther out he was looking for anybody or anything he might find but he found nothing what had happened had they abandoned him and the cattle had they all been spirited away by indians if so why had he been left was this part of williamsвђ game to win the herd and what could he do now what could he do alone as dawn began to break he rode back to the camp he found no signs of struggle the bedrolls lay as they had been left evidently the men had got up pulled on their boots and walked quietly away whether of their own volition or under the threat of a gun he had no way of knowing going to the chuck wagon he dug out a side of bacon filled a small sack with coffee a couple of loaves of bread and some odds and ends he took a spare coffeepot his cup and whatever else he might need then he rode back to the herd the cattle were already up and stretching grazing a little the brindle steer that had been the leader since the third day had moved out and head up was waiting вђњall right boy letвђs goвђќ chantry said and he started off riding point the brindle steer followed slowly the others fell in behind broken to the trail by long days of driving how long he could keep them together he did not know the brindle steer pointed north toward the big timbers and tom chantry circled back driving in the laggards the herd was moving warily he rode back to the point watching the country around which was relatively open what had he been expected to do cut and run start scouting for them and leave the cattle left to themselves the herd would soon scatter and no doubt they would soon realize he was alone and begin to fall out of the drive anyway all he had going for him was that brindle steer and the ingrained habit of the days on the trail but for the time the cattle moved off willingly enough the cattle had been moving steadily for nearly an hour when the indians appeared first there was one then another then a dozen they lined the crest of the low rise half a mile on his left and watched him they could see he was alone one man and a great herd of cattle held together only by the habit of the trail suddenly from out of a draw sun chief appeared he rode to the drag bunching those cattle that were beginning to lag and scatter a moment later bone mccarthy came from the shadow of a juniper on a low ridge and rode down to the flank and the cattle moved on toward big timbers and the arkansas river at noon the indians were still with them watching bone circled around and tarred the point inward and between them they bunched the cattle with sun chief and chantry standing guard bone mccarthy fried some bacon and made coffee вђњi found your railheadвђќ bone told him вђњitвђs this side of the colorado line coming on about a mile a day more or less i found something else too i found a telegram for youвђќ he handed the handwritten message to chantry it was brief and to the point reverses here without the herd i have nothing all depends on you doris sends love earnshaw вђњdid you read thisвђќ вђњcouldnвђt help it open like that besides i figured if i lost it iвђd still know what it had to say toughвђќ вђњheвђs a good man bone i canвђt let him downвђќ вђњthree men more than two thousand head of stock no remuda and those kiowas lookinвђ down our necks man youвђve bought yourself a big jobвђќ chantry glanced toward the ridge the kiowas were there watching and somewhere nearby he could be sure the outlaws who wanted his cattle were watching too but most of all he thought of french williams no matter what the man had been chantry had always deep down within himself believed that french would play his hand out fair and square they rode out to the cattle and sun chief came to the fire the kiowas were still out there more of them now and the big timbers were not far ahead where he had promised to visit the wolf walker вђњbossвђќ mccarthy said вђњwhatвђќ вђњwe got companyвђќ chantry turned in the direction mccarthy indicated a rider was coming toward them walking his horse and singing tenting tonight on the old camp ground it was mobile callahan chapter вђњlooks to me chantry like you could use a good handвђќ callahan said вђњiвђve been round and about and up the trail a time or two and iвђm a fair hand with a rope or a gunвђќ вђњyouвђve got a jobвђќ вђњdonвђt want you should worry about that mr sparrow is payinвђ me plenty to help you get to the railheadвђќ вђњsparrow paying youвђќ вђњuhhuh he some kin oвђ yoursвђќ вђњnoвђќ mobile glanced toward the indians вђњyouвђve got to figure on them of course but what you really need are horses what happenedвђќ chantry explained in as few words as possible his eyes straying from the cattle to the indians вђњyou think it was french williamsвђќ chantry shrugged вђњthe talrims are around and i think rugger was planning something with somebody else all i know is that everything iвђve got is riding with this herd and worse yet everything my boss has got is too if we can bring it in we can make something and if not a good man and his daughter have gone down with usвђќ they rode on in silence keeping moving constantly but trying to save their horses as much as possible at intervals all four men got off and walked by noon they could see the trees along the arkansas the looming tops of the big timbers they circled the herd and while the cattle were resting they built a fire вђњiвђm going on into the indian campвђќ chantry told them вђњi said i was going and i must i donвђt know what they are planning but my chances are as good there as here stay with the herd but if youвђre attacked scatter and run for it we can always get together and fight again i donвђt want to lose any of youвђќ вђњif you go into that campвђќ mccarthy warned вђњyouвђll lose your hairвђќ вђњmaybeвђќ he hesitated finishing his coffee вђњon the other hand i might make a deal for some horses you can help me cut out about six head of good beef iвђll drive them in for a gift to wolf walkerвђќ from the knolls the indians watched as the men cut out the beef and they followed chantry when he started for the big timbers with them suddenly four indians came riding down to him they drew up вђњi am going to your campвђќ chantry said speaking slowly вђњi take a present to wolf walker to hewhowalkswithwolvesвђќ one older buck with a strong profile demanded вђњwhy you do thisвђќ вђњi am tom chantry the wolf walker and i fought it was a good fight he fought with great strength it is good that we be friendsвђќ nothing more was said but the kiowas closed in around him and around the cattle soon they dipped down forded the river as far as an island then went on to the further bank and were among the cottonwoods the huge trees were scattered and the grass was thick beneath them there was much shade and the small fallen branches and twigs provided kindling for fires here and there were dead trees and he could see where some had been felled in the past suddenly the lodges were before him this was the sort of camp the kiowas or comanches preferred among open timber the sioux liked their camps near water but away from timber because of their dread of ambush the osage omahas and shawnees preferred dense thickets as they rode in women and children came from the lodges from among the trees and from the banks of the streams several warriors strode up to chantry and one grasped his bridle with a strong hand вђњi come to make talk with the wolf walkerвђќ he said an indian pushed back the flap of his tipi and stood up it was the wolf walker вђњi bring you a giftвђќ tom chantry said and he gestured toward the cattle вђњwe fought well you and iвђќ he held out his hand вђњi am tom chantryвђќ an older indian who stood nearby grunted and said something to those who stood about him wolf walker said вђњred buffalo speaks your name but he speak bordenвђќ вђњborden chantry was my fatherвђќ suddenly tom remembered the indians who had come often to the ranch when the weather was cold and hunting was bad his father had fed them had traded horses with them вђњthe kiowas were our good friendsвђќ he said вђњthey came often to my fatherвђs lodge i was papooseвђќ the old indian granted вђњcome eatвђќ chantry dismounted and followed the older indian to his lodge others followed them and they sat crosslegged on the floor вђњwhere you goвђќ the old indian presently demanded вђњto the wagonthatsmokesвђќ chantry said вђњto ship the cattle to my people who are hungryвђќ вђњyou men where they goвђќ he shrugged вђњsome friends some no friends to me they steal my horses they wish to steal cattle the wohawsвђќ he added remembering the indian name for oxen as he ate with them they asked of his father вђњhe is deadвђќ he said вђњthree men killed himвђ long agoвђќ вђњyou kill them nowвђќ вђњi have lost their sign many years i was far awayвђќ he gestured toward the east вђњthey are gone maybe deadвђќ вђњno deadвђќ the old indian said quietly вђњme know them two men are where iron trail endsвђќ вђњwhatвђќ he exclaimed he was not sure they had understood or that he had вђњyou say the men who killed my father are at the railheadвђќ вђњi say five men now three big menвђќ в he indicated the rusty stain on a potвђ вђњhair like soвђќ he tapped the rusty spot вђњone who has no scalp one the little birdвђќ it made no sense but he was not interested now in the men who had killed his father that was all water under the bridge nor did he believe he would find them at the railhead all he wanted now was freedom from attack and he believed he had won that any man who entered an indian village of his own volition was safe as long as he remained there though anyone outside the tribe was a potential enemy peace within the village was of first importance as there had been no chance of outrunning the kiowas with a trail herd his best chance had been to come among them without a doubt they believed he had returned to avenge his father had he denied it they would have lost respect for him and any friendship they might have had would be gone until now he had almost forgotten that his father had been a friend of the kiowas one of the fiercest of all the plains tribes he had traded with them fed them when they were hungry sheltered them often and interceded for them with the army he had done it out of respect and admiration not in fear and this the indians knew it followed that they would have known who killed him he got to his feet вђњi will come again to your villageвђќ he said вђњmy father was your friend and so shall i beвђќ he turned to wolf walker and thrust out his hand вђњsomeday we will hunt togetherвђќ the indian took his hand and the black eyes gleamed turning his back chantry went out and an indian boy held his horse he stepped into the saddle raised his right hand and rode away when he got back to the herd the cattle were moving the riders came back and gathered around himвђcallahan sun chief and mccarthy вђњwhat happenedвђќ mobile asked he explained and then added вђњthey told me the men who killed my father are at the railheadвђќ вђњwaitinвђ for youвђќ mobile asked вђњafter all these years whyвђќ вђњwhen youвђve lived a few years longer youвђll no longer wonder at the motives of men theyвђre mixed mr chantry and sometimes they donвђt know the why of them themselvesвђќ after a moment he went on вђњsometimes a man regrets you ever know regret mr chantry i have it is a powerful motive a mighty powerful one with some folksвђќ вђњand maybe they think youвђve come back to hunt them downвђќ mccarthy commented ironically вђњmaybe they just figure to get you before you get themвђќ after a moment mobile callahan said вђњdid you see them would you know them nowвђќ he considered that a moment вђњi donвђt know one of them was slight and young the other twoвђ well one of them was very big and redheaded but i doubt if i would know them now it has been a long timeвђќ вђњbeing gunhandy is a risky thing mr chantryвђќ callahan said вђњif a gun comes easy to your hand youвђre apt to let it happen when it shouldnвђt iвђve used a gun a time or two and most times whoever was on the other end had it acominвђ but there was a timeвђвђњ he swung wide and brought a laggard steer back to the herd вђњthere was a time when i killed a man that didnвђt need killinвђ it was in a poker game nobody blamed me for the shootinвђ but it didnвђt do me a damn bit oвђ good to tell myself that i gave him everвђ chanceвђi knew i hadnвђt the gun came too easy to my hand вђњhe had a wife and three kids and he said her name when he was dyinвђ вђњi did what i could for вђemвђќ mobile callahan was silent for a few minutes вђњi regret that shootinвђ mr chantry i surely do i always haveвђќ tom chantry rode out to the point thinking about what had happened where were french williams and the others had they deserted him or had they been taken away at gun point had he been doped that night in the coffee by sundown they were nine miles west whoever had told him there were only three days of driving to go had been mistaken of course there had been delays there had been frequent stops some of them overlong and their route had not always been the most direct how far now he wanted to ask bone mccarthy or sun chief but they were scattered out and there was no chance the herd had handled easily so far but it seemed as if they were becoming aware that the riders were fewer however the old brindle steer stayed right on the line where his nose was pointed heading toward the railroad as if he could smell the steam and the cinders the sun was low and it was time to circle for the night when the riders came upon them a moment before they had been moving placidly enough and then almost out of nowhere or out of the sinking sun the charging horsemen the thunder of guns and the longhorns broke into a run mobile callahan was riding drag sun chief was working the north side of the herd and bone mccarthy was on the south chantry himself was riding point and when the herd broke he was swept along riding at breakneck speed to keep from being trampled by the frightened maddened cattle somebody yelled вђњkill him kill chantryвђќ as the dust and the cattle closed around him he saw one person sitting a horse alone on a small knoll watching him it was sarah and then his world was filled with the thunder of hoofs the shouts of men the shotsвђand somewhere a scream of pain drowned by the roar of the stampede chapter there was no fighting the maddened rush of more than two thousand head of cattle the sudden charge from out of the sun the burst of firing and the cattle were gone his only hope was to run to keep ahead of them and to pray that his horse would keep its feet if the horse fell he was surrounded by tossing horns and there seemed no chance to break out of the herd there was nothing to do but run with them until the impetus of the charge was broken and the cattle stopped of their own volition suddenly the sun was gone but the red glow remained in the sky he had his sixshooter out ready to kill a steer to pile them up if he could but so far the dun was keeping its feet and was running freely he had no idea how far they had run but he knew that his horse could not hold such a pace for long a gap showed between the steer ahead and the steer to the right and chantry put the dun over hoping he might work his way free of the herd even in this moment of danger the thought came to him who had screamed back there the stampede must have caught somebody and trampled him down then he found another gap eased into it and suddenly he was at the edge of the herd and was fighting his way free of it he had run another halfmile before he was out of the press of cattle and running the flank he slowed the dun watching the herd stream by the time was not right for turning it and anyway he did not have the man power his best bet was to let them run then as they slowed down begin gradually turning them to point them north once more the stars were out the sky was black above the earth was black below the cattle were slowing now the fever run out of them and the fear gone he listened and above the steady pound of hoofs he heard only the occasional clack of horns bashing together no voices no other sound he moved in close to the herd now and began to sing to them trying to calm them and pushing a little toward the east as he did so slowly the cattle turned before him he saw a few scattered ones and swung wide to intercept them turning them back into the herd as he had them streaming out toward the east suddenly three riders topped out on a knoll instantly he recognized one of themвђit was sarah and the talrims at the same instant a shot rang out from behind him he felt a solid blow on the cantle of his saddle and heard a bullet whine off into the distance he managed one quick glance over his shoulder and saw four riders closing in from behind sarah and the talrims all threw up their rifles at once and he slapped spurs to his horse the dun was running its heart out now it went over the hill and down a ridge and chantry saw ahead of him several tall cottonwoods he almost pulled up though the trees were a good mile off he saw in the scene something more something familiar it was home the home ranch a bullet kicked dust just head of him and he threw one wild glance over his shoulder fanned out behind him were seven or eight riders another was closing in from the flank a volley came from behind and he felt the dun stumble he raced into the trees swung around and pulled up staring at his old home only the shell remained the roof had partly fallen in some of the logs had been pulled from the end wall to build a fire the old barn where he had once played was gone there were only the charred remains he heard the pound of hoofs and swung his horse around there was no place here to make a stand he could only run untilвђ the hole it rushed into his mind he had not thought of the hole in years was it still there was it large enough to take a man he shucked his rifle from the scabbard and rode the staggering dun down the draw then kicked free of the saddle and dropped as he did so he grabbed at the saddlebags and had barely got them when the dun slid to a stand half falling вђњsorry old boy i canвђt help you nowвђќ he ducked and ran he saw the brush where he had played at indian as a child the ditch cut by runoff water was larger now he ran along it safely hidden now as he had been then he went over the slight rise and into a buffalo wallow the wind had scoured it deeper he crawled slid and worked his way ahead he could hear them yelling and swearing as they searched around the ruins of the old house he went over the narrow ridge and saw the spot before him the sound of hoofs was not far off and he heard an angry shout вђњhis horse is down we got himвђќ he ran up to the place no water no spring any longer only a sandy basin about a dozen feet across and a slab of rock where the hole should have been he grabbed the rock with both hands and stood it on edge there was a hole there scarcely large enough for a manвђbut it was a hole was it deep enough his only chance was to try he turned around and backed into it kicking obstructions away when he got in all the way he pulled his winchester in after him he found a ledge on which to place the rifle then reaching out he grasped the slab at first it refused to budge he dug at its base and it slid forward falling over the opening closing him in he was buried alive literally he was buried could he push the stone outward again could he dig around it as he remembered there had been a solid ledge there crouching in the hole he waited had he left any marks they could see the sand of the basin had been churned by the feet of buffalo or cattle but if the stone had left any fresh earth exposedвђwhat then what was most in his favor was the sheer unlikelihood of a cave or opening anywhere around there was simply no probability of such a thing as he crouched there he heard horsesвђ hoofs again and muffled talk then a womanвђs voice it was shrill and he could make out the words faintly вђњnobody can vanish into nothing like that heвђs got to be hereвђќ for a little while the muttered talk continued then there was silence he put a hand on his rifle and moved it about behind the ledge where it had been lying was a solid wall but behind him and on the other side of him he touched nothing he listened but there was now no sound outside the air around him seemed fresh enough he felt in his pocket and found a match and struck it on the hammer of his rifle the match flared burned up brightly and he peered around the cave sloped down toward the back where he had crawled in it was a narrow tunnel no more than three feet across and where he now stood it was a little more than six feet behind him he had the impression of va s and from somewhere he heard the drip of water when he had found this cave as a child he had shown it to his father but there had never been time to explore it how large it was or where it led he had no idea from a few sticks perhaps pulled in by some animal long ago he selected a couple and lighted them they were dry and they burned well enough he made his way down the slope and found himself in a fairly large room from which a passage led at the bottom there was a pool of clear water a small stream trickled into it and this at one time must have been the spring he had drunk from as a boy but the floor of the cave seemed to have fallen and the trickle of water no longer reached the surface at this point he tasted the water and found that it was cold and fresh he drank then drank again then he returned to the spot near the opening and sat in the dark and chewed on a piece of jerky when it was finished he crawled up in the hole and pushed against the slab of stone it would not budge he pushed again but it did not move desperately he lunged against it but in the narrow passage it was difficult to exert any great force finally he drew back struggling for breath he sat down and fought against the panic that was welling up within him he forced himself to think remembering something his father had said вђњuse your head boy that head of yours is the one thing that makes you different from an animal of any other kind when you feel yourself getting scared sit down relax and let yourself be calm then study it out you will find an answerвђќ he sat quietly and slowly the panic left him that stone weighed no more than fifty or sixty pounds it was several inches thick and it had slid down from above the hole the old runoff water from the spring had fallen into the sandy basin several inches lower than the hole so if he put the pressure on the very top of the slab it might be tipped forward and over but what if those outside had found what he had done suppose they knew there was a hole here and that he had crawled in and knowing that suppose they had heaped earth over the rock packed it in to let him stay there and die there was no use in supposing he was not going to escape his dilemma by sitting and worrying about it what he had to do was try for a way out he crawled up in the narrow hole once more but this time he did not fight the rock he felt with his fingers for the very top of the slab and then he pushed nothing happened he waited a moment gathered strength and pushed harder the slab moved and a trickle of sand fell into the cave from above a moment longer he waited and then he pushed again the slab moved outward a little more and fell and the hole gaped at the top letting in both light and air again he pushed and a bullet clipped the top of the slab and spat sand into his face вђњstay thereвђќ the unfamiliar voice was harsh вђњyouвђre dead so stay deadвђќ he backed away he might chance a shot but he would have to get far enough into the hole to be able to see a target outside before he could fire on the other hand they would have a target they could not easily miss he put his rifle down carefully felt for the sticks and held a match to the frayed end of one it caught went out but caught with the next match taking up his rifle and several other sticks he went down the slope toward the back the flame bent slightly back toward the way he had come there was a draft here a slight movement of air from somewhere ahead he went on moving as swiftly as he could he found occasional small pieces of wood changed sticks lighting from his previous torch he crossed the roomlike area and glimpsed several dark openings but went on in the direction of the draft there was a trickle of water on the cave floor and he bent over and dampened his face it cooled quickly from the movement of air he had walked perhaps a hundred steps when he saw a faint gleam of light he lighted another dry stick and hurried on the gleam of light came from a small opening only a few yards ahead but suddenly he came to an abrupt halt for the light he saw was coming from an opening at the edge of a heavy canvas curtain weighted at the bottom with a wooden pole he went up to it and pulled it slightly aside he looked around in amazement then swore softly he was standing at the back of the root cellar on the ranch where he had grown up before him was a wall of shelves he started to move it and found the wall turned on a pivot the place was empty dusty longundisturbed by anything other than pack rats here his family had stored vegetables they had raised in their small kitchen garden and here his father had always warned them they were to take shelter in case of indian attack he remembered the day he had shown his father his cave that he called the hole his father had been properly astonished properly admiring and his father he now knew had known of it all the time now he knew where he was and he knew where the ones outside must be he checked his rifle and went to the door it was half hidden behind the bole of a huge old cottonwood and there was a little light coming through the crack where the boards of the door had shrunk he peered out and could see nothing but he did hear horses cropping grass rifle in his right hand ready to fire he moved the door with his left dust and sand fell but it moved easily nothing out there but the trees and grass the ruins of the barn some scattered gray boards and the brush beyond then to the right he glimpsed the horses cropping the grass he went up the last step and moved out he stood listening but heard nothing from behind the cottonwood he scouted the area carefully with eyes and ears nothing he walked toward the horses and took the bridle of the first one he stepped into the saddle and catching the bridle of the other walked the horse carefully away the men who watched the hole for him could continue to watch but they would have a long wait he rode to where he had left the dun the horse was down and dead he swore bitterly the dun had been a good horse a noble horse and he wanted to see no horse die he stepped down stripped his gear from the dead animal and exchanged it for that on the horse he was riding then he mounted up leading the spare horse he started north the first thing to do was to find the herd chapter from the hill above butte springs he glimpsed some scattered cattle and rode toward them he gathered them taking it easy to save his horses he led the extra mount so he could switch if need be there were eighteen head and he bunched them then pushed on gathering more beyond plum creek he could see still others scattered out and grazing the day was warm and clear and his eyes ranged the country around alert to sight any movement of men or animals if he could gather enough of the herd he would start them toward the railroad which must be north of him now and near the river he would drive what cattle he could gather pick up some hands and return to make a sweep of the plains beyond granada creek he could see the dusty trace that marked the sante fe trail by the time he was midway between plum and granada he had gathered more than a hundred head leaving them to graze he trailed the reins of the horse he was riding and switched to the other he left his first mount with the cattle rode west and began to gather more alternating horses he had by nightfall added another two hundred head to his herd finding them often in bunches of a dozen or more he pushed them north a couple of miles to fresh grass and when they had begun to lie down he made his own camp near a pool of water left from the recent rains in an arroyo that emptied into plum creek he did not build a fire with his horses picketed close by he went to sleep trusting to them to alert him to any danger the night passed quietly and before dawn he was up saddled his horses and rode out to continue his gather a few cattle had drifted into the basin and he added them to what he had then crossed the sante fe trail into the breaks around the head of wolf creek on the slope below him he saw some five hundred head of cattle bunched together and two picketed horses keeping out of sight he worked around on foot until he could see their camp two men were sleeping under a bank near some junipers a thin tendril of smoke lifted from the remains of their fire recovering his horse he rode in a small circle to a place among the junipers near them and then crept down the slope until he was on the bank just above them a dim path evidently made by buffalo or antelope went around the junipers and down into their camp it was all he needed moving quietly he made his way closer until he stood in their camp actually his movements were practically silent he picked up their rifles and put them behind him then went to the sleeping men each of whom had a sixshooter near him as he bent over holding his rifle in his right hand and just about to reach with his left and pick up the nearest manвђs gun belt the man lunged up from his bed and grabbed at the rifle as he lunged tom chantry swung a short buttstroke to the temple and the man dropped as though hit with an axe coolly chantry picked up the other gun belt then booted the sleeping man in the ribs he raised his head and said вђњwhat the hellвђќ and then he saw chantry standing over him вђњget upвђќ chantry said вђњand get your boots on weвђve got some cattle to driveвђќ вђњgo to hellвђќ chantry stooped suddenly grabbed the manвђs bed and jerked as he tumbled from the blankets chantry stepped in and kicked him in the stomach the man rolled over retching вђњnow get up and get your boots onвђќ chantry repeated вђњyouвђre going to find out what it means to steal another manвђs cattleвђќ the rustler gasped for a few minutes he looked at his companion вђњwhat happened to himвђќ вђњhe got a little ambitious maybe his skull is bustedвђќ вђњanвђ you donвђt give a damnвђќ вђњno i donвђt what happens to a thief is his own tough luck when you start out to steal youвђre anybodyвђs game remember that now you get your horse saddled weвђre driving these cattleвђќ вђњwhat about himвђќ вђњif he revives he can help you if he doesnвђt the buzzards will take care of him get movingвђќ chantry backed to the fire and picked up the coffeepot some coffee sloshed in it and he drank from the edge keeping a good distance he let his eyes range the area seeking out any possible cover a groan from the other man alerted him and he saw him stirring he walked over and booted him вђњget up get into your bootsвђќ вђњiвђll kill you for thisвђќ the man growled вђњget into the saddleвђќ chantry said вђњif you drive those cattle and donвђt get funny i may let you live make a wrong move and iвђll shoot you iвђm out of patienceвђќ with the two rustlers working under his rifle chantry gathered the bunch they had and drove them over to his own small herd which had scattered a bit as they grazed when the cattle were bunched with his own he faced the two rustlers staying fifty yards off from them his rifle on them he said вђњwhat became of my ridersвђќ вђњwouldnвђt you like to knowвђќ said the heavier of the two with a sneer вђњyes i wouldвђќ tom chantry smiled pleasantly at them вђњyou boys can tell me or not as you choose iвђve got this rifle and i can drop a running rabbit with it and you boys make a good deal bigger target youвђre cow thievesвђmaybe murderers whether you get out of this alive depends on how you cooperate and on my whim iвђve a good notion to shoot you both where you stand if youвђre found dead out here nobody is going to ask questions of course it would make it easier to handle the cattle if you boys work along and helpвђќ they looked at him and they did not like what they saw the rifle was ready and they judged him as they would themselves after all why should he keep them alive вђњall rightвђќ the bigger man agreed вђњweвђll ride along and heвђp with the cattle anвђ weвђll stay right with you up to the rails but what thenвђќ chantry shrugged вђњi donвђt want either of you you help me get my cattle to the railhead and then you can get out of the country as fast as you can ride start any sooner than within sight of the rails and iвђll shoot you wherever it isвђќ would he at that moment chantry had no idea he knew that come what might he must get these cattle to the railroad he strapped their rifles to his own saddle and their gun belts as well they started the cattle pointing them north it could not be more than twenty miles to the railroad now and probably was less for an hour they moved steadily chantry worked well back out of the dust his rifle ready to use at any sign of betrayal but they had no need for betrayal for suddenly without warning a dozen riders appeared they swept down upon him four of them rushing at the herd the others forming up near him a few yards off and they came at a time when his rifle was in his scabbard the first time all morning when that had been the case rugger was there and kincaid koch was there grinning at him a triumphant grin the others were strangers to his relief not one of the men with whom he had worked so well mckay hay gent or helvie was among them вђњlooks like you heвђped us round вђem upвђќ rugger said вђњanвђ we thank you for that now weвђre takinвђ them overвђќ they were going to kill him koch would never have it otherwise nor rugger either for that matter вђњlet me make you an offer boysвђќ chantry said pleasantly and drew his gun they were off guard his speed was greater than they expected and their reaction time was against them he drew and shot rugger out of the saddle then switched the gun to koch kochвђs rifle was coming up and chantryвђs bullet aimed for his midsection hit the hammer and glanced upward catching koch under the chin he toppled from his horse blood streaming from his throat and the horse went galloping away over the prairie rugger was on the ground koch was gone the others found themselves staring at a sixshooter that seemed to have come from nowhere вђњshuck those gunsвђќ tom chantry said вђњor iвђll empty some saddles quickвђќ kincaid hesitated and a bullet broke his arm at the elbow reaching over to one of the captured holsters chantry took another sixshooter with his left hand there was no need for it the others were loosening their gun belts the shooting had happened so fast that not one of them had even had time to register the need for a draw вђњnow get out of hereвђќ with a thunder of hoofs the riders were streaking away the men near him swung their horses and started to ride away and he let them go once more he was alone with the cattle and then he saw why the others had fled riding toward him in a long array was a line of at least fifty kiowa braves ahead of them they were driving several hundred head of cattle wolf walker rode toward him a dozen braves close behind he stopped in a swirl of dust вђњwe come we help we drive wohaws for friendвђќ вђњi thank youвђќ chantry said slowly the herd bunched again from somewhere came old brindle and stepped into the lead and the cattle moved off slowly from out of the draws other bunches of cattle came driven by kiowas by nightfall the cattle all seemed to have been gathered but tom chantry was worried where were french williams and the others williams himself was an uncertain quantity a man he had never trusted completely helvie mckay gent and akin had all seemed good men and dependable behind it all he was sure were the operations of sarah she must have found and employed the talrim brothers and she must have recruited the others to help her she would know what arguments to use if what she wanted was ownership of the cattle she would have clear title once he and williams were out of the way but now there seemed no way she could win the railroad was only a few miles away and the kiowas who guarded the cattle were fighting men not to be trifled with chantry recalled what she had told paul about not paying the men who helped her and he was sure she had something of the sort in mind now she was not the sort to give up easily but what could she do she must believe that the cards were all in her hands she probably had french williams a prisoner or had killed him and perhaps she still thought that tom chantry was trapped in the hole some of the outlaws who had been driving the cattle might have gotten in touch with her but that he doubted what would she do now the cattle would be delivered at the railhead placed aboard cars there and shipped east it began to look as if sarah was whipped and french williams too and then he remembered that at the railhead were the men who had killed his father what was he going to do about that and what did they plan to do chapter the river was not far off now and the railroad followed it he pointed the way occasionally glancing back to see if any enemies were in sight but he trusted the indians to alert him to any danger this was the shortgrass country blue grama buffalo grass and some needle grasses patches of prickly pear appeared now and again and yucca often called soap weed from the indiansвђ use of it dotted the plains the cattle seeming to sense the river with its abundance of water moved steadily onward and the kiowas proved efficient herdsmen working with the cattle as if born to it they were magnificent horsemen and managed their quick ponies without effort twice chantry glimpsed antelope and once a small bunch of buffalo moving southward away from the river suddenly from far off he heard a train whistle the kiowas drew up to listen and even the steers lifted their heads staring wildeyed at the unfamiliar sound a thin trail of smoke showed in the sky they topped out on a low rise and the river lay before them and somewhat to the east of north they saw a cluster of buildings and a train its locomotive giving off the smoke he had seen there was a sudden flurry of action near the town men running and mounted men beginning to assemble wolf walker came up to chantry вђњthey see usвђќ he said grimly вђњthink we come for fightвђќ вђњhold them iвђll ride aheadвђќ he started down the slight slope at a canter to meet the horsemen he was nearly at the town when he came up to them two dozen men armed and ready to fight вђњtake it easy gentlemenвђќ he said вђњthose kiowas are driving my cattle for meвђќ вђњlike hellвђќ blustered a huge bearded man вђњthis hereвђs a squaw manвђheвђs one of themвђќ вђњiвђm not one of them and i am driving these cattle from cimarron to load on the steam cars rustlers scattered my herd and the kiowas helped me gather them and drive them on they have been very helpfulвђќ вђњi donвђt believe thatвђќ the big man exclaimed вђњiвђвђњ chantry swung his horse to face him вђњmy friendвђќ he said вђњi am losing patience with you if you say that again youвђd better have a gun in your handвђќ the man started to speak then stopped but his eyes were ugly вђњhold your horses butlerвђќ another man said вђњsparrow told me about this man heвђs the one that stock buyer is waitinвђ for this hereвђs tom chantryвђќ вђњchantryвђќ suddenly butler was all confidence вђњyouвђre the one that took water from dutch akin well byвђto was вђњmr butlerвђќ chantry interrupted вђњyou are right i am the man who refused to fight a stranger against whom i had no animosity under the same circumstances i would do the same thing again вђњhowever a few miles back along the trail you will find two men who attempted to take my cattle rugger and koch you will find them dead iвђm afraid their intentions caused me to develop some animosity very quickly and you are now creating the same situation if i were you iвђd throttle down while you are still in a condition to do soвђќ he turned to the other man вђњthank you sir for speaking up i need a few good hands to take my herd and bring it in the kiowas would prefer not to come into townвђќ вђњiвђll helpвђќ the man turned in his saddle вђњjoe how about you bob and sam want to help this manвђќ chantry rode back with them and cut out a dozen steers вђњtake themвђќ he told the kiowas вђњbut wait until i returnвђќ and he rode on to the town there was little enough thereвђa dozen flimsy shacks two dozen sprawling tents saloons dance halls general stores a barber shop horse dealers stock buyers and two hotel tents as well as the private cars on sidings chantry swung down in front of the big tent with a general store sign and went inside he said вђњi want twenty blankets twenty new hunting knives and twenty packets of tobaccoвђќ вђњyou a traderвђќ вђњnoвђќ he replied вђњjust a man paying off a debtвђќ a voice spoke behind him вђњthere are other kinds of debts they all have to be paidвђќ it was sparrow вђњi have met your mr earnshaw a fine gentleman and a lovely daughterвђќ sparrow studied him thoughtfully вђњmr chantry i understand you and miss earnshaw are to be marriedвђќ вђњwe have discussed itвђќ вђњfine fine i am glad to hear it and then you will be going back eastвђќ chantry hesitated was he вђњi donвђt knowвђќ he said вђњtemporarily perhapsвђќ вђњif you stay here there will be problemsвђќ вђњwhy not there are problems everywhereвђќ вђњthese are different i understand you killed two men on the trailвђќ вђњit was necessary i did not wish to do itвђќ sparrow was quiet for a moment and then he said вђњhave you heard that the men who killed your father are here in this townвђќ вђњi heard itвђќ вђњyou intend to do nothing about itвђќ вђњthat was long ago mr sparrow i believe that circumstances will make them pay far better than i could if they leave me alone iвђll not disturb themвђќ вђњyou are right i thinkвђќ sparrow said вђњin saying that circumstances can make them pay for one reason or another all of them have sufferedвђќ вђњyou know themвђќ вђњyesвђќ chantry turned abruptly вђњi must ride back to the indians these are presents to pay them in some measure for what they have done these things will be useful to themвђќ вђњyou amaze me mr chantry only a few weeks in this country and the kiowas one of the bloodiest tribes on the plains come to your assistanceвђќ вђњit was because of my father long ago when i was only a boy we lived out here the kiowas were always welcome on our ranch and during bad times we fed them although i suspect we could little afford it we never had much you know and just when my father had built a herd that could make him wealthy he was wiped out by a northerвђќ sparrow was silent after a moment he said вђњyour father was a good man those men who killed him little knew what kind of man he was and they must not kill youвђќ chantry smiled вђњthey wonвђt iвђm quite good with a gun you knowвђќ sparrowвђs eyes were bleak вђњyes i was afraid of that you have your fatherвђs hands and his eyesвђќ he put a hand on chantryвђs sleeve it was a sudden uncharacteristic gesture and it startled chantry вђњplease donвђt carry it any further tom donвђt kill anyone else a man can go too far with itвђќ вђњthanksвђќ was tom chantryвђs only reply on a high rise with the sun growing lower in the sky he presented his gifts to the kiowas вђњyou have helped meвђќ he said вђњthat i cannot repay i give you these small things to show you that i value your friendship i hope nothing ever comes between your people and mineвђќ вђњwe goвђќ wolf walker said вђњg one day i shall come to see you again i shall come to your lodgeвђќ вђњyou will be welcome my fire is yoursвђќ he watched them ride away straight backs dark against the sunset he swung his horse and rode back to town back to the haunts of men the bargaining places and the risks that attend living among rough and violent men but he was at home now this was his country and now he must see doris he must tell her of his plans the lights were on in the town the great tents glowed with the lights inside and black shadows moved across their canvas walls music came from within and the click of poker chips and a roulette wheel men leaned against the lamp posts topped off with lanterns or thronged the muddy streets churned by hoofs and boots horsemen rode by other horses stood threelegged and sleepy at the hitching rails he led his horse to a place near where he had bunched his cattle and picketed it on good grass a man came out of the darkness and stood near him it was mobile callahan вђњi figured you were deadвђќ chantry said вђњno iвђve been about my businessвђќ вђњwhich isвђќ вђњkeepinвђ folks off your backвђќ ignoring the remark chantry asked вђњwhereвђs bone did he make itвђќ вђњyeah the cattle carried us west we figured weвђd better sit tight after roundinвђ up a few there was trouble brewinвђ here and we knew youвђd want earnshaw and his girl looked afterвђќ вђњyou were right what danger are they inвђќ вђњtheyвђre close to you that makes it enough thereвђs some folks donвђt give up easy and one of them is that shecat sarahвђќ вђњsheвђs hereвђќ вђњsheвђs here all right and the talrims are with her and they ainвђt all sheвђs teamed up with two other galoots seems they are the ones who killed your paвђќ вђњthere were threeвђќ вђњtwo now only one of themвђs got some boys as mean as he isвђќ he listened to the music heard a loud laugh and the jingle of spurs hard heels on a boardwalk the only stretch of walk in town in front of the general store the biggest hotel tent and a gambling place вђњwhere is earnshawвђќ he asked callahan nodded toward the siding вђњprivate car yonder he came west with a friend of his a railroad manвђќ chantry turned to go вђњwatch your stepвђќ callahan warned вђњthey know youвђre in town they know theyвђve got to kill youвђќ вђњwhereвђs frenchвђќ вђњnobody has seen him the word is that he pulled his men away from you figured youвђd never get the herd in without him and then he would have the herd if the kiowas didnвђt get it i heard that some of his boys didnвђt want to leave you but he took them anyhowвђќ вђњi hope thatвђs right i liked those boysвђќ chantry walked back to the street he stood for a moment against the side of one of the frame buildings looking up and down the street it was crowded any of those men might be the ones who sought him he stepped out from the shadows and made his way between the scattered tents toward the siding where the private cars waited lights showed from their windows he studied the layout with care but no one seemed to be about fifty yards or so away were a dozen empty boxcars and some flatcars and beyond them the stockpens and a loading chute after a moment he crossed the open space to the nearest of the private cars and grasping the handrail swung up the steps to the platform at the rear the door was of frosted glass and he rapped gently the door opened and a whitecoated negro showed him into a comfortable lounge of plushcovered furniture crystal chandeliers venetian mirrors looped and fringed draperies and antimacassars doris earnshaw was seated on a sofa a book in her hand at the sound of his voice she rose hurriedly and came to meet him for a moment she looked at him in astonishment вђњtom how youвђve changedвђќ he grinned вђњi need a bathвђќ he said вђњi just got in off the rangeвђќ вђњbut but youвђve changed youвђre bigger older browner everythingвђќ вђњpart of it will wash off out where iвђve been having a bath isnвђt a simple thingвђќ earnshaw came in вђњtom am i glad to see you how are the cattleвђќ вђњwe brought most of them in around two thousand head give or take a fewвђќ вђњwhat did you pay for themвђќ he explained as briefly as possible вђњthen the herd is oursвђќ earnshaw said вђњit all seems unbelievableвђќ вђњout hereвђќ chantry said вђњalmost everything isвђќ earnshaw listened as he told of the beef situation and the conditions in the area вђњi can get twentytwo dollars a head for your stock right now if they are in good shapeвђќ he said вђњwhat would you say to a quick sale right here then buy another herd to ship east to our own plantвђќ вђњfineвђќ he was thinking of the street out there and what remained for him to do вђњiвђd prefer that you two stay in the carвђќ he said when earnshaw had finished outlining his plans вђњlet me handle the outside business this is a pretty rough placeвђќ вђњi gathered as muchвђќ earnshaw said dryly he gave chantry a quick searching glance вђњwhat is this i hear about youвђќ вђњthings are very different out here sirвђќ he indicated the street вђњevery man out there carries a gun i expect youвђve heard some shootingвђќ he hesitated вђњthere are several men out there and at least one woman who want to kill meвђќ he could see they did not believe him вђњthatвђs sillyвђќ doris said вђњwhy wouldвђвђњ she broke off вђњtom youвђre serious you mean itвђќ вђњyes i doвђќ вђњa mr sparrow told me something of the sortвђќ earnshaw said вђњbut it all seemed rather melodramaticвђќ вђњmr sparrowвђќ chantry replied вђњis a businessman he is a cattleman and a rancher and from all i gather a very successful oneвђќ вђњhe is certainly interested in youвђќ earnshaw commented вђњhe assured me you were quite a remarkable young manвђќ вђњbut we knew that didnвђt we papaвђќ earnshaw studied him вђњyouвђve changed chantry i donвђt know what it is about youвђќ вђњiвђve survived thatвђs what it is i think periods of change are rather drastic out here as compared with what happens in the eastвђќ when earnshaw had retired to the sleeping compartments doris came closer вђњtom you mentioned a woman what is she likeвђќ he shrugged вђњi donвђt knowвђќ he said honestly вђњi actually met her only once and we werenвђt exactly introduced i donвђt even know her last name her first name is sarah she is here in town i hear and she seems to believe that my death would be advantageous my advice to you is to keep your door locked at all times donвђt let anyone in unless you know them wellвђќ he paused a moment вђњdoris your father mentioned a quick sale whom did he have in mindвђќ вђњcolonel enright his car is right behind ours he is here to buy beef and he will pay cash in goldвђќ chantry sat on the edge of the plush sofa his hat in his hand he was restless and uneasy was it the sudden change of surroundings was it only that he needed a bath a change of clothes or was it the knowledge that out there in the dark trouble awaited him trouble he could not avoid slowly almost thinking out loud he reviewed for doris all that had happened when he had finished she said вђњwhat will she do now you have the cattle here you are alive and possibly mr williams is alive too so what can she doвђќ вђњif you were she what would you doвђќ she answered quickly вђњiвђd go for the money when you sell the cattle iвђd steal the moneyвђќ he considered that until now sarah had been working to inherit the cattle and sell the herd herself and she had balked at nothing nothing at all yes he agreed reluctantly she would steal the money she would do just what doris had suggested he knew what the trouble was for he had a touch of it himself there was a feeling here that this was somehow out of the world that what one did in the west belonged only to the west and when one left it could be left behind of course that was not true but hadnвђt it been true for some people so many of them had that idea they came to get rich and get out chapter when he left the private car tom chantry moved quickly to the shadow of a pile of lumber there crouching in the darkness he waited and watched he had been in the west only a short time but it was true that circumstances had changed him he had grown more watchful less trusting of people or appearances he had enemies of whom he knew little except that they seemed prepared to stop at nothing he had some friends but he could not feel entirely sure who were friends and who were enemies he would do well to play out his hand as if he were alone and without help undoubtedly earnshaw wanted to make a quick deal a quick profit that would put him on his feet once more then there could be the purchase and shipment of a second herd that would launch him into business again that made sense and this was the place to do it but sarah was in town and she had with her the talrims who killed without qualm or hesitation apparently she had also established a working arrangement with the killers of his father these were his enemies persons to whom his death seemed a necessity the area covered by the town even with the scattered piles of building materials corrals and freight cars was small and his enemies would be moving in and around that area there was small chance of avoiding them he must locate their headquarters for there had to be a focal point he thought of mobile callahan who had helped him paid to do so by sparrow why for the time being he would dismiss that while keeping it in the back of his mind no matter what the motive this did not present any immediate danger bone mccarthy was he believed still working for him of sun chief there had been no sign and it seemed likely that he had been killed in the stampede and where was french williams knowing the man chantry was sure he would not give up without a fight crouching and waiting to see if he had been followed or if anyone was watching the car he considered his situation sparrowвђs warning had been a good one he must avoid further shooting if possible what he had to do was simple enough he must bring the sale of the cattle to colonel enright to a conclusion get the money into earnshawвђs hands effect the purchase and shipment of a second bunch of cattle and then get out though a move now against the herd was possible it was unlikely dorisвђ conclusion he felt sure was the right one sarah would be apt to make an attempt to get the purchase price into her hands so the car must be guarded against any such attempt he must get enright and earnshaw together at once and effect the sale and the transfer of money and then he had to find a herd of cattle available for purchase within a reasonable distance of the railroad all this he had to do while avoiding trouble with any of his enemies he was going to need eyes in the back of his head sarah would wait until she found out the payment had been made for the cattle and she would keep the talrims in check until then at least that was the way he saw it with him out of the way the whole affair might be moved along quickly he straightened up and went around a tent and between two piles of lumber to the street he stopped there scanning the street carefully it was likely that this town was only temporary this was for a brief time the end of the tracks and when they built them on west the town itself would move too everything here was set up to be torn down the camp of the construction workers was a mile further west even now but the whiskey the women and the gambling were still here the street was scarcely two hundred yards long with frequent gaps there were occasional piles of lumber stacks of goods covered with tarpaulins wagons drawn up back end to the street at least fifty men were walking or standing along the street most of them only dark figures and any one of them might be an enemy the tents and shacks were jammed to the doors with men chantry waited a moment then crossed the street and made his way back to the herd bone mccarthy was squatting by the fire вђњgettinвђ worried about you boss i nigh come ahuntinвђ youвђќ вђњwhoвђs out thereвђќ вђњfour cowhands from town all of вђem busted and glad for the work good men too i punched cows with two of вђem down on the brazos one timeвђќ вђњbone i want you to guard that private car where earnshaw and his daughter areвђќ he explained the situation and added вђњthereвђs just the two of them and a man named whitman heвђs out here for the railroad and the private car is his i donвђt expect any trouble until the gold is transferred from enright to earnshaw i understand that enright has a couple of tough railroad detectives guarding his car on the insideвђќ вђњhave you seen frenchвђќ вђњnoвђќ bone filled his cup вђњworries me that does it ainвђt like him to give upвђќ with the cattle guarded and bone mccarthy taking over the job of watching over earnshaw and doris chantry had made his first move in the events that were shaping up he left mccarthy and went to the general store where he bought a new outfit with several extra shirts and pairs of pants he selected a new pistol oiled it well and tried the balance he loaded his belt with cartridges filling all the empty loops and then carrying his purchases he went to the barber shop where he got a shave and a haircut he went back to the private car and asked for the use of the bath he scrubbed and soaked and came out wearing fresh clothes and feeling clean for the first time in days when he glanced outside the car window there was no one in sight a minute later colonel enright appeared with earnshaw вђњiвђve been looking at your cattle young man theyвђre in good shape iвђd buy another herd of the same size at the same priceвђќ вђњweвђll see what we can doвђќ chantry said then they discussed the price and it was finally settled at twentytwo dollars per headвђmore than he had expected much more than sarah had hoped for in round numbers it came to fortyfive thousand dollars in gold вђњyouвђll have to come and get itвђќ enright said and added вђњonce that gold is out of my hands it is your responsibilityвђand if i were you iвђd have myself ready for troubleвђќ вђњweвђll be all rightвђќ earnshaw said вђњi donвђt expect any troubleвђќ chantry walked out on the brassrailed observation platform bone mccarthy was loitering nearby and he strolled over вђњyou stay where you are boneвђќ chantry said вђњkeep an eye on things and donвђt let anybody get behind youвђќ вђњall rightвђќ chantry went back inside вђњdoris keep the door of the car locked while weвђre gone but be prepared to open it quickly to get your father insideвђќ вђњdo you think they will try to steal the goldвђќ вђњyou figured it out last nightвђremember i think you were rightвђќ they talked quietly and of many things but always his ears were alert for other sounds earnshaw came from the inner room and stood waiting chantry looked up вђњnowвђќ вђњyesвђќ вђњit might be safer to wait until daylightвђќ вђњthey wouldnвђt attempt a robbery right here in the middle of everything i think weвђre safe enough tom letвђs goвђќ reluctantly chantry got to his feet he opened the door вђњexcuse meвђќ he said and stepped out first all was quiet on the street perhaps sixty yards away there were the usual sounds occasionally a wild cowboy yell would leap from the jumble of sound and hang in air for an instant a dozen yards away was a pile of lumber and beyond it much further off were several boxcars and tents tom went down the steps facing forward and stepped off there was no sign of bone mccarthy but he had expected none earnshaw came down the steps after him and together they walked back beside the track to enrightвђs car inside it was just as ornate as the other two toughlooking eastern men loafed in the drawing room with a pair of shotguns across the table before them they had been playing checkers at a call from one of them enright came from the sleeping room bringing a sack of gold he returned for another then made more trips until there were eight sacks in all вђњthatвђs a fair loadвђќ he said вђњyouвђll have to make more than one tripвђќ chantry liked none of it one trip loaded down with gold was bad enough but several with each step the odds piled up against them and no matter what they carried each man must keep one hand free to use a gun he glanced at the two guards вђњyou two want to help weвђll pay youвђќ one man shook his head вђњmister iвђve got a family back in st louis i wouldnвђt stick my head out of that door with a sack of gold for anything on earthвђќ вђњnor meвђќ said the other вђњguarding inside of this car is one thing the colonel here heвђs got steel plates in the sides of this car heвђs ready for anything that happens from in here we could stand off an army but outside there in the dark mister maybe iвђm not very bright but iвђm not crazy eitherвђќ вђњbesidesвђќ he added вђњweвђve heard all the talk iвђd like to help you but i just canвђt see my way clear to committing suicideвђќ earnshaw stared at them then he looked at tom for the first time he appeared to realize the gravity of the situation вђњis it that badвђќ he asked вђњmr earnshawвђќ chantry said вђњout there tonight in that cluster of shacks and tents are perhaps a hundred men who have committed every crime in the books they come here to prey on the trackworkers but theyвђll grab anything thatвђs loose aside from them there are at least two groups who feel they should have this money one of them has already killed men in the process of trying to steal the cattle they are not in town just to have a little recreationвђќ вђњitвђs only a few yardsвђќ earnshaw said вђњweвђll move it nowвђќ chantry bent over and looked out of the car windows all was dark and silent there was a faint glow of light from the windows of the car they were in and he could see light from the other private car further along the track there might be any number of men hidden out there and they could remain invisible until they opened fire вђњweвђll cover you from the doorвђќ one of the guards volunteered вђњbut that will help for only a few yardsвђќ chantry picked up two of the sacks and slung them over his left shoulder in his right hand he carried his gun earnshaw took two sacks and they stepped out of the door chantry went down the carвђs steps and dropped off to the dirt this was he felt the crucial moment nothing happened he moved out gun ready and waited until earnshaw reached the ground with earnshaw close behind him he started for the other car three hours earlier and a few hundred yards from town on the bank of the arkansas three big men got down from their horses tied them to brush and descended a steep path to the door of a dugout in the riverвђs bank the door of the dugout was above the waterlevel and some distance back from the riverвђs edge but the dugout had been the work of some optimist who was ignorant of western rivers the arkansas in flood was far from being the placid stream that now flowed along not far from the door in flood it was another story at the first high water the dugout would be flooded washed out and away at the moment four people sat inside awaiting the arrival of the three big men a table two benches and four bunks were in the small room hank talrim was sprawled on one of the bunks chewing on a straw bud was at the end of the table watching sarah who was playing solitaire the fourth person was a tall slim man playing an oddly twisted look to his face he was sallow and unshaven and his mustache was stained with tobacco there was an expression about him of ingrown bitterness and distaste the door opened and all of them looked up the man who entered first was huge with broad shoulders and big hands his once red hair was freely sprinkled with gray вђњhowdyвђќ he glanced once at sarah then at the sallowfaced man вђњhello harvey you seen sparrowвђќ вђњsparrow is he hereвђќ вђњuhhuh what you reckon that meansвђќ harvey shrugged ruff always irritated him it was the manвђs size they had worked together a dozen times over the years but harvey never failed to be angered by ruffвђs very presence and now to make things worse there were the two boys as well huge men too вђњmaybe heвђs here same as us if chantryвђs boy is huntinвђ us he surely ainвђt goinвђ to have to look farвђќ вђњstay away from himвђќ sarah said curtly вђњheвђll get his when we get the gold leave it at that and stay out of sightвђќ вђњi still say the best time is when they are transferring the gold from one car to the otherвђќ harvey said вђњand thatвђs why youвђve got nothingвђќ replied sarah sharply вђњthey will be keyed up ready for trouble chantry will have some men around some we donвђt expect to be there let them move the gold weвђll take it when theyвђre off guard and think they can relaxвђќ вђњwhat dвђyou thinkвђќ frank ruff looked at bud talrim вђњi like her thinkinвђ what she says goesвђќ ruff sat down and the two boys mort and charlie squatted on their heels вђњi donвђt like it sparrow beinвђ here heвђs always been sore over that shootinвђвђќ вђњforget him harvey said вђњhe never amounted to nothinвђвђќ вђњhave you seen him latelyвђќ charlie ruff spoke mildly вђњheвђs mighty hightoned now got him a big ranch down texas way and another in new mexico he runs fifteen twenty thousand head of cattleвђќ вђњi donвђt believe itвђќ harvey said вђњbelieve whatever youвђre of a mind toвђќ charlie said вђњthatвђs a fact what i saidвђќ вђњsome of those cattle williams and chantry were drivinвђ were hisвђќ mort ruff commented вђњsparrowвђs in this somehowвђќ вђњmaybe if we waitвђќ frank ruff said вђњheвђll do our killinвђ for usвђќ for a few moments there was only the sound of the shuffling of the cards then sarah spoke вђњthose cattleвђќ she said вђњwill bring nearly fifty thousand dollarsвђќ вђњi never seen that much moneyвђќ hank talrim said вђњsomehow it donвђt make no pictureвђќ bud gave him a disgusted glance вђњyou can make a picture out of a dollar canвђt you well anything you can buy with a dollar you can buy fifty thousand times as muchвђќ вђњwhooeeвђќ hank exclaimed вђњi donвђt know what iвђd do with it allвђќ sarahвђs face was still only her eyes seemed to move and they missed nothing secretly she felt only contempt for these men but they were useful to her and she did not underrate them the talrims seemed willing to do what she said but they would turn on her and kill her as quickly as a cat the others she was sure would not kill a woman as she played she studied them considering which one she would need the most once the money was in their possession she must get rid of the talrims harvey was as treacherous as the talrims and frank ruff was too suspicious charlie was the smartest of the lot the bestnatured the only one around whom she felt safe but at the same time she believed he would be less easy to fool mort was the one somehow she would have to work on mort she had caught him stealing glances at her and somehow she must trigger trouble between harvey and the talrims after they had the gold once paul was gone she had moved at once to use the talrims she had crossed their trail a few times knew where they were likely to be and she had approached them demanding their help she was still not sure why they had gone along nor did she dare approach either one separately each one seemed aware of what the other was thinking and she was intelligent enough to perceive that there was no separating them they had told her about rugger he was a cow thief and worse so she had waited for him one night on night guard around the herd she kept out of sight until he appeared led him off to one side and suggested stealing the herd the others had come in as a matter of course when the theft failed she saw at once that the death of french williams was no longer important they were too close to the railhead and the thing to do was get the money after the herd had been sold she intended to have that money and to go to england or france with it and live her years out in style she was sure that at least one and probably two of the men helping her would be killed and a fight between harvey and the talrims would not be difficult to start eliminating one or two she had no clear plan but she had a driving desire and the ability to move quickly when the moment came she was ready chapter tom chantry sat on the car steps staring into the night the goldвђall of itвђhad been carried from one car to the other without trouble earnshaw was pleased and mildly triumphant вђњsee i knew nothing would happen weвђre perfectly safeвђќ chantry glanced at him then looked away doris had been silent but presently she said вђњwell i was wrong too i was sure that girl would get them to try to steal the gold when it was being movedвђќ вђњmaybe theyвђre not so bad as we thinkвђќ earnshaw said mildly вђњtom iвђm afraid you frightened us all needlesslyвђќ вђњi donвђt think soвђќ chantry said stubbornly вђњtheyвђve just made other plansвђќ after that he had gone outside and sat down doris was going to bed earnshaw was shaving suddenly bone mccarthy came out of the darkness and a moment later mobile callahan вђњwhat happenedвђќ bone wondered вђњtheyвђre not around townвђќ callahan said вђњiвђve been keeping my eyes and ears open none of themвђs around and none of themвђs been seen by morning if theyвђre still here iвђll know where they are iвђve got the kids looking for themвђќ вђњkids hereвђќ вђњsure thereвђs a couple dozen of them in camp i got some of them together and promised iвђd buy them some rock candy if they locate that crowd and if theyвђre here those kids will find themвђќ they talked for a while discussing possibilities neither mccarthy nor callahan believed that sarah and the talrims would give up finally tom went inside and went to sleep on the sofa in the carвђs drawing room with the door locked and a chair under the knob his pistol beside him for three days events moved without a hitch colonel enright had the herd loaded and shipped mccarthy and chantry riding wide over the country located a small herd bound east for dodge and arranged for purchase at the railhead on the fourth day they found another herd after learning it was being held on a range north of the river for fattening mobile remained in town he gambled a little talked a little listened a lot twice he glimpsed harvey on the street and sarah moved into the frame hotel and began making herself known around the area she was polite reserved wellbehaved to mobile who had learned much during his lifetime it was obvious what she was doing she was establishing a reputation for being a lady a wellbehaved lady interested in finding a brother who had disappeared somewhere in colorado under the circumstances she was free to talk to anyone in search of information and if she was seen in conversation with the talrims she could simply explain that she had heard they had information about her brother tom chantry was puzzled over dinner in the private car with earnshaw whitman and doris he confessed вђњiвђm worried i know they havenвђt given upвђќ вђњtom youвђre obsessed with this woman whatever her name is and with those men if they had intended to do anything they would have done it when we moved the gold we were vulnerable thenвђќ вђњyes i know and the fact that weвђre in a settlement wouldnвђt stop the talrims i am sure they have some other planвђќ вђњiвђve seen the young lady about townвђќ whitman said вђњand certainly iвђd never suspect her of wrongdoing from what i hear she is searching for news of her brotherвђќ вђњher brother was killed by the kiowas she knows that and knows when it happenedвђќ вђњdoes that seem likely what would she be doing here then a young woman like her would have no reason to spend her time in a place like thisвђќ вђњunless she planned on picking up a good bit of goldвђќ whitman shook his head doubtfully and changed the subject tom could see that even doris was becoming somewhat impatient with him and he said no more but he did a lot of thinking when they bought the two herds amounting to fifteen hundred head the amount of gold they had aboard the train would be seriously depleted did sarah know of their plans he wondered mobile callahan strolled up to him as he stood on the street вђњmr chantryвђќ he said вђњthe kids got вђem spottedвђќ вђњwhereвђќ вђњin a dugout down on the river the whole crowd is there and give вђem a few more days and theyвђll probably be mean enough to kill off each otherвђќ вђњno sign of frenchвђќ вђњnot a signвђќ вђњi havenвђt seen mr sparrowвђќ mobile callahan made no reply for a moment and then he said вђњheвђs aroundвђќ he added вђњi donвђt quite see what heвђs up to my job was to keep trouble off your back why whatвђs his interest in youвђќ вђњi donвђt knowвђќ suddenly tom was not thinking of sparrow вђњmobile iвђm going to see sarahвђќ вђњyouвђre whatвђќ mobile stared at him and without waiting for a reply he said вђњtake a tip from me and stay away from her that womanвђs troubleвђќ вђњneverthelessвђthere she is nowвђќ she was looking every inch the lady her skirts gathered daintily in one hand as she crossed the street men stepped aside for her and tipped their hats вђњtomвђќвђit was the first time mobile had ever used his first nameвђвђњthese folks would hang you to the highest tree if you so much as said a word against her and donвђt think she hasnвђt planned it that wayвђќ they could hear her heels on the boardwalk and then she stopped behind them вђњmr chantry it is mr chantry isnвђt itвђќ вђњit isвђќ вђњi understand you sold your cattle you and mr williamsвђќ вђњi sold them french williams no longer has any share in them miss вђќ вђњmillier are you going back east nowвђќ вђњnoвђќ suddenly he realized there could be only one reason why she would want to stop and speak to him she wanted information coolly he gave it to her вђњweвђre buying more cattle prices have gone down somewhat so weвђre going to reinvestвђќ for just an instant he saw the stunned apprehension in her eyes an expression quickly gone вђњdo you think that is wise you seem to have done very well with the first cattle you bought but why buy cattle when the price is downвђќ вђњthatвђs the time to buy back east the market is good the problem is getting cars right here buying cattle means holding them for some time however we are in a position to get the necessary carsвђќ he shifted ground quickly вђњi understand you are looking for your lost brother he was killed by the kiowas as you knowвђќ several people were within listening distance and at least one man turned sharply around to hear better вђњi know nothing of the kindвђќ she replied and walked away mobile looked after her and said softly вђњwhat are you trying to do chantry start somethingвђќ what was he trying to do but he knew he wanted to force them to move he wanted it over with ended once and for all he was tired of watching tired of waiting now they knew the gold they wanted would soon be gone spent on cattle if anything would bring matters to a head this was it вђњiвђd like to be listening in when she gets that word to themвђќ he told callahan grimly he walked back to the private car enright had pulled out on the morning train and the track was clear thoughtfully he considered the possibilities the cattle were being brought down for delivery whitman owner of the car and earnshawвђs very good friend on the railroad had arranged for cars once delivery was made gold would be paid to the cattlemen who brought in the herds and earnshaw and doris would be free to return east and so would he he glanced at his reflection in one of the panel mirrors in the car he saw there a tall bronzed young man with wide shoulders narrow hips and a quietly commanding way about him above all there was no softness the hard riding on the plains had taken off the extra flesh hardened what remained and toughened his nature he was a different man now why go back east there was money to be made in the cattle business there was land to be had and several times lately he had heard men speaking of western colorado they had built a railroad out there too in that land of mountains and meadows of running streams and forests doris was standing behind him вђњtom what are you thinking ofвђќ he turned around вђњdoris how would you like to live out here further west in the mountainsвђќ вђњis that what you wantвђќ вђњi donвђt know i think it is this country has changed me maybe it has only brought me back to myself back to what i should be yes i do know i want to stayвђќ вђњall rightвђќ she said вђњweвђll stayвђќ she hesitated a moment вђњcan i bring my things out from the eastвђќ вђњwhatever you likeвђќ suddenly he heard steps on the platform behind him and he turned swiftly looking toward the frosted glass door there was a light tap вђњwho is itвђќ вђњcallahan can you open upвђќ gun in hand he opened the door mobile was alone вђњall rightвђќ he said вђњyou did it all hellвђs breakinвђ loose harvey was on the street tonight with mort ruff sarah millier has been talking about buying cattle maybe starting a brand of her own i donвђt know what that means but you can be sure sheвђs got some bee in her bonnetвђќ вђњany sign of the talrimsвђќ вђњno but iвђd swear i caught a glimpse of french williams it was near the store and i walked down that way but there was nobody aroundвђќ whitman and earnshaw had come from the dining room chantry turned to the railroad man вђњany chance of getting a locomotive we may want to move this car and fastвђќ вђњthe cars are on the siding a mile east of townвђќ whitman said вђњas i understand it the cattle are to be there for loading by daylightвђќ he paused вђњi can have an engine ready to move your car at any hour you wishвђќ вђњat four oвђclock in the morning then move this car to the loading area maybe we can put through the whole deal before they realize what is happeningвђќ earnshaw smiled вђњtom you worry too much there wonвђt be any trouble porter and wills will be there with their cattle weвђll load them pay them and start east doris tells me you two want to be married well you can come east and be married there even if you want to return here just donвђt worry i think youвђre being overconcernedвђќ вђњyou may be right anyway humor me enough to say nothing about the moveвђќ outside he talked briefly to mccarthy and callahan and then headed for the street would he know his fatherвђs killers it had been so long ago and he had only a glimpse of them then but the big man he would surely know for there werenвђt many like him he walked down to the store looking carefully around this was where mobile callahan thought he had seen french what would williamsвђ role be in this would he try to get the gold for himself he was a strange sort of man who did many things on impulse he was ruled by whim by impulsive likes and dislikes that seemed to follow no rule the street was crowded as usual chantry went into one of the huge gambling tents for the first time it was filled with pushing bearded sweating humanity his eyes roamed the room not a familiar face in sight suddenly across the room there was one familiar yet unfamiliar a huge redhaired young man loomed head and shoulders above the crowd it was not the man who had helped to kill his father he was too young from the description this had to be charlie ruff their eyes met for an instant the smile left ruffвђs eyes and he stared hardeyed at tom chantry then the smile appeared again and the big man came shouldering through the crowd ignoring those he brushed against angry looks changed quickly when they saw the size of the man who had shoved them out of the way he stopped widelegged in front of chantry вђњhowdy youвђll be chantry iвђve heard a lot about youвђќ several heads had turned watching вђњyouвђve come a long way for what youвђre going to getвђќ charlie said grinning вђњyou better tuck your tail anвђ run while you got a chanceвђќ вђњand what am i going to get as you phrase itвђќ a big young man secure in his huge size and strength charlie ruff had walked through life with little trouble there was no fear in him and there never had been men stepped aside for him or backed away he liked it that way and he was used to it but he guarded his words now вђњyouвђre going to get what youвђve got cominвђвђќ he said вђњand iвђm goinвђ to give it to youвђќ вђњthen why not nowвђќ chantry asked charlieвђs grin stiffened a little he had never been challenged before never called to back up a threat the games had come to a halt people were backing away tom chantry unbuckled his belt and handed it to a croupier вђњwhy not now charlieвђќ he said again charlie ruff was in a quandary when he had started for town the last thing his father said was for him to stay out of trouble вђњwatch a little play a little see if any of that crowd are around town but stay out of troubleвђќ it was too late to think of that now he had wanted to throw a scare into this man he had wanted to push a little just to see the man back off as others had done вђњsureвђќ he said вђњwhy not nowвђќ and he swung charlie ruff had thrown his huge fist with intent to demolish not a man in the room with the exception of the croupier who had seen many men and had learned how to judge them and a couple of oldtimers expected anything but a quick brutal beating but what happened then charlie ruff was unprepared for tom chantry slipped inside of the ponderous right and smashed a right to the ribs it was a beautifully timed punch and it landed solidly instantly he rolled and hooked a left to the same spot then came back just enough and brought up a short wicked uppercut to the chin charlie ruff went down his breath knocked from him his nose streaming blood he hit the dirt floor of the tent with a thud that shocked him through and through never before had he been hurt never had he been knocked down he stared then with a grunt he came off the ground and ran into two hard fists the first split the skin under his eye the second pulped his lips but he was big and tough and he kept coming he reached out his huge arms and chantry stepped back to get distance but the crowd shoved him back the huge arms caught him and enveloped him in a bear hug charlie ruff was a powerful man and now he was wild with anger he wanted to kill this man to break him in two with all his power he began to squeeze for one brief agonizing moment chantry thought he was gone he felt a hard fist crushed against his spine felt himself bent backward charlie ruff was at least fifty pounds heavier and much stronger there was one thing to do and he did it he kicked up both feet and fell backward the sudden yielding fooled charlie ruff and he fell forward stumbling in trying to catch his balance losing his grip on chantry as he did so chantry was up and around in an instant charlie got his balance and turned and caught a sweeping right to the jaw that knocked him against a tent pole the whole tent trembled and then the big man turned and came in trying for his hold again chantry stabbed a left to the mouth and as ruff lunged he sidestepped away from him for a moment they faced each other for the first time charlie ruff knew fear he blinked through the sweat and blood at chantry standing there ready lean hard and dangerous waiting for him charlie ruff had strutted and pushed and shoved all his life smaller men had stepped away from him appalled not only by the sheer size of him but by the knowledge that where he was his father and brother were not far behind but now they were not here and he was alone the crowd was packed tightly around him there was no place to run he had felt those ironhard fists and he did not want to feel them again the only way out was to kill chantry he was bigger he told himself and chantry had been lucky so far slowly he began to circle and chantry turned coolly to face him as he moved suddenly he charged head down arms flailing a sweeping right smashed chantry on the shoulder staggering him and numbing his arm the big man lunged into him grabbing and pounding charlie knew nothing of fighting but he had size and power his fists thudded and banged chantry staggered shuddering under the power of charlieвђs blows and charlie tried to smother him with sheer weight and size chantry went down narrowly avoided a ponderous kick then lunged up and caught charlie with an overhand right he slipped inside of a swing and smashed with both hands at the big body pulling charlie ruff back chantry leaned into him and battered his body with short wicked blows to the wind suddenly stepping back he whipped up an uppercut that caught the bigger man under the chin his head flew back and his knees buckled charlie hit the floor on his knees but in the instant before he hit chantry swung a hard right to the jaw charlie fell forward on his face for a moment chantry stood looking down and then he stepped back the croupier held out his guns вђњyouвђll be needing thoseвђќ and he added вђњi know that outfit watch yourselfвђќ вђњthanksвђќ bloody his shirt torn tom chantry pushed toward the exit he had wanted none of this he had not liked charlie ruff but he had not wanted to fight him now it was done and he had won outside the cool wind chilled his sweaty body he started up the street wanting to get under cover to bathe and get into a clean fresh shirt chapter he went to the frame hotel the lobby was empty except for the clerk an older man with a round moonlike face вђњhello mr chantry looks as if youвђve had trouble want a place to wash upвђќ вђњyes and a shirt if you can rustle one upвђќ вђњiвђll try come alongвђќ he led the way down a passage and into the back room on the ground floor вђњthereвђs a well out back iвђll get you a bucket of water youвђll want some hot water for those handsвђќ when he returned with the bucket and began kindling a fire in the stove he asked вђњwhat happenedвђќ вђњi had a fight with charlie ruffвђќ the clerk whistled вђњruff you must have whipped him youвђre not badly beat upвђќ вђњi did what i had to doвђќ вђњa lot of people will be pleasedвђnot only here but down in texas tooвђќ the clerk sat down вђњmy nameвђs finlayson we havenвђt met but iвђve seen you around and youвђre a friend of mr sparrowвђs is there anything else i can do for youвђќ chantry was about to say there was not but changed it вђњone thing what do you know about sarah millierвђќ вђњenough not to be so gullible as most of the local citizens she had visitors mr chantry mostly they used the back stairs but i saw them once or twiceвђthe talrims or frank ruff she saw me noticing them once and commented that they had some information on her brotherвђќ chantry explained about the brother and gave some background on sarah and paul вђњthereвђs some connection with french williams but i donвђt believe itвђs friendlyвђќ вђњi always liked frenchвђќ finlayson commented вђњwell i donвђt know what to think about her but iвђm glad sheвђs goneвђќ вђњgoneвђќ chanty straightened up water dripping from his hair and hands вђњchecked out about an hour after sundown there was a rig waiting out front i didnвђt see who was drivingвђќ tom dried his face and hands working gently over his bruised and battered knuckles he worked his fingers to keep stiffness from settling in the muscles he was terribly tired but there was no time to rest after thanking the clerk who refused payment he went out and made his way to the corral his horse was there and he roped it and saddled up he swung into the saddle and turned his horse toward the siding where the private car was waiting only it was gone he rode to the main track and looked around but there was no car it had pulled out he swung his mount and raced across town weaving in and out among the buildings the tents and stacks of lumber to the other sidings a small shack was over there where relief engineers and other trainmen bunked dropping from his saddle he went in the door a man turned sleepily in a bunk вђњwhoвђs thatвђќ he muttered chantry struck a match and lighted the lamp вђњwhitmanвђs private car is gone where is itвђќ the man swung his feet to the floor he was wearing red woollen longjohns now faded to a vague pink вђњwhitmanвђs car iвђm supposed to take that out moreвђself itвђs gone you say that canвђt beвђќ вђњwhereвђs your engineвђќ вђњon the siding right back yonderвђќ both men rushed to the door there was no engine the siding was empty вђњstole somebody stole the engineвђќ he turned back into the room and yelled at the other trainmen now half awake вђњthe engineвђs gone somebody stole itвђќ вђњitвђs harveyвђќ a tall skinny man started up вђњi seen that outlaw harvey arounвђ he used to be a trainman back missouri wayвђќ tom chantry went to his horse they had doris they had whitman and earnshaw too and the gold and they had a start of an hour or longer but one thing about a locomotive it had to keep to the tracks somewhere not very far off they would have horses waiting he started along the tracks at a canter where were mccarthy and callahan a mile out of town the loading pens showed their skeleton frames against the sky but there was no train he pushed on riding beside the tracks watching the skyline ahead he had no idea what lay before him that they would be stopping soon he was sure the outlaws would not dare risk going into the next station he rode on into the night his eyes probing at the darkness ahead suddenly the shapes loomed up the locomotive stood silent except for a faint hiss of steam the private car was lighted but no sound came from it slowing his pace gun in hand he circled the car at a distance the hoofs of his horse made little noise as they moved through the grass he rode closer then dismounted and groundhitched his horse close to the car he stopped to listen no sound he stepped up on the road bed caught the rail and swung up to the platform his left hand closed on the knob turned it the door opened easily and swung inward the drawing room was empty the door to the bedroom stood open he went past it empty there were signs here of hasty dressing clothing was thrown about the safe stood open papers were scattered on the floor they had the money and they had whitman earnshaw and doris he found a red lantern lighted it and hung it out on the east end of the locomotive there were no trains west of this the next to come would be from the east he searched the car found two boxes of cartridges which he took as well as an extra pistol hidden under the pillow of whitmanвђs bed he thrust that into his waistband he gathered some food found a canteen and filled it he found a good deal of hunting gear in a closet under whitmanвђs bed but nothing he could use outside he stuffed the food into the saddlebags hung the canteen around the pommel and then scouted for tracks using a lantern he found a place where horses had stood several of them and there was a faint trail leading off to the south for a moment after he was in the saddle he sat thinking they must have taken the three prisoners so there would be nobody to tell who had taken the gold or where they had gone it was unlikely they would keep them for long sarah would be for killing them she had intended to kill him back there under the trees in the rain even though her brother had not wanted it she would want no witnesses and the talrims would agree the ruffs no telling about them they might agree and they might just ride off and leave it to sarah and the talrims just then he heard the pound of hoofs and turning saw a rider approaching along his own trail the man pulled up when he saw him вђњchantryвђќ it was sparrow вђњhereвђќ chantry held his gun waiting there were a lot of things about sparrow that were unexplained вђњare they goneвђќ вђњyes and the money tooвђќ вђњtheyвђll ride southвђќ sparrow said вђњiвђm sure of it theyвђll head for coeвђs old hideoutвђќ вђњdo you know where it isвђќ вђњno only approximately nobody but outlaws knew where it was but we can lookвђќ вђњmaybeвђќ said another voice вђњyouвђd let me helpвђќ they turned sharply and faced a horseman who had come up quietly through the drift sand on the side of the track it was french williams вђњhowdy tomвђќ he said and tom could almost see the taunting appraising look in his eyes вђњi see you got the herd throughвђќ вђњno thanks to youвђќ chantry replied shortly вђњi wasnвђt supposed to help remember i will say that some of the boys set up a fuss when i pulled them off the herd you make friends dвђyou know that helvie gentry and them they swear by youвђќ вђњweвђve got a job to doвђќ chantry said вђњcome along if you likeвђќ вђњiвђd better no use lettinвђ you boys handle all that money nor the trouble eitherвђќ williams turned his horse to ride along вђњsurprised to see you here sparrow iвђd heard you were a man who avoided troubleвђќ вђњthat has been my policyвђќ вђњuhhuh i recall a changed policy now is that itвђќ williams chuckled вђњyouвђre the unlucky one chantry youвђre ridinвђ alone so to speak sparrow and me we know where you stand but you got no idea where weвђre placed in this setup we can count on you you donвђt know whether you can count on us or notвђќ вђњiвђll fight my own battles you stay out of itвђќ вђњfireeater arenвђt youвђќ williams said вђњyou sound a whole lot different from the fellow who backed off from dutch akin a while back you got any idea what youвђre ridinвђ intoвђќ williams whether for his benefit or sparrowвђs had dropped into the casual easy talk of many western men he could speak well enough when he wanted to вђњi know the talrims harvey and the ruffs six men and a woman whoвђs worse than all of themвђќ вђњyou got any idea what kind of men they are the talrims you know them a couple of dirtymean rattlesnakes but frank ruff now thereвђs something else frank ruff could file twentyseven notches on his guns if he was tinhorn enough to do it вђњyou hear of men whoвђve killed a few but when you get to pinninвђ it down to names and places you lose most of them not so with frank ruff him you can list for twentyseven and you can find the names dates and places to match them and everвђ one of them standinвђ up and facinвђ him one way or another mort heвђs tallied about six near as a body can figure and charlie about four maybe fiveвђќ вђњfiveвђќ sparrow said вђњso look at it any way you like youвђre takinвђ on something more than a handful of pilgrimsвђќ вђњyou donвђt have to comeвђќ вђњwouldnвђt miss it i got to see the boy who wouldnвђt draw against a drunken man face up to a pat hand like that with sarah for a joker in the deckвђќ they rode on then in silence the sand dunes loomed and chantry swung his horse riding up into them around a dune and then he saw the buildings two of them some scattered weathered boards a fallenin roof many tracks but none that could be defined because of the loose sand chantry swung down and looked into the buildings nothing why had they stopped here then вђњchantryвђќ it was williams вђњlook hereвђќ he emerged from the building and went toward williams who was around the corner standing on the edge of a small pit in the bottom lay two bodies jumping down he bent over and saw that both the men there were bound and gagged but very much alive he untied the gags вђњtheyвђve got dorisвђќ earnshaw said вђњif anybody follows theyвђll kill herвђќ вђњthey will anywayвђќ williams said shortly вђњor leave her to the talrims which would be worseвђќ hastily they cut the men loose earnshaw stood up вђњgo get them tom for godвђs sake find them in time they left us here said the sand would bury us in a few hours talrim said there was a storm coming upвђќ вђњthe stars are going maybe he was rightвђќ sparrow said вђњhead back for the train itвђs only a little wayвђќ south again the air grew cooler clouds covered the sky вђњhow far to robberвђs roostвђќ chantry asked вђњtoo far theyвђll see this coming and head for shelter itвђs going to be a gullywasherвђќ tom chantry was silent in the last few moments an eerie feeling had been creeping over him he knew where they were going knew exactly вђњdo you believe in fateвђќ he asked williams вђњi believe in a gun and a horseвђќ french said вђњand not much moreвђќ sparrow edged his horse over вђњwhy what about itвђќ вђњtwo of the men who killed my father are in that bunchвђќ he said вђњand do you know where theyвђre going for shelter theyвђre going to my old homeвђ to borden chantryвђs ranchвђќ sparrow pulled up and came back his voice was odd вђњyou mean the place up ahead belonged to your father it was his landвђќ вђњyes and he built the houseвђќ they started on he was coming right back to where he had barely escaped from the outlaws only now he was not driving cattle or riding with anything on his mind but the men ahead and doris вђњhow far behind them are weвђќ sparrow wondered вђњweвђve gainedвђthey stopped to leave earnshaw and whitman they probably lost thirty minutes and i donвђt think they are expecting pursuit not yet i meanвђќ a few spattering drops of rain fell they drew up got into their slickers and rode on again occasionally there was a flash of lightning вђњtheyвђre walking their horsesвђќ french said вђњweвђll be gaining on themвђќ an hour passed suddenly a light gleamed ahead then vanished chantry thought of the houseвђthe logs that had been pulled from the walls the roof partly fallenin they would be in the house and might not even know about the root cellar he led the way to the cottonwoods huge branches ran out from each tree and merged with others from nearby trees under them there was fair shelter from the rain and when he was under them he stepped down from the saddle the horses of the outlaws were outside the house вђњweвђll have to wait until morningвђќ sparrow said вђњwith the girl in thereвђќ french said вђњyouвђre forgetting her sparrowвђќ вђњall rightвђќ sparrow agreed вђњwhen youвђre readyвђќ вђњweвђll have to get them outsideвђќ chantry said вђњin close quarters she might be killedвђќ вђњtheyвђve started a fireвђќ sparrow commented вђњi donвђt think theyвђve been here longвђќ вђњspeaking of morningвђќ chantry said вђњitвђs almost that nowвђќ вђњyou wonвђt have to worry about your girl yetвђќ french said cynically вђњtheyвђll split the money firstвђќ вђњlook out somebodyвђs comingвђќ chantry warned they waited their bodies merged with the trunks of the trees light showed as the door opened and a girl stepped out that would be sarah she moved toward them and stopped a light showed again and a man appeared a big man he walked toward sarah stopping not much more than twenty feet away from them вђњyou wanted to see meвђќ he sounded puzzled вђњitвђs charlie the girls always want to talk toвђќ вђњi wanted to talk to you mortвђќ sarahвђs tone was soft friendly вђњiвђm afraid mort iвђm afraid of the talrimsвђќ вђњof them they wonвђt hurt you none besides they got that other girlвђќ вђњi donвђt mean that iвђm afraid for all of us you donвђt know them as i do iвђm sure they donвђt intend to divide that money with any of us i was sure you would understand mort charlie is too well he doesnвђt seem as serious as you doвђќ вђњhe laughs a lot but charlieвђs all rightвђќ mort was obviously turning the idea over in his mind вђњi donвђt take to them talrims myself i thought they were friends of yoursвђќ вђњoh no they sort of well they just joined up with me and whatвђs a girl to do i couldnвђt drive them off and i hadnвђt anybody to help meвђќ вђњiвђll help youвђќ mort said earnestly вђњbe careful then watch them if they start for their guns вђќ вђњdonвђt you worry none iвђm fasterвђn them iвђm fasterвђn anybody except maybe paвђќ вђњyou go back in if they say anything you tell them you like meвђthat you thought you might talk to me a littleвђќ вђњall right only donвђt you worry noneвђќ when he had gone sarah stood alone for a moment and then just as she turned to go back french stepped out and said вђњsarah it wonвђt workвђќ she was calm вђњwhy notвђќ вђњyouвђll be in there with them sarah and if shooting starts youвђre as likely to be shot as anyoneвђќ french williams started toward her talking quietly вђњlooking at the size of the place there will be five guns going in thereвђќ вђњsixвђќ she said вђњiвђll do some shooting myselfвђќ вђњdo you know who i amвђќ вђњof course youвђve lost most of your accent but itвђs there i havenвђt seen you since i was a little girlвђќ he was close to her now вђњyou favor your fatherвђќ вђњyou never liked him did you i can remember thatвђќ вђњwe didnвђt share the same ideasвђќ вђњi wonder if we doвђќ вђњabout that gold in there i think so youвђd like to have it all and so would i you spoke of shooting who were you going to shootвђќ вђњfrank ruffвђwho else but not at first not until heвђd helped kill the talrimsвђќ her voice was matteroffact вђњmort will start it and charlie and their pa will have to back him if anybody is left iвђll do the shootingвђќ she paused вђњor you can after all uncle henri blood is thicker than waterвђќ вђњwhose blood sarah surely not yoursвђќ вђњdonвђt do it for blood then do it for the money it is better that we have it than that they shouldвђќ вђњiвђll agree to thatвђќ he said cheerfully вђњbut i will have no part of any shooting with that girl in there she is the daughter of a friend get her out first then we will seeвђќ she hesitated and french williams glanced toward the house soon they would be wondering what had become of her and if they came out now вђњwait iвђll see what i can doвђќ and she turned and went back inside вђњdo you trust herвђќ sparrow asked вђњonly to do what she thinks is best for herвђќ the sky was gray in the east the rain which had ceased stood in pools like sheets of steel and the leaves dripped the clouds were breaking вђњtheyвђll be moving soonвђќ sparrow warned вђњthey know that by this time the car has been missed and the search will beginвђќ sarah emerged from the house again doris beside her right behind them was hank talrim as they walked toward the trees talrim watched them then he went back inside sarah stopped suddenly and doris continued to walk ahead moving toward a point just to the right of the trees and out of the line of fire harvey stepped out the door followed by hank talrim вђњheyвђќ harvey yelled вђњcome back hereвђќ as he shouted doris threw herself to the ground and rolled over into the shallow cut that led toward the spring harvey started to run toward them when talrim called out вђњharv waitвђќ as harvey turned hank talrim shot him he fell and rolled over and men burst from the house guns in hand hank laughed and tilted his gun he was ready to fire when frank ruffвђs big voice cut across the morning air with a shout вђњnoвђќ he pointed вђњlookвђќ all of them turned the morning sun had come from behind a cloud and its light was reflected from a pool of rain water near the trees it was enough to draw the eye french williams stood there and tom chantry and sparrow for an instant no one spoke then it was chantry hoping but not believing that a shootout might be avoided вђњleave the moneyвђќ he said clearly вђњmount your horses and ride out weвђll call it quitsвђќ frank ruff ignored him вђњarenвђt you on the wrong side sparrowвђќ he said вђњseems to me you should be over here with usвђќ вђњi am where i always should have been frank you lied to me you knowвђќ chantry was cool he had an empty feeling inside but his mind was clear his eyes appraising these were men of violence and they would shoot even if frank ruff older and perhaps wiser might see the sense in just riding off the talrims would not hank and bud were the ones nearest the house the three ruffs were at the other side scattered out watching on his own side williams was a known gunfighter a man of tested ability he himself well he could shoot as for sparrow he knew nothing about him except that the man was calm controlled and ready вђњyouвђd better do like the man saysвђќ williams said almost pleasantly вђњyou boys were never going to make it anyway iвђve got four men between you and the hideout theyвђre coming up the country right now scouting for signвђќ they had forgotten sarah standing alone she watched her face cold and still her eyes measuring all she had come west for all she had bargained for all she wanted was in that house the first part of her plan had begun to work when hank talrim had shot harvey that was one less she had talked to the talrims in confidence and she had talked to mort no matter how it turned out there would be fewer among whom to divide the loot according to her thinking when the ruffs burst into the open and saw harvey down they should have turned their guns on hank and in turn bud would have started shooting with her own gun to account for frank ruff if need beвђor whoever survived it could still work williams and chantry and sparrow the talrims and the ruffs when it was all over she might still be alone she stood for an instant knowing that the slightest move might start the shooting she was hesitating trying to decide what could be done that would be best for her when chantry spoke again вђњthere need be no shooting hereвђќ he said quietly вђњas you gentlemen know i am against violence leave the gold ruffвђjust take your horses and ride out of hereвђќ вђњwhat about your paвђќ вђњmy father faced his problems in his time i shall face mine in my time what you did to my father was murder ruff i have a feeling you will hangвђ if not for that for some other crime i see no reason for me to kill you when your end is inevitableвђќ вђњyou talk mighty fancyвђќ frank ruff said вђњall i hear is that you want to back outвђќ вђњi did not come hunting you that was your own idea i came west to buy cattle as these men can testify i have bought my cattle вђњyou now have two sons no matter who wins the odds are that when the shooting is over you will have one less maybe two less is that what you wantвђќ вђњheвђs right frank itвђs a mexican standoffвђќ sparrow said sarah saw only one thing frank ruff was hesitating the last argument had reached him in a moment he might decide to quit then there would be no shooting and the gold would go to chantry she knew the talrims their first instinct always was to kill if she moved at this tense moment her move would draw the eyes of the others and she knew what the talrims would do then вђњhankвђќ she said softly and moved suddenly eyes swung toward her and the talrims grabbed for their guns all eyes had turned but tom chantryвђs even as the talrims drew his gun was coming up his first shot caught hank talrim in the stomach and knocked him to the ground the second hit bud in the shoulder and then a thunder of guns stabbing flame a man running a man falling a grunt a scream and then silence how long had it been only a few seconds tom chantry still held his gun up ready but it was all over so many lives so short a time he could hardly realize yet what had happened from the corner of his eye he had seen french williams his gun had come out so fast it seemed almost to materialize out of thin air into his hand spouting flame now williams was down hunched against a tree his eyes still bright his gun still ready but his shirt was slowly turning crimson sparrow was leaning against another tree a trickle of blood on his cheek more blood on his shirt hank talrim was dead bud was crawling toward his horse but anybody could see he wasnвђt going far frank ruff was dead literally shot to pieces by french williams mort ruff was seemingly unhurt and was bending over charlie who was down doris came from the ditch where she had been lying вђњtom are you all rightвђќ she asked вђњi think so take care of frenchвђќ he went over to sparrow вђњbetter get your coat off mr sparrow iвђll want to look at your sideвђќ вђњitвђs just a crease tom did you hear what frank said about me being on the wrong sideвђќ вђњso i think you were on the right sideвђќ вђњyou donвђt understand tom i want you to understand i was a youngster only sixteen iвђd been working with frank ruff and harvey they told me there was a man needed killing that heвђd killed a friend of theirs and they wanted me to join them i believed them and i went along and i didnвђt know what i was shaped up for until it happened i didnвђt figure on an ambush tom i didnвђt even know your father but i helped shoot him down and it wasnвђt until i read it in the papers and heard folks talking that i realized what iвђd done вђњthey lied to me tom but i went alongвђ maybe because i wanted them to think me a big man i wanted to show them i had as much nerve as anyone i didnвђt know until afterwards that the man i had helped to kill was a good man a better man than any one of usвђќ вђњweвђll consider your part past and done with nowвђќ and chantry uncovered sparrowвђs wound it was a crease but a deep one he tore the shirt and made a pad then bound it over the wound there was nothing much else to be done here вђњi tried to make it up to you tom i tried to helpвђќ вђњyou didвђќ then mobile callahan and bone mccarthy came riding hard down the slope and from the south came hay gent mckay and helvie chantry went over to french вђњhow is heвђќ he asked doris вђњheвђs been shot three timesвђlow on the left side through the thigh and the chest muscle on the left side where it joins the shoulderвђќ вђњthey were shooting for his heartвђќ french looked up at him вђњiвђve got no heart tom thatвђs why they couldnвђt hit itвђќ callahan dropped from his horse and brought his saddlebags with him вђњlet me at him iвђve had something to do with this sort of thingвђќ mccarthy and helvie were looking at the outlaws mort ruff got slowly to his feet вђњcharlieвђs hurt badвђќ he said вђњcan you help himвђќ вђњiвђll tryвђќ helvie said bud talrim was dead вђњweвђd better report thisвђќ chantry said sparrow looked at him вђњto whom there isnвђt any law within a hundred and fifty miles that i know of you report it if you like iвђm going to forget itвђќ mckay and gent were pulling poles from the roof of the house вђњweвђll make some travois like the indians useвђќ mckay said вђњcarry the wounded backвђќ вђњi can rideвђќ sparrow said вђњweвђll need just two for williams and charlie ruffвђќ suddenly doris looked up вђњwhereвђs sarahвђќ chantry looked blank nobody had thought of sarah she was gone two horses were gone and the money was gone mobile started for his horse вђњweвђll find her come on boneвђќ вђњall right if i comeвђќ helvie asked they rode out and chantry watched them go somehow the money did not seem so important now although he knew it was it was earnshawвђs future dorisвђ future and his but was it they could start over out here that was possible a setback was only that nothing to put a man down you took such things accepted them and went on from there it was a matter of the mind that was all if you werenвђt whipped in your mind nothing could whip you вђњletвђs get on with itвђќ tom chantry said вђњback to the railroadвђќ had there ever been a time when he was not riding toward the railroad chapter sarah millier was vastly content she was safely away with two horses and all the gold she had a good rifle a pistol and a map the map showed the location of the arkansas river it showed trinidad to the west tascosa to the southeast it was drawn on a piece of tablet paper and tascosa looked reassuringly close there was a stage from there to fort griffin and points east and her horses were fresh she would ride to tascosa catch the stage go east to the railroad then to new york and within a matter of a few weeks she would be in paris with nearly fifty thousand dollars in gold nothing on the map said anything about the llano estacado the staked plain nor did it mention distance nor the factor of time she had just asked a man in trinidad to show her how the places lay in respect to each other she had said nothing to him about the fact that she might want to ride over that country she had the gold and she was safely away and if anyone had survived that shooting back there they would be having trouble enough without following her she rode blithely south and a little east the day was warm and pleasant and she made good time by nightfall when she camped on wild horse creek she had put twentyfive miles behind her there was a good bit of water in wild horse creek and she drank and her horses drank there was food in the saddlebags so she ate another hard dayвђs ride she thought and she would be in tascosa that was the way it looked on her map sarah had no canteen nor did she realize the need for one she had no idea that wild horse creek was more often dry than otherwise the next day she started out at daybreak alternately walking or cantering at noon she was far out on a wide plain of sparse grass with nothing in sight anywhere her horse no longer cantered but was content to walk a light wind began to blow the sky was clear the sun warm she was thirsty but unworried when she saw brush ahead she knew it was a creek half an hour later she sat her horse in the dry bed of that creek there was no water no sign of any she pushed on the pack horse carrying the gold lagged and impatiently she tugged on the lead rope she rode on into the sunlit afternoon tascosa could not be far away now the distance on the map the man had drawn had seemed so small and she had no idea that she would never see tascosa that it was far away beyond the horizon beyond many horizons and that in all the land between water was scarce even for those who knew where to look shortly before sundown she came upon the bones of cattle and after that she saw them frequently finally unable to go on she got down tied her horse to several skulls pulled together and slept before morning she awoke her throat was dry and she was scarcely able to swallow she walked until the sun came up then got into the saddle she could see that her horses were suffering the pack horse most for the gold was heavy and a dead weight when the sun was high she looked all around her and saw nothing but an endless plain level as a floor it seemed she found water holes where the earth was cracked from the heat but no water she came at last to a river bed instantly her heart leaped with excitement tascosa was on the canadian this must be it she was going to make it after all the bed was dry the cimarron still far to the north of the canadian was often dry she turned upstream and after plodding for some distance she found a small pool behind a natural dam formed of rocks and brush she drank the water was bad but she drank and the horses drank and the water was gone in the shade of some brush she lay down to rest after tying the horses to the brush she slept like something dead then was awakened by the sun on her face the pack horse was gone the branch to which it had been tied was broken her horse tied more securely had not gotten free there was a myriad of tracks of buffalo or cattle or something among them all she could not make out which were those of the horse for the sand was soft and left no welldefined print she rode on upstream found another miniature pool drank and let the horse drink then scrambled him up the bank seeing a low knoll she rode to the top she stared and a dreadful emptiness crept into her for wherever she looked there was nothing only the vast plain that swept away to the horizon never in all her life had she seen or imagined anything like this it was a vast brown sea rolling endlessly away there was no movement anywhere no sign of life something seemed to shrink inside her she no longer even thought of the gold only of life nothing in all her years had prepared her for this yet she must keep on it could not be far surely surely it must be close she turned the horse down the slope and headed south on the fifth day mobile callahan sighted the pack horse it was standing alone head hanging when they rode up they could see the pack had slipped around until it was under the horseвђs belly they cut the pack away gave the horse a drink from water poured into the crown of a hat then dividing the gold between their horses and leading the pack horse they turned back bone mccarthy standing in his stirrups looked all around вђњbeats allвђќ he muttered вђњwhere do you figure she thought she was goinвђ ainвђt nothing off that way for milesвђќ вђњlost maybe only she surely held to her courseвђќ вђњwhat dвђyou thinkвђќ вђњfigure it out for yourself she had no water with her and besides waterвђs too far apart in this country iвђd say she was deadвђќ вђњcome on packinвђ all this gold weвђll be lucky to make it back ourselvesвђќ thirteen years later two cowboys hunting strays in the lonely lands where the panhandle of oklahoma gives way to the panhandle of texas came on some bones вђњhey sam looka hereвђќ sam rode over looked into the shallow place behind the clump of bear grass вђњwhat dвђya know woman tooвђќ вђњwhite womanвђќ the first cowhand indicated the twisted leather of a boot sole and heel he held up a finger bone on it was a gold ring with a diamondвђor what looked like one вђњwhat would a white woman be doinвђ away off hereвђќ he looked around some of the bones had been pulled away by coyotes there was no sign of a grave somehow she had come to this point died here and remained lying there until now вђњought to bury herвђќ sam said вђњwith what we got no shovel come on we

elseвђќ they rode away the sound of their hoofbeats died away the wind stirred and a little dust drifted over the whitened bones and then lay still
