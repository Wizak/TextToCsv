 chapter one a band on a guitar before i was born my mum played music with four friends theres a photograph of them in our living room evie grace angela kate and my mum they were the sweet pepper band and they played south american music mum played guitar mum had long dark hair in the photograph shes wearing a big hat a red shire and yellow trousers she looks south american but shes not shes english shes smiling in the photograph she looks beautiful shes beautiful now too but these days her hair is short and the dark brown colour comes from a bottle mum doesnt play her guitar very often any more it sits in the corner of the living room waiting for evie grace angela or kate to visit when i was a little girl i liked to put my small hand on the front of mums guitar while she played if my hand moved a little because of the music mum said that was called vibration she was happy that i could feel the vibration of her music when i put my hand on her guitar and she wasnt angry when one day i had blue paint on my hand and i put it on the guitar mum liked me to feel the vibration of her music you see thats because i cant hear her music my ears dont work im deaf i was born like that sometimes i think thats why mum doesnt play music very often because she knows i cant hear it and now that im eighteen years old my hands are too big to put them on the front of the guitar i dont know if mum was sad to have a deaf baby she tells me i was beautiful when i was born i had lots of blonde hair and blue eyes that went brown like hers after a few months but i dont think mums sad because she smiles all the time mum smiles more than anyone i know shes always happy thats one of the things everyone loves about her the children at busy kids day nursery where we both work all love mum busy kids is mums business she started it five years ago mums really good with children i remember when i was quite young five or six years old i was sad about something i dont remember what i was sad about but i do remember what mum said we sat in a chair together with her face close to mine and she put her arms around me we stayed like that for a while and then she sat back so she could talk to me mum and i use our hands and fingers to talk to each other its called signing anyway mum said that we can choose how to be in life happy or sad she said lifes short so choose to be happy i try never to forger those words i try to be like my mum because i think shes a wonderful person i dont know much about my father because he left after i was born all i know is that he played music too and that hes french he lives in paris now mum and my father met when he was working in norwich for a year they fell in love and soon got married dad moved into the house where mum and i live now norwich is a beautiful place but it isnt as big and exciting as paris i think my father got bored or perhaps he was sad when i was born deaf because thats when he went away to live with his family in paris he never came back some of my friends dont talk to their parents very much my friend suzanne sometimes tells her mother shes with me when shes really with her boyfriend she does this because her mum worries about her all the time she worries about where she is and who shes with bur mum and i are very close and i couldnt tell her something that wasnt true anyway she doesnt worry the way suzannes mum does so i usually tell her everything but i didnt tell her when i fell in love for the first time i dont know why perhaps it was because it felt so strange because i felt so strange it was almost like being on a boat on an angry sea sometimes i was afraid of how i felt and there was another problem i didnt know the name of the man i was in love with chapter two shopping just for a moment try to think what its like to live in my world stop what youre doing and put your hands over your ears are there no sounds at all or are the noises of the street just quieter than usual i know mum loves listening to the sounds of birds singing in the countryside when we go walking in my world there are no birds singing there are no noisy men working on the roads no people leaving bars late at night shouting at each other no babies crying but the man i love doesnt live in my world he lives in the hearing world the first time i saw him he was standing in front of the shop across the road from our house he was putting apples and oranges onto the table outside the shop and his black hair had blue lights in it from the sun i watched him from my bedroom window and i smiled at how carefully he was putting the fruit onto the table he was like an artist not a shop assistant then as i watched a big motorbike went up the street the young man looked up and smiled as he watched it go past i saw the motorbike go past but he heard it first then saw it after the motorbike was gone he went back to his fruit but then a small girl fell off her bicycle close to the shop and he ran to help her he knew she wanted help because he heard her in only one minute i already knew four things about him he had beautiful black hair he liked motorbikes he was kind to apples oranges and little girls and of course he could hear until i first saw him i didnt think very often about being deaf its all ive ever known and i cant do anything to change it and all my boyfriends have been deaf but after i saw the young man i wanted to be like most other people i didnt want to be different i soon found out that he only worked at the shop on saturdays after that i went in there to buy something each saturday every week i wanted to talk to him but every week i just smiled and paid for my things things that i didnt really want mum often looked at me strangely when i came back from the shop we didnt need any apples samantha she said once i bought some yesterday and another time weve already got biscuits in the cupboard on saturdays i always wanted to go to the shop but i always felt afraid too i never felt very comfortable as i walked across the road i played with the money in my pocket like a child going to buy sweets and then sometimes when i got to the shop i waited for a moment outside reading the postcards in the window people who want to sell things write about them on a postcard and the young man puts them in the window car five years old cat needs good home large fridge nearly new one saturday i read all of the postcards twice before i went into the shop then when i was inside i didnt know what to buy mum and i always go to the supermarket on fridays and i really didnt want anything the young man was busy selling bread and cakes to a woman with two children this gave me time to think and in the end i decided to buy a newspaper the shop was often very busy on saturdays usually the young man just had time to smile at me and take my money but that morning it was different after the woman and her children left the shop was empty there was only me and the young man when i took my newspaper to him to pay for it he smiled but when i tried to smile back at him my mouth felt like wood then he said something to me i watched his mouth closely we had lessons at school to help us lipread to watch peoples mouths to read their words when they talk i can lipread quite well so i watched the young mans mouth and i thought he was talking about a fire a big fire then i looked down at my newspaper and saw a picture of a house on fire it was a colour picture and the fire was very big and red i hoped nobody was in the house thats what i wanted to say to the young man how terrible i hope nobody was in the house but i didnt say it i didnt say anything i dont like speaking you see i dont like actually using my voice when i was a child i often tried to calk and other children didnt understand me sometimes they laughed thats why i think my voice sounds strange and i didnt want the young man to think i was strange when i looked up the young man was speaking again then he wailed for me to answer him but i didnt hear him so i couldnt so i just smiled and took my newspaper and left the shop but as i walked across the road to my house i felt sad because i was sure he probably did think i was strange now chapter three my best friend mum looked at me when i went into the house with the newspaper we signed to each other are you ok she asked and i did my best to smile yes im ok i said she looked at me for a moment as if she didnt quite believe me and then she said rons here hes in the living room that made me happy again ron is my very best friend we lived next door to each other when we were children now hes a student in london and i dont get to see him very often hes studying to be a teacher of deaf children he wanted to become one because of me ron learnt to speak to me by signing when he was very young i went quickly into the living room ron was sitting on the sofa reading a magazine when he saw me he put the magazine down hi sam he signed to me and smiled hi ron i smiled back and kissed him how are you i was really happy to see him i knew i could tell him about my problem with the man from the shop ron understood these things i remember the first time he fell in love it was with my friend suzanne actually mum put her head round the door i watched her mouth move as she asked ron if he wanted a cup of tea she likes ron as much as i do when we were children she often took both of us to the sea for the day once i asked ron what the sound of the sea was like he said the seas loud when it gets to the beach but it can be soft and quiet too usually i dont feel sad about being deaf but i love the sea and i would like to hear what it sounds like very much i quickly told ron about the man from the shop before mum came back with the tea actually i think i know him ron said after a few moments my brothers friend has a saturday job at that shop hes a student at the university he lives in petes house pete is rons brother i couldnt believe it my man lived in petes house whats his name i asked jim ron told me actually petes having a party at his house tonight come with me jim will probably be there parties are difficult for me because i cant talk to people its different when im with my other deaf friends because we sign to each other and we laugh a lot going to a party with them is different to going to any other sort of party we all speak the same language when im at a party with them im in the centre of things at parties with hearing people im on the outside or i feel as if i am ron knew what i was thinking come to the party he signed please id like you to come ok i said at last just as mum came in with the tea chapter four the party later i was looking at all my clothes when mum came into my bedroom i had a green dress in one hand and a short black skirt in the other hand i wasnt happy with the dress or the skirt mum took a blue jumper from the bed and gave it to me the weather man on the television says that it will snow she said then she smiled and kissed me and i felt bad that she didnt know about jim i decided to tell her as soon as there was anything to tell if there was anything to tell it was almost spring but it was still very told ron and i stopped to buy some drinks on the way to the party and by the time we got to petes house it was beginning to snow ron looked at me as we waited at the door ok he asked i smiled at him yes i said im ok a girl opened the door and said hello to ron i didnt know her she was very pretty and she was wearing a nice red dress i smiled at her and followed ron into the house inside we went into the kitchen it was full of people all the girls were wearing short dresses or skirts i was the only one wearing a jumper and jeans ron and i took our drinks into the living room this room was full of people too and it was hot very hot but i couldnt take my jumper off because i wasnt wearing a tshirt under it the jumper was a mistake but i tried to forget about it the musics very loud i said to ron how do you know that he asked and smiled because i can feel it in my legs i told him and it was true it was like my hand on mums guitar the vibration of the music was travelling from the floor into my feet then it was going right up my legs and into my body a man came up to us it was pete he said something to ron then looked right at me pete knows im deaf of course hello sam i saw his mouth saying wheres jim i wanted to ask but i didnt i just said hello and smiled pete talked to us for a while then he went to change the music ron talked to me people in the room watched us talking with our hands people often watch when i use sign language its interesting for them i think ron told me about the fun he was having with his new friends in london he talked a lot about a girl called mary is mary your girlfriend i asked him and his face went a bit red at the moment shes just a friend he said but i want her to be my girlfriend i thought about jim where was he why wasnt he here the party was in his house ron often knows what im thinking hell come soon he told me around ten oclock ron was talking to some other friends across the room i felt very hot in my jumper so i decided to go into the garden for a short time outside everything was white there was snow everywhere and it was beautiful the garden looked like a big white cake and i was the first person to walk on it or i thought i was the first person to walk on it but after a few moments i saw that i wasnt i could see empty places in the snow made by shoes footprints but i couldnt see anyone but i knew someone was there because just then something very told hit the side of my face snow chapter five snow fun more snowballs flew past my face then i saw someone come out from behind a white tree it was the man from the shop it was jim i laughed and quickly made a snowball then i sent it through the air but jim moved so quickly to one side the snowball hit a tree behind him so i started to make another snowball but before it was ready jim threw a new one at me i laughed again then i ran behind a wall and made lots of snowballs when they were ready i came out from behind the wall but jim had made lots of snowballs too and soon i was very wet after a few minutes i was laughing so much my stomach hurt just the way it does when im laughing at parties with my deaf friends when i looked up at last i saw that jim was standing quite close to me i also saw that something was wrong he wasnt smiling now he was looking at me i remembered how he looked at me in the shop and i knew it was the same now he was waiting for me to answer him but i couldnt i looked into his face waiting for him to speak again after a while he did and this time i watched his mouth very carefully there was an outside light on the side of the house anyway the snow all around us made it almost as light as day whats your name he asked this time i knew it was very important for me say something sam i said carefully my names sam samantha then i told him i cant hear what you say im deaf he looked at me for a very long time and i wasnt sure if he understood then he smiled can you lipread sam he asked i nodded yes i said usually then lipread this he said moving his mouth carefully the time for talking has finished get your snowballs ready then he ran away and went back behind his tree before i could move snowballs were coming through the air again i ran back behind my wall laughing my first snowball hit him in the face but he sent one back which got me on my face the snow was told and wet in my eyes but i didnt mind i was happy i knew jim was throwing snowballs at me because he liked me sometimes when people learn about me being deaf theyre very careful with me i feel like im a piece of expensive glass its difficult to be friends with a piece of expensive glass bui jim wasnt careful with me and i liked that soon i was very hoc but i didnt want to stop i wanted to throw snowballs at jim all night but after about five minutes jim stopped when i looked over to see why i saw his mouth was moving but he wasnt looking at me he was looking at someone behind me i turned and saw a girl standing near the house it was the girl in the red dress the same girl who opened the door when ron and i arrived at the party she was saying something to jim and she didnt look happy she wasnt smiling and her eyes were told as told as her legs in the short red dress jim started to walk across the snowy grass when he got near to me he smiled and looked into my face ill win next time he said then he went inside with the girl i stayed on in the garden for a few minutes more but it wasnt much fun now you cant really throw snowballs at yourself when i went back in the house i found ron in the kitchen sam youre still here he signed i was looking for you he looked at my wet clothes what happened to your jumper before i could answer i saw jim on the other side of the kitchen the girl in the red dress was talking to him but he wasnt listening he was watching me and ron speaking with our hands ron saw who i was looking at have you been outside with jim he asked and he smiled when my red face gave him my answer ive been with jim and about a hundred snowballs i smiled as i signed the words ron laughed more people came into the kitchen and he moved closer to me there wasnt enough room for him to sign now so he spoke carefully its very good to see you sam he said i like london but its not so much fun without you there ron is like my brother so when he kissed my face i knew it was the kiss of a brother to his sister but i didnt know if jim knew that chapter six spring cleaning the next saturday was the first saturday in mareh mum always likes us to clean the house on the first saturday in mareh she calls it spring cleaning she was cleaning downstairs and i was cleaning upstairs i wanted to be upstairs because i could see the shop from my bedroom window downstairs there are always cars in the street outside and you cant see out very well i really wanted to see jim again and i looked out of the window often while i was cleaning once he came outside to put some fruit and flowers onto the cable but he didnt look across the road the snowball fight was a week ago now a week is a long time if youre in love it was sunny and the snow was gone now i was sorry about that havent you finished this room sam mum stood in front of me signing she couldnt understand why i was still cleaning my room im usually quite quick ac cleaning when im not looking out of windows and remembering snowballs sorry i answered and she smiled thats ok actually can you go to the shop to get a bottle of window cleaner for me i forgot to buy some i couldnt believe it she was sending me to the shop do you feel ok sam mum asked me you look hot yes i answered i feel fine but i knew my face was red are you sure she said ill go to the shop if you want no i signed ill go and i quickly went downstairs and left the house jim was busy when i went into the shop he was standing near the bottles of wine with a man he was helping the man to decide which wine to buy the man was quite short jim smiled at me over his head i smiled at him and then i went over to the bottles of cleaner mum always buys the same window cleaner but i stood in front of the different bottles as if i didnt know which one was best i wanted the short man to choose his wine quickly and leave i wanted jim to myself at last the man left carrying two bottles of wine onered one white i took my window cleaner over to jim to pay for it when i got there he was writing something on a piece of paper then he gave it to me the writing was large and black it was like an artists writing i read the words i know more about snowballs than wine i laughed did you enjoy our snowball fight he wrote next i took the pen from him yes i wrote i did very much after hed read my words he looked at me then he started writing again is ron your boyfriend i read this time i didnt write i spoke no i said hes my best friend i havent got a boyfriend jim understood me without any problem or i think he did because he smiled do you want to meet me tomorrow night he said and he moved his mouth carefully so i could lipread his words yes i said id like that how long does it take to buy window cleaner sam mum asked me when i got back to the house but i only smiled sorry mum i signed and hurried quickly upstairs it wasnt until i started cleaning mums bedroom that i thought about the girl in the red dress again who was she but i was afraid of the answer i liked jim too much and i didnt want to think about the girl in the red dress chapter seven a new boyfriend next day mum and i went to winterton for a walk winterton is one of my favourite places its cast of norwich by the sea winterton is where mum took me and ron when we were children it takes about fortyfive minutes to drive there we put on our coats and made some coffee and some sandwiches to take with us on the beach it was told but sunny some children were running by the sea with their dog as we walked along i told mum about jim when i was finished my face was a bit red you really like him dont you she said looking at me it was windy by the sea mums hair was all over her face but i could see her smile through it yes i said i do just for a moment she looked a little sad she walked ahead a short way then she looked back at me love is wonderful she said smiling again enjoy it while you can sam enjoy it while you can i did enjoy myself that evening very much jim and i went to a bar in the centre of norwich it was in the old area of town close to the river there was a pool table in the bar i like playing pool ron taught me how to play years ago now im better than him jim saw me looking at the pool table and the next moment he was putting some money into the side of it we played and i won easily it only took five minutes my last boyfriend got angry when he lost bur when i looked at jim i saw that he was laughing i liked that very good he said but my snowballs are better than yours then he looked at me can you understand me i smiled yes i said i can understand if you speak slowly can you understand me jim smiled too yes he said i can understand you very well we sat down together at a table and for the next two hours we talked most of the time we spoke to each other and sometimes we wrote things down i didnt think about how we were talking i was too interested in what we were saying this was what i found out about jim he was twentyone years old and he was studying english at university in norwich this was his last year as a student his family lived in derbyshire in the middle of england he had a brother of twentyfive a sister of seventeen and a dog called sky he liked walking in the hills near his family home he told me that in winter the hills were often white with snow winter was his favourite time then he told me the only two things he didnt like about norfolk there werent many hills and it didnt snow very often mum has told me that people who live in different places in england sound different when they speak people from derbyshire sound different to people from london and people from london sound different to people from norwich they have different accents so i knew that jim probably had a different accent to the other people around us in the bar then jim wanted to know about me so i told him about my job at busy kids i said that i spent a lot of my time playing and that the children dont mind about me being deaf i wont always work at busy kids i finished i like working there but i also like writing stories one day i want to write a book im sure you will jim said youll write a book and youll be famous i just want to be happy i wrote on his piece of paper but i was already happy happy being with jim whats it like to be deaf jim asked then and i thought for a moment you dont mind me asking you that do you jim asked no i wrote i want to tell you but its difficult i think it must be very peaceful jim said i like noise but sometimes i need to be quiet thats when i go to the countryside for a walk he laughed but actually the countryside can be a very noisy place there are cars and animals and birds singing mum likes listening to the birds sing i told him yes i do too he said and the sound of the wind in the trees sometimes my world is too quiet i said and jim touched my hand dont be sad he said and i smiled im not sad i said and it was true i was very happy being with jim i think being deaf is a bit like swimming underwater i told him you know when youre swimming and you look up through the water everything looks different the water changes everything jim moved his chair near to mine and took my hand in his fish always live in the water he said its all they know yes i said and i knew he understood what i was trying to tell him fish dont know that the water makes things look different when the bar closed jim walked home with me he had his bicycle with him it was dark so i couldnt read his lips but i didnt mind it was nice just to be with him we lived in different worlds because i was deaf and he wasnt but it wasnt important outside my house we stopped under a street light jim looked into my eyes whats your mobile phone number so i can text you i told him my mobile phone number then i showed him how to say goodbye in sign language he tried it a few times then he showed me another way to say goodbye with a kiss i liked that way best chapter eight the girl in the red dress that evening was the beginning of something wonderful because jim and i met often after that sometimes he went out with his friends or stayed at home to study but we saw each other as often as we could we met in cafes or in bars or we just went for walks sometimes we used pen and paper to talk but usually i read his lips i showed him some more sign language too but often we didnt have to talk at all we just liked being together when we werent together we sent each other text messages and emails in this way we spoke to each other every day sometimes i felt i was living a dream a very good dream i was in love and i was very happy until the day i met the girl in the red dress again the girl from the party it was a monday morning and i was on my way to work mum had left early to meet a new parent so i was walking it was a sunny day and i was feeling good i went to the shops to buy food for the childrens lunches and then i walked through the park i was probably thinking about jim because i was always thinking about jim i didnt see the girl with the red dress until she stood in front of me she wasnt wearing a red dress that day of course but i knew who she was hello i said but she didnt say anything she just stood there and looked at me then when she started speaking she talked really quickly too quickly please i said can you speak more slowly i cant understand you she looked cross what i saw her say i cant understand you my face went red but i tried again speaking carefully please speak more slowly so i can read your lips im deaf when she spoke again she spoke very slowly too slowly i could understand every word jim was my boyfriend before he met you she said my boyfriend we were very happy together very happy im good for him in a way you can never be good for him how can you be good for him you cant hear his music his music i didnt understand what she meant she looked at me dont you know about his music she said jim plays in a band i cant believe you dont know that the band means everything to him everything and he needs to be with someone who can hear his music jim writes songs didnt you know that you really dont know jim very well do you he writes songs and he plays them to me before he tries them with the band he could never do that with you could he so stay away from him understand youll never make him happy the way i do she waited for a moment to see if i would say anything but i was too hurt inside to speak hurt and afraid so she said it one more time stay away from jim then she left there was a seat in the park under a tree i sat down on it and watched her walk away my head hurt it was lull of her words she was jims girlfriend until he met me was that true why didnt he tell me and he played music in a band was that true as well i thought i knew jim but now i didnt know what to believe or to think i only knew that i was afraid very afraid i knew why jim never spoke to me about his music because im deaf just then i felt my phone ring i took it from my bag and looked at it there was a text message from jim meet me tonight i love you jim i didnt answer the message mum looked at me when i arrived at busy kids are you all right sam she asked me you look ill im ok i signed and i took the shopping into the kitchen where we make the childrens lunches mum followed me sam she said what is it i didnt want to talk about it but mums face was very worried so i told her you must speak to jim she said do you want me to phone him no i said no thank you i need to thank i was sad all day no i was worse than sad my happy world was broken into pieces at four oclock mum told me to go home early ive got a friend coming for dinner but im busy here she said can you cook something i was happy to go home early but i wasnt hungry but i made a pizza for mum and her friend mum got home at six oclock and went to have a shower when somebody comes to the front door at our house the lights go on and off then i know that someones there the lights in the kitchen went on and off while i was making a salad and mum was in the shower i went to the front door to see who it was i could see a man through the glass it was jim i opened the door he was smiling but i couldnt smile back i was pleased to see him but i was sad too because of the meeting with the girl hi sam he said these are for you then i saw he had some flowers beautiful flowers red roses lots of them flowers for a boyfriend to give to his girlfriend but in my head i saw the girl from the party in her red dress the roses were the same colour as her dress did jim give her roses when he was her boyfriend thank you i took the flowers from him and when i looked up again jim was saying something except of course i didnt know what it was i dont think i have ever felt so sad about being deaf as at that moment jim took the flowers back from me and put them down on a table inside the house then he put his arms around me i knew he was trying to show me what he wanted to say to me it was the same thing as his text message the same thing as the roses i love you i was happy that jim loved me but i was still sad because i knew love wasnt enough chapter nine pizza and talking when i was about fifteen years old my favourite books and films were all love stories the stories were all the same there was a man the hero and a woman the heroine they met but there was always a problem which meant they could not be together at first perhaps the hero was hurt by love in the past and didnt want a girlfriend now or the heroine had an important job and didnt have time for a boyfriend anyway these books or films always finish in the same way the hero and the heroine know that they are in love so the problems arent important the only important thing is their love when we tell children stories we often finish and they were happy ever after its the same with love stories the hero and the heroine are always happy ever after happy together always with no problems but real life is different to stories and im not a heroine anyway i read hundreds of those books when i was fifteen and there was never a story about a deaf girl with a boyfriend who played music i moved away from jim as mum came down the stairs her hair was wet but she was smiling at jim i soon saw that he was the friend coming to dinner i dont want you to be sad she signed to me while jim put the roses in some water so i phoned jim and asked him to dinner after weve eaten you can tell him why youre sad and until then i can find out more about him she was smiling like the children in the busy kids nursery smile sometimes when theyve done something a little bad i dont usually feel angry with the children and i couldnt feel angry with mum while we are the pizza jim and mum talked mum laughed a lot i knew she liked jim of course she liked jim sometimes mum signed to me to tell me what she and jim were talking about his studies at university his family her days as a musician with the sweet pepper band jims father plays guitar she told me he was quire famous when he was a young man isnt that interesting mum was like a young girl she was having fun talking to jim but i sat quietly watching them i didnt eat very much i wasnt hungry i think mum was asking jim more questions about his family but i just felt sad that i didnt already know about his father being a famous musician after two months of being jims girlfriend i didnt know his father was a famous musician i didnt know about jim playing in a band and i didnt know that the girl from the party was his girlfriend before me what else didnt i know im going out now mum said to me after dinner ill wash the plates when i come home you stay here and calk to jim i saw her say goodbye and then she left i took jims plate do you want a coffee i asked him no thank you he said he was looking at me waiting but i didnt know what to say or how to begin i only knew that i wanted to sign to him what i was thinking and feeling i wanted him to understand signing signing is my first language and i wanted to talk to him about the girl from the party in my first language jim waited until i was looking at him your mum told me what happened he said she told me about lauren so i thought thats what shes called lauren i didnt like her and i didnt like her name sam jim said lauren wasnt my girlfriend when you and i met at the party we did go out together for a few months but that was last year were just friends now or we were friends oh im so angry with her for hurting you i didnt think jim would lie to me but he didnt tell me about his music jim knew what i was thinking im sorry i didnt tell you about my music he said you didnt tell me because its a problem i said but he didnt agree no he said thats not true yes it is i said i told him he loves music and i cant hear music its a big problem i told him he doesnt want a deaf girlfriend he wants a hearing girlfriend but now jim couldnt understand me i wasnt speaking very well because i was angry and sad so i wrote it down for him you want a girlfriend who can hear your music im not good for you jims face was very sad dont say that he said it isnt true i know what i want and thats you you are good for me sam youre very good for me when i didnt answer jim started to write again i want to be with you sam i want to be with you too thats what i wanted to write but i didnt because i couldnt forget laurens words maybe jim did want me maybe lauren just wanted to hurt me but her words were true i could never know jim the man who played music so could i ever really know jim chapter ten jims band jim went home after that i told him to go because i needed to think before he went he wrote something down and gave it to me i read it after he left it said i believe that sometimes its more important to feel than to think we love each other dont forget that i didnt forget it i thought about it all the time but i also remembered laurens words and jims music it was the worst time of my life mum knew i was sad take a holiday from work sam she told me visit ron in london i thought it was a good idea i always had fun with ron so i went but its difficult to have fun with anyone when your world is in pieces i was in london not norwich but i still was thinking about jim i wasnt having fun at all and i soon saw that ron and his friend mary were boyfriend and girlfriend now not just friends ron felt bad about jim and me he tried not to be too happy about mary when i was there he didnt want me to feel worse but every time he looked at her he smiled and i understood of course i understood until a week ago it was the same for me i felt happy every time i looked at jim but not anymore a few days later when it was time for me to catch the train home ron took me to the station we stood together on the station platform with hundreds of people hurrying to work around us ron signed to me sam i dont think of you as my deaf friend he said i think of you as my kind funny friend im sure its the same for jim im so lucky to have you as my friend i told him we kissed and said goodbye and then i got on the train i wanted to believe ron but laurens words were always in my head jim wants to be with someone who can hear his music i knew it was true when i got home mum looked at me she saw in my face that nothing was different send jim a text message sam she said please speak to him i hate to see you like this i cant i told her she looked at me for a long time do you know what i think she said i dont think this is about jim at all i think its about your father i looked at her but i didnt say anything i wanted to know what she meant i didnt want to tell you this she said but now i think its best mums face was sad and i felt afraid what is it i asked she closed her eyes for a moment your father left us because he met another woman a woman who didnt have any children and who thought your father was wonderful she didnt want to play guitar or have children she only wanted to be with him sam your father didnt leave because you were deaf he left because he didnt want to be a father to any child mum was very sad now she was crying and her face was wet i wanted to put my arms around her but she started signing again you think jim will leave you after a few months because youre deaf but i think youre wrong jim isnt the same as your father he doesnt just think about himself hes a good man and he loves you she smiled at me oh sam i understand i really do when you love somebody you feel afraid but its better to feel afraid than to feel sad sometimes you have to fight for what you want she put her arms around me and soon we were both crying then after a few minutes she smiled at me she looked happy now like mum again get your coat she told me i know where jim is we can go to see him i didnt ask any questions i just did what she said i wanted to see jim i wanted to see him very much mum drove through the city centre i didnt know where we were going or how she knew where jim was i was busy thinking about love stories and about the problem keeping me from jim it wasnt that i was deaf and it wasnt because my dad left when i was born it was me i was making problems because was afraid i was fighting against something i really wanted and it was stupid i could never kill my love for jim it was too strong after ten minutes the car stopped and i saw we were near a church but mum didnt go into the church she went up to the building next to it st marks church hall before she opened the door i stopped her how did you know where to find jim i asked her mum smiled i came here while you were in london she said and smiled again follow me its all right then she opened the door and went in after a moment i went in after her and there was jim with four other men they were playing music and i knew this was jims band jim was playing drums there were four drums of different sizes jim was playing all of them his hands were moving very quickly quicker than mums hands when shes speaking to me i watched him play for a few moments at first he didnt see me but i was happy just to look at him it was very good to see him again and now i was really seeing him because this was the jim who played music this was the real jim chapter eleven happy ever after i knew the music was loud because i fell the vibration of the sound in the floor under my feet mum put her hands over her ears when jim saw me there was not as much vibration because he stopped playing his drums he got up and walked over to me and his friends stopped playing too i think everyone was looking at us but im not sure all i remember is jims smile and the love in his eyes before he kissed me as i kissed him back i forgot to be afraid this was jim and i loved him there was nothing to be afraid of after a few moments he moved about a metre away and started to sign to me he made some mistakes but i understood just as he understood when i spoke to him and i remembered his fast hands on the drums there was no problem this is what he signed to me your mum taught me some sign language now ill teach you to play drums come with me before i could answer jim took my hand in his we moved to stand with his friends mum was smiling at me everyone was smiling jim stood behind me and his hands were on my hands and then i was playing the drums and the vibration travelled from the drums to my hands and up my arms to my head it was wonderful as wonderful as my small hand on the front of mums guitar the end
