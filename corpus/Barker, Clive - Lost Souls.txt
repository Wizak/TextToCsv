 by clive barker everything the blind woman had told harry shed seen was undeniably real whatever inner eye norma paine possessedthat extraordinary skill that allowed her to scan the island of manhattan from the broadway bridge to battery park and yet not move an inch from her tiny room on seventyfifththat eye was as sharp as any knife jugglers here was the derelict house on ridge street with the smoke stains besmirching the brick here was the dead dog that shed described lying on the sidewalk as though asleep but that it lacked half its head here too if norma was to be believed was the demon that harry had come in search of the shy and sublimely malignant chachat the house was not harry thought a likely place for a desperado of chachats elevation to be in residence though the infernal brethren could be a loutish lot to be certain it was christian propaganda which sold them as dwellers in excrement and ice the escaped demon was more likely to be downing fly eggs and vodka at the waldorfastoria than concealing itself amongst such wretchedness but harry had gone to the blind clairvoyant in desperation having failed to locate chachat by any means conventionally available to a private eye such as himself he was he had admitted to her responsible for the fact that the demon was loose at all it seemed hed never learned in his all too frequent encounters with the gulf and its progeny that hell possessed a genius for deceit why else had he believed in the child that had tottered into view just as hed leveled his gun at chachata child of course which had evaporated into a cloud of tainted air as soon as the diversion was redundant and the demon had made its escape now after almost three weeks of vain pursuit it was almost christmas in new york season of goodwill and suicide streets thronged the air like salt in wounds mammon in glory a more perfect playground for chachats despite could scarcely be imagined harry had to find the demon quickly before it did serious damage find it and return it to the pit from which it had come in extremis he would even use the binding syllables which the late father hesse had vouchsafed to him once accompanying them with such dire warnings that harry had never even written them down whatever it took just as long as chachat didnt see christmas day this side of the schism it seemed to be colder inside the house on ridge street than out harry could feel the chill creep through both pairs of socks and start to numb his feet he was making his way along the second landing when he heard the sigh he turned fully expecting to see chachat standing there its eye cluster looking a dozen ways at once its cropped fur rippling but no instead a young woman stood at the end of the corridor her undernourished features suggested puerto rican extraction but thatand the fact that she was heavily pregnantwas all harry had time to grasp before she hurried away down the stairs listening to the girl descend harry knew that norma had been wrong if chachat had been here such a perfect victim would not have been allowed to escape with her eyes in her head the demon wasnt here which left the rest of manhattan to search the night before something very peculiar had happened to eddie axel it had begun with his staggering out of his favorite bar which was six blocks from the grocery store he owned on third avenue he was drunk and happy and with reason today he had reached the age of fiftyfive he had married three times in those years he had sired four legitimate children and a handful of bastards andperhaps most significantlyhed made axels superette a highly lucrative business all was well with the world but jesus it was chilly no chance on a night threatening a second ice age of finding a cab he would have to walk home hed got maybe half a block however whenmiracle of miraclesa cab did indeed cruise by hed flagged it down eased himself in and the weird times had begun for one the driver knew his name home mr axel hed said eddie hadnt questioned the godsend merely mumbled yes and assumed this was a birthday treat courtesy of someone back at the bar perhaps his eyes had flickered closed perhaps hed even slept whatever the next thing he knew the cab was driving at some speed through streets he didnt recognize he stirred himself from his doze this was the villagesurely an area eddie kept clear of his neighborhood was the high nineties close to the store not for him the decadence of the village where a shop sign offered ear piercing with or without pain and young men with suspicious hips lingered in doorways this isnt the right direction he said rapping on the perspex between him and the driver there was no word of apology or explanation forthcoming however until the cab made a turn toward the river drawing up in a street of warehouses and the ride was over this is your stop said the chauffeur eddie didnt need a more explicit invitation to disembark as he hauled himself out the cabbie pointed to the murk of an empty lot between two benighted warehouses shes been waiting for you he said and drove away eddie was left alone on the sidewalk common sense counseled a swift retreat but what now caught his eye glued him to the spot there she stoodthe woman of whom the cabbie had spokenand she was the most obese creature eddie had ever set his sight upon she had more chins than fingers and her fat which threatened at every place to spill from the light summer dress she wore gleamed with either oil or sweat eddie she said everybody seemed to know his name tonight as she moved toward him tides moved in the fat of her torso and along her limbs who are you eddie was about to inquire but the words died when he realized the obesitys feet werent touching the ground she was floating had eddie been sober he might well have taken his cue then and fled but the drink in his system mellowed his trepidation he stayed put eddie she said dear eddie i have some good news and some bad news which would you like first eddie pondered this one for a moment the good he concluded youre going to die tomorrow came the reply accompanied by the tiniest of smiles thats good he said paradise awaits your immortal soul she murmured isnt that a joy so whats the bad news she plunged her stubbyfingered hand into the crevasse between her gleaming tits there came a little squeal of complaint and she drew something out of hiding it was a cross between a runty gecko and a sick rat possessing the least fetching qualities of both its pitiful limbs pedaled at the air as she held it up for eddies perusal this she said is your immortal soul she was right thought eddie the news was not good yes she said its a pathetic sight isnt it the soul drooled and squirmed as she went on its undernourished its weak to the point of expiring altogether and why she didnt give eddie a chance to reply a paucity of good works eddies teeth had begun to chatter what am i supposed to do about it he asked youve got a little breath left you must compensate for a lifetime of rampant profiteering i dont follow tomorrow turn axels superette into a temple of charity and you may yet put some meat on your souls bones she had begun to ascend eddie noticed in the darkness above her there was sad sad music which now wrapped her up in minor chords until she was entirely eclipsed the girl had gone by the time harry reached the street so had the dead dog at a loss for options he trudged back to norma paines apartment more for the company than the satisfaction of telling her she had been wrong im never wrong she told him over the din of the five televisions and as many radios that she played perpetually the cacophony was she claimed the only sure way to keep those of the spirit world from incessantly intruding upon her privacy the babble distressed them i saw power in that house on ridge street she told harry sure as shit harry was about to argue when an image on one of the screens caught his eye an outside news broadcast pictured a reporter standing on a sidewalk across the street from a store from which bodies were being removed what is it norma demanded looks like a bomb went off harry replied trying to trace the reporters voice through the din of the various stations turn up the sound said norma i like a disaster it was not a bomb that had wrought such destruction it emerged but a riot in the middle of the morning a fight had begun in the packed grocery store nobody quite knew why it had rapidly escalated into a bloodbath a conservative estimate put the death toll at thirty with twice as many injured the report with its talk of a spontaneous eruption of violence gave fuel to a terrible suspicion in harry chachat he murmured despite the noise in the little room norma heard him speak what makes you so sure she said harry didnt reply he was listening to the reporters recapitulation of the events hoping to catch the location of axels superette and there it was third avenue between ninetyfourth and ninetyfifth keep smiling he said to norma and left her to her brandy and the dead gossiping in the bathroom linda had gone back to the house on ridge street as a last resort hoping against hope that shed find bolo there he was she vaguely calculated the likeliest candidate for father of the child she carried but thered been some strange men in her life at that time men with eyes that seemed golden in certain lights men with sudden joyless smiles anyway bolo hadnt been at the house and here she wasas shed known shed be all alongalone all she could hope to do was lie down and die but there was death and death there was that extinction she prayed for nightly to fall asleep and have the cold claim her by degrees and there was that other death the one she saw whenever fatigue drew her lids down a death that had neither dignity in the going nor hope of a hereafter a death brought by a man in a gray suit whose face sometimes resembled a halffamiliar saint and sometimes a wall of rotting plaster begging as she went she made her way uptown toward times square here amongst the traffic of consumers she felt safe for a while finding a little deli she ordered eggs and coffee calculating the meal so that it just fell within the begged sum the food stirred the baby she felt it turn in its slumber close now to waking maybe she should fight on a while longer she thought if not for her sake for that of the child she lingered at the table turning the problem over until the mutterings of the proprietor shamed her out onto the street again it as late afternoon and the weather was worsening a woman was singing nearby in italian some tragic aria tears close linda turned from the pain the song carried and set off again in no particular direction as the crowd consumed her a man in a gray suit slipped away from the audience that had gathered around the streetcorner diva sending the youth he was with ahead through the throng to be certain they didnt lose their quarry marchetti regretted having to forsake the show the singing much amused him her voice long ago drowned in alcohol was repeatedly that vital semitone shy of its intended targeta perfect testament to imperfectibilityrendering verdis high art laughable even as it came within sight of transcendence he would have to come back here when the beast had been dispatched listening to that spoiled ecstasy brought him closer to tears that hed been for months and he liked to weep harry stood across third avenue from axels superette and watched the watchers they had gathered in their hundreds in the chill of the deepening night to see what could be seen nor were they disappointed the bodies kept coming out in bags in bundles there was even something in a bucket does anybody know exactly what happened harry asked his fellow spectators a man turned his face ruddy with the cold the guy who ran the place decided to give the stuff away he said grinning at this absurdity and the store was fuckin swamped someone got killed in the crush i heard the trouble started over a can of meat another offered somebody got beaten to death with a can of meat this rumor was contested by a number of others all had versions of events harry was about to try and sort fact from fiction when an exchange to his right diverted him a boy of nine or ten had buttonholed a companion did you smell her he wanted to know the other nodded vigorously gross huh the first ventured smelled better shit came the reply and the two dissolved into conspiratorial laughter harry looked across at the object of their mirth a huge overweight woman underdressed for the season stood on the periphery of the crowd and watched the disaster scene with tiny glittering eyes harry had forgotten the questions he was going to ask the watchers what he remembered clear as yesterday was the way his creams conjured the infernal brethren it wasnt their curses he recalled nor even the deformities they paraded it was the smell off them of burning hair and halitosis of veal left to rot in the sun ignoring the debate around him he started in the direction of the woman she saw him coming the rolls of fat at her neck furrowing as she glanced across at him it was chachat of that harry had no doubt and to prove the point the demon took off at a run the limbs and prodigious buttocks stirred to a fandango with every step by the time harry had cleared his way through the crowd the demon was already turning the corner into ninetyfifth street but its stolen body was not designed for speed and harry rapidly made up the distance between them the lamps were out in several places along the street and when he finally snatched at the demon and heard the sound of tearing the gloom disguised the vile truth for fully five seconds until he realized that chachat had somehow sloughed off its usurped flesh leaving harry holding a great coat of ectoplasm which was already melting like overripe cheese the demon its burden shed was away slim as hope and twice as slippery harry dropped the coat of filth and gave chase shouting hesses syllables as he did so surprisingly chachat stopped in its tracks and turned to harry the eyes looked all ways but heavenward the mouth was wide and attempting laughter it sounded like someone vomiting down an elevator shaft words damour it said mocking hesses syllables you think i can be stopped with words no said harry and blew a hole in chachats abdomen before the demons many eyes had even found the gun bastard it wailed cocksucker and fell to the ground blood the color of piss throbbing from the hole harry sauntered down the street to where it lay it was almost impossible to slay a demon of chachats elevation with bullets but a scar was shame enough amongst their clan two almost unbearable dont it begged when he pointed the gun at its head not the face give me one good reason why not youll need the bullets came the reply harry had expected bargains and threats this answer silenced him theres something going to get loose tonight damour chachat said the blood that was pooling around it had begun to thicken and grow milky like melted wax something wilder that me name it said harry the demon grinned who knows it said its a strange season isnt it long nights clear skies things get born on nights like this dont you find where said harry pressing the gun to chachats nose youre a bully damour it said reprovingly you know that tell me the things eyes grew darker its face seemed to blur south of here id say it replied a hotel the tone of its voice was changing subtly the features losing their solidity harrys trigger finger itched to give the damned thing a wound that would keep it from a mirror for life but it was still talking and he couldnt afford to interrupt its flow on fortyfourth it said between sixthsixth and broadway the voice was indisputably feminine now blue blinds it murmured i can see blue blinds as it spoke the last vestiges of its true features fled and suddenly it was norma who was bleeding on the sidewalk at harrys feet you wouldnt shoot an old lady would you she piped up the trick lasted seconds only but harrys hesitation was all that chachat needed to fold itself between one plane and the next and flit hed lost the creature for the second time in a month and to add discomfort to distress it had begun to snow the small hotel that chachat had described had seen better years even the light that burned in the lobby seemed to tremble on the brink of expiring there was nobody at the desk harry was about to start up the stairs when a young man whose pate was shaved as bald as an egg but for a single kiss curl that was oiled to his scalp stepped out of the gloom and took hold of his arm theres nobody here he informed harry in better days harry might have cracked the egg open with his bare fists and enjoyed doing so tonight he guessed he would come off the worse so he simply said well ill find another hotel then eh kiss curl seemed placated the grip relaxed in the next instant harrys hand found his gun and the gun found kiss curls chin an expression of bewilderment crossed the boys face as he fell back against the wall spitting blood as harry started up the stairs he heard the youth yell darrieux from below neither the shout nor the sound of the struggle had roused any response from the rooms the place was empty it had been elected harry began to comprehend for some purpose other than hostelry as he started along the landing a womans cry begun but never finished came to meet him he stopped dead kiss curl was coming up the stairs behind him two or three at a time ahead someone was dying this couldnt end well harry suspected then the door at the end of the corridor opened and suspicion became plain fact a man in a gray suit was standing on the threshold skinning off a pair of bloodied surgical gloves harry knew him vaguely indeed had begun to sense a terrible pattern in all of this from the moment hed heard kiss curl call his employers name this was darrieux marchetti also called the cankerist one of the whispered order of theological assassins whose directives came from rome or hell or both damour he said harry had to fight the urge to be flattered that he had been remembered what happened here he demanded to know taking a step toward the open door private business the cankerist insisted please no closer candles burned in the little room and by their generous light harry could see the bodies laid out on the bare bed the woman from the house on ridge street and her child both had been dispatched with roman efficiency she protested said marchetti not overly concerned that harry was viewing the results of his handiwork all i needed was the child what was it harry demanded a demon marchetti shrugged well never know he said but at this time of year theres usually something that tries to get in under the wire we like to be safe rather than sorry besides there are thosei number myself amongst themthat believe there is such a thing as a surfeit of messiahs messiahs said harry he looked again at the tiny body there was power there i suspect said marchetti but it could have gone either way be thankful damour your world isnt ready for revelation he looked past harry to the youth who was at the top of the stairs patrice be an angel will you bring the car over im late for mass he threw the gloves back onto the bed youre not above the law said harry oh please the cankerist protested lets have no nonsense its too late at night harry felt a sharp pain at the base of his skull and a trace of heat where blood was running patrice thinks you should go home damour and so do i the knife point was pressed a little deeper yes said marchetti yes said harry he was here said norma when harry called back at the house who eddie axel of axels superette he came through clear as daylight dead of course dead he killed himself in his cell asked me if id seen his soul and what did you say im a telephonist harry i just make the connections i dont pretend to understand the metaphysics she picked up the bottle of brandy harry had set on the table beside her chair how sweet of you she said sit down drink another time norma when im not so tired he went to the door by the way he said you were right there was something on ridge street where is it now gonehome and chachat still out there somewhere in a foul temper manhattans seen worse harry it was little consolation but harry muttered his agreement as he closed the door the snow was coming on more heavily all the time he stood on the step and watched the way the flakes spiraled in the lamplight no two he had read somewhere were ever alike when such variety was available to the humble snowflake could he be surprised that events had such unpredictable faces each moment was its own master he mused as he put his head between the blizzards teeth and he would have to take whatever comfort he could find in the knowledge that between this chilly hour and dawn there were innumerable such momentsblind maybe and wild and hungrybut all at least eager to be born harry is an interesting combination he springs out of the film noir detective tradition but he also has his feet and hands deep in horror territory like me he feels the tension between the ordinary world and the supernatural worldclive barker
