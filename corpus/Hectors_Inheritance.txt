 hectors inheritance or the boys of smith institute horatio alger jr author of eric train boy young acrobat only an irish boy bound to rise the young outlaw driven from home etc new york hectors inheritance chapter i mr roscoe receives two letters mr roscoe rang the bell and in answer a servant entered the library where he sat before a large and commodious desk has the mail yet arrived he asked yes sir john has just come back from the village go at once and bring me the letters and papers if there are any john bowed and withdrew mr roscoe walked to the window and looked thoughtfully out upon a smooth luxuriant lawn and an avenue of magnificent trees through which carriages were driven to what was popularly known as castle roscoe everything even to the luxuriously appointed room in which he sat indicated wealth and the ease which comes from affluence mr roscoe looked around him with exultation and all this may be mine he said to himself if i am only bold what is it old pindar says boldness is the beginning of victory i have forgotten nearly all i learned in school but i remember that there is some risk perhaps but not much and i owe something to my son he was interrupted by the entrance of the servant with a small leather bag which was used to hold mail matter going from or coming to the house the servant unlocked the bag and emptied the contents on the desk there were three or four papers and two letters it was the last which attracted mr roscoes attention we will take the liberty of looking over mr roscoes shoulder as he reads the first it ran as follows dear siri am in receipt of your favor asking my terms for boarding pupils for pupils of fifteen or over i charge five hundred dollars per year which is not a large sum considering the exceptional advantages presented by inglewood school my pupils are from the best families and enjoy a liberal table moreover i employ competent teachers and guarantee rapid progress when the student is of good natural capacity and willing to work i think you will agree with me that it is unwise to economize when the proper training of a youth is in question and that a cheap school is little better than no school at all i have only to add that i shall be most happy to receive your young nephew if you decide to send him to me and will take personal pains to promote his advancement i remain dear sir your obedient servant dionysius kadix mr roscoe threw the letter down upon the desk with an impatient gesture five hundred dollars a year he exclaimed what can the man be thinking of why when i went to school twentyfive years since less than half this sum was charged the man is evidently rapacious let me see what this other letter says the second letter was contained in a yellow envelope of cheap texture and was much more plebeian in appearance than the first again we will look over mr roscoes shoulder and read what it contains it was postmarked smithville and the envelope was disfigured by a blot it commenced dear sirit gives me pleasure to answer your inquiries respecting my school i have about fifty pupils part of whom say onethird are boarders though i say it myself it will be hard to find any school where more thorough instruction is given i look upon my pupils as my children and treat them as such my system of government is therefore kind and parental and my pupils are often homesick in vacation longing for the time to come when they can return to their studies at smith institute it is the dearest wish of mrs smith and myself to make our young charges happy and to advance them by pleasant roads over flowery meads to the inner courts of knowledge humbug muttered mr roscoe i understand what all that means he continued i hope you will not consider three hundred dollars per annum too much for such parental care considering the present high price of provisions it is really as low a price as we can afford to receive i shall be glad if you consider my letter favorable and decide to place your nephew under my charge yours respectfully socrates smith a m that is more reasonable said mr roscoe to himself as he laid down the letter three hundred dollars i consider a fair price at any rate i do not propose to pay any more for hector i suppose the table is plain enough but i dont believe in pampering the appetites of boys if he were the master of roscoe hall as he thinks he is there might be some propriety in it but upon that head i shall soon undeceive him i will let him understand that i am the proprietor of the estate and that he is only a dependent on my bounty i wonder how he will take it i dare say he will make a fuss but he shall soon be made to understand that it is of no use now to answer these letters mr roscoe sat down in a luxurious armchair and drawing pen and paper toward him wrote first to dr radix i subjoin the letter as it throws some light upon the character of the writer roscoe hall sept th dr dionysius radix my dear siri am in receipt of your letter of the th instant answering my inquiries in regard to your school let me say at once that i find your terms too high five hundred dollars a year for forty weeks board and schooling seems to me an exorbitant price to ask really at this rate education will soon become a luxury open only to the wealthy you are probably under a misapprehension in reference to my young ward nephew he is not in a strict sense of the term he was adopted not legally but practically by my brother when he was only a year old and his origin has been concealed from him my brother being childless has allowed him to suppose that he was his own son undoubtedly he meant to provide for him in his will but as often happens put off willmaking till it was too late the estate therefore goes to me and the boy is unprovided for this does not so much matter since i am willing to educate him and give him a fair start in life if he acts in a manner to suit me i do not however feel called upon to pay an exorbitant price for his tuition and therefore shall be obliged to forego placing him at inglewood school yours etc allan roscoe when this letter is sent i shall have taken the decisive step thought mr roscoe i must then adhere to my story at whatever cost now for the other his reply to the letter of socrates smith a m was briefer but likely to be more satisfactory to the recipient it ran thus socrates smith a m dear siryour letter is at hand and i find it on the whole satisfactory the price you chargethree hundred dollars per annum is about right i hope you are a firm disciplinarian i do not want hector too much indulged or pampered though he may expect it my poor brother having been indulgent to excess let me add by the bye that hector is not my nephew though i may inadvertently have mentioned him as such and had no real claims upon my brother though he has been brought up in that belief he was adopted in an informal way by my brother when he was but an infant under the circumstances i am willing to take care of him and prepare him to earn his own living when his education is completed you may expect to see me early next week i will bring the boy with me and enter him at once as a pupil in your school yours etc allan roscoe there that clinches it said mr roscoe in a tone of satisfaction now for an interview with the boy chapter ii resenting an insult a stones throw from the mansion was a neat and spacious carriage house the late master of castle roscoe had been fond of driving and kept three horses and two carriages one of the latter was an oldfashioned coach while there was besides a light buggy which hector was accustomed to consider his own it was he generally who used this for his father preferred to take a driver and generally took an airing either alone or with hector in the more stately carriage drawn by two horses hector walked across the lawn and entered the carriage house where edward the coachman was washing the carriage as the former is to be our hero we may pause to describe him he was fifteen slenderly but strongly made with a clear skin and dark eyes and a straightforward look he had a winning smile that attracted all who saw it but his face could assume a different expression if need be there were strong lines about his mouth that indicated calm resolution and strength of purpose he was not a boy who would permit himself to be imposed upon but was properly tenacious of his rights as he entered the carriage house he looked about him in some surprise where is the buggy edward he asked master guy is driving out in it how is that said hector doesnt he know that it is mine he might at least have asked whether i intended to use it that is what i told him and what did he say that it was just as much his as yours and perhaps more so what could he mean he said his father had promised to give it to him promised to give him my buggy exclaimed hector his eyes flashing its a shame master hector so it is said edward sympathetically he had known hector since he was a boy of five and liked him far better than guy who was a newcomer and a boy disposed to domineer over those whom he considered his inferiors i dont intend to submit to it said hector trying ineffectually to curb his anger i dont blame you master hector but im afraid you will have a hard time as your uncle is your guardian of course he has power over you and he thinks everything of that boy of his though to my mind he is an unmannerly cub i dont know how much power he has over me but he mustnt expect me to play second fiddle to his son i am willing that guy should enjoy as many privileges as i do though the estate is mine but he mustnt interfere with my rights thats right master hector why dont you speak to your uncle about it i would if i were you so i will if it is necessary i will speak to guy first and that may be sufficient i dont want to enter complaint against him if i can help it you didnt see master guy ride out did you no i was reading if i had seen him i would have stopped him i am afraid it wouldnt have done any good do you mean that he would have taken the buggy in spite of me asked hector indignantly i think he would have tried to tell the truth master hector i refused to get the buggy ready for him till he brought out a paper from his father commanding me to do it then of course i had no choice hector was staggered by this have you got the paper he asked yes answered edward fumbling in his vest pocket he drew out a small scrap of notepaper on which was written my son guy has my permission to ride out in the buggy you will obey me rather than hector this was signed allan roscoe so it seems my uncle is the trespasser said hector it is he who takes the responsibility i will go and speak to him at once wait a minute there comes master guy returning from his ride you can have it out with him first in fact hector had only to look down the avenue to see the rapid approach of the buggy guy held the reins and was seated in the drivers seat with all the air of a master the sight aggravated hector and not without reason he waited until guy flinging the reins to edward leaped from the buggy then he thought it time to speak guy he said calmly it seems to me that you owe me an apology oh i do do i sneered guy what for let me ask you have driven out in my buggy without asking my permission oh its your buggy is it said guy with another sneer of course it is you know that as well as i do i dont know it at all then i inform you of it i dont want to be selfish i am willing that you should ride out in it occasionally but i insist upon your asking my permission guy listened to these words with a sneer upon his face he was about the same age and size as hector but his features were mean and insignificant and there was a shifty look in his eye that stamped him as unreliable he did not look like the roscoes though in many respects he was in disposition and character similar to his father it strikes me he said with an unpleasant smile that youre taking a little too much upon yourself hector roscoe the buggy is no more yours than mine what do you say edward said hector appealing to the coachman i say that the buggy is yours and the horse is yours and so i told master guy but he wouldnt take no notice of it do you hear that guy yes i do and thats what i think of it answered guy snapping his fingers my father gave me permission to ride out in it and ive got just as much right to it as you and perhaps more you know better guy said hector indignantly and i warn you not to interfere with my rights hereafter suppose i do sneered guy then i shall be under the necessity of giving you a lesson said hector calmly you will will you youll give me a lesson repeated guy nodding vigorously who are you id like to know if you dont know i can tell you tell me then i am hector roscoe the owner of roscoe hall whether your father is to be my guardian or not i dont know but there are limits to the power of a guardian and i hope he wont go too far hear the boy talk said guy contemptuously i wish to treat my uncle with becoming respect but he is a newcomer here i never saw him till three months since and he has no right to come here and take from me all my privileges we can all live at peace together and i hope we shall but he must treat me well you are quite sure roscoe castle belongs to you are you hector thats the law father left no will and so the estate comes to me ho ho laughed guy with malicious glee if you only knew what i know you wouldnt crow quite so loud its a splendid joke there was something in this that attracted hectors attention though he was not disposed to attach much importance to what guy said if i only knew what you know he repeated yes thats what i said what is it youll know it soon enough and i can tell you one thing itll surprise you itll take down your pride a peg or two hector stared at his cousin in unaffected surprise what could guy possibly mean had his father perhaps made a will and left the estate to some one else his uncle for example was this the meaning of guys malicious mirth i dont know to what you refer he said but if its anything that is of importance to me i ought to know it what is it go and ask father said guy with a tantalizing grin i will answered hector and without delay he turned to enter the house but guy had not exhausted his malice he was in a hurry to triumph over hector whom he disliked heartily i dont mind telling you myself he said you are not what you suppose youre a lowborn beggar he had no sooner uttered these words than hector resented the insult seizing the whip from guy he grasped him by the collar flung him to the ground and lashed him with it there said he with eyes aflame take that guy roscoe and look out how you insult me in future guy rose slowly from the ground pale with fury and as he brushed the dust from his clothes ejaculated youll pay dearly for this hector ill take the consequences said hector as coldly as his anger would allow now i shall go to your father and ask the meaning of this chapter iii hector learns a secret hector entered the library with some impetuosity usually he was quiet and orderly but he had been excited by the insinuations of guy and he was impatient to know what he meant if he meant anything allan roscoe looked up and remarked with slight sarcasm this is not a bear garden hector you appear to think you are on the playground judging by your hasty motions i beg your pardon uncle said hector who never took amiss a rebuke which he thought deserved i suppose i forgot myself being excited i beg your pardon what is the cause of your excitement asked mr roscoe surveying the boy keenly guy has said something that i dont understand he must have said something very profound then returned allan roscoe with light raillery indeed uncle allan it is no laughing matter said hector earnestly then let me hear what it is he intimates that he knows something that would let down my pride a peg or two he hints that i am not the heir of castle roscoe the boy used the term by which the house was usually known allan roscoe knit his brow in pretended vexation inconsiderate boy he murmured why need he say this but said hector startled is it true my boy said his uncle with simulated feeling my son has spoken to you of a secret which i would willingly keep from you if i could yet perhaps it is as well that you should be told now told what exclaimed hector quite at sea can you bear to hear hector that it is indeed true you are not the owner of this estate who is then ejaculated the astonished boy i am and guy after me what did my father leave the estate away from me i thought he did not leave a will nor did he then how can anyone else except his son inherit your question is a natural one if you were his son you would inherit under the law if i were his son repeated hector slowly his head swimming what do you mean by that of course i am your brothers son it is very painful for me to tell hector it will be distressing for you to hear no tie of blood connects you with the late owner of castle roscoe i dont believe you uncle allan said hector bluntly of course therefore i am not your uncle added allan roscoe dryly i beg your pardon i should have said mr allan roscoe said hector bowing proudly for his heart was sore and he was deeply indignant with the man who sat smooth and sleek in his fathers chair harrowing up his feelings without himself being ruffled that is immaterial call me uncle if you like since the truth is understood but i must explain i would like to know what is your authority for so surprising a statement mr roscoe you cannot expect me to believe that i have been deceived all my life i make the statement on your fathers authority i should say on my brothers authority can you prove it mr roscoe i can i will presently put into your hands a letter written me by my brother some months since which explains the whole matter to save you suspense however i will recapitulate where were you born in california that is probably true it was there that my brother found you found me perhaps that is not the word my brother and his wife were boarding in sacramento in the winter of in the same boarding house was a widow with a child of some months old you were that child your mother died suddenly and it was ascertained that she left nothing her child was therefore left destitute it was a fine promising boy give me credit for the compliment and my brother having no children of his own proposed to his wife to adopt it she was fond of children and readily consented no formalities were necessary for there was no one to claim you you were at once taken in charge by my brother and his wife therefore and very soon they came to look upon you with as much affection as if you were their own child they wished you to consider them your real parents and to you the secret was never made known nor was it known to the world when my brother returned to this state three years after not one of his friends doubted that the little hector was his own boy when you were six years old your mother died that is my brothers wife all the more perhaps because he was left alone my brother became attached to you and i think he came to love you as much as if you were his own son i think he did said hector with emotion never was there a kinder more indulgent father yet he was not your father said allan roscoe with sharp emphasis so you say mr roscoe so my brother says in his letter to me do you think it probable that with all this affection for me he would have left me penniless asked the boy no it was his intention to make a will by that will he would no doubt have provided for you in a satisfactory manner but i think my poor brother had a superstitious fear of will making lest it might hasten death at any rate he omitted it till it was too late it was a cruel omission if your story is a true one your my brother did what he could to remedy matters in his last sickness when too weak to sign his name he asked me as the legal heir of his estate to see that you were well provided for he wished me to see your education finished and i promised to do so i could see that this promise relieved his mind of one thing you may be assured hector he never lost his affection for you thank heaven for that murmured the boy who had been deeply and devotedly attached to the man whom all his life long he had looked upon as his father i can only add hector said mr roscoe that i feel for your natural disappointment it is indeed hard to be brought up to regard yourself as the heir of a great estate and to make the discovery that you have been mistaken i dont mind that so much mr roscoe said hector slowly it is the hardest thing to think of myself as having no claim upon one whom i have loved as a father to think myself as a boy of unknown parentage but he added suddenly i have it only on your word why should i believe it i will give you conclusive proof hector read this allan roscoe took from his pocket a letter without an envelope one glance served to show hector that it was in the handwriting of his late father or at any rate in a handwriting surprisingly like it he began to read it with feverish haste the letter need not find a place here the substance of it had been accurately given by mr allan roscoe apparently it corroborated his every statement the boy looked up from its perusal his face pale and stricken you see that i have good authority for my statement said mr roscoe i cant understand it said hector slowly i need only add said mr roscoe apparently relieved by the revelation that my brother did not repose confidence in me in vain i accept as a sacred charge the duty he imposed upon me i shall provide for you and look after your education i wish to put you in a way to prepare yourself for a useful and honorable career as a first step i intend on monday next to place you in an excellent boarding school where you will have exceptional privileges hector listened but his mind was occupied by sad thoughts and he made no comment i have even selected the school with great care said mr roscoe it is situated at smithville and is under the charge of socrates smith a m a learned and distinguished educator you may go now i will speak with you on this subject later hector bowed after what he had heard his interest in other matters was but faint i shall be glad to get him out of the house thought allan roscoe i never liked him chapter iv a skirmish hector walked out of the house in a state of mental bewilderment not easily described was he not hector roscoe after all had he been all his life under a mistake if this story were true who was he who were his parents what was his name why had the man whom he had supposed to be his father not imparted to him this secret he had always been kind and indulgent he had never appeared to regard the boy as an alien in blood but as a dearly loved son yet if he had after all left him unprovided for he had certainly treated hector with great cruelty i wont believe it said hector to himself i wont so wrong my dear fathers memory at the bidding of this man whose interest it is to trump up this story since he and his son become the owners of a great estate in my place just then guy advanced toward hector with a malicious smile upon his face he knew very well what a blow poor hector had received for he was in his fathers confidence and he was mean enough and malicious enough to rejoice at it whats the matter with you hector he asked with a grin you look as if you had lost your last friend hector stopped short and regarded guy fixedly do you know what your father has been saying to me he asked well i can guess answered guy ho ho its a great joke that you have all the time fancied yourself the heir of castle roscoe when you have no claim to it at all i am the heir he added drawing himself up proudly and you are a poor dependent and a nobody its funny perhaps you wont think it so funny after this said hector coolly exasperated beyond endurance as he spoke he drew off and in an instant guy measured his length upon the greensward guy rose his face livid with passion in a frame of mind far from funny he clinched his fists and looked at hector as if he wished to annihilate him youll pay for this he screamed youll repent it bitterly you poor nameless dependent lowborn very likely hold there said hector advancing resolutely and sternly facing the angry boy be careful what you say if this story of your fathers is true which i dont believe you might have the decency to let me alone even if you dont sympathize with me if you dare to say or hint anything against my birth ill treat you worse than i have yet youll suffer for this almost shrieked guy i am ready to suffer now if you are able to make me said hector come on and well settle it now but guy had no desire for the contest to which he was invited he had a wholesome fear of hectors strong muscular arms aided as they were by some knowledge of boxing hector had never taken regular lessons but a private tutor whom his father had employed a graduate of yale had instructed him in the rudiments of the manly art of selfdefense and hector was very well able to take care of himself against any boy of his own size and strength in size guy was his equal but in strength he was quite inferior this guy knew full well and angry as he was he by no means lost sight of prudence i dont choose to dirty my hands with you he said i shall tell my father and it would serve you right if he sent you adrift in hectors present mood he would not perhaps have cared much if this threat had been carried into execution but he was not altogether reckless and he felt that it was best to remain under mr roscoes protection until he had had time to investigate the remarkable story which he suspected his reputed uncle had trumped up to serve his own interests tell your father if you like said hector quietly i dont know whether he will sustain you or not in your insults but if he does then i shall have two opponents instead of one does that mean that you will attack my father demanded guy hoping for an affirmative answer as it would help him to prejudice his father against our hero no answered hector smiling i dont apprehend there will be any necessity for he wont insult me as you have done guy lost notime in seeking his father and laying the matter before him inveighing against hector with great bitterness so he knocked you down did he guy asked allan roscoe thoughtfully yes he took me unawares or he couldnt have done it answered guy a little ashamed at the avowal what did you do i i told him he should suffer for it why did he attack you it was on account of something i said what was it guy reluctantly answered this question and with correctness it was your fault for speaking to him wrhen he was feeling sore at making a painful discovery do you justify him in pitching into me like a big brute asked guy hastily no but still i think it was natural under the circumstances you should have kept out of his way and let him alone wont you punish him for attacking me demanded guy indignantly i will speak to him on the subject said allan roscoe and will tell him my opinion of his act then shant i be revenged upon him asked guy disappointed listen guy said his father is it no punishment that the boy is stripped of all his possessions while you step into his place henceforth he will be dependent upon me and later upon you he has been hurled down from his proud place as owner of castle roscoe and i have taken his place as you will hereafter do yes said guy gleefully it will be a proud day when i become master of the estate allan roscoe was not a specially sensitive man but this remark of his son jarred upon him you seem to forget guy that you do not succeed till i am dead yes i suppose so answered guy slowly it almost seems as if you were in a hurry for me to die i didnt mean that but its natural to suppose that i shall live longer than you do isnt it i suppose so returned allan roscoe shortly of course thats what i mean then since you are so much better off than hector you had better be more considerate and leave him to get over his disappointment as well as he can shall i send in hector to see you asked guy as he at length turned to leave the room yes youre to go in to my father said guy reappearing on the lawn hes going to give it to you hector anticipated some such summons and he had remained in the same spot too proud to have it supposed that he shrank from the interview with a firm resolute step he entered the presence of allan roscoe i hear you wish to see me mr roscoe he said manfully yes hector guy has come to me with complaints of you if he says i knocked him down for insulting me he has told you the truth said hector sturdily that was the substance of what he said though he did not admit the insult but for that i should not have attacked him i do not care to interfere in boys quarrels except in extreme cases said mr roscoe i am afraid guy was aggravatiag and you were unnecessarily violent it doesnt seem to me so said hector so i regard it i have warned him not to add by taunts to the poignancy of your disappointment i request you to remember that guy is my son and that i am disposed to follow my brothers directions and provide for and educate you hector bowed and retired he went out with a more favorable opinion of allan roscoe who had treated the difficulty in a reasonable manner allan roscoe looked after him as he went out i hate that boy he said to himself i temporize from motives of policy but i mean to tame his haughty spirit yet chapter v preparing to leave home allan roscoes remonstrance with the two boys had the effect of keeping the peace between them for the remainder of the week guy did not think it prudent to taunt hector unless backed up by his father and he felt that the change in their relative positions was satisfaction enough at present besides his father in a subsequent conversation had told guy that it was his purpose to place hector in a boarding school where the discipline would be strict and where he would be thrashed if he proved rebellious i shall tell mr smith he added that the boy needs a strong hand and that i am not only perfectly willing that he should be punished whenever occasion may call for it but really desire it good good commended guy gleefully i hope old smithll lay it on good i presume he will said allan roscoe smiling in sympathy with his sons exuberance i am told by a man who knows him that he is a tall man strong enough to keep order and determined to do it i should like to be there to see hectors first flogging remarked the amiable guy id rather see it than go to the theater any time i dont see how you can unless you also enter the school no thank you answered guy no boarding school for me that isnt my idea of enjoyment id rather stay at home with you hector wont be here to interfere with my using his horse and buggy they are his no longer i give them to you thank you father said guy very much gratified but i would rather you would not use them till after hector is gone it might disturb him thats just why i want to do it but it might make trouble he might refuse to go to school youd make him go wouldnt you father yes but i wish to avoid forcible measures if possible come guy its only till monday then hector will be out of the way and you can do as you please without fear of interference all right father ill postpone my fun till he is out of the way youll go with him wont you yes guy just tell old smith how to treat him tell him to show him no mercy if he doesnt behave himself you seem to dislike hector very much you shouldnt feel so it isnt christian guy looked at his father queerly out of the corner of his eye he understood him better than allan roscoe supposed i hope you wont insist on my loving him father he said i leave that to you i only wish you to avoid coming into collision with him as for love that is something not within our power will you be ready to go with me to boarding school on monday morning hector asked allan roscoe on saturday afternoon yes sir indeed hector felt that it would be a relief to get away from the house which he had been taught to look upon as his first by right of inheritance and later as actual owner as long as he remained he was unpleasantly reminded of the great loss he had experienced again his relations with guy were unfriendly and he knew that if they were permanently together it wouldnt be long before there would be another collision though in such a case he was sure to come off victorious he did not care to contend especially as no advantage could come of it in the end of the boarding school kept by mr socrates smith he had never heard but felt that he would at any rate prefer to find himself amid new scenes if the school were a good one he meant to derive benefit from it for he was fond of books and study and thought school duties no task i have carefully selected a school for you continued allan roscoe because i wish to follow out my poor brothers wishes to the letter a good education will fit you to maintain yourself and attain a creditable station in life which is very important since you will have to carve your own future there was no objection to make to all this still it did grate upon hectors feelings to be so often reminded of his penniless position when till recently he had regarded himself and had been regarded by others as a boy of large property smithville was accessible by railroad being on the same line as the town of plympton in which roscoe castle was situated there was a train starting at seven odock which reached smithville at halfpast eight this was felt to be the proper train to take as it would enable hector to reach school before the morning session began allan roscoe who was not an early riser made an effort to rise in time and succeeded in truth he was anxious to get hector out of the house it might be that the boys presence was a tacit reproach it might be that he had contracted a dislike for him at any rate when hector descended to the breakfast room he found mr roscoe already there you are in time hector said mr roscoe i dont know how early they will get up at school but i hope it wont be earlier than this i have no objection to early rising said hector i have said allan roscoe gaping i am sorry to have inconvenienced you said hector politely i could have gone to school alone no doubt but i wished an interview with mr socrates smith myself i look upon myself in the light of your guardian though you are not my nephew as was originally supposed id give a good deal to know whether this is true thought hector fixing his eyes attentively upon his uncles face i have written uncle inadvertently that being the character in which mr roscoe appeared to the world by the way hector said allan roscoe there is one matter which we have not yet settled what is that sir about your name my name is hector roscoe i beg your pardon assuming by brothers communication to be true and i think you will not question his word you have no claim to the name to what name have i a claim then asked hector pointedly to the name of your father the last name i mean i have no objection to your retaining the name of hector what was the name of my father asked the boy ahem my brother did not mention that in his letter quite an omission i must observe then it is clear that he meant to have me retain his own name said hector decisively that does not follow as i know no other name to which i have a claim i shall certainly keep the name of the kindest friend i ever had whether he was my father or not said hector firmly allan roscoe looked annoyed really he said i think this illjudged very illjudged it will lead to misapprehension it will deceive people into the belief that you are a real roscoe i dont know but i am answered hector with a calm look of defiance which aggravated allan roscoe have i not told you you are not he said frowning you have but you have not proved it said hector i am surprised that you should cling to a foolish delusion you are only preparing trouble for yourself if my word is not sufficient you are an interested party this story if true gives you my property at any rate you may take your fathers i mean my brothers word for it if he had told me so i would believe it said hector you have it in black and white in the paper i showed you what more do you want i want to be sure that that document is genuine however i wont argue the question now i have only been giving you my reasons for keeping the name i have always regarded as mine allan roscoe thought it best to drop the subject but the boys persistency disturbed him chapter vi smith institute socrates smith a m was not always known by the philosophic name by which he challenged the worlds respect as a man of learning and distinguished attainments when a boy in his teens and an academy student he was known simply as shadrach smith his boy companions used to address him familiarly as shad it was clear that no pedagogue could retain the respect of his pupils who might readily be metamorphosed into old shad by the advice of a brother preacher he dropped the plebeian name and bloomed forth as socrates smith a m i may say in confidence that no one knew from what college mr smith obtained the degree of master of arts he always evaded the question himself saying that it was given him by a western university causa honoris it might be or it might not at any rate he was allowed to wear the title since no one thought it worth while to make the necessary examination into its genuineness nor again had anyone been able to discover at what college the distinguished socrates had studied in truth he had never even entered college but he had offered himself as a candidate for admission to a college in ohio and been rejected this did not however prevent his getting up a school and advertising to instruct others in the branches of learning of which his own knowledge was so incomplete he was able to hide his own deficiencies having generally in his employ some college graduate whose poverty compelled him to accept the scanty wages which socrates doled out to him these young men were generally poor scholars in more than one sense of the word as mr smith did not care to pay the high salary demanded by a firstclass scholar mr smith was shrewd enough not to attempt to instruct the classes in advanced classics or mathematics as he did not care to have his deficiencies understood by his pupils it pleased him best to sit in state and rule the school administering reproofs and castigations where he thought fit and best of all to manage the finances though his price was less than that of many other schools his profits were liberal as he kept down expenses his table was exceedingly frugal as his boarding pupils could have testified and the salaries he paid to under teachers were pitifully small so it was that year by year socrates smith a m found himself growing richer while his teachers grew more shabby and his pupils rarely became fat allan roscoe took a carriage from the depot to the school arrived at the gate he descended and hector followed him the school building was a long rambling irregular structure of no known order of architecture bearing some resemblance to a factory the ornament of architecture mr smith did not regard he was strictly of a utilitarian cast of mind so long as the institute as he often called it afforded room for the school and scholars he did not understand what more was wanted is mr smith at leisure mr roscoe asked of a barearm servant girl who answered the bell i guess hes in his office was the reply take him this card said mr roscoe the girl inspected the card with some curiosity and carried it to the eminent principal when socrates smith read upon the card the name allan roscoe and penciled in the corner with a pupil he said briskly bring the gentleman in at once bridget as mr roscoe entered mr smith beamed upon him genially it was thus he always received those who brought to him new scholars as he always asked half a terms tuition and board in advance every such visitor represented to him so much ready cash and for ready cash socrates had a weakness i am glad to see you mr roscoe said the learned principal advancing to meet his visitor and this is the young lad dear me he is very well grown and looks like he was fond of his books this was not exactly the way in which a learned scholar might be expected to talk but mr smiths speech was not always elegant or even grammatically correct i believe he is reasonably fond of study said mr roscoe hector this is your future instructor prof socrates smith at the name of professor which he much affected socrates smith looked positively benignant my young friend he said we will try to make you happy smith institute is a regular beehive full of busy workers who are preparing themselves for the duties and responsibilities of life i aim to be a father to my pupils and mrs smith is a mother to them i am truly glad to receive you into my happy family hector scanned attentively the face of his new teacher he was not altogether prepossessed in his favor that the reader may judge whether he had reason to be let me describe mr smith he was a trifle over six feet in height with yellowish sandy hair high cheek bones a rough and mottled skin a high but narrow forehead a pair of eyes somewhat like those of a ferret long ungainly limbs and a shambling walk a coat of rusty black with very long tails magnified his apparent height and nothing that he wore seemed made for him perhaps as the first socrates was said to have been the homeliest of all the athenians it was fitting that the man who assumed his name should also have the slightest possible claim to beauty he may be a learned man thought hector but he is certainly plain enough it is well that he has something to compensate for his looks i hope you are glad to come here my boy said socrates affably i sincerely trust that you will be contented at the institute i hope so too said hector but he evidently spoke doubtfully i should like a little conversation with you professor smith said allan roscoe i dont know that it is necessary to keep hector here during our interview socrates took the hint he rang a hand bell and a lank boy of fifteen appeared wilkius said mr smith this is a new scholar hector roscoe take him to the playground and introduce him to mr crabb all right sir come along this last was addressed to hector who went out with the new boy i thought it best to speak with you briefly about hector professor smith commenced allan roscoe very appropriate and gratifying mr roscoe i can assure you he will be happy here i dare say returned mr roscoe carelessly i wish to guard you against misinterpreting my wishes i dont want the boy pampered or too much indulged we never pamper our boarding pupils said socrates and it is quite certain that he spoke the truth it spoils boys to be too well treated so it does said socrates eagerly plain wholesome diet without luxury and a kind but strict discipline such are the features of smith institute quite right and judicious professor i may remark that the boy though reared in luxury by my brother is really penniless you dont say so yes he is solely dependent upon my generosity i propose however to give him a good education at my own expense and prepare him to earn his living in some useful way kind philanthropist exclaimed socrates he ought indeed to be grateful i doubt if he will said mr roscoe shrugging his shoulders he has a proud spirit and a high idea of his own position though he is of unknown parentage and has nothing of his own indeed i merely wish to say that you do not need to treat him as if he were my nephew it is best to be strict with him and make him conform to the rules i will indeed mr roscoe would that all guardians of youth were as judicious your wishes shall be regarded after a little more conversation allan roscoe took his leave so under auspices not the most pleasant hectors school life began chapter vii the tyrant of the playground under the guidance of the lank boy named wilkins hector left mr smiths office and walked to a barrenlooking plot of ground behind the house which served as a playground for the pupils of smith institute wilkins scanned the new arrival closely i say roscoe he commenced what made you come here why do boys generally come to school returned hector because they have to i suppose answered wilkins i thought they came to study oh youre one of that sort are you asked wilkins curiously i hope to learn something here youll get over that soon answered wilkins in the tone of one who could boast of a large experience i hope not i shall want to leave school if i find i cant learn here who is it that brought you here your father no indeed answered hector quickly for he had no desire to be considered the son of allan roscoe uncle then he is my guardian answered hector briefly they were by this time in the playground some dozen boys were playing baseball they were of different ages and sizes ranging from ten to nineteen the oldest and largest bore such a strong personal resemblance to socrates smith that hector asked if he were his son no answered wilkins he is old socks nephew who is old sock smith of course his name is socrates you know dont let him catch you calling him that though what sort of a fellow is this nephew asked hector hes a bully he bosses the boys its best to keep on the right side of jim oh is it inquired hector smiling slightly well i should say so suppose you dont hell give you a thrashing does his uncle allow that yes i think he rather likes it dont the boys resist it wont do any good you see jims bigger than any of us hector took a good look at this redoubtable jim smith he was rather loosely made painfully homely and about five feet nine inches in height nothing more need be said as in appearance he closely resembled his uncle jim smith soon gave hector an opportunity of verifying the description given of him by wilkins the boy at the bat had struck a ball to the extreme boundary of the field the fielder at that point didnt go so fast as jim who was pitcher thought satisfactory and he called out in a rough brutal tone if you dont go quicker archer ill kick you all round the field hector looked at wilkins inquiringly does he mean that he asked yes he does does he ever make such a brute of himself often and the boys allow it they cant help it so it seems you have a tyrant of the school thats just it isnt there any boy among you to teach the fellow better manners you must be cowards to submit oh youll find out soon that you must submit too said wilkins hector smiled you dont know me yet he said what could you do against jim hes three or four inches taller than you how old are you i shall be sixteen next month and he is nineteen that may be but hed better not try to order me round youll sing a different tune in a day or two said wilkins by this time jim smith had observed the new arrival whats that youve got with you wilkins he demanded pausing in his play the new boy whos he his name is roscoe ho hasnt he got any other name asked jim meaningly wilkins had forgotten the new arrivals first name and said so whats your name roscoe asked jim in the tone of a superior hector resented this tone and though he had no objection under ordinary circumstances to answering the question he did not choose to gratify his present questioner i dont happen to have a card with me he answered coldly oh thats your answer is it retorted jim scenting insubordination with undisguised pleasure for he always liked the task of subduing a new boy yes i guess you dont know who i am said jim blustering oh yes i do well who am i then the bully of the school i should suppose from your style of behavior do you hear that boys demanded jim in a theatrical tone turning to the other boys there was a little murmur in response but whether of approval or reprobation it was not easy to judge that boy calls me a bully he actually has the audacity to insult me what do you say to that the boys looked uneasy possibly in their secret hearts they admired the audacity that jim complained of but seeing the difference between the two boys in size and apparent strength it did not seem to them prudent to espouse the side of hector dont you think i ought to teach him a lesson yes cried several of the smaller boys who stood in awe of the bully hector smiled slightly but did not seem in the least intimidated jim said wilkins the boys guardian is inside with your uncle this was meant as a warning and received as such a boys guardian is presumed to be his friend and it would not be exactly prudent while the guardian was closeted with the principal to make an assault upon the pupil very well said jim well postpone roscoes case this afternoon will do as well come boys let us go on with the game what made you speak to jim in that way expostulated wilkins im afraid youve got into hot water didnt i tell the truth about him yes answered wilkins cautiously but youve made an enemy of him i was sure to do that sooner or later said hector unconcernedly it might as well be now as any time do you know what hell do this afternoon what will he do hell give you a thrashing without asking my permission asked hector smiling youre a queer boy of course he wont trouble himself about that you dont seem to mind it he continued eying hector curiously oh no perhaps you think jim cant hurt i know better than that did he ever thrash you then half a dozen times why didnt you tell his uncle it would be no use jim would tell his story and old sock would believe him but heres mr crabb the usher the man i was to introduce you to hector looked up and saw advancing a young man dressed in rusty black with a meek and longsuffering expression as one who was used to being browbeaten he was very shortsighted and wore eyeglasses chapter xiii in the schoolroom mr crabb said wilkins this is the new scholar roscoe mr smith asked me to bring him to you ah indeed said crabb adjusting his glasses which seemed to sit uneasily on his nose i hope you are well roscoe thank you sir my health is good the schoolbell will ring directly perhaps you had better come into the schoolroom and select a desk very well sir are you a classical scholar roscoe yes sir and how far may you have gone now queried crabb i was reading the fifth book of virgil when i left off study really you are quite a scholar i suppose you dont know any greek i was in the second book of the anabasis you will go into the first class then i hope you will become one of the ornaments of the institute thank you is the first class under mr smith no i teach the first class said crabb with a modest cough i thought the principal usually took the first class himself mr smith comes into the room occasionally and supervises but he has too much business on hand to teach regularly himself is mr smith a good scholar asked hector ahem answered mr crabb evidently embarrassed i presume so you should not ask ahem irrelevant questions in fact mr crabb had serious doubts as to the fact assumed he knew that whenever a pupil went to the principal to ask a question in latin or greek he was always referred to crabb himself or some other teacher this to be sure proved nothing but in an unguarded moment mr smith had ventured to answer a question himself and his answer was ludicrously incorrect the schoolroom was a moderatesized drearylooking room with another smaller room opening out of it which was used as a separate recitation room here is a vacant desk said mr crabb pointing out one centrally situated i think that will do who sits at the next desk mr smiths nephew oh that big bully i saw on the playground hush said crabb apprehensively mr smith would not like to have you speak so of his nephew so mr crabb is afraid of the cad soliloquized hector i suppose i may think what i please about him he added smiling pleasantly yees of course but master roscoe let me advise you to be prudent is he in your class yes is he much of a scholar i dont think he cares much for latin and greek answered mr crabb but i must ring the bell i see that it wants but five minutes of nine about my desk here is another vacant desk but it is not as well located never mind i will take it i shall probably have a better neighbor the bell was rung another teacher appeared an elderly man who looked as if all his vitality had been expended on his thirty years of teaching he too was shabbily dressed his coat being shiny and napless and his vest lacking two out of the five original buttons i guess smith doesnt pay very high salaries thought hector poor fellows his teachers look decidedly seedy the boys began to pour in not only those on the playground but as many more who lived in the village and were merely day scholars jim smith stalked in with an independent manner and dropped into his seat carelessly he looked around him patronizingly he felt that he was master of the situation both ushers and all the pupils stood in fear of him as he well knew only to his uncle did he look up as his superior and he took care to be on good terms with him as it was essential to the maintenance of his personal authority last of all mr smith the learned principal walked into the schoolroom with the air of a commanding general followed by allan roscoe who he had invited to see the school in operation socrates smith stood upright behind his desk and waved his hand majestically my young friends he said this is a marked day we have with us a new boy who is henceforth to be one of us to be a member of our happy family to share in the estimable advantages which you all enjoy need i say that i refer to master roscoe the ward of our distinguished friend mr allan roscoe who sits beside me and with interest i am sure surveys our institute as he spoke he turned towards mr roscoe who nodded an acknowledgment i may say to mr roscoe that i am proud of my pupils and the progress they have made under my charge the principal quietly ignored the two ushers who did all the teaching when these boys have reached a high position in the world it will be my proudest boast that they were prepared for the duties of life at smith institute compared with this proud satisfaction the few paltry dollars i exact as my honorarium are nothing absolutely nothing socrates looked virtuous and disinterested as he gave utterance to this sentiment and now boys you will commence your daily exercises under the direction of my learned associates mr crabb and mr jones mr crabb looked feebly complacent at this compliment though he knew it was only because a visitor was present in private socrates was rather apt to speak slightingly of his attainments while i am absent with my distinguished friend mr roscoe i expect you to pursue your studies diligently and preserve the most perfect order with these words the stately figure of socrates passed through the door followed by mr roscoe a pleasant sight mr roscoe said the principal this company of ambitious aspiring students all pressing forward eagerly in pursuit of learning quite true sir answered allan roscoe i wish you could stay with us for a whole day to inspect at your leisure the workings of our educational system thank you mr smith answered mr roscoe with an inward shudder but i have important engagements that call me away immediately then we must reluctantly take leave of you i hope you will feel easy about your nephew my ward corrected allan roscoe i beg your pardon i should have remembered your ward i leave him with confidence in your hands my dear sir so allan roscoe took his leave let us look in upon the aspiring and ambitious scholars after mr smith left them in charge of the ushers jim smith signalized his devotion to study by producing an apple core and throwing it with such skillful aim that it struck mr crabb in the back of the head the usher turned quickly his face flushed with wild indignation who threw that missile he asked in a vexed tone of course no one answered i hope no personal disrespect was intended continued the usher again no answer does anyone know who threw it asked mr crabb i think it was the new scholar said jim smith with a malicious look at hector master roscoe said mr crabb with a pained look i hope you have not started so discreditably in your school life no sir answered hector i hope i am not so ungentlemanly i dont like to be an informer but i saw smith himself throw it at you as he has chosen to lay it to me i have no hesitation in exposing him jim smiths face flushed with anger ill get even with you you young muff he said whenever you please said hector disdainfully really young gentlemen these proceedings are very irregular said mr crabb feebly with jim smith he did not remonstrate at all though he had no doubt that hectors charge was rightly made chapter ix the class in virgil presently the class in virgil was called up to this class hector had been assigned though it had only advanced about half through the third book of the aeneid while hector was in the fifth as there is no other class in virgil roscoe you had better join the one we have it will do you no harm to review very well sir said hector the class consisted of five boys including hector besides jim smith wilkins bates and johnson belonged to it as twentyfive lines had been assigned for a lesson hector had no difficulty in preparing himself and that in a brief time the other boys were understood to have studied the lesson out of school bates read first and did very fairly next came jim smith who did not seem quite so much at home in latin poetry as on the playground he pronounced the latin words in flagrant violation of all the rules of quantity and when he came to give the english meaning his translation was a ludicrous farrago of nonsense yet poor mr crabb did not dare apparently to characterize it as it deserved i dont think you have quite caught the authors meaning mr smith he said by the way jim was the only pupil to whose name he prefixed the title mr i couldnt make anything else out of it muttered jim perhaps some other member of the class may have been more successful johnson how do you read it i dont understand it very well sir wilkins were you more successful no sir roscoe can you translate the passage i think so sir proceed then hector at once gave a clear and luminous rendering of the passage and his version was not only correct but was expressed in decent english this is a point in which young classical scholars are apt to fail mr crabb was not in the habit of hearing such good translations and he was surprised and gratified very well very well indeed roscoe he said approvingly mr smith you may go on hed better go ahead and finish it said smith sulkily he probably got it out of a pony my young readers who are in college or classical schools will understand that a pony is an english translation of a classical author he is mistaken said hector quietly i have never seen a translation of virgil mr smith shrugged his shoulders and drew down the corners of his mouth intending thereby to express his incredulity i hope no boy will use a translation said the usher it will make his work easier for the time being but in the end it will embarrass him roscoe as you have commenced you may continue translate the remainder of the passage hector did so exhibiting equal readiness the other boys took their turns and then words were given out to parse here jim smith showed himself quite at sea though the usher as it was evident selected the easiest words for him he made a mistake in every one apparently he was by no means certain which of the words were nouns and which verbs and as to the relations which they sustained to other words in the sentence he appeared to have very little conception at length the recitation was over it had demonstrated one thing that in latin scholarship hector was far more accurate and proficient than any of his classmates while jim smith stood far below all the rest what in the world can the teacher be thinking of to keep such an ignoramus in the class thought hector he doesnt know enough to join a class in the latin reader the fact was that jim smith was unwilling to give up his place as a member of the highest class in latin because he knew it would detract from his rank in the school mr crabb to whom every recitation was a torture had one day ventured to suggest that it would be better to drop into the caesar class but he never ventured to make the suggestion again so unfavorably was it received by his backward pupil he might in the case of a different pupil have referred the matter to the principal but socrates smith was sure to decide according to the wishes of his nephew and did not himself possess knowledge enough of the latin tongue to detect his gross mistakes after a time came recess hector wished to arrange the books in his desk and did not go out mr crabb came up to his desk and said roscoe i must compliment you on your scholarship you enter at the head you are in advance of all the other members of the class thank you sir said hector gratified there is one member of the class who is not competent to remain in it yes sir i observed that but he is unwilling to join a lower class it is a trial to me to hear his daily failures but perhaps he would do no better anywhere else he would be as incompetent to interpret caesar as virgil i am afraid so i should suppose sir by the way roscoe said the usher hurriedly let me caution you against irritating smith he is the principals nephew and so we give him more scope he seems to me a bully said hector so he is i cant understand why the boys should give in to him as they do he is taller and stronger than the other boys besides he is backed up by the principal i hope you wont get into difficulty with him thank you mr crabb your caution is kindly meant but i am not afraid of this jim smith i am quite able to defend myself if attacked i hope so said the usher but he scanned hectors physical proportions doubtfully and it was very clear that he did not think him a match for the young tyrant of the school meanwhile jim smith and his schoolfellows were amusing themselves in the playground wheres that new fellow asked jim looking back to see whether he had come out he didnt come out said bates jim nodded his head vigorously just as i expected he said he knows where he is well off do you think he was afraid to come asked bates to be sure he was he knew what to expect are you going to thrash him asked johnson i should say i might hes a very good latin scholar remarked wilkins he thinks he is sneered jim so mr crabb appears to think that for old crabb said jim contemptuously snapping his fingers he dont know much himself ive caught him in plenty of mistakes this was certainly very amusing considering smiths absolute ignorance of even the latin rudiments but the boys around him did not venture to contradict him but it dont make any difference whether he knows latin or not proceeded jim he has been impudent to me and he shall suffer for it i was hoping to get a chance at him this recess but itll keep you might spoil his appetite for dinner said bates who was rather a toady to jim thats just exactly what i expect to do at any rate for supper ive got to have a reckoning with that young muff the recess lasted fifteen minutes at the end of that time the schoolbell rang and the boys trooped back into the schoolroom hector sat at his desk looking tranquil and at ease he alone seemed unaware of the fate that was destined for him chapter x dinner at smith institute at twelve oclock the morning session closed then came an intermission of an hour during which the day scholars either ate lunch brought with them or went to their homes in the village to partake of a warm repast at ten minutes past twelve a redarmed servant girl made her appearance at the back door looking out on the playground and rang a huge dinner bell the boys dropped their games and made what haste they could to the dining room now for a feast said wilkins to hector significantly does mr smith furnish good board asked hector for he felt the hunger of a healthy boy who had taken an early breakfast good grub said wilkins making a face wait till you see old sock isnt going to ruin himself providing his pupils with the delicacies of the season im sorry for that i am confoundedly hungry hungry exclaimed wilkins ive been i hungry ever since i came here is it as bad as that asked hector rather alarmed i should say so i havent had a square meal what i call a square meal for four weeks and thats just the time since i left home they had reached the door of the diningroom by this time in the center stood a long table but there didnt seem to be much on it except empty plates at a side table stood mrs smith ladling out soup from a large tureen thats the first course whispered wilkins i hope youll like it the boys filed in and took seats the servant girl already referred to began to bring plates of soup and set before the boys it was a thin unwholesomelooking mixture with one or two small pieces of meat about the size of a chestnut in each plate and fragments of potatoes and carrots a small triangular wedge of dry bread was furnished with each portion of soup we all begin to eat together dont be in a hurry said wilkins in a low tone when all the boys were served socrates smith who sat in an armchair at the head of the table said boys we are now about to partake of the bounties of providence let me hope with grateful hearts he touched a hand bell and the boys took up their soup spoons hector put a spoonful gingerly into his mouth and then stopping short looked at wilkins his face was evidently struggling not to express disgust is it always as bad he asked in a whisper yes answered wilkins shrugging his shoulders but you eat it wilkins had already swallowed his third spoonful i dont want to starve answered wilkins significantly youll get used to it in time hector tried to dispose of a second spoonful but he had to give it up at home he was accustomed to a luxurious table and this meal seemed to be a mere mockery yet he felt hungry so he took up the piece of bread at the side of his plate and though it was dry he succeeded in eating it by this time his lefthand neighbor a boy named colburn had finished his soup he looked longingly at hectors almost untasted plate aint you going to eat your soup he asked in a hoarse whisper no give it to me yes in a trice colburn had appropriated hectors plate and put his own empty one in its place just after this transfer had been made mr smith looked over to where hector was sitting he observed the empty plate and said to himself that new boy has been gorging himself he must have a terrible appetite well thats one good thing he aint dainty some boys turn up their noses at plain wholesome diet i didnt know but he might presently the hand bell rang again and the soup plates were removed in their places were set dinner plates containing a small section each of corned beef with a consumptivelooking potato very probably soggy at any rate this was the case with hectors he succeeded in eating the meat but not the potato give me your potato asked his lefthand neighbor yes it was quickly appropriated hector looked with some curiosity at the boy who did so much justice to boardingschool fare he was a thin pale boy who looked as if he had been growing rapidly as indeed he had this perhaps it was that stimulated his appetite afterward hector asked him if he really liked his meals no he said theyre nasty he was an english boy which accounted for his use of the last word you eat them as if you liked them remarked hector im so hungry apologized colburn mournfully im always hungry i eat to fill up not cause i like it i could eat anything i believe he could said wilkins who overheard this conversation could you eat fried cat now he asked yes answered colburn honestly there would be something hearty and filling about fried cat i aint half full now it was just after dinner hector might have said the same thing at the end of his first dinner there was indeed another course it consisted of some pale flabby apple pie about half baked the slices given were about half the size of those that are ordinarily supplied at private tables and restaurants hector managed to eat the apple but the crust he was obliged to leave he noticed however that his fellow pupils were not so fastidious when the last fragment of pie had disappeared mr smith again rang the hand bell boys he said we have now satisfied our appetites i havent thought hector we have once more experienced the bountiful goodness of providence in supplying our material wants as we sit down to our plain but wholesome diet i wonder how many of us are sensible of our good fortune i wonder how many of us think of the thousands of poor children scattered about the world who know not where to get their daily bread you have been refreshed and have reinforced your strength you will soon be ready to resume your studies and thus also take in a supply of mental food for as you are all aware or ought to be aware the mind needs to be fed as well as the body there will first be a short season for games and outofdoor amusements mr crabb will you accompany the boys to the playground and superintend their sports mr crabb also had participated in the rich feast and rose with the same unsatisfied but resigned look which characterized the rest he led the way to the playground and the boys trooped after him really wilkins said hector in a low tone this is getting serious isnt there any place outside where one can get something to eat theres a bakers half a mile away but you cant go till after afternoon session show me the way there then and ill buy something for both of us all right said wilkins brightening up by the way i didnt see jim smith at the table no he eats with his uncle and aunt afterward you noticed that old sock didnt eat just now yes i wondered at it he has something a good deal better afterward he wouldnt like our dinner any better than we did but he is better off for he neednt eat it so jim fares better than the rest of us does he yes hes one of the family you know just then pleasant fumes were wafted to the boys nostrils and they saw through the open window with feelings that cannot well be described a pair of roast chickens carried from the kitchen to the diningroom see what old sock and maam sock are going to have for dinner said wilkins enviously i dont like to look at it it is too tantalizing said hector chapter xi hector receives a summons it so happened that hector was well provided with money during the life of mr roscoe whom he regarded as his father he had a liberal allowance liberal beyond his needs and out of it had put by somewhat over a hundred dollars the greater part of this was deposited for safekeeping in a savings bank but he had twentyfive dollars in his possession at the time he was saving his money he regarded himself as the heir and future possessor of the estate and had no expectation of ever needing it it had been in his mind that it would give him an opportunity of helping out of his private funds any deserving poor person who might apply to him when the unexpected revelation had been made to him that he had no claim to the estate he was glad that he was not quite penniless he did not care to apply for money to allan roscoe it would have been a confession of dependence and very humiliating to him no sooner was school out than he asked wilkins to accompany him to the bakers that he might make up for the deficiencies of mr smiths meager table i suppose if i guide you youll stand treat roscoe said wilkins of course then let us go said his schoolfellow with alacrity id like to get the taste of that beastly dinner out of my mouth they found the bakers but close beside it was a restaurant where more substantial fare could be obtained wilkins said hector i think i would rather have a plate of meat all right im with you so the two boys went into the restaurant and ordered plates of roast beef which they ate with evident enjoyment i guess said the waiter grinning you two chaps come from the institute yes answered hector what makes you think so the way you eat they do say old smith half starves the boys youre not far from right said wilkins but it isnt alone the quantity but the quality thats amiss they ate their dinner leaving not a crumb and then rose refreshed i feel splendid said wilkins i just wish i boarded at the restaurant instead of the doctors thank you roscoe for inviting me all right wilkins well come again some day somehow the extra dinner seemed to warm the heart of wilkins and inspire in him a feeling of friendly interest for hector i say hector ill tell you something go ahead youve got to keep your eyes open i generally do answered hector smiling except at night i mean when jim smiths round why particularly when he is around because he means to thrash you what for you are too independent you dont bow down to him and look up to him i dont mean to said hector promptly if you dont youll see trouble and that very soon let it come said hector rather contemptuously you dont seem afraid said wilkins regarding him curiously because i am not afraid isnt that a good reason you dont think you can stand up against jim do you i will see when the time comes i shouldnt be a bit surprised if he were looking out for you at this very moment and wondering where you are it seemed that wilkins was right as they approached the school grounds john bates came running to meet them where have you been you two he said to the village answered wilkins what for for a walk answered wilkins with a warning glance at hector it would have been awkward if the principal had heard that they had been compelled to eke out their meager dinner at a restaurant well jim wants you leastways he wants roscoe bates looked as if he expected roscoe would immediately hasten to comply with the wishes of the redoubtable jim if he wants me he can come to me said hector independently but i say that wont do jim wont be satisfied wont he i dont know that that particularly concerns me shall i tell him that if you choose bates looked as if hector had been guilty of some enormity what defy the wishes the mandates of jim smith the king of the school and the tyrant of all the small boys he felt that hector roscoe was rushing on his fate i advise you to come he said jims mad with you already and hell lick you worse if you send him a message like that he will probably have to take blows as well as give them said hector then i am to tell him what you said of course with a look that seemed to say your fate be on your own head bates walked away john bates is always toadying to jim said wilkins so hes prime favorite when jim is goodnatured when hes cross ive seen him kick bates and bates didnt resent it he didnt dare to hed come round him the next day the same as ever has the boy no selfrespect asked hector in a tone of disgust he doesnt seem to have as soon as school was out jim smith had looked round for the new boy who seemed disposed to defy his authority on account of eating at different tables they had not met during the noon intermission at any rate there had not been time to settle the question of subserviency through the afternoon session jim had been anticipating the signal punishment which he intended to inflict upon the newcomer ill show him he said to himself tomorrow hell be singing a different tune or i am mistaken this was the way jim had been accustomed to break in refractory new arrivals the logic of his fist usually proved a convincing argument and thus far his supremacy had never been successfully resisted he was confident that he would not be interfered with secretly his uncle socrates sympathized with him and relished the thought that his nephew who so strongly resembled him in mind and person should be the undisputed boss to use a word common in political circles of the school he discreetly ignored the conflicts which he knew took place and if any luckless boy the victim of jims brutality ventured to appeal to him the boy soon found that he himself was arraigned and not the one who had abused him wheres that new boy asked jim as he left the schoolroom he had not seen our heros departure but his ready tool bates had i saw him sneaking off with wilkins said bates where did they go to the village i guess they seemed to be in a hurry said jim with a sneer they wanted to get out of your way that is the new boy did suggested bates jim nodded likely he did he answered so he went to the village did he yes i saw him well hes put it off a little that boys cranky im goin to give him a lesson he wont forget very soon so you will so you will jim chuckled bates thats the way i generally take down these boys that put on airs said jim complacently this roscoes the worst case ive had yet so wilkins went off with him did he yes i saw them go off together ill have to give wilkins a little reminder then it wont be safe to take up with them that defy me ill just give him a kick to help his memory he wont like that much oh my chuckled bates when you see them coming bates go and tell roscoe i want to see him said jim with the air of an autocrat all right jim said bates obediently so he went on his errand and we know what success he met with chapter xii the impending conflict jim smith stood leaning indolently against a post when his emissary bates returned from his errand he was experiencing that stern joy which bullies feel just before an encounter with a foeman inferior in strength whom they expect easily to master several of the boys were near by sycophantic followers of jim who were enjoying in advance the rumpus they expected i am afraid schoolboys do not always sympathize with the weaker side in the present instance there was hardly a boy who had not at some time or other felt the weight of jims fist and as there is an old saying that misery loves company it was not perhaps a matter of wonder that they looked forward with interest to seeing another suffer the same illtreatment which they had on former occasions received presently bates came back jim looked over his head for the boy whom he expected to see in his company wheres the new boy he demanded with a frown he wont come wont come repeated jim with an ominous frown did you tell him i wanted him yes i did and what did he say that if you wanted to see him you could come to him all the boys regarded each other with looks of surprise was it possible that any boy in smith institute could have the boldness to send such a message to jim most of all jim was moved by such a bold defiance of his authority for the moment he could not think of any adequate terms in which to express his feelings did the new boy say that he asked hoarsely yes he did jim nodded his head vigorously two or three times you fellows he said appealing to the boys around him did you ever hear such impudence no never exclaimed the boys in concert bates being the loudest and most emphatic i have never been so insulted since i was at the institute said jim again looking about him for a confirmation of his statement its because hes a new boy he dont understand suggested one thats no excuse said jim sternly he neednt think ill let him off on that account of course not answered bates what would you advise me to do boys asked jim with the air of a monarch asking the opinion of his counselors thrash him till he cant stand said the subservient bates he was always ready to go farther than anyone else in supporting and defending the authority of the tyrant of the playground bates you are right i shall follow your advice said jim where is the young reprobate he is over in carvers field is anyone with him yes wilkins ha wilkins and i will have an account to settle if he is going to side with this young rascal he must take the consequences so hes over in the field is he whats he doing i think he was going to walk down to the brook carvers field was a tract several acres in extent of pasture land sloping down to one corner where a brook trickled along quietly here three large trees were located under whose spreading branches the boys in the intervals of study used often to stretch themselves for a chat or engage in some schoolboy games such as nimble peg or quoits the owner of the field was an easygoing man who did not appear to be troubled by the visits of the boys as long as they did not maltreat the peaceful cows who gathered their subsistence from the scanty grass that grew there he wants to keep out of your way i guess volunteered bates as this suggestion was flattering to the pride of the boss it was graciously received very likely he said but hell find that isnt so easy boys follow me if you want to see some fun jim started with his loose stride for the field where he expected to meet his adversary or rather victim for so he considered him and the smaller boys followed him with alacrity there was going to be a scrimmage and they all wanted to see it jim and his followers issued from the gate and crossing the street scaled the bars that separated carvers field from the highway already they could see the two boys roscoe and wilkinsslowly walking and nearly arrived at the brook in the lower part of the field he doesnt seem much afraid remarked talbot one of the recent comers incautiously upon him immediately jim frowned ominously so you are taking sides with him talbot are you he said imperiously no jim answered talbot hurriedly for he now saw that he had been guilty of an imprudence what made you say he wasnt scared then i only said he didnt seem afraid answered talbot apologetically be careful what you say in future young fellow said jim sternly that is if you are a friend of mine if you are going over to roscoe you can go and i shall know how to treat you but i am not going over to him i dont like him said the cowardly boy very well i accept your apology this time in future be careful what you say by this time wilkins and roscoe had reached the clump of big trees and had seated themselves under their ample branches then for the first time glancing backward toward the school they became aware of the advancing troop of boys wilkins saw them first theres jim coming he exclaimed now you are in a pickle he means business i suppose said hector coolly he has decided to accept my invitation and come to see me youll find he has said wilkins significantly he seems to have considerable company remarked hector scanning the approaching party with tranquillity theyre coming to see the fun said wilkins i suppose you mean the fight between jim smith and myself well not exactly theyve come to see you thrashed hector smiled suppose they should see jim thrashed instead what then they might be surprised but i dont think they will be answered wilkins dryly he was on the whole well disposed toward hector and he certainly disliked jim heartily but he did not allow his judgment to be swayed by his preferences and he could foresee but one issue to the impending conflict there was one thing that puzzled him exceedingly and that was hectors coolness on the brink of a severe thrashing such as jim was sure to give him for his daring defiance and disregard of his authority youre a queer boy hector he said you dont seem in the least alarmed i am not in the least alarmed answered hector why should i be you dont mind being thrashed then i might mind but i dont mean to be thrashed if i can help it but you cant help it you know well that will soon be decided there was no time for any further conversation for jim and his followers were close at hand jim opened the campaign by calling hector to account look here you new boy he said didnt bates tell you that i wanted to see you yes answered hector looking up indifferently well why didnt you come to me at once hey because i didnt choose to i sent word if you wished to see me to come where i was what do you mean by such impudence hey i mean this jim smith that you have no authority over me and never will have i have not been here long but i have been here long enough to find out that you are a cowardly bully and ruffian how all these boys can give in to you i cant understand jim smith almost foamed at the mouth with rage youll pay for this he howled pulling off his coat in furious haste chapter xiii who shall be victor hector was not slow to accept the challenge conveyed by his antagonists action he too sprang to his feet flung off his coat and stood facing the bully hector was three inches shorter and more than as many years younger than jim but his figure was well proportioned and strongly put together as the boys could see on the other hand jim smith was loosely put together and though tall he was not well proportioned his arms were long and his movements were clumsy his frame however was large and he had considerable strength but it had never been disciplined he had never learned to box and was ignorant of the first rudiments of the art of selfdefense but he was larger and stronger than any of his schoolfellows and he had thus far had no difficulty in overcoming opposition to his despotic rule the boys regarded the two combatants with intense interest they could see that hector was not alarmed and meant to defend himself so there was likely to be a contest although they could not but anticipate an easy victory for the hitherto champion of the school hector did not propose to make the attack he walked forward to a favorable place and took his stand the position he assumed would have assured the casual observer that he knew something of the art in which his larger antagonist was deficient so you are ready to fight are you said jim you can see for yourself jim rushed forward intending to bear down all opposition he was whirling his long arms awkwardly and it was clear to see that he intended to seize hector about the body and fling him to the earth had he managed to secure the grip he desired opposition would have been vain and he would have compassed his design but hector was far too wary to allow anything of this kind he evaded jims grasp by jumping backward then dashing forward while his opponent was somewhat unsteady from the failure of his attempt he dealt him a powerful blow in the face jim smith was unprepared for such prompt action he reeled and came near falling it may safely be said also that his astonishment was as great as his indignation and that was unbounded so thats your game is it he exclaimed furiously ill pay you for this see if i dont hector did not reply he did not propose to carry on the battle by words already the matter had come to a sterner arbitrament and he stood on the alert all his senses under absolute control watching his big antagonist and from the expression of his face seeking to divine his next mode of attack he had this advantage over jim that he was cool and collected while jim was angry and rendered imprudent by his anger notwithstanding his first repulse he did not fully understand that the new boy was a much more formidable opponent than he anticipated nor did he appreciate the advantage which science gives over brute force he therefore rushed forward again with the same impetuosity as before and was received in precisely the same way this time the blood started from his nose and coursed over his inflamed countenance while hector was still absolutely unhurt meanwhile the boys looked on in decided amazement it had been as far as possible from their thoughts that hector could stand up successfully against the bully even for an instant yet here two attacks had been made and the champion was decidedly worsted they could not believe the testimony of their eyes carried away by the excitement of the moment wilkins who as we have said was disposed to espouse the side of hector broke into a shout of encouragement good boy roscoe he exclaimed youre doing well two or three of the other boys those who were least under the domination of jim and were only waiting for an opportunity of breaking away from their allegiance echoed the words of wilkins if there was anything that could increase the anger and mortification of the tyrant it was these signs of failing allegiance what was he to lose his hold over these boys and that because he was unable to cope with a boy much smaller and younger than himself perish the thought it nerved him to desperation and he prepared for a still more impetuous assault somewhere in his greek reader hector had met with a saying attributed to pindar that boldness is the beginning of victory he felt that the time had now come for a decisive stroke he did not content himself therefore with parrying or simply repelling the blow of his antagonist but he on his part assumed the offensive he dealt his blows with bewildering rapidity pressed upon jim skillfully evading the grasp of his long arms and in a trice the champion measured his length upon the greensward of course he did not remain there he sprang to his feet and renewed the attack but he had lost his confidence he was bewildered and to confess the truth panicstricken and the second skirmish was briefer than the first when for the third time he fell back with his young opponent standing erect and vigorous the enthusiasm of the boys overcame the limits of prudence there was a shout of approval and the fallen champion to add to his discomfiture was forced to listen to his own hitherto subservient followers shouting hurrah for the new boy hurrah for hector roscoe this was too much for jim he rose from the ground sullenly looked about him with indignation which he could not control and shaking his fist not at one boy in particular but at the whole company exclaimed youll be sorry for this you fellows you can leave me and stand by the new boy if you want to but youll be sorry for it ill thrash you one by one as i have often done before try roscoe first said one boy jeeringly ill try you first said jim and too angry to postpone his intention he made a rush for the offender the latter who knew he was no match for the angry bully turned and fled jim prepared to follow him when he was brought to by hector placing himself in his path let that boy alone he said sternly what business is it of yours demanded jim doggedly but he did not offer to renew the attack however it will be my business to put an end to your tyranny and bullying said hector undauntedly if you dare to touch one of these boys you will have to meet me as well jim had had enough of encountering hector he did not care to make a humiliating spectacle of himself any more before his old flatterers but his resources were not at an end you think yourself mighty smart he said with what was intended to be withering sarcasm you havent got through with me yet he did not however offer to pursue the boy who had been the first to break away from his allegiance he put on his coat and turned to walk toward the school saying youll hear from me again and that pretty soon none of his late followers offered to accompany him he had come to the contest with a band of friends and supporters he left it alone even bates his most devoted adherent remained behind and did not offer to accompany the discrowned and dethroned monarch whats jim going to do asked talbot hes going to tell old sock and get us all into trouble itll be a cowardly thing to do said wilkins hes been fairly beaten in battle and he ought to submit to it he wont if he can help it i say boys three cheers for the new boy exclaimed wilkins they were given with a will and the boys pressed forward to shake the hand of the boy whose prowess they admired thank you boys said hector but id rather be congratulated on something else i would rather be a good scholar than a good fighter but the boys were evidently of a different opinion and elevated hector straightway to the rank of a hero chapter xiv socrates calls hector to account jim smith as he walked back to the institute nursing his wrath felt very much like a dethroned king he was very anxious to be revenged upon hector but the lesson he had received made him cautious he must get him into trouble by some means should he complain to his uncle it would involve the necessity of admitting his defeat unless he could gloss over the story in some way this he decided to do on reaching the school he sought his dormitory and carefully wiped away the blood from his face then he combed his hair and arranged his dress and sought his uncle mr smith was at his desk looking over his accounts and estimating the profits of the half year when his nephew made his appearance uncle socrates id like to speak to you very well james proceed i want to complain of the new boy who came this morning socrates smith looked up in genuine surprise as a general thing his nephew brought few complaints for he took the responsibility of punishing boys he did not like himself what roscoe inquired the principal yes is he in any mischief mischief i should say so why hes a regular young turk a young turk i dont think i understand you james i mean hes a young ruffian what has he been doing asked socrates in surprise he pitched into me a short time ago said jim in some embarrassment pitched into you you dont mean to say that he attacked you yes i do but hes a considerably smaller boy than you james i am surprised that he should have dared to attack you yes he is small but hes a regular fighter i suppose you gave him a lesson yees of course so that he wont be very likely to renew the attack well i dont know about that hes tough and wiry and understands boxing i found it hard work to thrash him but you did thrash him said socrates puzzled yes then what do you want me to do i thought you might punish him for being quarrelsome it may be a good idea i remember now that his uncle warned me that he would need restraining just so uncle said jim eagerly his uncle was right well i will give him a lecture he will find that he cannot behave as he pleases at smith institute said socrates pompously he will find that i do not tolerate any defiance of authority i will speak of it after vespers thank you uncle hell get a raking down thought jim with gratification ill make it hot for him here he may be sure of that half an hour after supper was read a brief evening service called vespers and then the boys study hours commenced during this time they were expected to be preparing their lessons for the next day the service was generally read by socrates smith a m in person it was one of the few official duties he performed and he was generally very imposing in his manner on this occasion when the service had been read on that particular evening the principal did not immediately give the signal for study to be commenced instead he cleared his throat saying boys i have a few words to say to you this morning a new boy made his appearance among us his uncle or perhaps i should say his guardian attracted by the welldeserved fame of smith institute came hither to enter him among my pupils i received him cordially and promised that he should share with you the rich the inestimable educational advantages which our humble seminary affords i hoped he would be an acquisition that by his obedience and his fidelity to duty he would shed luster on our school here socrates blew his nose sonorously and resumed but what has happened on the very first day of his residence here he brutally assaults one of our numbers my nephew and displays the savage instincts of a barbarian his uncle did well to warn me that he would need salutary restraint hector who had been amused by the solemn and impressive remarks of socrates looked up in surprise had allan roscoe really traduced him in this manner after robbing him of his inheritance as hector felt convinced that he had done hector roscoe said socrates severely stand up and let me hear what you have to say for yourself hector rose calmly and faced the principal by no means awestricken at the grave arraignment to which he had listened i say this mr smith he answered that i did not attack your nephew till he had first attacked me this he did without the slightest provocation and i defended myself as i had a right to do its a lie muttered jim in a tone audible to his uncle my nephews report is of a different character i am disposed to believe him i regret to say sir that he has made a false statement i will give you an account of what actually occurred on my return from a walk he sent a boy summoning me to his presence as he was not a teacher and had no more authority over me than i over him i declined to obey but sent word that if he wished to see me he could come where i was i then walked down to the brook in carvers field he followed me as soon as he had received my message and charging me with impertinence challenged me to a fight well we had a fight but he attacked me first i dont know whether this account is correct or not said socrates a little nonplused by this new version of the affair i am ready to accept the decision of any one of the boys said hector bates said socrates who knew that this boy was an adherent of his nephew is this account of roscoes true bates hesitated a moment he was still afraid of jim but when he thought of hectors prowess he concluded that he had better tell the truth yes sir he answered jim smith darted an angry and menacing glance at his failing adherent ahem said socrates looking puzzled it is not quite so bad as i supposed i regret however that you have exhibited such a quarrelsome disposition i dont think i am quarrelsome sir said hector silence sir i have mr allan roscoes word for it it appears to me said hector undauntedly that your nephew is at least as quarrelsome as i am he forced the fight upon me probably you wrill not be in a hurry to attack him again said socrates under the impression that hector had got the worst of it some of the boys smiled but socrates did not see it as you have probably received a lesson i will not punish you as i had anticipated i will sentence you however to commit to memory the first fifty lines of virgils aeneid mr crabb will you see that roscoe performs his penance yes sir said crabb faintly is your nephew also to perform a penance asked hector undaunted silence sir what right have you to question me on this subject because sir he is more to blame than i i dont know that i am not at all sure that your story is correct mr crabb meek as he was was indignant at this flagrant partiality mr smith he said i happen to know that roscoes story is strictly correct and that your nephew made an unprovoked attack upon him hector looked grateful and jim smith furious mr crabb said socrates angrily i did not ask your opinion so far as my nephew is concerned i will deal with him privately boys you may begin your studies all the boys understood that jim was to be let off and they thought it a shame but mr crabb took care to make hectors penance as light as possible and thus passed the first day at smith institute chapter xv the usher confides in hector mr crabb acted rashly in siding with hector and speaking against mr smiths nephew socrates showed his displeasure by a frigid demeanor and by seeking occasions for snubbing his assistant on the other hand hector felt grateful for his intercession and an intimacy sprang up between them a few days afterward on a half holiday mr crabb said roscoe i am going out for a walk do you care to accompany me i will do so with pleasure said hector sincerely mr crabb he said after they were fairly on their way i am sorry to see that mr smith has not forgiven you for taking my part against jim i would do it again roscoe said the usher i could not sit silent while so great an injustice was being done do you think jim was punished i am sure he was not he is a boy after mr smiths own heart that is he possesses the same mean and disagreeable qualities perhaps in a greater degree has he interfered with you since no answered hector smiling he probably found that i object to being bullied you are fortunate in being strong enough to withstand his attacks yes said hector quietly i am not afraid of him bullies are generally cowards said the usher i wonder mr crabb you are willing to stay at smith institute as usher to such a man as mr smith ah roscoe said mr crabb sighing it is not of my own free will that i stay poverty is a hard taskmaster i must teach for a living but surely you could get a better position perhaps so but how could i live while i was seeking for it my lad he said after a pause i have a great mind to confide in you i want one friend to whom i can talk unreservedly mr crabb said hector earnestly i shall feel flattered by your confidence thank you roscoe or rather since we are going to be friends let me distinguish you from the other boys and call you hector i wish you would sir i need not tell you that i am poor continued mr crabb you can read it in my shabby clothes i sometimes see the boys looking at my poor suit as if they wondered why i dressed so badly smith has more than once cast insulting looks at my rusty coat it is not penuriousness as some of the boys may think it is poverty that prevents me from attiring myself more becomingly mr crabb i sympathize with you said hector thank you hector of that i am sure mr smith ought to pay you enough to clothe yourself neatly he makes you work hard enough he pays me twenty dollars a month said the usher twenty dollars and my board is that all asked hector in amazement why the girl in the kitchen earns nearly that to be sure answered the usher bitterly but in mr smiths estimation i stand very little higher he does not value education not possessing it himself however you may wonder why even with this sum i cannot dress better it is because i have another than myself to support you are not married asked hector in surprise no but i have an invalid sister who is wholly dependent upon me to her i devote threequarters of my salary and this leaves me very little for myself my poor sister is quite unable to earn anything for herself so it is a matter of necessity yes i understand said hector in a tone of sympathy you now see why i do not dare to leave this position poor as it is for myself i might take the risk but i should not feel justified in exposing my sister to the hazard of possible want you are right mr crabb i am very sorry now that you spoke up for me it has prejudiced mr smith against you no no i wont regret that indeed he would hesitate to turn me adrift for he would not be sure of getting another teacher to take my place for the same beggarly salary something may turn up for you yet mr crabb said hector hopefully perhaps so answered the usher but his tone was far from sanguine when they returned to the school hector carried out a plan which had suggested itself to him in the interest of mr crabb he wrote to a boy of his acquaintance living in new york who he had heard was in want of a private tutor and recommended mr crabb in strong terms for that position he did this sincerely for he had found the usher to be a good teacher and well versed in the studies preparatory to college he did not think it best to mention this to mr crabb for the answer might be unfavorable and then his hopes would have been raised only to be dashed to the earth later in the day hector fell in with bates already referred to as a special friend of jim smith the intimacy however had been diminished since the contest in which hector gained the victory bates was not quite so subservient to the fallen champion and jim resented it i saw you walking out with old crabb said bates he isnt particularly old said hector oh you know what i mean did you ever see such a scarecrow do you refer to his dress asked hector yes hell soon be in rags i shouldnt wonder at all if that old suit of his was worn by one of noahs sons in the ark you dont suppose he wears it from choice do you i dont know hes stingy i suppose afraid to spend a cent you are mistaken he has a sister to support and his salary is very small i can believe that old sock is mean with his teachers how much does he pay crabb it is very little but i dont know that i ought to tell i say though roscoe i wouldnt go to walk with him again why not the boys will say that you are trying to get into his good graces so hell let you off easy in your lessons i dont want him to let me off easy i generally intend to be prepared i know but thats what they will say let them say what they please and i will do what i please said hector independently old sock aint any too fond of crabb since he took your part the other day jim says the old man means to bounce him before long i suppose that means discharge him it means giving him his walking papers jim will see that he does it too hector did not reply but he felt more than ever glad that he had written a letter which might possibly bring the poor usher more profitable and at the same time agreeable employment jim doesnt like you either added bates i never supposed he did i can do without his favor he will get you into a scrape if he can i have no doubt whatever of his benevolent intentions toward me i shall not let it interfere with my happiness just then a sharp cry was heard as of a boy in pain it came from the school yard which the two boys were approaching on their return from a walk whats that asked hector quickly i expect its the new boy one had arrived the day before is he hurt i wonder asked hector quickening his steps jims got hold of him probably said bates he said this morning he was going to give the little chap a lesson to break him into school ways he did did he said hector compressing his lips i shall have something to say to that and he quickened his steps chapter xvi tossed in a blanket the last new boy was a little fellow only eleven years old his name was tommy cooper as he was called at home it was his first absence from the sheltering care of his mother and he felt lonesome in the great dreary school building where he was called cooper and you little chap he missed the atmosphere of home and the tenderness of his mother and sister in fact the poor boy was suffering from that most distressing malady homesickness had mrs socrates smith been a kind motherly woman she might have done much to reconcile the boy to his new home but she was a tall gaunt bony woman more masculine than feminine not unlike miss sally brass whom all readers of dickens will remember i am sorry to say that a homesick boy in a boarding school does not meet with much sympathy even those boys who have once experienced the same malady are half ashamed of it and if they remember it at all remember it as a mark of weakness there was but one boy who made friendly approaches to tommy and this was hector roscoe hector had seen the little fellow sitting by himself with a sad face and he had gone up to him and asked him in a pleasant tone some questions about himself and his home so you have never been away from home before tommy he said no sir answered the boy timidly dont call me sir i am only a boy like you call me hector that is a strange name i never heard it before no it is not a common name i suppose you dont like school very much i never shall be happy here sighed tommy you think so now but you will get used to it i dont think i shall oh yes you will it will never seem like home of course but you will get acquainted with some of the boys and will join in their games and then time will pass more pleasantly i think the boys are very rough said the little boy yes they are rough but they dont mean unkindly some of them were homesick when they came here just like you were you homesick asked tommy looking up with interest i didnt like the school very well but i was much older than you when i came here and besides i didnt leave behind me so pleasant a home i am not so rich as you tommy i have no father nor mother and for the moment hector too looked sad the little fellow became more cheerful under the influence of hectors kind and sympathetic words our hero however was catechised about his sudden intimacy with the new scholar i see youve got a new situation roscoe said bates when hector was walking away what do you mean youve secured the position of nurse to that little cry baby you mean tommy cooper yes if thats his name i was cheering up the little fellow a bit hes made rather a bad exchange in leaving a happy home for smith institute thats so this is a dreary hole but theres no need of crying about it you might if you were as young as tommy and had just come shall you take him under your wing yes if he needs it we now come to the few minutes preceding the return of hector from his walk as indicated in the last chapter tommy cooper was sitting in the school yard with a disconsolate look when jim smith who was never happier than when he was bullying other boys espied him whats the matter with you young one he said roughly is your grandmother dead no answered tommy briefly come here and play i would rather not i am not going to have you sulking round here do you hear me are you one of the teachers asked tommy innocently youll find out who i am answered jim roughly here palmer do you want a little fun with this young one palmer and bates were jim smiths most devoted adherents what are you going to do jim questioned palmer im going to stir him up a little said jim with a malicious smile go and get a blanket all right said palmer well toss him in a blanket he wont look so sulky after we get through with him there were two or three other boys standing by who heard these words its a shame said one in a low voice see the poor little chap how sad he looks i felt just as he does when i first came to school jim ought not to do it said the second its a mean thing to do tell him so no thank you hed treat me the same way the two speakers were among the smaller boys neither being over fourteen and though they sympathized with tommy their sympathy was not likely to do him any good out came palmer with the blanket are there any teachers about asked jim no thats good we shant be interfered with here young one come here what for asked tommy looking frightened come here and youll find out but tommy had already guessed he had read a story of english school life in which a boy had been tossed in a blanket and he was not slow in comprehending the situation oh dont toss me in a blanket said the poor boy clasping his hands sorry to disturb you but its got to be done young one said jim here jump in itll do you good oh dont sobbed the poor boy itll hurt me no it wont dont be a cry baby well make a man of you but tommy was not persuaded he jumped up and tried to make his escape but of course there was no chance for him jim smith overtook him in a couple of strides and seizing him roughly by the collar dragged him to the blanket which by this time palmer and one of the other boys who had been impressed into the service reluctantly were holding jim smith taking up tommy bodily threw him into the blanket and then seizing one end gave it a violent toss up went the boy into the air and tumbling back again into the blanket was raised again raise him boys shouted jim give him a hoist then it was that tommy screamed and hector heard his cry for help he came rushing round the corner of the building and comprehended at a glance what was going on naturally his hot indignation was much stirred for shame you brutes he cried stop that if there was anyone whom jim smith did not want to see at this moment it was hector roscoe he would much rather have seen one of the ushers he saw that he was in a scrape but his pride would not allow him to back out keep on boys he cried its none of roscoes business hed better clear out or well toss him as he spoke he gave another toss save me hector cried tommy espying his friends arrival with joy hector was not the boy to let such an appeal go unheeded he sprang forward dealt jim smith a powerful blow that made him stagger and let go the blanket and then helped tommy to his feet run into the house tommy he said there may be some rough work here he faced round just in time to fend off partially a blow from the angry bully take that for your impudence shouted jim smith ill teach you to meddle with me but jim reckoned without his host the blow was returned with interest and in the heat of his indignation hector followed it up with such a volley that the bully retreated in discomfiture and was glad to withdraw from the contest ill pay you for this you scoundrel he said venomously whenever you please you big brute returned hector contemptuously it is just like you to tease small boys if you annoy tommy cooper again youll hear from me id like to choke that fellow muttered jim either he or i will have to leave this school chapter xvii jim smiths revenge it would be natural to suppose that jim smith relying upon his influence with his uncle would have reported this last outrage as he chose to consider it to the principal thus securing the punishment of hector but he was crafty and considered that no punishment hector was likely to receive would satisfy him corporal punishment for taking the part of an illused boy hector was probably too spirited to submit to and under these circumstances it would hardly have been inflicted besides jim was aware that the offense for which hector had attacked him was not likely if made known to secure sympathy even his uncle would be against him for he was fond of money and had no wish to lose the new pupil whose friends were well able to pay for him no he decided that what he wanted was to bring hector into disgrace the method did not immediately occur to him but after a while he saw his way clear his uncles bedchamber was on the second floor and jims directly over it on the third story some of the other boys including hector had rooms also on the third floor jim was going upstairs one day when through the door of his uncles chamber which chanced to be open he saw a wallet lying on the bureau on the impulse of the moment he walked in on tiptoes secured the wallet and slipped it hurriedly into his pocket then he made all haste upstairs and bolted himself into his own room two other boys slept there but both were downstairs in the playground jim took the wallet from his pocket and eagerly scanned the contents there were eight fivedollar bills and ten dollars in small bills besides a few papers which may be accurately described as of no value to anyone but the owner the boys face assumed a covetous look he as well as his uncle was fond of money a taste which unfortunately as he regarded it he was unable to gratify his family was poor and he was received at half price by socrates smith on the score of relationship but his allowance of pocket money was less than that of many of the small boys he made up the deficiency in part by compelling them to contribute to his pleasures if any boy purchased candy or any other delicacy jim if he learned the fact required him to give him a portion just as the feudal lords exacted tribute from their serfs and dependents still this was not wholly satisfactory and jim longed instead for a supply of money to spend as he chose so the thought came to him as he scanned the contents of the wallet why shouldnt i take out one or two of these bills before disposing of it no one will lay it to me the temptation proved too strong for jims power of resistance he selected a fivedollar bill and five dollars in small bills and reluctantly replaced the rest of the money in the wallet so far so good he thought thats a good idea then unlocking the door he passed along the entry till he came to the room occupied by hector as he or one of the two boys who roomed with him might be in the room he looked first through the keyhole the coast is clear he said to himself in a tone of satisfaction still he opened the door cautiously and stepped with catlike tread into the room then he looked about the room hanging on nails were several garments belonging to the inmates of the room jim selected a pair of pants which he knew belonged to hector and hurrying forward thrust the wallet into one of the side pockets then with a look of satisfaction he left the room shutting the door carefully behind him there he said to himself with exultation thatll fix him perhaps hell wish he hadnt put on quite so many airs he was rather annoyed as he walked along the corridor back to his own room to encounter wilkins he had artfully chosen a time when he thought all the boys would be out and he heartily wished that some untoward chance had not brought wilkins in where are you going jim asked wilkins i went to bates room thinking he might be in but he wasnt do you want him i left him out on the playground oh its no matter itll keep said jim indifferently i got out of that pretty well he reflected complacently perhaps jim smith would not have felt quite so complacent if he had known that at the time he entered hectors room it was occupied though he could not see the occupant it so chanced that ben platt one of hectors roommates was in the closet concealed from the view of anyone entering the room yet so placed that he could see through the partially open door what wras passing in the room when he saw jim smith enter he was surprised for he knew that that young man was not on visiting terms with the boy who had discomfited and humiliated him what on earth can jim want he asked himself he did not have long to wait for an answer though not a real one but actions as men have often heard speak louder than words when he saw jim steal up to hectors pants and producing a wallet hastily thrust it into one of the pockets he could hardly believe the testimony of his eyes well he ejaculated inwardly i would not have believed it if i hadnt seen it i knew jim was a bully and a tyrant but i didnt think he was as contemptible as all that the wallet he recognized at once for he had more than once seen socrates take it out of his pocket its old socks wallet he said to himself its clear that jim has taken it and means to have it found in roscoes possession thats as mean a trick as i ever heard of just then wilkins entered the room wilkins and ben platt were hectors two roommates hello wilkins im glad youve come just as you have what for platt do you want to borrow some money no there is more money in this room now than there has been for a long time what do you mean the governor hasnt sent you a remittance has he no expound your meaning then most learned and mysterious chum i will within five minutes jim smith has been here and left a wallet of money jim been here i met him in the corridor i warrant he didnt say he had been here no he said he had been to bates room but didnt find him there thats all gammon wilkins what will you say when i tell you that old socks wallet is in this very room i wont believe it look here then as he spoke ben went to hectors pants and drew out the wallet wilkins started in surprise and dismay how did roscoe come by that he asked surely he didnt take it of course he didnt you might know roscoe better didnt you hear me say just now that jim brought it here and put it in roscoes pocket yes in your presence yes only he didnt know that i was present said platt where were you in the closet the door was partly open and i saw everything what does it all mean cant you see its jims way of coming up with roscoe you know he threatened that hed fix him all i can say is that its a very mean way said wilkins in disgust he was not a model boy far from it indeed but he had a sentiment of honor that made him dislike and denounce a conspiracy like this its a dirty trick he said warmly i agree with you on that point what shall we do about it lay low and wait till the whole thing comes out when sock discovers his loss jim will be on hand to tell him where his wallet is then we can up and tell all we know good theres a jolly row coming said wilkins smacking his lips chapter xviii the missing wallet is found socrates smith was ordinarily so careful of his money that it was a very remarkable inadvertence to leave it on the bureau nor was it long before he ascertained his loss he was sitting at his desk when his wife looked in at the door and called for a small sum for some domestic expenditure with an ill grace for socrates hated to part with his money he put his hand into the pocket where he usually kept his wallet really mrs smith he was saying it seems to me you are always wanting money why bless my soul and such an expression of consternation and dismay swept over his face that his wife hurriedly inquired what is the matter mr smith matter enough he gasped my wallet is gone gone echoed his wife in alarm where can you have left it mr smith pressed his hand to his head in painful reflection how much money was there in it socrates asked his wife between forty and fifty dollars groaned mr smith if i dont find it sophronia i am a ruined man this was of course an exaggeration but it showed the poignancy of the losers regret cant you think where you left it suddenly mr smiths face lighted up i remember where i left it now he said i was up in the chamber an hour since and while changing my coat took out my wallet and laid it on the bureau ill go right up and look for it do socrates mr smith bounded up the staircase with the agility of a man of half his years and hopefully opened the door of his chamber which jim had carefully closed after him his first glance was directed at the bureau but despair again settled down sadly upon his heart when he saw that it was bare there was no trace of the missing wallet it may have fallen on the carpet said socrates hope reviving faintly there was not a square inch of the cheap kidderminster carpet that he did not scan earnestly greedily but alas the wallet if it had ever been there had mysteriously taken to itself locomotive powers and wandered away into the realm of the unknown and the inaccessible yet searching in the chambers of his memory mr smith felt sure that he had left the wallet on the bureau he could recall the exact moment when he laid it down and he recollected that he had not taken it again some one has taken it he decided and wrath arose in his heart he snapped his teeth together in stern anger as he determined that he would ferret out the miserable thief and subject him to condign punishment mrs smith tired of waiting for the appearance of her husband ascended the stairs and entered his presence well she said i havent found it answered socrates tragically mrs smith the wallet has been stolen are you sure that you left it here asked his wife sure he repeated in a hollow tone i am as sure as that the sun rose tomorrow i mean yesterday was the door open no but that signifies nothing it wasnt locked and anyone could enter is it possible that we have a thief in the institute said mrs smith nervously socrates i shant sleep nights think of the spoons theyre only plated and my earrings you could live without earrings think rather of the wallet with nearly fifty dollars in bills who do you think took it socrates i have no idea but i will find out yes i will find out come downstairs mrs smith we will institute inquiries when mr smith had descended to the lower floor and was about entering the office it chanced that his nephew was just entering the house whats the matter uncle socrates he asked you look troubled and a good reason why james i have met with a loss you dont say so exclaimed jim in innocent wonder what is it a wallet with a large amount of money in it perhaps there is a hole in your pocket suggested jim a hole large enough for my big wallet to fall through dont be such a fool excuse me uncle said jim meekly of course that is impossible when do you remember having it last of course socrates told the story now familiar to us and already familiar to his nephew though he did not suspect that jim struck his forehead as if a sudden thought had occurred to him could it be he said slowly as if to himself no i cant believe it cant believe what demanded socrates impatiently if you have any clew out with it i hardly like to tell uncle socrates for it implicates one of the boys which asked mr smith eagerly i will tell you though i dont like to half an hour since i was coming upstairs when i heard a door close as i thought and directly afterward saw hector roscoe hurrying up the stairs to the third floor i was going up there myself and followed him five minutes later he came out of his room looking nervous and excited i didnt think anything of it at the time but i now think that he entered your room took the wallet and then carried it up to his own chamber and secreted it hector roscoe repeated mr smith in amazement i wouldnt have supposed that he was a thief nor i and perhaps he isnt it might be well however to search his room i will answered socrates with eagerness come up james and you mrs smith come up too the trio went upstairs and entered poor hectors room it was not unoccupied for ben platt and wilkins were there they anticipated a visit and awaited it with curious interest they rose to their feet when the distinguished visitors arrived business of importance brings us here said socrates platt and wilkins you may leave the room the boys exchanged glances and obeyed wilkins said ben when they were in the corridor it is just as i thought jim has set a trap for roscoe he may get caught himself said wilkins i aint oversqueamish but that is too confounded mean of course youll tell all you know yes and i fancy it will rather surprise mr jim i wish they had let us stay in there meanwhile jim skillfully directed the search he may have put it under the mattress suggested jim socrates darted to the bed and lifted up the mattress but no wallet revealed itself to his searching eyes no it is not here he said in a tone of disappointment the boy may have it about him i will send for him wait a moment uncle socrates said jim there is a pair of pants which i recognize as his mr smith immediately thrust his hand into one of the pockets and drew out the wallet here it is he exclaimed joyfully here it is then roscoe is a thief i wouldnt have thought it said jim nor i i thought the boy was of too good family to stoop to such a thing but now i remember mr allan roscoe told me he was only adopted by his brother he is perhaps the son of a criminal very likely answered jim who was glad to believe anything derogatory to hector what are you going to do about it uncle i shall bring the matter before the school i will disgrace the boy publicly answered socrates smith sternly he deserves the exposure aha master roscoe said jim gleefully to himself i rather think i shall get even with you and that very soon chapter xix a dramatic scene it was generally after vespers that mr smith communicated to the school anything which he desired to call to their attention this was to be the occasion of bringing our hero into disgrace the boys assembled most of them quite ignorant that anything exceptional was to occur hector himself the person chiefly interested was entirely unconscious that he was to be made a shining mark for the arrows of suspicion and obloquy if he had noticed the peculiar and triumphantly malicious looks with which jim smith the bully and tyrant whom he had humiliated and deposed regarded him he might have been led to infer that some misfortune was in store for him but these looks he did not chance to notice there were two other boys however who did notice them these were ben platt and wilkins who had very good reasons as we know for doing so i believe old sock is going to pitch into roscoe at vespers said ben in a whisper to his roommate so do i theres a look about him like that of a tiger about to pounce on his prey or a cat with murderous designs on a mouse we must expose the whole thing of course wont jim be mad let him he wont dare to thrash us while roscoe is round there was indeed about socrates smith an air of mystery portentous and suggestive he looked like one meditating a coup detat or perhaps it might better be said a coup de main as the hand is with schoolmasters generally the instrument of attack when the proper time arrived mr smith cleared his throat as he always did before beginning to speak boys he said i have an important and i may say a painful communication to make to you all the boys looked at each other in curiosity except the three who were already in the secret you know boys continued socrates how proud i am of this institute how zealous i am for its good reputation how unwearied i am in my efforts for your progress and welfare mr smiths unwearied efforts were largely in the line of making out and receipting bills for tuition and it may be said that this was to him by far the most agreeable of the duties he undertook to perform i have been proud of my pupils continued the principal and it has given me pleasure to reflect that you all reflected credit more or less upon my teaching i have also sought to form your manners to train you to fill the positions which providence may have in store for you in a word while from time to time you may have indulged in little escapades slightlyculpable i have felt that you were all gentlemen what in the world does he mean thought more than one puzzled boy what is all this leading to among those to whom this thought occurred was hector roscoe who was very far from conjecturing that all this long preamble was to introduce an attack upon him but proceeded socrates after a pause i have this afternoon been painfully undeceived i have learned with inexpressible pain that smith institute has received an ineffaceable stigma old sock is getting eloquent whispered ben platt i have learned continued socrates with tragic intensity that i have nourished a viper in my bosom i have learned that we have a thief among us this declaration was greeted with a buzz of astonishment each boy looked at his next door neighbor as if to inquire is it you each one except the three who were behind the scenes of these jim smith with an air of supreme satisfaction looked in a sidelong way at hector unconscious the while that two pairs of eyes those of wilkins and ben platt were fixed upon him i thought you would be surprised said the principal except of course the miserable criminal but i will not keep you in suspense today by inadvertence i left my wallet containing a considerable sum of money on the bureau in my chamber an hour later discovering my loss i went upstairs but the wallet was gone it had mysteriously disappeared i was at a loss to understand this at first but i soon found a clew i ascertained that a boy a boy who is presently one of the pupils of smith institute had entered my chamber had appropriated the wallet had carried it to his dormitory and there had slyly concealed it in the pocket of a pair of pants doubtless he thought his theft would not be discovered but it was and i myself discovered the missing wallet in its place of concealment here mr smith paused and it is needless to say that the schoolroom was a scene of great excitement his tone was so impressive and his statement so detailed that no one could doubt that he had most convincing evidence of the absolute accuracy of what he said who was it every boy had it on his lips to inquire three hours have elapsed since my discovery continued mr smith during that time i have felt unnerved i have however written and posted an account of this terrible discovery to the friends of the pupil who has so disgraced himself and the school ben platt and wilkins exchanged glances of indignation they felt that mr smith had been guilty of a piece of outrageous injustice in acting thus before he had apprised the supposed offender of the charge against him and heard his defense both boys decided that they would not spare jim smith but at all hazards expose the contemptible plot which he had contrived against his schoolfellow i waited however till i was somewhat more calm before laying the matter before you i know you will all be anxious to know the name of the boy who has brought disgrace upon the school to which you belong and i am prepared to reveal it to you hector roscoe stand up if a flash of lightning had struck him where he sat hector could not have been more astonished for a moment he was struck dumb and did not move stand up hector roscoe repeated the principal no wonder you sit there as if paralyzed you did not expect that so soon your sin would find you out then hector recovered completely his selfpossession he sprang to his feet and not only that but he strode forward blazing with passion till he stood before mr smiths desk and confronted him mr smith he said in a ringing tone do i understand you to charge me with stealing a wallet of yours containing money i do so charge you and i have complete evidence of the truth of my charge what have you to say what have i to say repeated hector looking around him proudly and scornfully i have to say that it is an infamous lie hold sir exclaimed socrates angrily shameless boy do you intend to brazen it out did i not tell you that i had complete proof of the truth of the charge i dont care what fancied proof you have i denounce the charge as a lie that wont do sir i myself took the wallet from the pocket of your pantaloons hanging in the chamber mrs smith was with me and witnessed my discovery and there was another present one of the pupils of this institute who also can testify to the fact it is useless for you to deny it you found the wallet in the pocket of my pantaloons asked hector slowly yes there can be no doubt about that who put it there demanded hector quickly socrates smith was staggered for he had not expected this query from the accused who put it there he repeated yes sir continued hector firmly if the matter is as you state it some one has been mean enough to put the wallet into my pocket in order to implicate me in a theft of course you put it there yourself roscoe your defense is very lame hector turned round to his fellowscholars boys he said you have heard the charge that has been made against me you know me pretty well by this time is there any one of you that believes it to be true no no shouted the boys with one exception jim smith was heard to say distinctly i believe it silence in the school shouted socrates this is altogether irregular and i wont have it hector turned to the principal and said calmly you see mr smith that in spite of your proof these boys will not believe that your charge is well founded that is neither here nor there roscoe will anyone step up and prove your innocence there was another sensation in the second row back a boy was seen to rise mr smith said ben platt i can prove roscoes innocence chapter xx hector gains a victory there were two persons on whom ben platts declaration made a profound impression these were jim smith and his uncle the learned socrates the latter was surprised for he was fully persuaded that the charge he had made was a true one and hector was a thief as for jim his surprise was of a very disagreeable nature knowing as he did that he himself had taken the money he was alarmed lest his offense was to be made known and that the pit which he had digged for another should prove to be provided for himself socrates was the first to speak after taking time to recover himself from his surprise this is a very extraordinary statement platt he said you say you can prove roscoes innocence yes sir answered platt firmly i wish no trifling here sir said the principal sharply i myself found the wallet in roscoes pocket yes sir answered ben platt i know it was there you knew it was there repeated socrates how did you know it was there because i saw it put in here jim smiths face turned from red to pale and he moved about uneasily in his seat could ben platt have been hidden somewhere in the room he asked himself if so what was he to do there was but one answer to this question he must brazen it out and boldly contradict the witness but he would bide his time he would wait to hear what ben had to say did you put it in yourself asked socrates savagely no mr smith i didnt put it in answered ben indignantly none of your impudence sir said the schoolmaster irritated i merely answered your question and defended myself answered ben there was a little murmur among the pupils showing that their sympathy was with the boy who had been so causelessly accused by the principal silence exclaimed socrates annoyed now he continued turning to ben since you know who put the wallet into roscoes pocket a very remarkable statement by the way will you deign to inform me who did it james smith did it said ben looking over to the principals nephew who was half expecting such an attack its a base lie cried jim but his face was blanched his manner was nervous and confused and he looked guilty if he were not so my nephew asked socrates flurried yes sir it isnt so uncle socrates said jim excited ill lick you ben platt when we get out of school you forget yourself james said socrates with a mildness he would not have employed with any other pupil i beg your pardon uncle socrates said jim with contrition but i cant be silent when i am accused of things i dont do to be sure you have some excuse but you should remember the respect you owe to me then you did not do it certainly not sir so it appears platt that you have brought a false charge against your fellowpupil said mr smith severely i can conceive of nothing meaner mr smith said hector what right have you to say that the charge is false is it the denial of your nephew if he took the wallet he would of course deny it so would you retorted socrates no one saw me conceal it said hector significantly then wilkins rose mr smith he said i have some evidence to offer out with it sir said the principal angrily for he was fighting against an iaward conviction that his nephew was really the guilty party i was walking along the corridor about the time platt speaks of smiths visit to roscoes room and i met your nephew walking in the opposite direction when i entered the room platt told me that halfconcealed by the closet door he had seen jim smith enter and thrust the wallet into roscoes pocket soon after you and mrs smith came into the room guided by your nephew who let you know just where the wallet was hidden he had very good reasons for knowing added wilkins if a look would have annihilated wilkins the look directed towards him by jim smith would have had that effect its a conspiracy against me uncle socrates said jim intent upon brazening it out theyre all in league together the testimony of wilkins doesnt amount to much said mr smith he may have seen james in the corridor but that is by no means a part of his complicity in this affair just so said jim eagerly ben platts evidence ought to count for something said hector he saw your nephew putting the wallet into the pocket of my pants socrates was clearly perplexed in spite of his partiality for his nephew the case against him certainly looked very strong hector however determined to make his defense even stronger i would like to ask platt he said at what time this took place at three oclock how do you know it was three asked the principal sharply because i heard the clock on the village church strike three i would like to ask another boy frank lewis if he heard the clock strike three lewis answered in the affirmative where were you at the time in the playground what were you doing playing ball was i in the game yes how long had the game been going on half an hour how long had the game been going on do you know from half to threequarters of an hour can you remember whether i was with you all the time you were now platt will you tell me how long after the wallet was put into my pocket before mr smith appeared in search of it not over half an hour i submit then said hector in a matteroffact manner that i was absent in the playground during the entire time when it was found in my room i believe this is what lawyers call an alibi that i have fortunately been able to prove you are a very smart lawyer sneered the principal the boys were by this time so incensed at mr smiths evident effort to clear his nephew at the expense of roscoe that there was a very audible hiss in which at least half a dozen joined is this rebellion asked socrates furiously no sir said ben platt firmly we want justice done that is all you shall have justice all of you exclaimed socrates carried beyond the limits of prudence i am glad to hear that sir said hector if you do not at once exonerate me from this charge which you know to be false and write to my guardian retracting it i will bring the matter before the nearest magistrate this was more than socrates had bargained for he saw that he had gone too far and was likely to wreck his prospects and those of the school i will look into the matter he said hurriedly and report to the school hereafter you may now apply yourselves to your studies chapter xxi the usher is discharged among the boys of smith institute there was but one opinion on the subject of the principals wallet all acquitted roscoe of having any part in the theft and they were equally unanimous in the belief that jim smith had contrived a mean plot against the boy whom he could not conquer by fair means there was a little informal consultation as to how jim should be treated it was finally decided to send him to coventry as this phrase which is well understood in english schools may not be so clear to my readers i will explain that jim was to be refused notice by his schoolfellows unless he should become aggressive when he was to be noticed in a manner far from agreeable jim could not help observing the cold looks of the boys who but lately were glad enough to receive notice from him and he became very angry as to being ashamed of the exposure he was not sensitive nor did he often have any feeling of that kind naturally vindictive he felt especially angry with the two boys ben platt and wilkins whose testimony had proved so uncomfortable for him ill thrash those boys if i never thrash another he said to himself so they have turned against me have they theyre only fit to black my boots anyway ill give em a lesson platt and wilkins were expecting an attack they knew that jim would seize the opportunity of attacking them singly and in the absence of hector of whom he was afraid and with good reason they concerted measures accordingly for defeating the common enemy jim was stalking about the next day looking sullen and feeling ugly he could not help observing that whenever he approached a group of boys they immediately scattered and walked away in various directions this naturally chafed him for having no intellectual resources he found solitude oppressive besides he had been accustomed to the role of boss and where is a boss without followers tired of the schoolroom precincts jim went to walk in a rustic lane much to his delight he saw approaching him one of the boys who had so seriously offended him it was ben platt ben was sauntering along in idle mood when he came face to face with the dethroned boss so its you platt is it said jim grimly i believe it is answered ben coolly ive got a word or two to say to you said jim significantly say them quick said ben for im in a hurry im not said jim in his old tone and it makes no difference whether you are or not indeed you are as polite as usual returned ben look here you young whelp jim broke forth unable any longer to restrain his wrath what did you mean by lying about me last evening i didnt lie about you said ben boldly yes you did what made you say you saw me put that wallet into roscoes pocket i cant think of any reason unless because it was true said ben even if it were how dared you turn against me first you play the spy and then informer paugh i see you admit it said ben well if you want an answer i will give you one you laid a plot for hector roscoe one of the meanest dirtiest plots i ever heard of and i wasnt going to see you lie him into a scrape while i could prevent it thats enough platt exclaimed jim furiously now do you know what i am going to do i dont feel particularly interested in the matter you will be then i am going to thrash you you wouldnt if hector roscoe were here said ben not appearing to be much frightened well he isnt here though if he were it wouldnt make any difference ill whip you so you cant stand bens reply was to call wilkins from a clump of bushes where he had lurked unobserved hitherto sprang wilkins and joined his friend there are two of us smith said ben platt i can thrash you both answered jim whose blood was up before the advent of hector no two boys would have ventured to engage jim in combat but his defeat by a boy considerably smaller had lost him his prestige and the boys had become more independent he still fancied himself a match for both however and the conflict began but both of his antagonists were in earnest and jim had a hard time now it so happened that mr crabb the usher was taking a solitary walk and had approached the scene of conflict unobserved by any of the participants he arrived at an opportune time jim had managed to draw wilkins away and by a quick movement threw him he was about to deal his prostrate foe a savage kick which might have hurt him seriously when the usher quiet and peaceful as he was by nature could restrain himself no longer he rushed up seized him by the collar dragged him back and shook him with a strength he did not suppose he possessed saying leave that boy alone you brute jim turned quickly and was very much surprised when he saw the meek usher whom he had always despised because he looked upon him as a miss nancy so its you is it he said with a wicked glance yes it is i answered the usher manfully come up just in time to stop your brutality is it any of your business demanded jim looking as if he would like to thrash the usher i have made it my business platt and wilkins i advise you to join me and leave this fellow who has so disgraced himself as to be beneath your notice we will accompany you with pleasure sir said the boys they regarded the usher with new respect for this display of courage for which they had not given him credit ill fix you crabb said jim smith insolently and dont you forget it mr crabb did not deign to answer him jim smith was as good as his word an hour later mr crabb was summoned to the presence of the principal socrates received him with marked coldness mr crabb he said i cannot conceal the amazement i feel at a complaint which has just been made by my nephew well sir mr crabb had nerved himself for the worst and did not cower or show signs of fear as socrates expected he would james tells me that you attacked him savagely this afternoon when he was having a little sport with two of his schoolfellows is that what he says mr smith yes sir and i require an explanation you shall have it the sport in which your nephew was engaged was attempting to thrash wilkins he had him down and was about to deal him a savage kick when i fortunately came up and joined in the fight sneered socrates yes if you choose to put it so would you have had me stand by and see wilkins brutally used of course you color the affair to suit yourself said socrates coldly the fact is that you an usher have lowered yourself by taking part in a playful schoolboy contest playful repeated mr crabb yes and i shall show how i regard it by giving you notice that i no longer require your services in my school i shall pay you up at the end of the week and then discharge you mr smith said the usher permit me to say that anything more disgraceful than your own conduct within the last twentyfour hours i have never witnessed you have joined your nephew in a plot to disgrace an innocent boy declining to do justice and now you have capped the climax by censuring me for stopping an act of brutality merely because your nephew was implicated in it this to me exclaimed socrates smith hardly crediting the testimony of his ears yes sir and more i predict that the stupid folly which has characterized your course will within six months drive from you every scholar you have in your school mr crabb gasped socrates never more surprised in his life than he was at the sudden spirit exhibited by the usher i will not be so insulted leave me and tomorrow morning leave my service i will sir i have no desire to remain here longer but when mr crabb had walked away his spirit sank withia him how was he to obtain another situation he must consult immediately with hector roscoe in whose judgment boy as he was he reposed great confidence chapter xxii the welcome letter hector said mr crabb nervously i am going to leave the institute at the end of the week have you secured another situation mr crabb asked hector hopefully no answered the usher shaking his head i have been discharged for what reason for interfering with mr smiths nephew when he was brutally abusing wilkins did mr smith fully understand the circumstances yes but he stands by his nephew right or wrong he blamed me for checking his nephews brutality this is shameful said hector warmly may i ask mr crabb if you have formed any plans no except to seek a new position answered crabb i fear he added despondently that it may be some time before i am so fortunate roscoe i dont know what to do when i leave the school i shall barely have five dollars and you know i have not only myself but another to support keep up your courage mr crabb it is nearly time for me to hear from the friend in new york to whom i wrote is your behalf if you can secure the position of his private tutor if i can i will hail it as providential it will relieve me at once from all anxiety i dont think i shall long remain here myself mr crabb said hector i came here with the full intention of making the most of the facilities the institute affords for education but i find the principal incompetent and disposed to connive at injustice and brutality the only good i have got here has been derived from your instructions thank you roscoe such a tribute is indeed welcome said the usher warmly it is quite sincere mr crabb and i hope my good wishes may bring you the advantage which i have in view thank you roscoe i dont blame you for being disgusted with the management of the school you have yourself suffered injustice yes in writing home and charging me with theft before he had investigated the circumstances mr smith did me a great injustice i doubt whether he has since written to correct the false charge as i required him to do if not i shall owe it to myself to leave the school you will be justified in doing so the next day brought hector two letters one was from allan roscoe and read as follows hector i have received from your worthy teacher a letter which has filled me with grief and displeasure i knew you had great faults but i did not dream that you would stoop so low as to purloin money as it seems you have done mr smith writes me that there is no room to doubt your guilt he himself discovered in the pocket of your pantaloons a wallet containing a large sum of money which he had missed only a short time before he learned that you had entered his chamber and taken the money being tempted by your own dishonest and depraved heart i cannot express the shame i feel at this revelation of baseness i am truly glad that you are not connected with me by blood yet i cannot forget that my poor brother treated you as a son and took pains to train you up in right ideas it would give him deep pain could he know how the boy whom he so heaped with benefits has turned out i may say that guy is as much shocked as i am but he it seems had a better knowledge of you than i for he tells me he is not surprised to hear it i confess i am for i thought better of you under the circumstances i shall not feel justified in doing for you as much as i intended i proposed to keep you at school for two years more but i have now to announce that this is your last term and i advise you to make the most of it i will try when the term closes to find some situation for you where your employers money will not pass through your hands allan roscoe hector read the letter with conflicting feelings the most prominent being indignation and contempt for the man who so easily allowed himself to think evil of him the other letter he found more satisfactory it was from his young friend in new york walter boss as it is short i subjoin it dear hector i am ever so glad to hear from you but i should like much better to see you i read to papa what you said of mr crabb and he says it is very apropos as he had made up his mind to get me a tutor i am rather backward you see not having your taste for study and papa thinks i need special attention he says that your recommendation is sufficient and he will engage mr crabb without any further inquiry and he says he can come at once he will give him sixty dollars a month and board and he will have considerable time for himself if he wants to study law or any other profession i dont know but a cousin may join me in my studies in which case he will pay a hundred dollars per month if that will be sastisfactory why cant you come and make me a visit well have jolly fun come and stay a month old chap there is no one i should like better your friend walter boss hector read this letter with genuine delight it offered a way of escape both for the unfortunate usher aad himself nothing could be more apropos to quote walters expression our hero lost no time in seeking out mr crabb you seem in good spirits roscoe said the usher his careworn face contrasting with the beaming countenance of his pupil yes mr crabb i have reason to be and so have you have you heard from your friend asked the usher hopefully yes and its all right mr crabb looked ten years younger is it really true he asked it is true that you are engaged as private tutor to my friend walter youll find him a splendid fellow but i dont know if the pay is sufficient continued hector gravely i am willing to take less pay than i get here said the usher for the sake of getting away how much do you receive here twenty dollar a month and board i might perhaps get along on a little less he added doubtfully you wont have to mr crabb you are offered sixty dollars a month and a home you are not in earnest roscoe asked the usher who could not believe in his good fortune i will read you the letter mr crabb when it was read the usher looked radiant roscoe he said you come to me like an angel from heaven just now i was sad and depressed now it seems to me that the whole future is radiant sixty dollars a month why it will make me a rich man mr crabb said hector with a lurking spirit of fun can you really make up your mind to leave smith institute and its kind and benevolent principal i dont think any prisoner ever welcomed his release with deeper thankfulness said the usher to be in the employ of a man whom you despise yet to feel yourself a helpless and hopeless dependent on him is i assure you roscoe a position by no means to be envied for two years that has been my lot but it will soon be over yes thanks to you why cant you accompany me hector i ought not perhaps to draw you away but but listen to the letter i have received from my kind and considerate guardian as he styles himself said hector he read allan roscoes letter to the usher he seems in a great hurry to condemn you said mr crabb yes and to get me off his hands said hector proudly well he shall be gratified in the last i shall accept walters invitation and we will go up to new york together that will indeed please me of course you will undeceive your guardian yes i will get wilkins and platt to prepare a statement of the facts in the case and accompany it by a note releasing mr roscoe from any further care or expense for me but hector can you afford to do this i cannot afford to do otherwise mr crabb i shall find friends and i am willing to work for my living if need be at this point one of the boys came to mr crabb with a message from socrates desiring the usher to wait upon him at once chapter xxiii another chance for the usher mr smith had been thinking it over he had discharged mr crabb in the anger of the moment but after his anger had abated he considered that it was not for his interest to part with him mr crabb was a competent teacher and it would be wellnigh impossible to obtain another so cheap twenty dollars a month for a teacher qualified to instruct in latin and greek was certainly a beggarly sum but mr crabbs dire necessity had compelled him to accept it where could he look for another teacher as cheap socrates smith appreciated the difficulty and decided to take mr crabb back on condition that he would make an apology to jim to do mr crabb justice it may be said that he would not have done this even if he saw no chance of another situation but this mr smith did not know he did observe however that the usher entered his presence calm erect and appearing by no means depressed as he had expected you sent for me sir said the usher interrogatively yes mr crabb you will remember that i had occasion to rebuke you when we last conferred together for overstepping the limits of your authority i remember mr smith that you showed anger and found fault with me exactly so why doesnt he ask to be taken back thought socrates i have thought the matter over since continued the principal and have concluded we might be able to arrange matters the usher was surprised he had not expected that mr smith would make overtures of reconciliation he decided not to mention at present his brighter prospects in new york but to wait and see what further his employer had to say mr crabb bowed but did not make any reply i take it for granted mr crabb that your means are limited proceeded socrates you are right there sir if i had not been poor i should not have accepted the position of teacher in smith institute for the pitiful salary of twenty dollars a month twenty dollars a month and your board mr crabb said socrates with dignity i consider a very fair remuneration i do not mr smith said the usher in a decided tone i apprehend you will find it considerably better than to be out of employment said socrates rather angry you are right there sir i am glad you show signs of returning reason well mr crabb i have thought the matter over and i have a proposal to make to you very well sir i do not wish to distress you by taking away your means of livelihood you are very considerate sir there was something in mr crabbs tone that socrates did not understand it really seemed that he did not care whether he was taken back or not but of course this could not be it was absolutely necessary for him poor as he was that he should be reinstated so mr smith proceeded to cut the matter short i am willing to take you back on two conditions may i ask you to name them the first is that you shall apologize to my nephew for your unjustifiable attack upon him day before yesterday what is the other mr smith the other is that hereafter you will not exceed the limits of your authority and you wish my answer asked the usher raising his eyes and looking fixedly at his employer if you please mr crabb then sir you shall have it your proposal that i should apologize to that overgrown bully for restraining him in his savage treatment of a fellowpupil is both ridiculous and insulting you forget yourself mr crabb said socrates gazing at the hitherto humble usher in stupefaction as to promising not to do it again you will understand that i shall make no such engagement then mr crabb said socrates angrily i shall adhere to what i said the other day at the end of this week you must leave me of course sir that is understood you havent another engagement i take it said mr smith very much puzzled by the ushers extraordinary independence yes sir i have indeed said socrates amazed where do you go then was mr crabbs time for triumph i have received this morning an offer from the city of new york he said from new york is it in a school no sir i am to be private tutor in a family indeed do you receive as good pay as here as good echoed the usher i am offered sixty dollars a month and board with the possibility of a larger sum in the event of extra service being demanded socrates smith had never been more surprised this mr crabb whom he had considered to be under his thumb as being wholly dependent upon him was to receive a salary which he considered princely how did you get this office he asked through my friend hector roscoe answered the usher probably he is deceiving you it is ridiculous to offer you such a sum i am quite aware that you would never think of offering it but mr smith there are other employers more generous mr crabb left the office with the satisfied feeling that he had the best of the encounter he would have felt gratified could he have known the increased respect with which he was regarded by the principal as a teacher who could command so lucrative an engagement in the great city of new york before closing this chapter i must take notice of one circumstance which troubled mr smith and in the end worked him additional loss i have already said that jim smith in appropriating his uncles wallet abstracted therefrom a fivedollar bill before concealing it in hectors pocket this loss mr smith speedily discovered and he questioned jim about it i suppose roscoe took it said jim glibly but he says he did not take the wallet said socrates who was assured in his own mind that his nephew was the one who found it on the bureau without stigmatizing him as a thief he concluded that jim meant to get hector into trouble wasnt it found in his pants pocket queried jim yes but why should he take five dollars out of the wallet i dont know it doesnt look likely that he would said socrates eying jim keenly then it may have been ben platt or wilkins said jim with a bright idea so it might said the principal with a feeling of relief they said they were in the room at any rate platt said so at the time it was concealed only he made a mistake and took roscoe for me there is something in that james it may be as you suggest they are both sneaks said jim who designated all his enemies by that name theyd just as lieve do it as not i never liked them i must look into this matter its clear that some one has got this money and whoever has it has got possession of it dishonestly to be sure answered jim with unblushing assurance if i were you i would find out who did it that is if you dont think roscoe did it no i dont think roscoe did it now you may tell platt and wilkins that i wish to see them jim could not have been assigned a more pleasing duty he hated the two boys quite as much as he did hector and he was glad to feel that they were likely to get into hot water he looked about for some time before he found the two boys at length he espied them returning from a walk here you two he called out in a voice ef authority youre wanted who wants us asked ben platt my uncle wants you answered jim with malicious satisfaction youd better go and see him right off too you wont find it a trifling matter either probably jim has been hatchng some mischief said wilkins he owes us a grudge well go and see what it is chapter xxiv the young detectives when mr smith had made the two boys understand that he suspected them of purloining the missing fivedollar bill they were naturally very indignant mr smith said ben platt in a spirited tone no one ever suspected me of dishonesty before nor me said wilkins thats neither here nor there said the principal dogmatically it stands to reason that some one took the money money doesnt generally walk off itself he added with a sneer i dont dispute that said ben but that does not prove that wilkins or i had anything to do with it you were in the room with the money for half an hour according to your own confession said socrates yes i was and part of that time wilkins was also present yes sir assented wilkins i am no lawyer said the principal triumphantly but that seems to me a pretty good case of circumstantial evidence you seem to forget sir that there is another person who had an excellent chance to take the money said ben platt you mean hector roscoe that is true it lies between you three no mr smith i do not mean hector roscoe i have as much confidence in roscoe as myself so have i sneered socrates and i know he would not take any money that did not belong to him i mean a very different person your nephew james smith socrates smith frowned with anger there seems to be a conspiracy against my unfortunate nephew he said i dont believe a word of your mean insinuations and i am not deceived by your attempt to throw your own criminality upon him it will not injure him in my eyes moreover i shall be able to trace back the theft to the wrongdoer the missing bill was marked with a cross upon the back and should either of you attempt to pass it your guilt will be made manifest i advise you to restore it to me while there is yet time the bill was marked asked wilkins eagerly yes then sir you may have a chance to find out who took it the discovery might not please you said socrates with a sneer it would give me the greatest pleasure mr smith if i can in any way help you discover the missing note i will do so you can go said socrates abruptly when the two boys had left the presence of the principal ben platt said what are you going to do about it wilkins first of all answered wilkins promptly i am going to find out if jim took that money how can you find out did you notice that he had come out with a new ring no i didnt observe it he has bought it since that money was lost said wilkins significantly do you think he purchased it with the missing bill i wouldnt wonder at all at any rate i am going to find out he must have bought it from washburn the jeweler will you go with me and ask yes answered ben eagerly let us go alone if we can only prove the theft upon jim so that old sock cant help believing that he stole the money we shall be cleared though as to that there isnt a scholar in school who would believe the charge against us still we may as well do what we can to bring the guilt home to jim smith ten minutes later the two boys entered the shop of mr washburn will you show me some rings mr washburn asked wilkins certainly answered the jeweler politely what is the price of that asked wilkins pointing to one exactly like the one he had seen on jims finger three dollars and a half it is a very pretty pattern yes sir theres one of our boys who has one just like it you mean james smith the principals nephew yes sir he bought it of me yesterday the two boys exchanged a quick glance they felt that they were on the brink of a discovery did he give you a fivedollar bill in payment asked ben platt yes answered the jeweler in surprise could you identify that bill what are you driving at boys asked mr washburn keenly i will explain to you if you will answer my questions first yes i could identify the bill have you it in your possession still i have how will you know it it seems to me my boy you are in training for a lawyer i have a very urgent reason for asking you this question mr washburn then i will answer you when the note was given me i noticed that it was on the park bank of new york will you be kind enough to see if you can find it certainly the jeweler opened his money drawer and after a brief search produced the bill in question it was a fivedollar bill on the park bank of new york as he had already told the boys now mr washburn asked wilkins trying to repress his excitement will you examine the back of the bill and see if there is any mark on it the jeweler did as requested and announced after slight examination that there was a cross on the back of the bill in the upper right hand corner hurrah shouted ben impulsively to the wondering jeweler he explained his precise object in the inquiry he had made and the boys were complimented by mr washburn for their shrewdness if i ever meet with a loss i shall certainly call on you for assistance boys he said thank you mr washburn answered wilkins but i do not expect to be here to be called upon you are not going to leave the institute are you i shall write to my father in what manner i have been treated and let him understand how the principal manages the school and i feel sure he will withdraw me ditto for me said ben platt old socks partiality for his nephew has been carried too far and now that the only decent teacher is going mr crabb i dont mean to stay here if i can help it the boys upon their return to the school sought out the principal well boys he said have you come to confess no sir answered ben but we have come to give you some information about your money i was sure you knew something about it said socrates with a sneer i am glad you have decided to make a clean breast of it you are mistaken sir well out with your information said the principal roughly a fivedollar bill marked as you have described was paid to mr washburn the jeweler only yesterday ha well the one who offered it purchased a gold ring i dont care what he bought who was it that offered the money your nephew james smith i dont believe it said the teacher very much disconcerted then sir i advise you to question mr washburn how can he identify the bill is it the only fivedollar bill he has the only fivedollar bill on the park bank of new york and he says he noticed that this was the bank that issued the bill handed him by your nephew what of that the note which he still has in his possession is marked just exactly as you have described it may have been marked since it came into mr washburns hands said socrates but he was evidently very much disturbed by the intelligence he might not confess it but he could not help believing that jim was the thief after all you can go he said harshly i will look into this improbable story chapter xxv smith institute grows unpopular hector lost no time in drawing up a statement of the facts connected with the loss of the wallet which he got wilkins and ben platt to sign this he put into an envelope directed to allan roscoe accompanied by a brief note which i subjoin mr roscoe i send you a statemeat signed by two of my schoolmates showing that the charge which mr smith was in such a hurry to bring against me in order to screen his nephew who is the real thief is wholly unfounded i am not particularly surprised that you were ready to believe it nor do i care enough for your good opinion to worry i consider that it is due to myself however to prove to you that i have done nothing of which i need be ashamed finding the scholars here in terror of a bully who imposed upon his schoolfellows with impunity because being the principals nephew he was protected in so doing i taught him a lesson which may not do him good but has certainly been of benefit to his fellowpupils in so doing i have incurred his enmity and that of his uncle who for more than one reason is utterly unfit to conduct a school of this kind you threaten to remove me from school at the end of this term i do not wish to remain and shall remove myself at the end of this week i shall not look to you for support nor do i expect again to depend upon the estate to which i once thought myself the heir unless i should be able to prove that i am the son of your brother as i fully believe notwithstanding the letter you exhibit hector roscoe when mr allan roscoe received this letter he was very much disturbed as he had no affection for hector and did not care what became of him this may perhaps excite surprise could it be the last sentence which excited his alarm is that letter from hector asked guy who had noticed the postmark as it lay upon his fathers table yes answered allan roscoe does he try to explain his theft asked guy he says he had nothing to do with it oh of course sneered guy you dont believe it do you he sends a statement of two of the pupils to the effect that the wallet was taken by another pupil a nephew of the principal thats too thin i dont know it may be true i dont like the boy but i hardly think it probable he would steal you think better of him than i do i suppose he wants to get into your good graces again no he says he shall leave school at the end of this week and will not again look to me for support thats jolly exclaimed guy much pleased youre well rid of him papa let him go away and make a living as he can hell have to turn newsboy or something of that sort perhaps hell have to be a bootblack wouldnt that be a good come down for a boy like hector guy spoke with great glee but his father did not seem to enjoy his release as well as guy he showed that he understood the boy better when he said hector will not have to resort to any such employmeat he has a good education and he can get some decent position probably on the whole i am sorry he is going to leave my protection for friends of the family may perhaps blame me but it isnt your fault papa he is taking his own course to be sure you are right there mr roscoe thought so much on the subject however that the next day he went to smith institute to see hector without telling guy where he was going arrived there he asked to see mr smith the latter did not appear to be in a happy frame of mind how do you do mr roscoe he said very well answered mr roscoe briefly mr smith i wish to see my ward i am sorry you cannot see him mr roscoe cannot see him why not because he has left the institute allan roscoe frowned why has he left he asked he has left against my will i think he has been influenced by an usher in my employ who has behaved very ungratefully i took him sir when he was in danger of starving and now he leaves me at a days notice after doing all he can to break up my school i feel no particular interest in your usher said allan roscoe coldly i wish to obtain information about the boy i placed under your charge do you know where he has gone no he did not tell me answered the principal you wrote me that he had been detected in stealing a wallet yes answered socrates embarrassed appearances were very much against him do you still think he took it i may have been mistaken answered mr smith nervously for he began to see that the course he had been pursuing was a very unwise one hector has written me inclosing a statement signed by two of his schoolfellows implicating your own nephew and he charges that you made the charge against him out of partiality for the same there is considerable prejudice against my nephew said socrates and for very good reasons i should judge said allan roscoe severely hector describes him as an outrageous bully and tyrant i am surprised mr smith that you should have taken his part now socrates had already had a stormy interview with his nephew though partial to jim and not caring whether or not he bullied the other boys as soon as he came to see that jims presence was endangering the school he reprimanded him severely he cared more for himself for number one than for anyone else in the universe he had been exceedingly disturbed by receiving letters from the fathers of wilkins and ben platt and two other fathers giving notice that they should remove their sons at the end of the term and demanding in the meantime that his nephew should be sent away forthwith and now allan roscoe whom he had hoped would side with him had also turned against him then he had lost the services of a competent usher whom he got cheaper than he could secure any suitable successor and altogether things seemed all going against him moreover jim who had been the occasion of all the trouble had answered him impudently and socrates felt that he had been badly used as to his own agency in the matter he did not give much thought to that my nephew is going to leave the school mr roscoe said socrates halfapologetically i should think it was full time mr smith perhaps so said smith but if i have stood by him it has been in ignorance i cannot think him as wrong as your ward has probably represented hector was jealous of him of his scholarship i presume well no answered the principal reluctantly but of his physical superiority and and influence in the school i may say in fact mr roscoe that till your ward entered the school it was a happy and harmonious family his coming stirred up strife and discontent and i consider him primarily responsible for all the trouble that has occurred i dont defend hector roscoe said allan but he writes me that your nephew was a bully who imposed upon his schoolfellows and that he by taking their part and stopping this tyranny incurred his illwill and yours i supposed i should be misrepresented said socrates meekly i am devoted to my school and my pupils mr roscoe i am wearing out my life in their service i may make mistakes sometimes but my heart my heart mr roscoe continued socrates tapping his waistcoat is right and acquits me of any intentional injustice i am glad to hear it mr smith said allan roscoe stiffly as hector has left you i have only to settle your bill and bid you goodday will you not exert your influence to persuade the boy to return pleaded socrates as i dont know where he is i dont see how i can said allan roscoe dryly that man is an arch hypocrite he said to himself as he was returning home i may state here that at the end of the term half the pupils left smith institute and socrates smith lamented too late the folly that had made him and his school unpopular chapter xxvi hectors arrival in new york mr crabb and hector were sitting side by side in a railroad car speeding away from smith institute in the heart of each was a feeling of relief which increased as each minute carried them farther away from the school hector said the usher looking younger and happier than his pupil had ever known him i feel like a free man now it is a feeling that i have not had since i first set foot in smith institute i think you will lead a happier life in new york mr crabb i am sure of it thanks to your considerate kindness i shall for the first time earn an ample salary and even be able to lay up money is my future pupil about your age he is a year younger where did you make his acquaintance at saratoga my father and i spent two months at congress hall two summers ago and as walters family were also there we naturally got to be friends he is a capital fellow and you will be sure to like him i am ready to like him after reading that letter he wrote you is he fond of study that is his weak point said hector laughing walter was never cut out for a scholar i dont mean of course that he hasnt fair capacity but his taste doesnt lie that way however he wont give you any trouble only you wont succeed as well as you may wish in pushing him on all boys are not cut out for scholars said the usher now you hector would do excellently and might hope to make a very successful professional man hector shook his head i must look to a different career he said i am to be the architect of my own fortune you know what are your plans hector asked the usher i will consult with mr boss walters father by the way he knows nothing of the change in my circumstances he supposes me to be the heir to the roscoe estate trouble has come upon you early hector should you need help hereafter you must remember that i am earning a good salary and thank you mr crabb gratefully but you will need all you earn i dont look upon my loss of fortune as a trouble i think it will make me more manly and selfreliant and stimulate me to exertion i have a fair education and i am sure i can earn my living in some honest way if that is your spirit hector i am sure you will succeed you are young and hopeful i am too much inclined to despond i have always been timid about the future it is a matter of temperament it was early in the afternoon when they reached new york as they emerged from the depot a brightfaced boy came up eagerly and greeted them how are you hector he said you see i came to meet you i have been longing to have you come i am just as glad to see you walter said hector heartily mr crabb here is your future pupil walter boss i hope we may soon be friends walter said the usher attracted by the bright sunny face of the boy walter gave the usher his hand i hope so too he said smiling ill try not to worry you any more than i can help i have no misgivings said mr crabb as he mentally contrasted his new pupil with jim smith and two or three others at the institute who had been a frequent source of trouble and annoyance here is the carriage said walter pointing out a plain but handsome carriage waiting outside bundle in both of you i beg your pardon mr crabb for my familiarity that was intended for hector i am ready to be classed with hector said mr crabb i am glad to hear you say so i was afraid you would be stiff and dignified i think i shall take my cue from you oh my rule is go as you please edward drive home the house occupied by mr boss was a fine brownstone dwelling on fortysecond street arrived there mr crabb was shown into a spacious chamber on the third floor furnished with a luxury to which the poor usher was quite unaccustomed now hector you can have a room to yourself or you may share my den said walter i would rather share the den said hector thats what i hoped you see we shall have ever so much to say to each other we havent seen each other for over a year a slight shade of gravity overspread hectors face since he had met his friend his father had died and he had been reduced from the heir of wealth to a penniless orphan of this last change walter knew nothing but hector did not mean long to leave him in ignorance at dinner the two newcomers saw mr ross from whom they received a friendly welcome the usher was put at his ease at once i hope youll get along with my boy said the bluff city merchant of one thing you may be assured your scholarship wont be severely taxed in educating him walter is a pretty good boy but he isnt a prodigy of learning i may be some day father said walter with mr crabbs help i take it mr crabb isnt able to perform miracles said mr ross goodhumoredly no mr crabb i shant expect too much of you get your pupil on moderately fast and i shall be satisfied i am glad hector that you were able to pay walter a visit at this time so am i sir i thought you might not be able to leave your studies i have given up study sir i am surprised at that hector i thought you contemplated going to college so i did sir but circumstances have changed my plans indeed yes sir i will explain after dinner and will ask your advice mr ross dropped the subject and after dinner led the way to the library where he sank into an armchair and breathing a sigh of satisfaction said this mr crabb is the most enjoyable part of the twentyfour hours for me i dismiss business cares and perplexities and read my evening paper or some new book in comfort as the usher looked about him and saw costly books engravings furniture and pictures he could well understand that in such surroundings the merchant could take solid comfort it was a most agreeable contrast to the plain and povertystricken room at smith institute where the boys pursued their evening studies under his superintendence well hector so you dont propose to go back to school said the merchant isnt that rather a sudden resolution yes sir but as i said circumstances have changed what circumstances because you are rich you dont think you ought to be idle i hope oh no sir it is because i have discovered that i am not rich not rich i always understood that your father left a large estate said mr ross in surprise so he did sir didnt it descend to you i thought so till recently why dont you think so now in answer hector told the story of the revelation made to him by allan roscoe after his fathers death you see therefore he concluded that i am penniless and a dependent upon mr allan roscoes generosity this is a most extraordinary story said the merchant after a pause yes sir it changes my whole future i suppose mr allan roscoe is the beneficiary and the estate goes to him yes sir did your father the late mr roscoe ever hint to you anything which could lead you to suspect that you were not his own but an adopted son never mr ross answered hector with emphasis did he continue to treat you with affection always nothing in his manner ever would have led me to imagine that i was not his own son he left no will no sir what are your plans i do not wish to remain dependent upon allan roscoe i should like to obtain a situation of some kind in the city if i can i can probably serve you then after a while for the present stay here as walters companion thank you sir i should like nothing better chapter xxvii larry deane not altogether in accordance with his inclinations walter was set to work at his studies immediately under the direction of mr crabb he asked his father for a weeks vacation to go about the city with hector but his father answered in the negative you are too far behind in your studies walter he said you are two years at least behind hector and cannot spare the time as well as he hector will have to go round alone objected walter it will do him no harm to get acquainted with the different parts of the city as that will be a kind of knowledge he may require if he should obtain a situation i shant see much of him oh yes you will mr crabb will not make you study all day mr crabb you may work with walter from nine to one this with perhaps an hour or more devoted to study in the afternoon or evening will enable him to make fair progress this arrangement struck walter favorably as he could whenever he desired it spend the whole afternoon with hector hector found it very pleasant to act upon the suggestion made by mr ross he had visited the city of new york at different times but had never enjoyed the opportunity of exploring it by himself his first visit was made to central park where he mingled with the crowds wandering about in search of pleasure he made his way to the lake and took passage in one of the skiffs which in charge of a skilled oarsman makes a tour of the pretty and picturesque sheet of water the second morning he turned his steps southward and walked down broadway it was a leisurely walk for he had no scruple in stopping wherever he saw anything in the streets or in the shop windows that seemed to him worthy of attention about the corner of canal street he was very much surprised at a boy who was on his knees blacking the boots of an elderly gentleman a boy whom he recognized at once as the son of a man who had for years been in his fathers employ as gardener at castle roscoe what brings him here thought hector much surprised larry deane he said as the boy finished his job and rose from his feet to receive his pay hector roscoe exclaimed larry not much less surprised what brings you here and what has reduced you to such work inquired hector larry deane was a boy of about hectors age he was a healthylooking country lad looking like many another farmers son fresh from the country he had not yet acquired that sharp keen look which characterizes in most cases the new york boy who has spent all his life in the streets i can answer both your questions with the same word master hector said larry as a sober look swept over his broad honest face dont call me master larry we are equals here but what is that word that word is trouble answered the bootblack come with me into this side street said hector leading the way into howard street you have a story to tell and i want to hear it yes i have a story to tell i hope your father and mother are well said hector interrupting him yes they are well in health but they are in trouble as i told you what is the trouble it all comes of mr allan roscoe answered larry and his son guy tell me all about it i was walking in the fields one day said larry when guy came out and began to order me round and call me a clodhopper and other unlikely names which i didnt enjoy finally he pulled off my hat and when i put it back on my head he pulled it off again finally i found the only way to do was to give him as good as he sent so i pulled off his hat and threw it up in a tree he became very angry and ordered me to go up after it i wouldnt do it but walked away the next day my father was summoned to the house where mr allan roscoe complained of me for insulting his son he asked my father to thrash me and when father refused he discharged him from his employment a day or two afterward a new gardener came to roscoe castle and father understood that there was no chance of his being taken back that was very mean in mr roscoe said hector indignantly yes so it was but father couldnt do anything he couldnt get a new place for it wasnt the right time of year and mr roscoe said he wouldnt give him a recommendation well we had very little money in the house for mother has been sick of late years and all fathers extra earnings went to pay for medicines and the doctors bill so one day i told father i would come to new york and see if i couldnt find something to do i think you did the right thing larry said hector approvingly it was your duty to help your father if you could i cant help him much answered larry what made you take up this business larry i couldnt get anything else to do besides this pays better than working in a store or office how much can you earn at it six or seven dollars a week i should think it would require all that to support you it would if i went to a boarding house but i cant afford that where do you live at the newsboys lodging house how much does that cost you for eighteen cents a day i get supper lodging and breakfast in the middle of the day i go to a cheap restaurant then you are able to save something yes last week i sent home three dollars the week before two dollars and a half why that is doing famously you are a good boy larry thank you hector but though it is doing very well for me it isnt as much as they need at home besides i cant keep it up as after a while i shall need to buy some new clothes if your father had been alive my father would never have lost his place master hector wont you use your influence with your uncle to have him taken back hector felt keenly how powerless he was in the matter he looked grave as he answered larry you may be sure that i would do all in my power to have your father restored to the position from which he never should have been removed but i fear i can do nothing wont you write to mr roscoe pleaded larry who of course did not understand why hector was powerless yes i will write to him but i am sorry to say that i have very little influence with mr roscoe that is strange said larry and you the owner of the estate hector did not care to explain to larry just how matters stood so he only said i cant explain to you what seems strange to you larry but i may be able to do so some time i will certainly write to mr roscoe as you desire but you must not build any hopes upon it meanwhile will you accept this from me and send it to your father as he spoke he drew from his pocketbook a fivedollar bill and handed it to his humble friend larry would not have accepted it had he known that hector was nearly as poor as himself but supposing him to be the heir of a large and rich estate he felt no hesitation thank you very much hector he said you had always a kind heart this money will do my father very much good i will send it to him today do you generally stand here larry asked hector yes then i will take pains to see you again shall you stay long in the city master hector not master hector then hector if you dont mind i shall be here for the present i dont know how long then let me black your boots for nothing every time you come by i want to do something for you thank you larry but i dont like to have a friend perform such a service remember me to your father when you write i wish i could do something for larry said hector to himself as he walked away as it is i stand in need of help myself he was to make a friend that day under rather unusual circumstances chapter xxviii two more acquaintances hector continued his walk downtown despite the crowds of persons who thronged the sidewalks he did not anticipate meeting anyone else that he knew but he was destined to another surprise on the corner of murray street he saw two persons advancing toward him the last perhaps that he expected to see not to keep the reader in suspense it was allan roscoe and his son guy guy was the first to recognize hector of course he too was surprised why theres hector he exclaimed directing his fathers attention to our hero allan roscoe looked up quickly it is hard to tell whether he felt glad or the reverse at this meeting with the boy whom he called his ward an instant later hector recognized guy and his father how do you do mr roscoe he said politely very well when did you reach new york on saturday it should have been explained that hector had spent sunday quietly with mr ross and walter and that this was monday ahem i was very much surprised at your leaving the institute said mr roscoe i explained to you in my letter why i proposed to leave it hector answered coldly i did not think your reason sufficient as mr smith saw fit to bring a base charge against me and persisted in it even after he must have been convinced that his nephew was guilty i was unwilling to remain under his charge any longer the circumstances were against you said mr roscoe you might have known me better than that mr roscoe said hector proudly yet you condemned me unheard of course i am very glad that the charge is unfounded said mr roscoe awkwardly where there is smoke there is generally fire said guy spitefully i understand you guy said hector half turning to look at the boy who had usurped his place i hope you wont think it impolite if i say that i care nothing whatever for your opinion you put on as many airs as ever sneered guy i should think you would be a little more humble in your changed position i have not changed even if my position has answered hector money is nothing to be proud of i apprehend that the world judges differently said allan roscoe since you have taken your destiny into your own hands you will excuse me for asking how you intend to earn your living i hope to get a mercantile position answered hector take my advice said guy with a derisive smile and buy yourself a blacking box and brush i am told bootblacks make a good deal of money hush guy said his father do not insult hector but hector concerned himself but little with any slight received from guy roscoe his words however recalled his thoughts to the boy he had so recently met larry deane and he resolved to see if he could not help him by an appeal to allan roscoe mr roscoe said he quickly i nearly forgot something i want very much to say to you what is it asked his guardian suspiciously it occurred to him that hector wished to borrow some money and he was considering how little he could decently give him i hear you have discharged reuben deane from his position how did you hear it from his son larry where did you see larry asked allan in some curiosity he has been driven to take up that employment which guy so kindly recommended to me larry deane a bootblack thats a good one exclaimed guy with evident relish i dont think so said hector the poor boy is picking a poor living and sending home what he can to his father who cannot get new employment mr roscoe why did you discharge him i can answer that question though its none of your business all the same volunteered guy the boy larry was impudent to me and his father took his part mr roscoe said hector reuben deane was in my fathers employ before i was born larry and i used to play together when we were little boys and since when we were older a bootblack is a nice playmate said guy with his usual sneer he was not a bootblack then retorted hector nor would he be now but for your mean spite mr roscoe as i happen to know my father always valued the services of reuben deane and i ask in his name that you give him back his place my brother may have been deceived in him said allan roscoe coldly emphasizing the first two words in order to remind hector that he was no longer to consider him as his father but i cannot promise to adopt all his views and proteges i have displaced deane and substituted for him a gardener with whom i am better pleased have you no sympathy for the poverty and distress of a man who has served our family faithfully for so many years asked hector half indignantly my father is competent to manage his own affairs said guy offensively you dont appear to think so or you would not answer for him retorted hector boys i must request you to desist from this bickering said allan roscoe i am sorry hector that i cannot comply with your request by the way you did not tell me where you were staying with a gentlman on fortysecond street what is his name andrew ross not the eminent merchant of that name asked allan roscoe in surprise yes i believe so he is worth a million i supposed he was rich he lives in an elegant house where did you get acquainted with him hector at saratoga a year and a half ago did you beg him to take you in asked guy unpleasantly hector quietly ignored the question walter boss and i have been very intimate and i was invited to pay him a visit does he know that you are a poor boy asked guy i have communicated to mr ross what your father told me answered hector coldly he is a real friend and it made no difference in his treatment of me i hope to get a situation through his influence you are lucky to have such a man for a friend said allan roscoe who would himself have liked to become acquainted with a man whose social position was so high i hope you will not misrepresent me to him should any opportunity occur i will try to procure you employment thank you sir said hector but his tone lacked heartiness he saw that his being a visitor to mr ross and his son had made a difference in his favor guy too began to think he might be a little more gracious he like his father liked to associate with boys of high social position and he would have liked to be introduced to walter ross what is your number he asked of hector i dont know but ill call and see you some time is walter ross generally at home dont put yourself to any inconvenience to call said hector significantly walter and i are generally away in the afternoon oh i dont care to call upon you said guy annoyed i can have all the company i want i wont detain you any longer mr roscoe said hector realizing that the conversation had occupied considerable time goodmorning that boy is as proud as ever said guy after hector had left them he doesnt seem to realize that he has lost his money he has not had time to realize it yet it wont be long before he will understand the difference it makes i am glad he isnt my cousin continued guy i dislike him more than any boy i know allan roscoe looked thoughtful i fear that boy will give me trouble yet he said to himself he evidently suspects that something is wrong chapter xxix jim smith effects a loan after parting with allan roscoe and guy hector kept on his way downtown he did not expect to meet any more acquaintances but he was again to be surprised standing on the sidewalk having his boots blacked he recognized the schoolfellow he had least reason to like jim smith what brings jim here he asked himself in some surprise he did not feel inclined to go up and claim acquaintance but it chanced that he became witness of a piece of meanness characteristic of jim when the young bootblack had finished polishing his shoes he waited for his customary fee jim fumbled in his pockets and finally produced two cents there boy he said placing them in the hand of the disgusted knight of the brush whats that for he asked its your pay look here mister youve made a mistake heres only two cents i know it do you think i work for any such price as that perhaps you expect a dollar sneered jim no i dont but a nickels my lowest price plenty of gentlemen give me a dime thats too much ive paid you all im going to wait a minute that boot dont look as well as the other jim unsuspiciously allowed the boy to complete his work but he had occasion to regret it the bootblack hastily rubbed his brush in the mud on the sidewalk and daubed it on one of jims boots quite effacing the shine there thatll do he said and scrambling to his feet ran round the corner then for the first time jim looked down and saw what the boy had done he uttered an exclamation of disgust and looked round hastily to see where the offender had betaken himself his glance fell upon hector who was quietly looking on and not without a sense of enjoyment it often happens that we greet cordially those for whom we have even a feeling of aversion when we meet them unexpectedly away from our usual haunts jim who was beginning to regret that circumstances had forced him to leave the serene sanctuary of smith institute since now he would be under the necessity of making his own living was glad to see our hero is it you roscoe he said eagerly yes answered hector coolly what are you doing walking about the city just at present suppose we go together hector hardly knew how to refuse and the two boys kept down broadway in company youre surprised to see me aint you asked jim rather so you see i got tired of the school ire been there three years so i told my uncle i would come to new york and see if i couldnt get work i hope you may succeed said hector for he would not allow his dislikes to carry him too far he felt that there was room in the world for jim and himself too are you going to work asked jim i hope so got anything in view not exactly it would be a good thing if we could get into the same place do you say that because we have always agreed so well asked hector amused we may be better friends in future said jim with a grin hector was judiciously silent where are you staying up on fortysecond street thats a good way uptown isnt it yes pretty far up are you boarding no i am visiting some friends couldnt you get me in there as one of your school friends this question indicated such an amount of assurance on the part of his old enemy that at first hector did not know how to reply in fitting terms i couldnt take such a liberty with my friends he said besides it doesnt strike me that we were on very intimate terms but jim was not sensitive to a rebuff the fact is he continued i havent got much money and it would be very convenient to visit somebody perhaps you could lend me five dollars i dont think i could i think i shall have to say goodmorning i cant make anything out of him said jim to himself philosophically i wonder if hes got any money uncle socrates told me his uncle had cast him off going up broadway instead of down it was not long before jim met allan roscoe and guy whom he immediately recognized not being troubled with immodesty he at once walked up to mr roscoe and held out his hand goodmorning mr roscoe he said in an ingratiating voice goodmorning young man where have i met you asked allan roscoe puzzled at smith institute i am the nephew of mr smith what not the nephew who mr roscoe found it hard to finish the sentence he didnt like to charge jim with stealing to his face i know what you mean said jim boldly i am the one whom your nephew charged with taking money which he took himself i dont want to say anything against him as he is your nephew but he is an artful young but no matter you are his uncle he is not my nephew but was only cared for by my brother said allan roscoe you may tell me freely my good fellow all the truth you say that hector stole the money which your uncle lost yes but he has made my uncle believe that i took it it is hard upon me said jim pathetically as i was dependent upon my uncle i have been driven forth into the cold world by my benefactor because your nephew prejudiced his mind against me i believe him papa said guy who was only too glad to believe anything against hector i have thought all along that hector was guilty is that your son asked the crafty jim i wish he had come to the institute instead of hector he is a boy that i couldnt help liking there are few who are altogether inaccessible to flattery at any rate guy was not one of this small number i feel sure you are not guilty said guy regarding jim graciously it was a very mean thing in hector to get you into trouble it was indeed said jim i am cast out of my uncles house and now i have no home and hardly any money hector is in the city have you seen him asked allan roscoe yes i met him a few minutes since did you speak to him yes i reproached him for getting me into trouble but he only laughed in my face he told me he hated you both added jim ingenuously just like hector said guy what have i always told you papa i am sorry you have suffered such injustice at the hands of anyone in any way connected with my family said mr roscoe who like guy was not indisposed to believe anything to the discredit of hector i do not feel responsible for his unworthy acts but i am willing to show my sympathy by a small gift he produced a fivedollar note and put it into jims ready hand thank you sir he said you are a gentleman so the interview closed and jim left the spot chuckling at the manner in which he had wheedled so respectable a sum out of allan roscoe meanwhile hector after looking about him turned and getting into a broadway stage rode uptown as far as twentythird street where the stage turned down toward sixth avenue he concluded to walk the remainder of the way as he was walking up madison avenue his attention was drawn to a little girl in charge of a nursemaid the latter met an acquaintance and forgot her charge the little girl left to herself attempted to cross the street just as a private carriage was driven rapidly up the avenue the driver was looking away and it seemed as if through the double neglect of the driver and the nurse the poor child would be crushed beneath the hoofs of the horses and the wheels of the carriage chapter xxx a brave deed hectors heart stood still as he realized the peril of the child he dashed forward on the impulse of the moment and barely succeeded in catching up the little girl and drawing her back out of harms way the driver who had done his best to rein up his horses but without success ejaculated with fervent gratitude for he too had a child of his own about the age of the little girl god bless you boy the little girl seemed less concerned than anyone of the spectators she put her hand confidently in hectors and said take me to mary and who is mary asked hector kindly he did not require an answer for the nurse who rather late in the day had awakened to the fact that her charge was in danger came running forward crying oh miss gracie what made you run away the little girl would have been killed but for this boys timely help said a middleaged spectator gravely im sure i dont know what possessed her to run away said mary confusedly she wouldnt if she had been properly looked after said the gentleman sharply for he had children of his own hector was about to release the child now that he had saved her but she was not disposed to let him go you go with me too she said she was a pretty child with a sweet face rimmed round by golden curls her round red cheeks glowing with exercise what is her name asked hector of the nurse grace newman answered the nurse who felt the necessity of saying something in her own defense shes a perfect little runaway she worries my life out running round after her grace newman said the middleaged gentleman already referred to why she must be the child of my friend titus newman of pearl street yes sir said the nurse my old friend little knows what a narrow escape his daughter has had i hope you wont tell him sir said mary nervously why not because he would blame me and so he ought said the gentleman nodding vigorously its no merit of yours that she wasnt crushed beneath the wheels of that carriage if you had been attending to your duty she wouldnt have been in danger i dont see as its any business of yours said mary pertly you aint her father or her uncle i am a father and have common humanity said the gentleman and i consider you unfit for your place come along grace said mary angry at being blamed youve behaved very badly and im going to take you home wont you come too asked the little girl turning to hector no theres no call for him to come said the nurse pulling the child away goodby gracie said hector kindly goodby responded the child these nursemaids neglect their charges criminally said the gentleman directing his remarks to hector mr newman owes his childs safety perhaps her life to your prompt courage she was in great danger said hector i was afraid at first i could not save her a second later and it would have been too late what is your name my brave young friend hector roscoe sir it is a good name do you live in the city at present i do sir i was brought up in the country going to school i take it i am looking for a place sir i wish i had one to give you i retired from business two years since and have no employment for anyone thank you sir i should have liked to serve you but ill tell you what my young friend i have a considerable acquaintance among business men if you will give me your address i may have something to communicate to you ere long thank you sir hector drew a card from his pocket and added to it the number of mr ross house i am much obliged to you for your kind offer he said you dont look as if you stood in need of employment said the gentleman noticing the fine material of which hectors suit was made appearances are sometimes deceitful said hector half smiling you must have been brought up in affluence said mr davidson for this was his name yes sir i was till recently i supposed myself rich you shall tell me the story some time now i must leave you well thought hector as he made his way homeward i have had adventures enough for one morning when hector reached the house in fortysecond street he found walter just rising from his lessons well hector what have you been doing asked walter wandering about the city did you see anybody you knew while doing so oh yes i was particularly favored i saw allan roscoe and guy you dont say so were they glad to see you not particularly when guy learned that i was staying here he proposed to call and make your acquaintance i hope you didnt encourage him said walter with a grimace no i told him that we were generally out in the afternoon that is right i suppose you have been hard at work walter ask mr crabb walter has done very well said the usher if he will continue to study as well i shall have no fault to find if i do will you qualify me to be a professor in twelve months time i hope not for in that case i should lose my scholar and have to bow to his superior knowledge then you dont know everything mr crabb far from it i hope your father didnt engage me in any such illusion because said walter i had one teacher who pretended to know all there was worth knowing i remember how annoyed he was once when i caught him in a mistake in geography i shall not be annoyed at all when you find me out in a mistake for i dont pretend to be very learned then i think well get along said walter favorably impressed by the ushers modesty i suppose if i didnt know anything we should get along even better said mr crabb amused well perhaps that might be carrying things too far walter admitted in the afternoon hector and walter spent two hours at the gymnasium in twentyeighth street and walked leisurely home after a healthful amount of exercise for some reason which he could not himself explain hector said nothing to walter about his rescue of the little girl on madison avenue though he heard of it at the gymnasium one of the boys henry carroll said to walter there was a little girl came near being run over on madison avenue this noon did you see it no but i heard of it who was the little girl grace newman i know who she is how did it happen the boy gave a pretty correct account some boy saved her he concluded by running forward and hauling her out of the road just in time he ran the risk of being run over himself mr newman thinks everything of little grace id like to be in that boys shoes neither of the boys noticed that hectors face was flushed as he listened to the account of his own exploit the next morning among the letters laid upon the breakfast table was one for hector roscoe a letter for you hector said mr ross examining the envelope in some surprise are you acquainted with titus newman the pearl street merchant no sir answered hector in secret excitement he seems to have written to you said mr ross hector took the letter and tore open the envelope chapter xxxi an important letter the letter alluded to in the last chapter ran thus it was written from mr newmans house in madison avenue though inclosed in a business envelope master hector roscoe i learn that i am indebted to you for the rescue of my little daughter from imminent peril during my absence from home yesterday a friend who witnessed her providential escape has given me such an account of your bravery in risking your own life to save that of an unknown child that i cannot rest till i have had an opportunity of thanking you in person you will do me a favor if not otherwise engaged if you will call at my house this evening about eight oclock yours gratefully titus newman it is needless to say that hector read this letter with feelings of gratification it is true as we are often told that virtue is its own reward but it is nevertheless pleasant to feel that our efforts to do well and serve others are appreciated no bad news i hope hector said walter no answered hector you may read the letter if you like mr ross mr ross did so and aloud much to the surprise of everyone at table you did not tell me of this said walter in astonishment no answered hector smiling but why not because hector is modest mr ross answered for him now if you had done such a thing walter we should have been sure to hear of it i dont know returned walter comically you dont know how many lives i have saved within the last few years nor anyone else i fancy replied his father by the way hector there is a paragraph about it in the herald of this morning i read it little suspecting that you were the boy whose name the reporter was unable to learn hector read the paragraph in question with excusable pride it was in the main correct how old was the little girl asked walter four years old i should think that isnt quite so romantic as if she had been three times as old i couldnt have rescued her quite as easily in that case of course hector was called upon for an account of the affair which he gave plainly without adding any of those embellishments which some boys possibly some of my young readers might have been tempted to put in you are fortunate to have obliged a man like titus newman hector said mr ross he is a man of great wealth and influence do you know him papa asked walter no that is not at all well i have been introduced to him punctually at eight oclock hector ascended the steps of a handsome residence on madison avenue the door was opened by a colored servant of imposing manners is mr newman at home asked hector politely yes sar be kind enough to hand him this card yes sar presently the servant reappeared saying mr newman will see you sar in the library i will induct you thither thank you answered hector secretly amused at the airs put on by his sable conductor seated at a table in a handsomely furnished library sat a stout gentleman of kindly aspect he rose quickly from his armchair and advanced to meet our hero i am glad to see you my young friend he said sit there pointing to a smaller armchair opposite so you are the boy who rescued my dear little girl his voice softened as he uttered these last few words and it was easy to see how strong was the paternal love that swelled his heart i was fortunate in having the opportunity mr newman you have rendered me a service i can never repay when i think that but for you the dear child his voice faltered dont think of it mr newman said hector earnestly i dont like to think of it myself and you exposed yourself to great danger my boy i suppose i did sir but that did not occur to me at the time it was all over in an instant i see you are modest and do not care to take too great credit to yourself but i shall not rest till i have done something to express my sense of your noble courage now i am a man of business and it is my custom to come to the point directly is there any way in which i can serve you yes sir i am glad to hear it name it i am looking for a situation in some mercantile establishment mr newman pardon me but judging from your appearance i should not suppose that it was a matter of importance to you yes sir i am poor you dont look so you judge from my dress no doubt hector was attired in a suit of fine texture i suppose i may say he added with a smile that i have seen better days surely you are young to have met with reverses if that is what you mean to imply the merchant remarked observing our hero with some curiosity yes sir if you have time i will explain to you how it happened as the story has already been told i will not repeat hectors words mr newman listened with unaffected interest it is certainly a curious story he said did you then quietly surrender your claims to the estate simply upon your uncles unsupported assertion i beg pardon sir he showed me my fathers that is mr roscoes letter call him your father for i believe he was do you sir asked hector eagerly i do your uncles story looks like an invention let me think was your fathers name edward roscoe yes sir and in what year were you born in the year at sacramento yes sir then i feel quite sure that i made your fathers acquaintance in the succeeding year and your own as well though you were an infant that is you were less than a year old did my father say anything of having adopted me no on the contrary he repeatedly referred to you as his child and your mother also displayed toward you an affection which would have been at least unusual if you had not been her own child then you think sir hector began i think that your uncles story is a mere fabrication he has contrived a snare in which you have allowed yourself to be enmeshed i am only a boy sir i supposed there was nothing for me to do but to yield possession of the estate when my uncle showed me the letter it was natural enough and your uncle doubtless reckoned upon your inexperience and ignorance of the law what would you advise me to do sir let me think the merchant leaned back in his chair closed his eyes and gave himself up to reflection in the midst of his reverie the pompous servant entered bringing a letter upon a silver salver a letter sar he said that will do you can go augustus yes sar mr newman glanced at the postmark tore open the letter read it with a frown and then as if he had suddenly formed a resolution he said this letter has helped me to a decision hector regarded him with surprise what could the letter have to do with him have you any objection to going out to california by the next steamer asked mr newman no sir answered hector with animation am i to go alone yes alone chapter xxxii a wayward youth it is needless to say that hector was very much surprised not to say startled at this sudden proposal what could mr newman possibly want him to go to california for if on business how did it happen that he trusted a mere boy with so responsible a mission the explanation came soon no doubt you are surprised said the merchant at the proposal i have made you i am not prepared myself to say that i am acting with good judgment in making it i have obeyed a sudden impulse which is not always prudent yet in more than one instance i have found advantage in obeying such an impulse but to my explanation by the way let me first ask you two or three questions have you any taste for any kind of liquor no sir answered hector promptly even if you had do you think you would have selfcontrol enough to avoid entering saloons and gratifying your tastes yes sir that is well do you play pool no sir answered hector wondering whither all these questions tended i ask because playing pool in public rooms paves the way for intemperance as bars are generally connected with such establishments i dont even know how to play pool sir said hector do you ever bet or gamble continued the merchant no sir you will understand why i ask all these questions when i tell you that i have a nephew now nineteen years of age who does all these things he is not only my nephew but my ward i have a moderate sum of money in my charge which belongs to him enough if he were a young man of correct habits to buy him an interest in a respectable business that use i had proposed to make of it when he reached twentyone or rather to recommend to him but for his yielding to temptation in more than one form and finally running away from my protection where is he now sir in california three months since he disappeared and it was some weeks before i learned where he had gone as i do not intend to conceal anything from you i must tell you that he carried with him five hundred dollars purloined from my desk this grieved me most of all i wrote out to a mercantile friend in san francisco who knows the boy by sight to hunt him up and see if he could do anything for him he writes me this is the letter i hold in my hand that he has seen gregory and expostulated with him but apparently without effect the boy has pretty much run through his money and will soon be in need i do not intend however to send him money for he would misuse it i dont think it will do him any harm to suffer a little privation as a fitting punishment for his wayward courses i would not wish him to suffer too much and i am anxious lest he should go further astray i now come to the explanation of my proposal to you i wish you to go to california to seek out gregory obtain his confidence and then persuade him to give up his bad course and come home with you prepared to lead a worthier life are you willing to undertake it yes sir answered hector i will undertake it since you are willing to place such a responsibility upon me i will do my best to accomplish what you desire but i may fail in that case i will not blame you answered the merchant what sort of a boy is gregory shall i find it difficult to gain his confidence no he is a youth of very amiable disposition indeed he was generally popular among his companions and associates but he is morally weak and finds it difficult to cope with temptation i believe that a boy like you will stand a better chance of influencing him than a man of mature age i will do my best sir one thing more you may assure gregory that i forgive him the theft of my money though it gave me great pain to find him capable of such an act and that i am prepared to receive him back into my favor if he will show himself worthy of it i will give you a letter to that effect now when will you be ready to start by the next steamer that is well chapter xxxiii mr roscoe makes a discovery the california steamer was to start in two days this gave hector but little time for preparation but then he had but scanty preparation to make mr ross and walter were naturally surprised at the confidence placed in hector by a stranger but were inclined to think that our hero would prove himself worthy of it dont be gone long hector said walter i shall miss you i depended upon having your company for a good while yet come back to my house hector said mr ross cordially when you return whether you are successful or not consider it a home where you are always welcome thank you sir said hector gratefully i wish you were my uncle instead of mr allan roscoe by the way hector take time while you are in california to go to sacramento to see if you can learn anything of your early history it is most important to you and im sure mr newman will not object he has already suggested it to me said hector moreover he has given me the name of the minister who baptized me and should he be dead or removed he has given me the name of another person a lady with whom my father boarded during his residence in sacramento it is to be hoped that one or the other of these persons may still be living it will afford me sincere pleasure if by reliable testimony you can defeat the wicked conspiracy into which mr roscoe has entered with the object of defrauding you of your inheritance hectors ticket was purchased by mr newman and he was provided with a considerable sum of money as well as an order upon a bank in san francisco for as much more as he might need you are trusting me to an unusual extent mr newman said hector that is true but i have no hesitation in doing so i am a close observer and though i have seen but little of you i have seen enough to inspire me with confidence i hope i shall deserve it sir that depends upon yourself so far as integrity and fidelity go whether you succeed or not in your undertaking depends partly upon circumstances my young readers may wonder how hector would be expected to recognize a young man whom he had never seen he was provided with a photograph of gregory which had been taken but six months before and which as mr newman assured him bore a strong resemblance to his nephew he may have changed his name he said but he cannot change his face with this picture you will be able to identify him the great steamer started on her long voyage walter and mr crabb stood on the pier and watched it till hectors face was no longer distinguishable for the distance and then went home each feeling that he had sustained a loss among those who watched the departure of the steamer was a person who escaped hectors notice for he arrived just too late to bid goodby to an acquaintance who was a passenger on board this person was no other than allan roscoe when he recognized hectors face among the passengers he started in surprise and alarm hector roscoe going to california he inwardly ejaculated what can be his object and where did he raise money to go conscience whispered he has gone to ferret out the fraud which you have practiced upon him and his mission is fraught with peril to you allan roscoe returned to his elegant home in a state of nervous agitation which effectually prevented him from enjoying the luxuries he was now able to command a sword seemed suspended over him but he resolved not to give up the large stake for which he played so recklessly without a further effort by the next mail he wrote a confidential letter to an old acqaintance in san francisco chapter xxxiv first impressions of san francisco hector was seasick for the first twentyfour hours but at the end of that time he had become accustomed to the rise and fall of the billows and was prepared to enjoy himself as well as he could in the confined quarters of an ocean steamer of course he made acquaintances among them was a clergyman of middle age who was attracted by our heros frank countenance they met on deck and took together the constitutional which travelers on shipboard find essential for their health you seem to be alone said the clergyman yes sir pardon me but it is uncommon to meet one so young as yourself who is making so long a journey i suppose however you have friends or relatives in california no sir i know no one to my knowledge in the golden state then perhaps you go out in search of employment no sir i go out on business you are a young business man said the clergyman smiling perhaps i should rather say on a mission i am sent out by a new york merchant in search of his nephew who is somewhere in san francisco hector explained himself further the minister mr richards listened with attention certainly he said a great responsibility rests upon you mr newman must have great confidence in you i hope he will not find it misplaced answered hector modestly it is certainly a compliment to you that a shrewd business man should consider you worthy of such confidence the presumption is that he has good reason for his confidence i think my young friend that you will enjoy your visit to our state then you reside there sir oh yes i went out twenty years since in fact just after i graduated from the theological school i spent a year at the mines but at the end of that time finding an opening in my profession i accepted the charge of a church in sacramento in sacramento exclaimed hector eagerly yes have you any associations with that city it is my birthplace sir then you are not a stranger to california yes sir i came away so early that i have no recollection of the place what is your name asked the clergyman hector roscoe roscoe the name sounds familiar to me said the minister thoughtfully how long since you went to sacramento mr richards i went there in and i was born there in my father and mother lived there for some time afterwards it is probable that i met them for sacramento was a small place then shall you go there yes sir i have a special reason for going a reason most important to me as mr richards naturally looked inquisitive hector confided in him further you see sir he concluded that it is most important to me to ascertain whether i am really the son of the man whom i have always regarded as my father if so i am heir to a large fortune if not my uncle is the heir and i certainly should not wish to disturb him in the enjoyment of what the law awards him that is quite proper said mr richards in your investigation it is quite possible that i may be able to help you materially through my long residence and extensive acquaintance in sacramento when you come there lose no time in calling upon me whatever help i can render you shall cheerfully be given thank you sir shall you be much disappointed if you find that you are only the adopted instead of the real son of mr roscoe yes sir but it wont be chiefly on account of the property i shall feel alone in the world without relations or family connections with no one to sympathize with me in my successes or feel for me in my disappointments i understand you and i can enter into your feelings arrived in san francisco hector took lodgings at a comfortable hotel on kearney street he didnt go to the palace hotel or baldwins though mr newman had supplied him with ample funds and instructed him to spend whatever he thought might be necessary i mean to show myself worthy of his confidence said hector to himself he arrived in the evening and was glad to remain quietly at the hotel the first evening and sleep off the effects of his voyage after the contracted stateroom in which he had passed over twenty days he enjoyed the comfort and luxury of a bed on shore and a goodsized bedroom but in the morning he took a long walk which was full of interest less than five minutes walk from his hotel was the noted chinese quarter curiously enough it is located in the central part of the business portion of san francisco set a stranger down in this portion of the city and the traveler finds it easy to imagine himself in some chinese city all around him thronging the sidewalks he will see almondeyed men wearing long queues and clad in the comfortable but certainly not elegant flowing garments which we meet only occasionally in our eastern cities on the person of some laundryman then the houses too with the curious names on the signs speak of a faroff land on every side also is heard the uncouth jargon of the chinese tongue there is a part of san francisco that is known as the barbary coast it is that part which strangers will do well to avoid for it is the haunt of the worst portion of the population here floats many a hopeless wreck in the shape of a young man who has yielded to the seductions of drink and the gaming table who has lost all hope and ambition and is fast nearing destruction if hector allowed himself to explore this quarter it was not because he found anything to attract him for his tastes were healthy but he thought from the description of gregory newman that he would stand a better chance of meeting him here than in a more respectable quarter hector halted in front of a building which he judged to be a gambling house he did not care to enter but he watched with curiosity those who entered and those who came out as he was standing there a man of forty touched him on the shoulder hector turned and was by no means attracted by the mans countenance he was evidently a confirmed inebriate though not at that time under the influence of liquor there was an expression of cunning which repelled hector and he drew back i say boy said the stranger do you want to go in no sir if you do i know the ropes and ill introduce you and take care of you thank you said hector but i dont care to go in are you afraid asked the man with a slight sneer yes havent i a reason come sonny dont be foolish have you any money a little give it to me and ill play for you ill double it in ten minutes and ill only ask you five dollars for my services suppose you lose i wont lose said the man confidently come he said in a wheedling tone let me make some money for you thank you but i would rather not i dont want to make money in any such way youre a fool said the man roughly and with an air of disgust he left the spot much to hectors relief still hector lingered expecting he hardly knew what but it chanced that fortune favored him he was just about to turn away when a youth two or three years older than himself in appearance came out of the gambling house he was pale and looked as if he had kept late hours he had the appearance also of one who indulges in drink when hectors glance fell upon the face of the youth he started in great excitement surely he thought that must be gregory newman chapter xxxv the prodigal as the best way of getting into communication with the youth whom he suspected to be the object of his search hector asked him the name of the street on receiving an answer he said in an explanatory way i am a stranger here i only arrived on the last steamer the other looked interested where do you come from from new york i used to live there said gregory for it was he with a sigh have you bettered yourself by coming out here asked hector gregory shook his head no he said i begin to think i was a fool to come at all perhaps you had poor prospects in new york said hector no my uncle is a rich merchant there i have some property also and he is my guardian did he favor your coming no he was very much opposed to it perhaps i ought not to take such a liberty but i begin to agree with you about your being a fool to leave such prospects behind you oh i am not offended it is true enough i suppose you havent prospered then said hector prospered look at me do you see how shabby i am gregory certainly did look shabby his clothes were soiled and frayed and he had the appearance of a young tramp that isnt the worst of it he added bitterly i have spent my last cent and am penniless that is bad certainly did you lose any of it in there said hector indicating the gaming house i have lost full half of it there answered gregory this morning i found myself reduced to four bits to what inquired hector puzzled oh i forgot you had just arrived four bits is fifty cents well i was reduced to that and instead of saving it for my dinner i went in there and risked it if i had been lucky i might have raised it to ten dollars as a man next to me did but im out of luck and i dont know what to do why dont you go back to your uncle in new york what and walk all the way without food said gregory bitterly of course you couldnt go without money suppose you had the money would you go i should be afraid to try it said gregory smiling why dont you think he would receive you back he might but for one thing answered gregory what is that i may as well tell you though i am ashamed to said gregory reluctantly i left new york without his knowledge and as i knew he wouldnt advance me money out of my own property i took five hundred dollars from his desk that was bad said hector quietly but he didnt look shocked or terrorstricken for this would probably have prevented any further confidence it wasnt exactly stealing said gregory apologetically for i knew he could keep back the money from my property still he could represent it as such and have me arrested i dont think he would do that i dont want to run the risk you see now why i dont dare to go back to new york but what on earth i am to do here i dont know couldnt you get employment asked hector for he wished gregory to understand his position fully what in this shabby suit respectable business men would take me for a hoodlum hector knew already that a hoodlum in san francisco parlance is a term applied to street loafers from fifteen to twentyfive years of age who are disinclined to work and have a premature experience of vice suppose you were assured that your uncle would receive you back and give you another chance gregory shook his head i dont believe he would and i am afraid i dont deserve it no i must try to get to the mines in some way how are you fixed said gregory turning suddenly to hector could you spare a fivedollar gold piece for a chap thats been unfortunate perhaps i might but i am afraid you would go back into the gambling house and lose it as you did your other money no i wont i promise you that four bits was nothing five dollars would give me a chance of going somewhere where i could earn a living gregory seemed to speak sincerely and hector thought it would do him no harm to reveal himself and his errand your name is gregory newman isnt it he inquired gregory stared at him in uncontrollable amazement how do you know that he inquired and your uncles name is titus newman yes but he lives on madison avenue does he not yes yes but who are you that seem to know so much about me my name is hector roscoe did i know you in new york no i never met you to my knowledge then how do you recognize me and know my name in answer hector took from his pocket a photograph of gregory and displayed it how did you come by that asked gregory hurriedly are you a detective gregory looked so startled that hector had hard work not to laugh it seemed ludicrous to him that he should be supposed to be a detective on gregorys track as the boy evidently suspected no he answered i am not a detective but a friend i have come out to san francisco especially to find you you wont inform against me asked gregory nervously not at all i come as a friend with a message from your uncle what is it asked gregory eagerly he wants you to come back to new york and he will give you another chance is this true yes will you come i shall be glad to leave san francisco said gregory fervently i have had no luck since i arrived here do you think you deserved any said hector significantly no perhaps not gregory admitted when will you be ready to return you forget that i have no money i have and will pay your passage gregory grasped the hands of our hero gratefully you are a trump said he then he looked at his wretched and dilapidated suit i dont like to go home like this he said i should be mortified if i met my uncle or any of my old acquaintances oh that can be remedied said hector if you can lead the way to a good clothing house where the prices are moderate i will soon improve your appearance that i will answered gregory gladly within five minutes walk was a good clothing house on kearney street the two entered and a suit was soon found to fit gregory then they obtained a supply of underclothing and gregory breathed a sigh of satisfaction his selfrespect returned and he felt once more like his old self now said hector i shall take you to my hotel and enter your name as a guest you and i can room together do you know said gregory i almost fear this is a dream and that i shall wake up again a tramp as you found me half an hour ago i was almost in despair when you met me though gregory seemed quite in earnest in his desire to turn over a new leaf hector thought it prudent to keep the funds necessary for their journey in his own possession he gave a few dollars to gregory as spending money but disregarded any hints looking to a further advance chapter xxxvi how hector succeeded in sacramento now that hector had succeeded in the main object of his journey he had time to think of his own affairs it was most important for him to visit sacramento and make inquiries into the matter that so nearly concerned him i must find out he said to himself whether i am entitled to the name i bear or whether i only received it by adoption the second day after his discovery of gregory newman he said to him gregory business of importance calls me to sacramento do you wish to go with me does the business in any way relate to me asked gregory not at all then i prefer to remain in san francisco can i trust you not to fall back into your old ways asked hector yes i have had enough of them answered gregory and there was a sincerity in his tone which convinced hector that he might safely leave him i shall probably stay overnight he said if i stay any longer i will telegraph to you arrived in sacramento hector sought out the residence of the rev mr richards whose acquaintance he had made on board the steamer his clerical friend received him with evident pleasure how have you fared my young friend he asked very well sir i have succeeded in my mission then you have found the youth you were in search of yes sir moreover i have induced him to return home with me and turn over a new leaf that is indeed good news and now i think i have also good news for you please let me know it sir said hector eagerly i have found the lady with whom your father and mother boarded while they were in sacramento what does she say she says answered mr richards promptly that you are mr roscoes own son and were born in her house thank heaven ejaculated hector nor is this all i have found the minister who baptized you he is still living at a very advanced age the rev mr barnard i called upon him and recalled his attention to the period when your father lived in the city i found that he remembered both your parents very well not only that but he has a very full diary covering that time in which he showed me this record baptized june th hector the son of thomas and martha roscoe a bright healthy child in whom the parents much delight then it seems to me said hector that my case is a very strong one unusually so in fact it could not be stronger i marvel how allan roscoe your uncle could have ventured upon a fraud which could be so easily proved to be such he depended upon sacramento being so far away said hector he thought i would accept my fathers letter without question that letter was undoubtedly forged said the minister it must have been but it was very cleverly forged the handwriting was a very close copy of my fathers it was a great pleasure to hector that he could say my father without a moments doubt that he was entitled to say so he thought also that you would not have the means to come here to investigate for yourself said mr richards yes and he would have been right but for the commission mr newman gave me what course would you advise me to take asked hector a little later to substantiate my claim get mrs blodgetts and rev mr barnards sworn affidavits and place them in the hands of a reliable lawyer requesting him to communicate with your uncle this advice seemed to hector to be wise and he followed it fortunately he had no difficulty in inducing both parties to accede to his request the next day he returned to san francisco chapter xxxvii a narrow escape armed with the affidavits which were to restore to him the position in life of which his uncle had wickedly deprived him hector returned to san francisco he found gregory unaffectedly glad to see him glad to see you back hector he said i missed you hector was glad to find that gregory had not taken advantage of his absence to indulge in any of his old excesses he began to hope that he had already turned over the new leaf which was so desirable i know what you are thinking of said gregory after hector had returned his salutation you are wondering whether i cut up any while you were gone you dont look as if you had said hector smiling no i have had enough of sowing wild oats it doesnt pay shall i tell you what i did last evening if you like i attended a lecture illustrated with the stereopticon i was in bed at ten gregory said hector taking his hand you dont know how glad i am to hear this i am sure your uncle will be delighted when you return to him so changed ive made a great fool of myself said gregory candidly hereafter i am going to make you my model hector blushed deeply for he was a modest boy you compliment me too much gregory he said still if you are in earnest i will try to set you a good example you wont have any trouble in doing that you are one of the fellows that find it easy to be good i am not sure of that gregory still i mean to do my best in the evening the two boys attended a theatrical performance it was not till after eleven oclock that they emerged from the theatre and slowly not by the most direct way sauntered home there was no thought of danger in the mind of either yet as a fact hector had never in his life been exposed to peril so serious as that evening lurking behind in the shadow a shabbylooking man followed the two boys keeping his eyes steadily on hector at a place specially favorable our hero was startled by hearing a bullet whiz by his ear he turned instantly and so did gregory they saw a man running and they pursued him they might not have caught up with him but that he stumbled and fell instantly they were upon him well he said sullenly youve caught me after all were you the man who fired at me asked hector or was it my friend here you sought to kill i was firing at you answered their captive coolly now what are you going to do with me was this forced upon you by want did you wish to rob me no i had another motive what was it if i tell you will you let me go free hector hesitated the man proceeded speaking with emphasis if i tell you who put me up to this and furnish you proofs so that you can bring it to him will you let me go you will not renew the attempt asked hector no answered the man it isnt likely i shall have no further motive yes i agree read that letter then there isnt light enough will you accompany me to the hotel where i can read it i will the three walked together to the hotel where hector and gregory were staying there hector read the letter he was astonished and horrified when he discovered that it was from his uncle to this man with whom he seemed to have an acquaintance describing hector and promising him a thousand dollars if he would put him out of the way this is very important said hector gravely are you ready to accompany me to new york and swear to this yes if you will pay my expenses by the next steamer hector gregory and the stranger who called himself reuben pearce sailed for new york chapter xxxviii conclusion allan roscoe sat at the breakfast table with guy opposite him though mr roscoe was not altogether free from anxiety since he had learned of hectors expedition to california he had taught himself to believe that there was little chance of the boys ferreting out the imposition he had practiced upon him he had been a poor and struggling man most of his life having when quite a young man squandered his inheritance and his present taste of affluence was most agreeable he felt that he could not part with castle roscoe but i am safe enough he said to himself even if hector discovered anything something might happen to him so that he might be unable to return father said guy who had just dispatched an egg i want ten dollars this morning ten dollars said his father frowning how is this did i not give you your weeks allowance two days since well ive spent it answered guy and i need some more you must think i am made of money said his father displeased its pretty much so said guy nonchalantly your income must be ten thousand a year i have a great many expenses how have you spent your allowance oh i cant tell exactly its gone at any rate you mustnt become mean father mean dont i give you a handsome allowance look here guy i cant allow such extravagance on your part this once ill give you five dollars but hereafter you must keep within your allowance cant you make it ten no i cant said his father shortly guy rose from the table and left the room whistling the old mans getting mean he said if he doesnt allow me more i shall have to get in debt as guy left the room the mail was brought in on one of the envelopes mr roscoe saw the name of his lawyer he did not think much of it supposing it related to some minor matter of business the letter ran thus allan roscoe esq dear sir be kind enough to come up to the city at once business of great importance demands your attention yours respectfully timothy tape mr tape is unusually mysterious said allan roscoe to himself shrugging his shoulders i will go up today i have nothing to keep me at home mr roscoe ordered the carriage and drove to the depot guy noticing his departure asked permission to accompany him not today guy he answered i am merely going up to see my lawyer two hours later mr roscoe entered the office of his lawyer well tape whats up he asked in an easy tone your letter was mysterious i didnt like to write explicitly said mr tape gravely the matter you say is of great importance it is indeed it is no less than a claim for the whole of your late brothers estate who is the claimant asked allan roscoe perturbed your nephew hector i have no nephew hector the boy called hector roscoe is an adopted son of my brother i know you so stated he says he is prepared to prove that he is the lawful son of the late mr roscoe he cant prove it said allan roscoe turning pale he has brought positive proof from california so he says has he then returned asked allan his heart sinking he is in the city and expects us to meet him at two oclock this afternoon at the office of his lawyer mr parchment now mr parchment was one of the most celebrated lawyers at the new york bar and the fact that hector had secured his services showed allan roscoe that the matter was indeed serious how could he afford to retain so eminent a lawyer asked allan roscoe nervously titus newman the millionaire merchant backs him do you think there is anything in his case asked allan slowly i can tell better after our interview at two oclock at five minutes to two allan roscoe and mr tape were ushered into the private office of mr parchment glad to see you gentlemen said the great lawyer with his usual courtesy two minutes later hector entered accompanied by mr newman hector nodded coldly to his uncle he was not of a vindictive nature but he could not forget that this man his own near relative had not only deprived him of his property but conspired against his life hector said allan roscoe assuming a confidence he did not feel i am amazed at your preposterous claim upon the property my brother left to me this is a poor return for his kindness to one who had no claim upon him mr parchment will speak for me said hector briefly my young client said the great lawyer claims to be the son of the deceased mr roscoe and of course in that capacity succeeds to his fathers estate it is one thing to make the claim and another to substantiate it sneered allan roscoe precisely so mr roscoe said mr parchment we quite agree with you shall i tell you and your learned counsel what we are prepared to prove mr roscoe nodded uneasily we have the affidavits of the lady with whom your brother boarded in sacramento and in whose house my young client was born we have furthermore the sworn testimony of the clergyman still living who baptized him and we can show though it is needless in the face of such strong proof that he was always spoken of in his infancy by mr and mrs roscoe as their child and i have my brothers letter stating that he was only adopted asserted allan roscoe even that admitting it to be genuine said mr parchment cannot disprove the evidence i have already alluded to if you insist upon it however we will submit the letter to an expert and this is a conspiracy i wont give up the estate said allan passionately we also claim that there is a conspiracy said mr parchment smoothly and there is one circumstance that will go far to confirm it what is that demanded allan roscoe it is the attempt made upon my young clients life in san francisco by an agent of yours mr roscoe it is a lie said allan hoarsely shaking nevertheless with fear at a sign from mr parchment hector opened the door of the office to give admission to reuben pearce at a sight of this man allan roscoe utterly collapsed he felt that all was lost gentlemen he said i will give up the estate but for heavens sake dont prosecute me for this there was an informal conference in which it was agreed that allan roscoe should make no resistance to hectors claim but restore the estate to him hector promised though this was against his lawyers advice to give his uncle who would be left penniless the sum of two thousand dollars in cash and an allowance of a hundred dollars per month for his life he appointed mr newman his guardian being a minor and was once more a boy of fortune he resolved to continue his studies and in due time go to college thus preparing himself for the high position he would hereafter hold as for allan roscoe he and his son guy lost no time in leaving the neighborhood guy was intensely mortified at this turn of the wheel which had again brought his cousin uppermost and was quite ready to accompany his father to chicago where they are living at present but he had formed extravagant tastes and has been a source of trouble and solicitude to his father who indeed hardly deserves the comfort of a good son hector lost no time after being restored to his old position in reengaging larry deanes father who had been discharged by his uncle he paid him his usual wages for all the time he had been out of place and considerably raised his pay for the future larry shall never want a friend as long as i live he assured mr deane he was a friend to me when i needed one and i will take care to give him a good start in life he redeemed this promise by securing larry a place in mr newmans employ and voluntarily allowed him as large a weekly sum as the merchant paid him in addition so that larry could live comfortably in the city i am glad to say that larry has shown himself deserving of this kindness and has already been promoted to an important and better paid position a word about smith institute it never recovered from the blow that it had received at the time when hector found himself forced to leave it one after another the pupils left and mr smith felt that his race as a schoolmaster was run he advertised the institute for sale and who do you think bought it who but hector roscoe who probably paid more for it than anyone else would my readers will hardly suppose that he wanted it for himself in a cordial letter he presented it to mr crabb the late usher when he had finished his engagement with walter boss and the name was changed to crabb institute it was not long before it regained its old patronage for mr crabb was not only a good scholar but was fair and just to the pupils ruling them rather by love than fear he has married the daughter of a neighboring clergyman who is a judicious helper and contributes to the success of the school as for jim smith the last heard of him was to this effect he had strayed out to st louis and after a few months of vicissitude had secured the position of bartender in a low liquor saloon he has very little chance of rising higher the young tyrant of smith institute has not done very well for himself but he has himself to blame for it to return to hector i think we are justified in predicting for him a prosperous future he behaved well in adversity he is not likely to be spoiled by prosperity but promises to grow up a good and manly man who will seek to do good as he goes along and so vindicate his claim to the exceptional good fortune which he enjoys the end
