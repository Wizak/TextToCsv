 chapter on the damp snapping wind iced the bones through to the marrow snow from a storm earlier in the week was piled in irregular hills along the side of the road the sky was bitter blue stern trees with black empty branches rose out of winterbrowned grass and shook their limbs like fists against the cold that was march in maine miranda pumped the heater up to full programmed her cd player to puccinis la bohème and drove with the music soaring she was coming home after a tenday lecture tour bumping from hotel to college campus to airport and back to hotel miranda was more than ready for home her relief might have had something to do with the fact that she hated giving lectures suffered miserably every time she had to face those rows of eager faces but shyness and stage fright werent allowed to interfere with duty she was dr miranda jones a jones of jones point and she was never permitted to forget it the city had been founded by the first charles jones to make his mark in the new world the joneses miranda knew were required to make their marks to maintain their position as the leading family of the point to contribute to society to behave as expected of the joneses of jones point maine thrilled to put distance between herself and the airport she turned onto the coast road and hit the gas driving fast was one of her small pleasures she liked to move quickly to get from one point to the next with a minimum of fuss and time a woman who stood nearly six foot in her bare feet and had hair the color of a tonka toy fire engine rarely went unnoticed even when she wasnt in charge she looked as if she were and when she moved with the precision and purpose of a heatseeking missile the road ahead generally cleared she had a voice one infatuated man had compared to velvet wrapped in sandpaper she compensated for what she considered an accident of fate by cultivating a brisk clipped delivery that often bordered on prim but it got the job done her body might have come down from some celtic warrior ancestor but her face was pure new england narrow and cool with a long straight nose slightly pointed chin and cheekbones that could have chipped ice her mouth was wide and most often set in a serious line her eyes were fourth of july blue and most often sober but now as she entertained herself with the long winding drive that hugged the snowlaced cliffs both her mouth and her eyes smiled beyond the cliffs the sea was choppy and steel gray she loved the moods of it its power to soothe or thrill as the road bent like a crooked finger she heard the thunderous crash of water slapping against rock then drawing back like a fist to strike again the thin sunlight sparkled on the snow the wind blew fitful streams of it into the air across the road on the bay side the naked trees were bent like old men twisted by year after year of storms when she was a child and still fanciful shed imagined those trees muttering complaints to each other as they huddled against the wind though she considered herself fanciful no longer she still loved the look of them gnarled and knotted but lined up like old soldiers on the bluff the road climbed as the land narrowed with the water creeping in on both sides sea and sound both moody often bleak nibbled away at the shores with a perpetual hunger the crooked spit of land rose its topmost point humped like an arthritic knuckle and graced by the old victorian house that looked over sea and land beyond it where the ground tumbled down again toward the water was the white spear of the lighthouse that guarded the coast the house had been her refuge and her joy as a child because of the woman who lived in it amelia jones had bucked the jones tradition and had lived as she chose had said what she thought and had always always had a place in her heart for her two grandchildren miranda had adored her the only true grief shed ever known was when amelia had died with no fuss or warning in her sleep eight winters before shed left the house the tidy portfolio shed cleverly put together over the years and her art collection to miranda and her brother to her son mirandas father she left her wishes that he be half the man shed hoped before they met again to her daughterinlaw she left a strand of pearls because they were the only thing she could think of that elizabeth had ever fully approved of it had been so like her miranda thought now those pithy little comments in the will shed stayed in the big stone house for years living alone having survived her husband by more than a decade miranda thought of her grandmother as she reached the end of the coast road and turned into the long curving drive the house that topped it had survived years and gales the merciless cold of winter the shocking and sudden heat of high summer now miranda thought with a little twist of guilt it was surviving benign neglect neither she nor andrew seemed to find the time to arrange for painters or lawn care the house that had been a showplace when she was a child now displayed its sags and scars still she thought it lovely rather like an old woman not afraid to act her age rather than rambling it stood in straight soldierly angles its gray stone dignified its gables and turrets distinguished on the sound side a pergola offered charm and fancy wisteria tangled up its sides buried its roof in blossoms in the spring miranda always meant to make time to sit on one of the marble benches under that fragrant canopy to enjoy the scents the shade the quiet but somehow spring ran into summer and summer into fall and she never remembered her vow until winter when the thick vines were bare perhaps some of the boards on the wide front porch of the house needed replacing certainly the trim and shutters faded from blue to gray needed to be scraped and painted the wisteria on the pergola probably needed to be pruned or fed or whatever you did with such things she would get to it sooner or later but the windows glinted and the ferocious faces of the gargoyles crouched on the eaves grinned long terraces and narrow balconies offered views in every direction the chimneys would puff smoke when someone took the time to light a fire grand old oaks rose high and a thick stand of pines broke the wind on the north side she and her brother shared the space compatibly enough or had until andrews drinking became more habitual but she wasnt going to think about that she enjoyed having him close liked as well as loved him so that working with him sharing a house with him was a pleasure the wind blew her hair into her eyes the minute she stepped out of the car vaguely annoyed she dragged it back then leaned in to retrieve her laptop and briefcase shouldering both humming the final strains of puccini she walked back to the trunk and popped it open her hair blew into her face again causing her to huff out an irritated breath the halfsigh ended in a choked gasp as her hair was grabbed in one hard yank used as a rope to snap her head back small white stars burst in front of her eyes as both pain and shock stabbed into her skull and the point of a knife pressed cold and sharp against the pulse in her throat fear screamed in her head a primal burn that burst in the gut and shrieked toward the throat before she could release it she was twisted around shoved hard against the car so that the blossom of pain in her hip blurred her vision and turned her legs to jelly the hand on her hair yanked again jerking her head back like a dolls his face was hideous pasty white and scarred its features blunted it took her several seconds before the drymouthed terror allowed her to see it was a mask rubber and paint twisted into deformity she didnt struggle couldnt there was nothing she feared as much as a knife with its deadly point its smooth killing edge the keen tip was pressed into the soft pad under her jaw so that each choked breath she took brought a searing jab of pain and terror he was big sixfour or five she noted struggling to pay attention pay attention to details while her heart skittered into her throat where the blade pressed two hundred fifty or sixty pounds wide at the shoulders short at the neck oh god brown eyes muddy brown it was all she could see through the slits in the rubber fright mask he wore and the eyes were flat as a sharks and just as dispassionate as he tipped the point of the knife slid it over her throat to delicately slice the skin a small fire burned there while a thin line of blood trickled down to the collar of her coat please the word bubbled out as she instinctively shoved at the wrist of his knife hand every rational thought clicked off into cold dread as he used the point to jerk up her head and expose the vulnerable line of her throat in her mind flashed the image of the knife slashing once fast and silent severing carotid artery a gush of hot blood and she would die on her feet slaughtered like a lamb please dont i have three hundred and fifty dollars in cash please let it be money he wants she thought frantically let it just be money if it was rape she prayed she had the courage to fight even knowing she couldnt win if it was blood she hoped it would be quick ill give you the money she began then gasped in shock as he tossed her aside like a bundle of rags she fell hard on her hands and knees on the gravel drive felt the burn of small nasty cuts on her palms she could hear herself whimpering hated the helpless numbing fear that made it impossible to do more than stare at him out of blurred eyes to stare at the knife that glinted in the thin sunlight even as her mind screamed to run to fight she hunched into herself paralyzed he picked up her purse her briefcase turned the blade so that the sun shot off a spear of light into her eyes then he leaned down and jammed the point into the rear tire when he yanked it free took a step in her direction she began to crawl toward the house she waited for him to strike again to tear at her clothes to plunge the knife into her back with the same careless force hed used to stab it into the tire but she kept crawling over the brittle winter grass when she reached the steps she looked back with her eyes wheeling in her head with small hunted sounds bubbling through her lips and saw she was alone short rusty breaths scraped at her throat burned in her lungs as she dragged herself up the steps she had to get inside get away lock the door before he came back before he came back and used that knife on her her hand slid off the knob once twice before she managed to close her fingers around it locked of course it was locked no one was home no one was there to help for a moment she simply curled there outside the door shivering with shock and the wind that whipped over the hill move she ordered herself you have to move get the key get inside call the police her eyes darted left and right like a rabbit watching for wolves and her teeth started to chatter using the knob for support she pulled herself to her feet her legs threatened to buckle her left knee was screaming but she darted off the porch in a kind of drunken lope searched frantically for her purse before she remembered hed taken it she babbled out words prayers curses pleas as she yanked open the car door and fumbled with the glove compartment even as her fingers closed over her spare keys a sound had her whirling around wildly her hands coming up defensively there was nothing there but the wind sweeping through the bare black branches of trees through the thorny canes of the climbing roses over the brittle grass breath whistling she took off for the house in a limping run jabbing frantically with the key at the lock all but wailing with relief when it slid home she stumbled inside slammed the door turned the locks when her back was against that solid wood the keys slipped out of her fingers landed with a musical crash her vision grayed so she closed her eyes everything was numb now mind body she needed to take the next step to act to cope but she couldnt remember what step to take her ears were ringing and nausea rose up in one long greasy wave gritting her teeth she took one step forward then another as the foyer seemed to tilt gently right and left she was nearly to the base of the stairs when she realized it wasnt her ears ringing but the telephone mechanically she walked through the haze into the parlor where everything was so normal so familiar and picked up the phone hello her voice sounded far away hollow like a single beat in a wooden drum swaying a bit she stared at the pattern the sun made as it slipped through the windows and onto the wide planks of the pine floor yes yes i understand ill be there i have what shaking her head to clear it miranda struggled to remember what she needed to say i have some things things to take care of first no ill leave as soon as i can then something bubbled up inside her she was too dazed to recognize as hysteria im already packed she said and laughed she was still laughing when she hung up the phone laughing when she slid bonelessly into a chair and didnt realize when she tucked herself into a small defensive ball that the laughter had turned to sobs she had both hands wrapped tight around a cup of hot tea but she didnt drink it she knew the cup would shake but it was a comfort to hold it to feel the heat pass through the cup and into her chilled fingers soothe the abraded skin of her palms shed been coherent it was imperative to be coherent to be clear and precise and calm when reporting a crime to the police once she was able to think again shed made the proper calls shed spoken to the officers who had come to the house but now that it was done and she was alone again she couldnt seem to keep a single solid thought in her mind for more than ten seconds miranda the shout was followed by the cannon bang of the front door slamming andrew rushed in took one horrified study of his sisters face oh jesus he hurried to her crouched at her feet and began to play his long fingers over her pale cheeks oh honey im all right just some bruises but the control shed managed to build back into place trembled i was more scared than hurt he saw the tears in the knees of her trousers the dried blood on the wool the son of a bitch his eyes a quieter blue than his sisters abruptly went dark with horror did he his hands lowered to hers so that they gripped the china cup together did he rape you no no it was nothing like that he just stole my purse he just wanted money im sorry i had the police call you i should have done it myself its all right dont worry he tightened his grip on her hands then released them quickly when she winced oh baby he took the cup from her hands set it aside then lifted her abraded palms im so sorry come on ill take you to the hospital i dont need the hospital its just bumps and bruises she drew a deep breath finding it easier to do so now that he was here he could infuriate her and he had disappointed her but in all of her life hed been the only one to stick with her to be there he picked up her cup of tea pressed it into her hands again drink a little he ordered before he rose and paced off some of the fear and anger he had a thin rather bony face that went well with the long lanky build his coloring was like his sisters though his hair was a darker red almost mahogany nerves had him patting his hand against his thigh as he moved i wish id been here damn it miranda i should have been here you cant be everywhere andrew no one could have predicted that id be mugged in our own front yard i think and the police think that he was probably going to break into the house rob us and my coming home surprised him changed his plans they said he had a knife yeah gingerly she lifted a hand to the shallow cut on her throat and i can report that i havent outgrown my knife phobia one look at it and my mind just froze andrews eyes went grim but he spoke gently as he came back to sit beside her what did he do can you tell me he just came out of nowhere i was getting my things out of the trunk he yanked me back by the hair put the knife to my throat i thought he was going to kill me but he knocked me down took my purse my briefcase slashed my tires and left she managed a wavering smile not exactly the homecoming i was expecting i should have been here he said again andrew dont she leaned into him closed her eyes youre here now and that it seemed was enough to steady her mother called what he started to drape an arm around her shoulders and now sat forward to look at her face the phone was ringing when i got into the house god my minds still fogged she complained and rubbed at her temple i have to go to florence tomorrow dont be ridiculous you just got home and youre hurt youre shaken christ how can she ask you to get on a plane right after youve been mugged i didnt tell her she only shrugged i wasnt thinking in any case the summons was loud and clear i have to book a flight miranda youre going to bed oh yeah she smiled again very soon now ill call her he sucked in his breath as a man might when faced with an ugly chore ill explain my hero loving him she kissed his cheek no ill go a hot bath some aspirin and ill be fine and after this little adventure i could use a distraction it seems she has a bronze she wants me to test because it had gone cold she set the tea down again she wouldnt summon me to standjo if it wasnt important she wants an archeometrist and she wants one quickly shes got archeometrists on staff at standjo exactly this time mirandas smile was thin and bright standjo stood for standfordjones elizabeth had made certain that not only her name but everything else on her agenda came first in the florence operation so if shes sending for me its big she wants to keep it in the family elizabeth standfordjones director of standjo florence is sending for an expert on italian renaissance bronzes and she wants one with the jones name i dont intend to disappoint her she didnt have any luck booking a flight for the following morning and had to settle for a seat on the evening flight to rome with a transfer to florence nearly a full days delay there would be hell to pay as she tried to soak out the aches in a hot tub miranda calculated the time difference and decided there was no point in calling her mother elizabeth would be at home very likely in bed by now nothing to be done about it tonight she told herself in the morning shed call standjo one day couldnt make that much difference even to elizabeth shed hire a car to take her to the airport because the way her knee was throbbing driving could be a problem even if she could replace her tires quickly ah she had to do was she sat straight up in the tub sloshing water to the rim her passport her passport her drivers license her company ids hed taken her briefcase and her purse hed taken all her identification documents oh hell was the best she could do as she rubbed her hands over her face that just made it all perfect she yanked the oldfashioned chain plug out of the drain of the clawfoot tub she was steaming now and the burst of angry energy had her getting to her feet reaching for a towel before her wrenched knee buckled under her biting back a yelp she braced a hand against the wall and sat on the lip of the tub the towel dropping in to slop in the water the tears wanted to come from frustration from the pain from the sudden sharp fear that came stabbing back she sat naked and shivering her breath trembling out on little hitching gasps until shed controlled them tears wouldnt help her get back her papers or soothe her bruises or get her to florence she sniffled them back and wrung out the towel carefully now she used her hands to lift her legs out of the tub one at a time she gained her feet as clammy sweat popped out on her skin causing the tears to swim close again but she stood clutching the sink for support and took stock of herself in the fulllength mirror on the back of the door there were bruises on her arms she didnt remember him grabbing her there but the marks were dark gray so logically he had her hip was blackandblue and stunningly painful that she remembered was a result of being rammed back against the car her knees were scraped and raw the left one unattractively red and swollen she must have taken the worst of the fall on it twisted it the heels of her hands burned from their rude meeting with the gravel of the drive but it was the long shallow slice on her throat that had her head going light her stomach rolling with fresh nausea fascinated and appalled she lifted her fingers to it just a breath from the jugular she thought just a breath from death if hed wanted her to die she would have died and that was worse than the bruising the sick throbbing aches a stranger had held her life in his hands never again she turned away from the mirror hobbled over to take her robe from the brass hook by the door im never going to let it happen again she was freezing and wrapped herself as quickly as she could in the robe as she was struggling to belt it a movement outside the window had her head jerking up her heart thundering hed come back she wanted to run to hide to scream for andrew to curl herself into a ball behind a locked door and with her teeth gritted she eased closer to the window looked out it was andrew she saw with a dizzying wave of relief he was wearing the plaid lumbermans jacket he used when he split wood or hiked on the cliffs hed turned the floodlights on and she could see something glinting in his hand something he swung as he strode along over the yard puzzled she pressed her face against the window a golf club what in the world was he doing outside marching across the snowy lawn with a golf club then she knew and love flooded into her soothing her more than any painkiller he was guarding her the tears came back one spilled over then she saw him stop pull something from his pocket lift it and she watched him take a long swig from a bottle oh andrew she thought as her eyes closed and her heart sank what a mess we are it was the pain that woke her bright pops of it that banged out of her knee miranda fumbled on the light shook out pills from the bottle shed put on her bedside table even as she swallowed them she realized she should have taken andrews advice and gone to the hospital where some sympathetic doctor would have written her a prescription for some good potent drugs she glanced at the luminous dial of her clock saw it was after three at least the cocktail of ibuprofen and aspirin shed taken at midnight had given her three hours of relief but she was awake now and chasing the pain might as well finish it off she decided and face the music with the time difference elizabeth would be at her desk miranda picked up the phone and put the call through moaning a bit she shifted her pillows against the curvy miranda i was about to call to leave a message at your hotel for your arrival tomorrow im going to be delayed i delayed the word was like a single ice chip frigid and sharp im sorry i thought i made it clear this project is priority ive guaranteed the government that we would begin tests today im going to send john carter i i didnt send for john carter i sent for you whatever other work you have can be delegated i believe i made that clear as well yes you did no she thought the pills werent going to help this time but the cold anger beginning to stir inside her was bound to outdistance a little pain i had every intention of being there as instructed then why arent you my passport and other identification were stolen yesterday ill arrange to have them replaced as soon as possible and rebook my flight this being friday i doubt i can have new documents before sometime next week she knew how bureaucracies worked miranda thought grimly shed been raised in one even in a relatively quiet place like jones point its foolishly careless not to lock your car the documents werent in my car they were on me ill let you know as soon as theyre replaced and ive rescheduled i apologize for the delay the project will have my full time and attention as soon as i arrive goodbye mother it gave her perverse satisfaction to hang up before elizabeth could say another word in her elegant and spacious office three thousand miles away elizabeth stared at the phone with a mixture of annoyance and confusion is there a problem distracted elizabeth glanced over at her former daughterinlaw elise warfield sat a clipboard resting on her knee her big green eyes puzzled her soft lush mouth curved slightly in an attentive smile the marriage between elise and andrew hadnt worked which was a disappointment to elizabeth but her professional and personal relationship with elise hadnt been damaged by the divorce yes mirandas been delayed delayed elise lifted her brows so that they disappeared under the fringe of bangs that skimmed over her brow thats not like miranda her passport and other identification were stolen oh thats dreadful elise got to her feet she stood just over fivetwo her body had lush feminine curves that managed to look delicate with her sleek cap of ebony hair her large heavily lashed eyes and milky white skin the deep red of her mouth she resembled an efficient and sexy fairy she was robbed i didnt get the details elizabeths lips tightened briefly shell arrange to have them replaced and reschedule her flight it may take several days elise started to ask if miranda had been hurt then closed her mouth on the words from the look in elizabeths eyes either she didnt know or it wasnt her major concern i know you want to begin testing today it can certainly be arranged i can shift some of my work and start them myself considering elizabeth rose and turned to her window she always thought more clearly when she looked out over the city florence was her home had been her home since the first time shed seen it shed been eighteen a young college student with a desperate love for art and a secret thirst for adventure shed fallen hopelessly in love with the city with its red rooftops and majestic domes its twisting streets and bustling piazzas and shed fallen in love with a young sculptor who had charmingly lured her to bed fed her pasta and shown her her own heart of course hed been unsuitable completely unsuitable poor and wildly passionate her parents had snapped her back to boston the moment theyd learned of the affair and that of course had been the end of that she shook herself annoyed that her mind had drifted there shed made her own choices and they had been excellent ones now she was the head of one of the largest and most respected research facilities for art in the world standjo might have been one of the arms of the jones organization but it was hers her name came first and here so did she she stood framed in the window a trim attractive woman of fiftyeight her hair was a quiet ash blond discreetly tinted by one of the top salons in florence her impeccable taste was reflected in the perfectly cut valentino suit she wore the color a rich eggplant with hammeredgold buttons her leather pumps matched the tone exactly her complexion was clear with good new england bone structure overcoming the few lines that dared show themselves her eyes were a sharp and ruthlessly intelligent blue the image was one of a cool fashionable professional woman of wealth and position she would never have settled for less no she thought she would never settle for less than the absolute best well wait for her she said and turned back to elise its her field her specialty ill contact the minister personally and explain the short delay elise smiled at her no one understands delays like the italians true enough well go over those reports later today elise i want to make this call now youre the boss yes i am oh john carter will be coming in tomorrow hell be working on mirandas team feel free to assign him another project in the meantime theres no point in having him twiddle his thumbs johns coming itll be good to see him we can always use him in the lab ill take care of it thank you elise when she was alone elizabeth sat at her desk again studied the safe across the room considered what was inside miranda would head the project her decision had been made the moment shed seen the bronze it would be a standjo operation with a jones at the helm that was what she had planned what she expected and it was what she would have chapter two she was five days late so miranda moved fast pushing through the towering medieval doors of standjo florence and striding across the floor so that the clicks of her practical pumps were like rapid gunshots on the gleaming white marble she clipped the standjo id elizabeths assistant had overnighted her to the lapel of her jacket as she rounded an excellent bronze reproduction of cellinis figure of perseus displaying medusas severed head miranda had often wondered just what the choice of art in the entrance lobby said about her mother defeat all enemies she supposed with one swift stroke she stopped at the lobby counter swiveling the logbook around and dashing off her name noting the time on her watch then adding it shed dressed carefully even strategically for the day selecting a suit of royalblue silk that was military and trim in style miranda considered it both dashing and powerful when you were to meet with the director of one of the top archeometry laboratories in the world your appearance was vitally important even if that director was your mother especially miranda thought with the faintest of sneers if that director was your mother she punched the button on the elevator and waited impatience shimmering nerves were jumping gleefully in her stomach tickling in her throat buzzing in her head but she didnt let them show the minute she stepped into the elevator she flipped open her compact and freshened her lipstick a single tube of color could last her a year sometimes more she only bothered with such small annoyances when they couldnt be avoided satisfied shed done her best she replaced the compact and ran a hand over the sophisticated french twist that had taken her entirely too much time and trouble to create she jammed a few loosened pins back firmly in place just as the doors opened again she stepped out into the quiet elegant lobby of what she thought of as the inner sanctum the pearlgray carpet and ivory walls the sternbacked antique chairs suited her mother she thought lovely tasteful and detached the sleek console where the receptionist worked with its topgrade computer and phone system was also all elizabeth efficient brisk and stateoftheart buon giorno miranda approached the desk and stated her business briefly and in flawless italian sono la dottoressa jones ho un appuntamento con la signora standfordjones sì dottoressa un momento in her head miranda shifted her feet tugged at her jacket rolled her shoulders it sometimes helped her keep her body still and calm if she imagined twitching and shuffling she was just finishing up some imaginary pacing when the receptionist smiled and gave her the goahead miranda walked through the double glass doors to her left and down the cool white hallway that led to the office of the signora direttrice she knocked one was always expected to knock on any door of elizabeths the responding entri came immediately elizabeth was at her desk an elegant satinwood hepplewhite that suited her aristocratic new england looks perfectly framed in the window behind her was florence in all its sunny splendor they faced each other across the room both appraising swiftly elizabeth spoke first how was your trip uneventful good you look well i am quite well and you fine miranda imagined herself doing a wild tap dance around the perfectly appointed office and stood straight as a cadet at inspection would you like some coffee something cold no thank you miranda arched a brow you havent asked about andrew elizabeth waved toward a chair hows your brother miserable miranda thought drinking too much angry depressed bitter hes fine he sends his best she lied without a qualm i assume you told elise i was coming of course because miranda had remained standing elizabeth rose all the department heads and the appropriate staff members are aware that youll be working here temporarily the fiesole bronze is a priority naturally youll have full use of the labs and equipment and the cooperation and assistance of any members of the team you choose i spoke with john yesterday you havent started any tests yet no this delay has cost us time and youll be expected to begin immediately thats why im here elizabeth inclined her head what happened to your leg youre limping a bit i was mugged remember you said youd been robbed you didnt say youd been injured you didnt ask elizabeth let out what from anyone else miranda would have considered a sigh you might have explained youd been hurt during the incident i might have i didnt the priority was after all the loss of my documents and the delay that caused she inclined her head in a mirror of elizabeths gesture that much was made very clear i assumed elizabeth cut herself off flung her hand in a gesture that might have been annoyance or defeat why dont you sit down while i give you some background so the matter was to be tabled miranda had expected it she sat crossed her legs the man who discovered the bronze the plumber yes for the first time elizabeth smiled a quick curving of lips that was more an acknowledgment of the absurdity than genuine amusement carlo rinaldi apparently hes an artist at heart if not in deed hes never been able to make a living from his painting and his wifes father owns a plumbing business so mirandas quick eyebrow flick was a measure of mild surprise does his background matter only insofar as his connection to the piece there appears to be none he from all accounts literally stumbled over it he claims to have found it hidden under a broken step in the cellar of the villa della donna oscura and that as far as has been verified seems to be the case was there some question of that is he suspected of fabricating the story and the bronze if there was the minister is satisfied with rinaldis story now elizabeth folded her perfectly manicured hands on the edge of the desk her new england spine was straight as a ruler unconsciously miranda shifted ever so slightly to level her own the fact that he found it elizabeth continued smuggled it out of the villa in his toolbox then took his time reporting it through the proper channels caused some initial concern troubled miranda folded her hands to keep her fingers from tapping on her knee it didnt occur to her that she now exactly mirrored her mothers pose how long did he have it five days there was no damage youve examined it i have id rather not make any comments until youve seen it yourself well then miranda cocked her head lets have a look in answer elizabeth walked over to a cabinet and opening the door revealed a small steel safe youre keeping it in here my security is more than adequate a number of people have access to the vaults in the labs and i preferred to limit that access in this case and i thought it would be less distracting for you to do an initial exam here with one coraltipped finger elizabeth punched in a code waited then added another series of numbers opening the reinforced door she took out a metal box after setting it on her desk she opened the lid and took out a bundle wrapped in faded velvet well date the cloth as well and the wood from the step naturally though her fingers itched miranda rose and stepped forward slowly when elizabeth set the bundle on her spotless white blotter there are no documents correct none so far you know the history of the villa yes of course it was once the home of giulietta buonadoni a mistress of lorenzo the magnificent known as the dark lady after his death shes believed to have become a companion of other medicis at one time or another every light of the renaissance in or around florence was welcomed into her home so you understand the possibilities i dont deal in possibilities miranda said curtly exactly thats why youre here gently miranda brushed a finger over the tattered velvet is it i wanted the best and im in a position to access what i want i also demand discretion if news of this find leaks the speculation will be wild that is something standjo cant and wont risk the government wants no publicity and no public speculation until the bronze is dated and tests are complete the plumbers probably already told all his drinking pals i wouldnt think so again that small smile played around elizabeths mouth he took the bronze out of a governmentowned building hes quite aware at this point that if he doesnt do precisely what hes told he could go to prison fear is often an efficient gag yes but that isnt our concern weve been commissioned to test the bronze and to provide the government with all the information science can offer we require an objective eye someone who believes in facts not romance theres no room for romance in science miranda murmured and carefully unwrapped the velvet her heart gave one hard thud against her ribs when the bronze lay naked her skilled and experienced eye recognized the brilliance of the workmanship the glory of it but she frowned instinctively burying admiration under skepticism its beautifully conceived and executed certainly the style falls within the realm of the renaissance she slipped her glasses out of the case in her pocket put them on before she lifted the bronze she judged the weight turning it slowly the proportions were perfect the sensuality of the subject obvious the smallest details toenails each tendril of hair the definition of calf muscles were stunningly depicted she was glorious free wonderfully aware of her own power the long curvy body was arched back the arms lifted up not in prayer or supplication miranda noted in triumph the face wasnt delicate but stunning the eyes half closed as if in pleasure the mouth curved slyly in enjoyment of that pleasure she was balanced on the balls of her feet like a woman about to leap into a warm scented pool or a lovers arms it was unashamedly sexual and for one baffling instant miranda thought she could feel the heat of it like life the patina indicated age but such things were deceiving she knew patinas could be created the style of the artist was unmistakable but such a thing was all but impossible styles could be mimicked its the dark lady she said giulietta buonadoni theres no doubt about that ive seen this face often enough in paintings and sculpture of the period but ive never seen or heard of this bronze ill do some research on it but i doubt id have missed it elizabeth studied mirandas face rather than the bronze shed seen that quick flicker of excitement of delight both of which had been quickly controlled exactly as shed expected them to be but you agree it is a bronze of renaissance style yes that hardly makes it a lost piece from the fifteenth century her eyes were narrowed as she slowly turned the bronze in her hands any art student with a clever eye has sketched and copied her face over the years ive done so myself idly she scraped a bit at the bluegreen patina with her thumbnail the surface corrosion was visibly thick but she needed more much more ill start right away vivaldi played lightly in the air of the lab the walls were a pale hospital green the floor a spotlessly white linoleum each station was militarily neat fitted with microscopes computer terminals vials or tubes or sample bags there were no personal items no pretty framed family pictures no mascots or souvenirs the men wore ties the women skirts and over all were the crisp white lab coats with the standjo logo stitched in black on the breast pocket conversation was muted and minimal and equipment hummed like welloiled clocks elizabeth expected a tight ship and her former daughterinlaw knew how to run one the house in maine where miranda had grown up had presented precisely the same atmosphere it made for a cold home miranda thought as she scanned the area but an efficient workplace its been some time since you were here elizabeth began but elise will refresh your memory as to the setup youll have free access to all areas of course i have your security card and your codes fine miranda fixed a polite smile on her face as elise turned from a microscope and started toward them miranda welcome to florence elises voice was quiet not quite breathy but with the promise it could be if she were properly aroused its nice to be back how are you fine busy she flashed a hundredwatt smile and took mirandas hand hows drew not quite so fine but busy she lifted a brow when elise squeezed her hand im sorry its none of my business im still sorry she released mirandas hand and turned to elizabeth will you head the tour or shall i i dont need a tour miranda said before her mother could speak i need a lab coat a microscope a computer ill want to take photos and x rays of course there you are john carter loped his way over mirandas lab manager looked endearingly rumpled in the midst of ruthless efficiency and style his tie with silly grinning cows grazing was already askew hed snagged the pocket of his lab coat on something so that it flapped from loose threads there was a nick on his chin where hed cut himself shaving a thumbsized stub of a pencil behind his ear and smudges on the lenses of his glasses he made miranda feel cozily at home you okay he patted her arm in three bouncing strokes then hows the knee andrew told me the guy who mugged you tossed you around tossed you around elise looked over quickly we didnt know you were hurt just shaken up its all right im fine he held a knife to her throat carter announced a knife elise put a hand to her own throat thats horrible its its all right miranda said again he just wanted money she turned meeting her mothers eyes and i think hes cost us enough valuable time for a moment elizabeth said nothing there was challenge in mirandas gaze and she decided the time for sympathy had passed then ill let elise set you up your id and security cards are in here elizabeth handed miranda an envelope elise should be able to handle any of your questions or needs or you can contact me she glanced at the slim watch on her wrist i have another meeting shortly so ill let you get started i hope to have a preliminary report by end of day you will miranda murmured as her mother walked away she doesnt waste time with another smile elise gestured im so sorry you had to go through such a terrible ordeal but the work here should help you keep it off your mind i have an office set up for you the fiesole bronze is a top priority youre authorized to pick your team from any of the a security staff miranda there was a wealth of pleasure in the word and it was delivered with the heavy and exotic tones of italy miranda felt herself smiling even before she turned and had her hands taken and lavishly kissed giovanni you dont change indeed the chemistry technician was as outrageously handsome as miranda remembered dark and sleek with eyes like melted chocolate and a smile that radiated charm he stood an inch or so below her and still managed to make her feel feminine and tiny he wore his glossy black hair in a ponytail an affectation elizabeth permitted only because besides being beautiful to look at giovanni beredonno was a genius but you change bella donna youre even more lovely but what is this about being hurt he fluttered his fingers over her face its nothing just a memory do you want me to go break someone in half for you he kissed her gently one cheek then the other can i get back to you on that giovanni miranda has work yes yes he brushed off elises stiff and disapproving words with a careless gesture another reason for miranda to smile i know all about it a big project very hushhush he wiggled his expressive eyebrows when the direttrice sends to america for an expert it is no small thing so bellissima can you use me youre first on my list he tucked her hand through his arm ignoring the tightening of elises lips when do we start today miranda told him as elise gestured toward a doorway ill want tests run on the corrosion layers and the metal right away i think richard hawthorne would be helpful to you elise tapped the shoulder of a man hunkered over the keyboard on a computer dr hawthorne miranda watched the balding man blink owlishly through his glasses then fumble them off there was something vaguely familiar about him and she struggled to place him dr jones he gave her a shy smile that added appeal to his face his chin was short his eyes a distracted and pale blue but the smile was sweet as a boys its nice to see you again were ah happy to have you here i read your paper on early florentine humanism it was quite brilliant thank you oh yes she remembered hed done a stint at the institute a few years earlier after a moments hesitation which miranda knew came only because elise had recommended him she relented elise has an office for me could you join us for a moment id like to show you what i have id be delighted he fumbled with his glasses again hit a series of keys that saved his work its not a large space elise began with an apology as she ushered miranda through a door ive set it up with what i thought youd need of course you can requisition anything you like miranda took a quick scan the computer station appeared efficient and neat a wide white counter held microscopes slides and the small hand tools of her trade a tape recorder had been provided for detailing notes there was no window only the one door and with the four of them inside barely room to turn around but there was a chair a phone and the pencils were sharpened it would do she thought very well she set her briefcase on the counter then the metal box carefully she removed the wrapped bronze id like your opinion dr hawthorne just on a visual examination of the bronze of course id be delighted the projects been the hot topic around here for the last day or two giovanni put in as miranda began to unwrap the velvet ah he let out a sigh as she set the undraped bronze on the counter bella molto bella a fine execution richard pushed his glasses back into place and squinted at the bronze simple fluid wonderful form and details perspective sensual giovanni said bending to look closely the arrogance and the allure of the female miranda cocked a brow at giovanni before giving her attention back to richard do you recognize her its the dark lady of the medicis thats my opinion as well and the style renaissance unquestionably richard reached out with a tentative finger to stroke the left cheekbone i wouldnt say the model was used to represent a mythical or religious figure but herself yes the lady as the lady miranda agreed the artist portrayed her id guess as she was from an artists standpoint i would say he knew her personally ill need to do a search for documents your help would be invaluable there id be happy to help if this can be authenticated as a major piece from the renaissance period it will be quite a coup for standjo and for you dr jones shed thought of it indeed shed thought of it but she smiled coolly i dont count my chickens if she spent any amount of time in the environment in which she was found and it appears she did the corrosion growth would have been affected ill want the results of that of course she added to giovanni but i cant depend on it for true accuracy youll run relative comparisons thermoluminescence yes she smiled at richard again well also be testing the cloth and the wood from the stair tread but the documentation will make it all the more conclusive miranda leaned a hip on the corner of the small pickledoak desk she was found in the cellar of the villa della donna oscura secreted under the bottom tread of the stairs ill have a report on the details we know at this point for the three of you the three of you and vincente only she added security is one of the directors top concerns whoever you require to assist you must have agrade clearance and the data you give them must be kept to a minimum until weve completed all tests so for now shes ours giovanni winked at her shes mine miranda corrected with a slow serious smile i need any and all information on the villa itself on the woman i want to know her richard nodded ill start right away miranda turned back to the bronze lets see what shes made of she murmured a few hours later miranda rolled her shoulders and eased back in her chair the bronze stood before her smiling slyly there were no signs of brass or silicon bronze no platinum none of the metals or materials that werent used in the renaissance in the sliver of patina and metal shed extracted the bronze had a clay core just as a piece of that era should have the early testing of the corrosion levels indicated late fifteenth century dont be hasty she ordered herself preliminary tests werent enough so far she was working in the negative there was nothing out of place no alloy that didnt belong no sign of tool work that didnt jibe with the era in her visual exam but she had yet to determine the positive was the lady true or false she took time for one cup of coffee and some of the pretty crackers and cheese elise had provided for her in lieu of lunch jet lag was threatening and she refused to acknowledge it the coffee strong black and potent as only the italians could brew pumped through her system providing a caffeine mask over fatigue shed crash eventually miranda knew but not for a little while yet placing her hands over the keyboard she began hammering out the preliminary report for her mother it was as strict and dry as a maiden aunt thus far devoid of speculation and with very little personality she may have thought of the bronze as a puzzle a mystery to be solved but none of the romance of that found its way into her report she sent the report via email saved it on the hard drive under her password then took the bronze with her for the last test of the day the technician had little english and entirely too much awe for the daughter of the direttrice for miranda to find comfortable miranda conjured up an errand and sent her off for more coffee alone she began the thermoluminescence process ionizing radiation would trap electrons in higherenergy states in the clay core of a bronze when heated the crystals in the clay would give off bursts of light miranda set the equipment taking quick notes on each step and result in a notebook she took the measurements of those bursts logging them in adding them to her notes as well as for backup she increased the radiation heated the clay again to measure how susceptible it was to electron trapping those measurements were carefully logged in turn the next step was to test the radiation levels from the location where the bronze had been discovered she tested both the dirt samples and the wood it was a matter of math now though the accuracy of the method was hardly foolproof it was one more weight to add to the whole late fifteenth century she had no doubt of it savonarola had been preaching against luxury and pagan art during that period miranda mused the piece was a glorious kick in the ass to that narrowminded view the medicis were in control of florence with the incompetent piero the unfortunate taking the helm for a short period before he was expelled from the city by king charles viii of france the renaissance was moving from its early glory when the architect brunelleschi the sculptor donatello and the painter masaccio revolutionized the conception and the functions of art coming from that the next generation and the dawn of the sixteenth century leonardo michelangelo raphael nonconformists searching for pure originality she knew the artist knew in her heart her gut there was nothing he had created that she hadnt studied as intensely and completely as a woman studies the face of her lover but the lab wasnt the place for heart she reminded herself or gut instinct she would run all the tests again and a third time she would compare the known formula for bronzes of that era and check and recheck every ingredient and alloy in the statue she would dog richard hawthorne for documentation and shed find the answers chapter three sunrise over the rooftops and domes of florence was a magnificent moment it was art and glory the same delicate light had shimmered over the city when men had conceived and constructed the grand domes and great towers had faced them with marble mined from the hills and decorated them with the images of saints and gods the stars winked out as the sky turned from black velvet to pearl gray the silhouettes of the long slender pines that dotted the tuscan hillsides blurred as the light shifted wavered then bloomed the city was quiet as it was so rarely while the sun inched upward misting the air with hints of gold the iron gates over the storefront newsstand rattled and clanged while the proprietor yawned and prepared for the days business only a few lights shone in the many windows of the city one of them was mirandas she dressed quickly facing away from the stunning canvas that was quietly painting itself outside her hotel room her mind was on work how much progress would she make that day how much closer would she come to the answers she dealt in facts and would stick with facts no matter how tempting it was to leap to the next level instincts couldnt always be trusted science could she bundled her hair back in a clip then slipped on lowheeled pumps to go with her simple navy suit her early arrival would guarantee her a couple of hours of working in solitude though she appreciated having experts at her disposal the dark lady had already become hers she intended for every step of the project to bear her stamp she held her id up to the glass door for the heavyeyed guard he left his coffee and breakfast cakes reluctantly and shuffled over to frown at the card at her face then back at the card he seemed to sigh as he unlocked the door youre very early dottoressa jones i have work americans as far as the guard was concerned thought of little else you must sign the logbook of course as she approached the counter the scent of his coffee reached out and grabbed her by the throat she did her best not to drool as she scrawled her name and noted the time of arrival in the log grazie prego she murmured then started toward the elevator so shed make coffee first she told herself she could hardly expect to be sharp before shed had at least one jolt of caffeine she used her key card to access the correct floor then entered her code once she was at the security post outside the lab when she hit the switches banks of fluorescent lights blinked on a quick glance told her everything was in place that work in progress had been tidily stored at the end of the workday her mother would expect that she thought she would tolerate nothing less than neat efficiency in her employees and in her children miranda shrugged as if to shift the resentment off her shoulders within moments she had coffee brewing her computer booted and was transcribing her notes from the evening before onto the hard drive if she moaned at the first taste of hot rich coffee there was no one to hear if she leaned back in her chair eyes closed smile dreamy there was no one to see for five minutes she allowed herself to indulge to be a woman lost in one of lifes small pleasures her feet slipped out of her practical pumps her sharpboned face softened she all but purred if the guard had seen her now he would have approved completely then she rose poured a second cup donned her lab coat and got to work she retested the dirt from the site first measuring the radiation running figures once again she tested the clay that had been carefully extracted she put a smear of each on a slide then made a third with the scrapings of bronze and patina and studied each under the microscope she was studying her computer screen when the first of the staff began to trickle in it was there giovanni hunted her down with a fresh cup of coffee and a delicately sugared roll tell me what you see she demanded and continued to study the colors and shapes on the screen i see a woman who doesnt know how to relax he laid his hands on her shoulders rubbed gently miranda youve been here a week now and havent taken an hour to yourself the imaging giovanni ah still massaging he shifted so that their heads were close the primary decay process corrosion the white line there indicates the original surface of the bronze no yes the corrosion is thick on the surface and it grows downward deep into the metal which would be typical of a bronze of four hundred years we need to pinpoint the rate of growth never easy he said and she was in a damp basement the corrosion would have grown quickly there im taking that into account she removed her glasses to pinch out the pressure in the bridge of her nose the temperature and the humidity we can calculate an average there ive never heard of corrosion levels like this being faked theyre there giovanni inside her the cloth is no more than a hundred years old less i think by a decade or two a hundred irritated miranda turned to face him youre certain yes youll run tests of your own but youll find im right eighty to a hundred years no more she turned back to the computer her eyes saw what they saw her brain knew what it knew all right then were to believe that the bronze was wrapped in that cloth and in that cellar for eighty to a hundred years but all tests indicate the bronze itself is a great deal older perhaps here eat your breakfast um she took the roll absently and bit in eighty years ago the early part of the century world war one valuables are often hidden during wartime true enough but where was she before that why have we never heard of her hidden again she murmured when piero medici was expelled from the city during the italian wars perhaps hidden yes that could be accepted but forgotten dissatisfied she shook her head this isnt the work of an amateur giovanni she ordered the computer to print out the image its the work of a master there has to be some documentation somewhere i need to know more about that villa more about the woman who did she leave her possessions to who lived in the villa immediately after she died did she have children im a chemist he said with a smile not a historian for this you want richard is he in yet he is ever punctual wait he laughed a little taking her arm before she could hurry away have dinner with me tonight giovanni she gave his hand an affectionate squeeze then drew hers away i appreciate the fact that youre worried about me but im fine im too busy to go out to dinner youre working too hard and not taking care of yourself im your friend so its up to me i promise ill order an enormous meal from room service while i work at the hotel tonight she touched her lips to his cheek just as the door opened elise lifted a brow mouth tight in disapproval im sorry to interrupt miranda the director would like you to come to her office at fourthirty for a discussion of your progress of course elise do you know if richards free for a moment were all at your disposal thats exactly what i was telling her obviously immune to frost giovanni grinned then slipped out of the room miranda after a brief hesitation elise stepped farther into the room and shut the door at her back i hope you wont be offended but i feel i should warn you that giovanni darkly amused by elises obvious discomfort miranda merely smiled blandly giovanni hes brilliant at his work a valuable asset to standjo but on a personal level hes a womanizer i wouldnt say so head angled miranda slipped on her glasses tipping them down to look over the copper tops a womanizer uses giovanni gives that may be true but the fact is he flirts with every female on staff including you elises wellarched brows drew together on occasion and i can tolerate that as part of his personality still the lab isnt the place for flirtations and stolen kisses god you sound like my mother and nothing could have irritated miranda more but ill keep that in mind elise the next time giovanni and i toy with having wild sex in the chem lab i have offended you elise sighed lifted her hands helplessly i only wanted to its just that he can be so charming i nearly fell for it myself when i first transferred here i was feeling so low and unhappy were you the ice in mirandas tone had elise straightening her slim shoulders divorcing your brother didnt make me jump for joy miranda it was a painful and difficult decision and i can only hope it was the right one i loved drew but he her voice broke and she shook her head fiercely i can only say it wasnt enough for either of us the gleam of moisture in elises eyes brought miranda a hard tug of shame im sorry she murmured it happened so quickly i didnt think you gave a damn i did i still do she sighed then blinked back the threatening tears i wish it had been different but the fact is that it wasnt and isnt different i have to live my life yes you do miranda shrugged andrews been so miserable and it was easier for me to blame you i dont imagine the breakup of a marriage is ever one persons fault i dont think either of us was very good at marriage it seemed cleaner and even kinder to end it than to go on pretending like my parents elises eyes widened oh miranda i didnt mean its all right i agree with you my parents havent lived under the same roof in more than twentyfive years but neither of them bothers to end it cleanly or kindly andrew may be hurt but all in all i prefer your way it was she admitted the route she would have taken herself if shed ever made the mistake of getting married in the first place divorce she decided was a more humane alternative to the pale illusion of marriage shall i apologize for all the nasty thoughts ive had about you in the last year or so elises lips curved not necessary i understand your loyalty to drew i admire it and always have i know how close the two of you are united we stand divided we rush to therapy we never really managed to be friends we were colleagues then relatives but never really made it to friends even with all we have in common maybe we cant but id like to think we could at least be friendly i dont have many friends too much of an intimacy risk miranda thought with a hint of selfdisgust it would be foolish of me to refuse the offer of one elise opened the door again i dont have many friends either she said quietly its nice to have you touched miranda stared after her then gathered her printouts and samples to lock them in the safe she snagged carter briefly assigning him to check all sources for bronze formulas of the appropriate era though shed already done so herself and would do so again she found richard nearly buried in computer printouts and books his nose all but scraped along the pages like a bloodhounds on the scent find anything i can use miranda asked him huh he blinked at the page but didnt look up the villa was completed in lorenzo de medici commissioned the architect but the deed was held by giulietta buonadoni she was a powerful woman miranda pulled up a chair pushing at papers it wouldnt have been usual for a mistress to own such valuable property she cut quite a deal women of great beauty already hold great power he muttered the clever ones know how to use it history indicates she was clever intrigued miranda took a photo of the bronze out of her file you can see in her face this was a woman who knew her own worth what else can you tell me about her her name comes up from time to time but theres not much detail her lineage for instance is buried in time i cant find anything the first mentions of her ive found so far begin in indications are she was a member of the medici household potentially a young cousin of clarice orsini so going with that lorenzo took his wifes cousin for his mistress keeping it in the family she said with a smile richard only nodded soberly it would explain how she caught his eye though another source indicates she may have been the illegitimate daughter of one of the members of lorenzos neoplatonic academy that would also have put her into his line of sight however they met he moved her into the villa in by all accounts she was as devoted to the arts as he and used her power and influence to gather the stars of the era under her roof she died in during the siege of florence interesting again she thought a time when valuables might have been secreted away leaning back she swung her glasses by the earpiece so she died before it was certain the medicis would remain in power so it appears children i havent found anything on children give me a few of those books she decided ill help you look vincente morelli was the closest thing to an uncle miranda could claim hed known her parents since before she was born and for several years had handled the publicity and promotions and events for the institute in maine when his first wife had taken ill hed brought her home to florence and had buried her there twelve years ago hed grieved for three years then to everyones surprise had abruptly married a marginally successful actress the fact that gina was two years younger than his eldest daughter had caused some consternation in his family and some smirking grins among his associates vincente was round as a barrel with a pavarotti chest and legs like tree stumps while his wife resembled a young sophia loren lush and lusty and gorgeous she was rarely seen without several pounds of italian gold and winking gems clasped around her throat and wrist or at her ears they were both boisterous loud and occasionally crude miranda was fond of both of them but often wondered how such an extroverted couple managed to remain in close association with her mother ive sent copies of the reports upstairs miranda told vincente as he filled her small office with his bulk and personality i thought youd want to see the progress and that way when the time comes for an announcement to the media youll have been able to extrapolate data for the statement yes yes the facts are simple enough to write but tell me what you think cara give me some color my thoughts are weve still got work to do miranda he said it slowly with a persuasive smile as he leaned back in the chair that creaked alarmingly under his weight your beautiful mother has tied my hands until all what is it ts are crossed so when im able to take this story to the press it must have impact and passion and romance if the bronze proves to be genuine youll have impact yes yes but more the lovely and talented daughter of the direttrice comes across the sea one lady to another what do you think of her what do you feel from her miranda arched a brow and tapped her pencil against the edge of her desk i think the fiesole bronze is ninety point four centimeters in height twentyfour point sixtyeight kilograms in weight its a bronze nude female she continued holding back a smile as vincente rolled his eyes to the ceiling crafted in the renaissance style testing so far indicates it was cast in the last decade of the fifteenth century you are too like your mama you wont get anywhere with me with insults miranda warned and they grinned at each other you make my job difficult cara when the time was right he thought hed take his own angles on the press release elizabeth scanned the paperwork with sharp eyes miranda had been very careful with the facts with numbers with formulas with every step and stage of every test but it was still possible to see where she was leaning and where she believed she would end you believe its genuine every test indicates its age is between four hundred and fifty and five hundred years you have copies of the computergenerated photos the chemical tests who took them i did and the thermoluminescence process who conducted it i did and the dating by style is also yours the bulk of the documentation is from your own research you supervised the chemical tests testing the patina and metal personally did the formula comparisons isnt that why you brought me here yes but i also provided you with a team of experts i expected you to make more use of them if i run the tests myself i have more control miranda said curtly theres less possibility of error this is my field ive authenticated five pieces from this era three of them bronzes one of them a cellini the cellini had unassaultable documentation and excavation records regardless miranda said with bubbling resentment though she imagined herself flinging up her hands shaking her fists she kept her arms quietly by her sides i ran precisely the same tests on that piece as i have on this one in order to rule out forgery ive consulted with the louvre the smithsonian the bargello i believe my credentials are in order wearily elizabeth leaned back no one is questioning your credentials or your skill i would hardly have called you in on this project if i doubted either then why are you questioning them now that ive done the work im commenting on your lack of teamwork miranda and im concerned that you formed your opinion the moment you saw the bronze i recognized the style the era and the artist as did you miranda thought furiously damn you as did you however she continued coolly i conducted every standard test then retested and documented the procedure and the results from these i can form an opinion and a belief that the bronze currently locked in the safe is a depiction of giulietta buonadoni cast circa late fifteenth century and the work of a young michelangelo buonarroti i will agree that the style is of the school of michelangelo the bronze is too early a work to be of his school he was barely twenty and only genius can duplicate genius to my knowledge there is no documentation of a bronze of this artist that supports this piece as his work then the documentation has yet to be found or it never existed we have documentation of many of his pieces that are lost why not have a piece and not the documentation the cartoon for the fresco for the battle of cascina lost his bronze of julius the second destroyed and melted down many of his drawings apparently burned by his own hand shortly before his death however we know they existed the dark lady exists the age is right the style is right particularly in his early work he would have been about eighteen when this was cast hed already carved madonna of the stairs battle of the lapiths and centaurs he had already shown genius considering herself a patient women elizabeth merely nodded there is no argument that the bronze is superior work and of his style this does not however prove it is his work he lived in the medici palace was treated like lorenzos son he knew her there is documentation that they were acquainted she was often used as a model it would be more unusual if he hadnt used her you knew this possibility existed when you sent for me possibility and fact are different issues miranda elizabeth folded her hands as you said on your first day here you dont deal in possibilities im giving you fact the formula of the bronze is correct exactly correct x rays verify that the tool work is authentic for the era the clay core and scrapings have been dated the tests reveal the deep downward corrosion growth the patina is correct the bronze is latefifteenthcentury most likely the last decade she held up a hand before her mother could speak as an expert in the field and after a careful and objective study of the piece its my conclusion that the bronze is the work of michelangelo all thats missing is his signature and he didnt sign his pieces with the exception of the pietà in rome i wont argue with the results of your testing elizabeth angled her head with your conclusions however i hold reservations we cant afford to let your enthusiasm weigh on either side youre to say nothing of this to any of the staff at this point and i must insist you say nothing at all outside the lab if any rumors leak to the press it would be disastrous im hardly going to call the newspapers and announce ive authenticated a lost michelangelo but i have she placed her hands on the desk and leaned forward i know it and sooner or later youll have to admit it nothing would please me more i promise you but in the meantime this must be kept quiet im not in this for glory though she could taste it on the tip of her tongue she could feel it tingling in the tips of her fingers were all in this for glory elizabeth corrected with a small smile why pretend otherwise if your theory proves out youll have plenty of it if it doesnt and youre premature in your statement youll damage your reputation and mine and that of this facility that miranda i wont allow continue the document search i intend to miranda turned on her heel and stalked out she would gather up a pile of books take them back to the hotel and by god she told herself shed find the link at three am when the phone rang she was sitting up in bed surrounded by books and papers the twotoned shrill jerked her out of some colorful dream of sunny hillsides and cool marble courtyards musical fountains and harpsong disoriented she blinked against the glare of the lights shed left burning and groped for the phone pronto dr jones hello miranda i need you to come to my house as soon as possible what mother she stared blearyeyed at the bedside clock its three in the morning im perfectly aware of the time as is the assistant minister who was awakened some twenty minutes ago by a reporter who demanded to know the details of the lost bronze by michelangelo what but i dont choose to discuss this over the phone elizabeths voice vibrated with cold and barely suppressed fury do you remember how to get here yes of course ill expect you within thirty minutes she said seconds before the phone clicked miranda made it in twenty elizabeths home was small and elegant a twostory dwelling typical of florence with its yellowed ivory walls and redtiled roof flowers spilled out of pots and window boxes and were cared for religiously by the maid in the dark the windows gleamed bright stripes of light leaking through the louvered blinds it was roomy as miranda recalled an attractive arena for entertaining it would have occurred to neither mother nor daughter to share the space while miranda was in florence the door was wrenched open before she could knock elizabeth stood neatly groomed and perfectly presented in a peachcolored robe what happened miranda demanded thats precisely my question strict control was all that prevented elizabeth from slamming the door if this was your way of proving your point of exerting your expertise or of causing me professional embarrassment all you accomplished was the last i dont know what youre talking about miranda hadnt taken time to tame her hair and scooped an impatient hand through it to shove it out of her eyes you said a reporter called thats correct straight as a general elizabeth turned and strode into the front parlor a fire was laid but had yet to be lighted lamps blazed shooting shine from polished wood there was a vase of white roses on the mantel and nothing else the colors were all soft all pale part of mirandas mind registered what it always did when she stepped inside this or any room in the house it was more showcase than home and just as cool the reporter of course refused to reveal his source but he had quite a bit of information vincente would never have gone to the press prematurely no elizabeth agreed coolly vincente would not could the plumber what was his name have talked to a reporter the plumber couldnt have provided him with photos of the bronze with test results test results because her knees were suddenly loose miranda sat my tests standjos tests elizabeth said between her teeth despite the fact that you conducted them it remains the responsibility of my lab and its the security of that lab that has been breached but how it hit home then the tone the look in her mothers eyes she rose slowly you think i called a reporter and fed him information secured photos and test results elizabeth merely studied mirandas furious face did you no i did not even if we hadnt discussed the ramifications i would never undermine a project this way its my reputation on the line as well and its your reputation that could very well be made miranda looked into elizabeths eyes and saw the opinion had already been formed you can go to hell the reporter quoted from your report straight to hell and take your precious lab with you its always meant more to you than your own flesh and blood my precious lab has provided you with training and employment and with the potential for reaching the top of your field now because of haste and stubbornness and ego my professional integrity is in question and your reputation may very well be ruined the bronze is being transferred to another facility today transferred weve been fired elizabeth snapped then snatched up the phone that rang on a table beside her her lips thinned and her breath hissed through them once no comment she said in italian and hung up another reporter the third whos reached me on my private number it doesnt matter though her stomach was jumping miranda spoke calmly let them transfer her any reputable lab will only verify my findings thats precisely the kind of arrogance that put us in this position her eyes fired such icy temper that miranda didnt notice the strain or dark circles under them ive worked for years to reach this point to build and maintain a facility that is without question among the finest in the world this wont change that leaks happen even in the finest facilities they dont happen at standjo the silk of elizabeths robe swirled as she paced the matching slippers made no sound as they trampled the pink roses blooming on the carpet ill begin repairing the damage immediately i expect you to avoid the press and take the first available flight back to maine im not leaving until this is finished it is finished for you your services are no longer required at standjo florence she turned back to her daughter her face set her tired eyes chilly and direct your security clearance will be voided i see a quick execution without a trial i shouldnt be surprised she said half to herself why am i this isnt the time to indulge in drama because her nerves were raw elizabeth indulged herself and moved to a cabinet for the brandy there was a dull drumming at the base of her skull that caused her more irritation than pain its going to take quite a bit of work to put standjo back on an even keel after this and there will be questions a lot of questions with her back to miranda elizabeth splashed two inches of brandy into a snifter it would be better for you if you arent in the country when theyre asked im not afraid of questions the panic was creeping in now sneaking slyly up her spine she was to be sent away the dark lady taken from her her work questioned her integrity shadowed i didnt do anything illegal or unethical and ill stand by my authentication of the bronze because its right because its real for your sake i hope so the press has your name miranda elizabeth lifted her brandy in an unconscious toast believe me theyll use it let them arrogance elizabeth hissed out a breath obviously you havent taken account that your actions will reflect on me personally and professionally you thought of it miranda shot back when you brought me here to verify and corroborate your own suspicions you may head standjo but you dont have the qualifications for this kind of work you wanted the glory mirandas heart hammered painfully in her throat as she stepped closer you sent for me because i share part of your name and your blood however much we both regret that elizabeths eyes narrowed the accusation wasnt inaccurate but neither was it complete i gave you the opportunity of a lifetime because of your qualifications and yes because youre a jones youve damaged that opportunity and my organization in the process ive done nothing but what i was brought here to do ive spoken to no one outside the organization and to no one in the organization who didnt meet with your clearance specifications elizabeth drew a calming breath her decision had already been made she reminded herself there was no point in discussing it further you will leave italy today you will not return to the lab or contact anyone who works there if you dont agree ill be forced to terminate your position at the museum you dont run the institute anymore and neither does father andrew and i do if you want that situation to continue youll do what i say whether you believe it or not im trying to save you embarrassment dont do me any favors mother we wouldnt want to spoil your record banished was all she could think cut off from the most exciting work of her life and sent away as powerlessly as a child ordered to her room ive given you your choice miranda if you stay youll do so alone and you will no longer be welcome at any standjo facility including the new england institute of art history miranda could feel herself begin to shake from both fear and rage even as she heard the inner screams of that fear and rage echo in her head she spoke quietly ill never forgive you for this not ever but ill go because the institutes important to me and because when this is over youll have to apologize and ill tell you to go to hell those will be the last words i ever speak to you she took the snifter out of her mothers hand salute she said and tossed back the brandy defiantly setting the snifter down with a crack of glass against wood she turned and walked out she didnt look back chapter four andrew jones was thinking of marriage and failure as he sipped jack daniels black straight up from a short glass he was well aware that everyone who knew him thought it was long past time for him to turn the page on his divorce and move on but he didnt feel like moving on not when it was so comforting to wallow marriage had been an enormous step for him and one hed considered carefully even though hed been wildly in love making that commitment turning an emotion into a legal document had given him many sleepless nights no one on the jones side of the family had ever made a successful run at marriage he and miranda called it the jones curse his grandmother had outlived her husband by more than a decade and had never at least in her grandsons hearing had a good word to say about the man shed lived with for thirtyodd years it was hard to blame her as the late and unlamented andrew jones had been infamous for his affection for young blondes and jack daniels black his namesake was well aware that the old man had been a bastard clever and successful but a bastard nonetheless andrews father preferred digs to home fires and had spent most of his sons childhood away from home brushing ancient dirt from ancient bones when he was in residence hed agreed with everything his wife said blinked owlishly at his children as if hed forgotten how they came to be in his line of sight and locked himself for hours at a time in his office it hadnt been women and whiskey for charles jones hed committed his adultery and neglect with science not that the great dr elizabeth standfordjones had given a shit andrew thought as he brooded over what hed intended to be one friendly drink at annies place shed left the childrearing to servants run the household like a nazi general and ignored her husband as sublimely as he had ignored her it always made andrew shudder to imagine that at least twice these coldblooded selfabsorbed people had tangled in bed long enough to conceive a couple of children when he was a boy andrew had often fantasized that charles and elizabeth had purchased him and his sister from some poor couple whod wept copiously when they traded their children for rent money when he was older hed enjoyed imagining that he and miranda had been created in a lab experiments conceived out of science rather than sex but the sad fact was that there was too much jones in him for it not to have come down naturally yeah he thought and lifted his glass old charles and elizabeth had tangoed one night thirtythree years ago and conceived the next generation of assholes but hed tried andrew told himself letting the whiskey slide down his throat in a hot caress hed done his best to make his marriage work to make elise happy to be the kind of husband she wanted and break the jones curse and had failed all around ill take another annie no you wont andrew shifted on his stool sighed gustily hed known annie mclean most of his life and knew how to get around her in the sweet summer when they were seventeen theyd tumbled together onto a rough blanket over rougher sand and had made love by the crashing waves of the atlantic he supposed the stumbling sex which had turned out to be a first for both of them had as much to do with the beer theyd consumed the night itself and the foolishness of youth as the licks of heat theyd sparked off each other and neither of them could have known what that one night those few hot hours by the sea would do to both of them come on annie let me have another drink youve already had two so one more wont hurt annie finished drawing a beer slid the mug gracefully down the length of the cherry wood bar toward the waiting customer briskly she wiped her narrow hands on her bar apron at fivesix and a hundred thirty welltoned pounds annie mclean gave the impression of nononsense competence a select few including a twotiming cheat of an exhusband knew there was a delicatewinged blue butterfly on her butt her wheatcolored hair was worn short and spiky to frame a face more interesting than pretty her chin was pointed her nose listed slightly to the left and was splattered with freckles her voice was pure down east and tended to flatten vowels she could and had tossed grown men out of her bar with her own workroughened hands annies place was hers because shed made it hers shed sunk every penny of her savings from her days of cocktail waitressing into the bar every penny her slicktalking ex hadnt run off with and had begged and borrowed the rest shed worked day and night transforming what had been little more than a cellar into a comfortable neighborhood bar she ran a clean place knew her regulars their families their troubles she knew when to draw another draft when to switch to coffee and when to demand car keys and call cabs she looked at andrew and shook her head hed drink himself blind if she let him andrew go home make yourself a meal im not hungry he smiled knowing how to put his dimples to work its cold and rainy out annie i just want a little something to warm the blood fine she turned to the coffee station and filled a mug from the pot this is hot and fresh christ i can go right down the street and get a goddamn drink without the hassle she merely lifted her eyebrows drink your coffee and stop whining with this she began to work her way down the bar the rain was keeping most of her customers home but those who had braved the storm were glued to their seats sipping beer watching the sports channel on tv huddled in conversations there was a pretty fire burning in the little stone hearth and someone had plugged in quarters and ella fitzgerald on the juke it was her kind of night warm friendly easy this was the reason shed been willing to risk every dime to work her hands raw and lie awake in bed worrying night after night not many had believed she could succeed a twentysixyearold woman whose only business experience had come from serving mugs of beer and counting tips seven years later and annies place was a jones point standard andrew had believed she remembered with a tug of guilt as she saw him stomp out of the bar hed lent her money when the banks wouldnt hed come by with sandwiches when shed been painting walls and staining wood hed listened to her dreams when others had ignored them he figured he owed her she thought now and he was a decent man who paid his debts but he couldnt erase the night sixteen years before when lost in love with him shed given him her innocence taken his he couldnt make her forget that in doing so theyd created a life one that had flickered only briefly he couldnt make her forget the look on his face when with joy leaping under terror shed told him she was pregnant his face had gone blank his body stiff as he sat on the rock on the long stretch of beach and stared out to sea and his voice had been flat cool impersonal when he offered to marry her paying a debt she thought now nothing more nothing less and by offering to do what most would consider the honorable thing hed broken her heart losing the baby only two weeks later was fate she supposed it had spared both of them overwhelming decisions but shed loved what had been growing inside her just as shed loved andrew once she accepted the baby was gone shed stopped loving that she knew had been as much a relief to andrew as it had been to her the hum of friendship she thought was a lot easier to dance to than the pluck of heartstrings damn women were the bane of his existence andrew decided as he unlocked his car and climbed behind the wheel always telling you what to do how to do it and most of all how you were doing it wrong he was glad he was done with them he was better off burying himself in work at the institute by day and blurring the edges with whiskey at night nobody got hurt that way especially him now he was much too sober and the night ahead was much too long he drove through the rain wondering what it would be like to just keep driving to go until he just ran out of gas and start fresh wherever that might be he could change his name get a job in construction he had a strong back and good hands maybe hard manual labor was the answer no one would know him or expect anything of him but he knew he wouldnt he would never leave the institute it was as nothing else had ever been home he needed it every bit as much as it needed him well he had a bottle or two at the house there was no reason he couldnt have a couple drinks in front of his own fire to lull him to sleep but he saw the lights winking through the rain as he drove up the winding lane miranda he hadnt expected his sister home not for days yet his fingers tightened on the wheel as he thought of her in florence with elise it took him several minutes after hed stopped the car before he was able to relax them the wind whipped at him as he shoved the car door open rain slapped at his face and streamed down his collar directly over the peaks and gables of the house the sky exploded with sharp forks of lightning a wild night he imagined miranda was inside enjoying it she loved a good storm for himself he would take peace quiet and oblivion he dashed toward the door then shook himself like a dog the minute he was inside the foyer he hung his wet coat on the old oak hall rack dragged a hand through his hair without glancing in the antique mirror he could hear the funereal tones of mozarts requiem coming from the parlor if miranda was playing that he knew the trip hadnt gone well he found her curled up in a chair in front of the fire bundled into her favored gray cashmere robe sipping tea from their grandmothers best china all of her comfort tools he noted neatly in place youre back early looks that way she studied him she was sure hed been drinking but his eyes were clear his color normal at least he was still marginally sober though he wanted a drink he sat down across from her it was easy to spot the signs of simmering temper but he knew her better than anyone and could also see the misery under it so whats the deal she had a project for me because shed hoped he would come home before she went to bed miranda had brought two cups she poured tea into the second now and pretended she didnt see andrews wince of distaste she knew very well hed prefer a glass of whiskey an incredible project miranda continued holding out the cup and saucer a bronze was discovered in the cellar of the villa della donna oscura do you know the history of the place refresh me giulietta buonadoni okay got it the dark lady a mistress of one of the medicis lorenzo the magnificent at least he was her first protector miranda specified grateful that andrews knowledge of the era was thorough enough it would save time the bronze was of the lady herself no mistaking that face she wanted me to do the tests the dating he waited a beat elise could have handled it elises field is broader than mine there was a hint of annoyance in mirandas tone renaissance is my era bronzes my specialty elizabeth wanted the best she always does so you ran the tests i ran them i ran them again i had top members of the staff assisting me i did everything personally step by step then i went back and did it all again and it was genuine andrew some of the excitement leaked through as she leaned forward late fifteenth century thats incredible wonderful why arent you celebrating theres more she had to take a breath steady herself its a michelangelo jesus he set his cup aside hurriedly are you sure i dont remember anything about a lost bronze a stubborn line dug its way between her eyebrows id stake my reputation on it its an early work brilliantly executed its a gorgeous piece echoing the sensual style of his drunken bacchus i was still working on documentation when i left but theres enough to support it the bronze wasnt documented miranda began to tap her foot in irritation giulietta probably hid it or at least kept it to herself politics it fits she insisted id have proven it without a doubt if shed given me more time why didnt she unable to sit miranda unfolded her legs and got up to jab at the fire with a poker someone leaked it to the press we werent nearly ready for an official announcement and the government got nervous they fired standjo and she fired me she accused me of leaking it furious she whirled back of wanting the glory so badly id have risked the project to get it i would never have done that no of course not he could brush that aside without a thought they fired her though it was small of him he couldnt quite stop the grin i bet that set her off she was livid under other circumstances i might get some satisfaction out of that but now ive lost the project not only wont i get credit but the only way ill see that piece again is in a museum damn it andrew i was so close you can bet that when the bronze is authenticated and announced shell find a way to get standjos name in it he arched a brow at his sister and when she does youll just have to make sure yours isnt left out its not the same she took it away from me was all miranda could think take what you can get he rose as well wandering over to the liquor cabinet because he would have to ask you saw elise yes miranda slid her hands into the pockets of her robe because she would have to answer she looks fine i think shes well suited to managing the lab there she asked how you were and you told her i was just dandy miranda watched him pour the first drink i didnt think you wanted me to tell her you were turning into a brooding selfdestructive drunk ive always brooded he said saluting her all of us do so that doesnt count is she seeing anyone i dont know we never got around to discussing our sex lives andrew you have to stop this why because its a waste and its stupid and frankly though i like her shes not worth it she lifted her shoulders no ones worth it i loved her he murmured watching the liquor swirl before he drank i gave her the best i had did you ever consider that maybe she didnt give her best maybe she was the one who didnt measure up he studied miranda over the rim of his glass no maybe you should or maybe you should consider that the best you had and the best she had didnt equal the best together marriages fail all the time people get over it he studied the liquor watching the light flicker through the glass maybe if they didnt get over it so easily marriages wouldnt fail so often and maybe if people didnt pretend love makes the world go round theyd pick their partners with more care love does make the world go round miranda thats why the worlds so fucked up he lifted his glass and drank deeply chapter five the sky shimmered with a cold gray angry dawn restless dark and full of sound the sea hammered against the rocks and rose up to punch its white fists into the raw and bitter air spring would have a fight on its hands before it could beat back winter nothing could have pleased miranda more she stood on the bluff her mood as fitful as the churning water below she watched it spew up from the rocks iceedged and mean and drew in the ancient violence of its scent shed slept poorly tangled in dreams she blamed on temper as much as travel fatigue she wasnt one for dreaming it was still dark when shed given up on sleep and had dressed in a thick green sweater and duncolored slacks of soft wool shed scraped out the last of the coffee andrew wasnt going to be pleased when he awoke and had brewed herself half a pot now she sipped that coffee strong and black out of a big white mug and watched dawn claw its way to life in the unhappy eastern sky the rain had stopped but it would come back she thought and as the temperatures had dropped sharply through the night it would likely come back as snow and sleet that was fine that was dandy that was maine florence with its white flashing sun and warm dry wind was an ocean away but inside her in her angry heart it was close the dark lady had been her ticket to glory elizabeth was right about that at least glory was always the goal but by god she had worked for it shed studied pushing herself brutally to learn to absorb to remember when her contemporaries had jumped from party to party and relationship to relationship thered been no wild rebellious period in her life no thumbing her nose at rules and traditions while in college no mad heartwrenching affairs repressed one roommate had called her boring as dirt had been the opinion of another because some secret part of her had agreed she had solved that problem by moving off campus and into a small apartment of her own shed been better off miranda always thought she had no skill for social interactions beneath the armor of composure and the starch of training she was miserably shy with people and so much more comfortable with information so she had read written closed herself into other centuries with a discipline fired by the hot light of ambition that ambition had one focus to be the best and by being the best to see her parents look at her with pride with stunned delight with respect oh it galled her to know that motivation was buried inside her still but shed never been able to dig it out and dispose of it she was nearly thirty had her doctorate her position at the institute a solid reputation in archeometry and a pitiful need to hear her parents applaud her act well she would just have to get over it before long she thought her findings would be proven then she would make certain that she gained the credit she deserved she would write a paper on the dark lady and her own involvement in its testing and authentication and she would never never forgive elizabeth for taking the control and the joy out of her hands or for having the power to do so the wind rose sneaking under her sweater like hands grabbing at flesh the first thin wet flakes began to swirl miranda turned from the sea her boots clattering on rock as she climbed down the cliff the steady beam of the great light continued to circle atop the white tower shooting out over the water and rock though there were no ships within its range from dusk to dawn year after year she thought it never failed some would look and see romance but when miranda studied the sturdy whitewashed tower she saw reliability more she thought now than was usually found in people in the distance the house was still dark and sleepy a fanciful silhouette from another time etched against an unforgiving sky the grass was a sickly winter brown and crunched under her heels from frost the scar of her grandmothers once lovely garden seemed to scold her this year miranda promised herself when she passed the blackened leaves and brittle sticks of stems she would give it some time and attention she would make gardening her hobby she was always promising herself a hobby in the kitchen she poured the last of the coffee from the pot into her mug after a final glance outside at the fastfalling snow she decided to drive to the institute early before the roads were covered from the warm comfort of his rented mercedes he watched the land rover glide effortlessly over the thin layer of snow on the street then turn into the parking lot beside the new england institute of art history it looked like a vehicle that should have been driven by a general during an elegant little war she made quite a picture herself he mused watching her climb out about six feet of female in her boots he judged and most of it wrapped in a steelgray coat that owed more to warmth than fashion her hair was a sexy stoplight red that escaped in untidy curls from a black ski cap she carried a thick briefcase that bulged a bit with its contents and she moved with a precision and purpose that would have made that wartime general proud but beneath that longlegged stride was the arrogant and unwitting sexuality of a woman who believed herself a step beyond the physical need for men it was a swinging aloof gait even in the dim light he recognized her she was he thought with a slow smile a hard woman not to notice hed been sitting there for nearly an hour now entertaining himself with various arias from carmen la bohème the marriage of figaro really he had all he needed for now and had done what he needed to do but he was grateful hed loitered long enough to see her arrive an early riser he decided a woman who liked her work well enough to face it on a cold snowy morning before most of the city stirred he appreciated a person who enjoyed their work god knew he loved his but what to do about dr miranda jones he wondered he imagined she was using the side entrance even now sliding her key card through the slot adding her code on the number pad no doubt she would carefully reset the security alarms once she was inside all reports indicated she was a practical and careful woman he appreciated practical women it was such a joy to corrupt them he could work around her or he could use her either way he would get the job done but using her would be so much more entertaining since this would be his last job it seemed only fair it include some entertainment in addition to the thrill and the profit he thought it would be worth his while to get to know miranda jones to indulge himself with her before he stole from her he saw the light flick on in a window on the third floor of the sprawling granite building straight to work he mused smiling again as he caught the shadow of movement behind the window it was about time he got to work himself he started the car pulled away from the curve and drove off to dress for the next part of his day the new england institute of art history had been built by mirandas greatgrandfather but it was her grandfather andrew jones who had expanded it to its full potential hed always had a keen interest in the arts and had even fancied himself a painter hed been at least good enough to convince a number of healthy young models to take off their clothes and pose for him hed enjoyed socializing with artists entertaining them acting as patron when one particularly an attractive female one caught his eye a ladies man and enthusiastic drinker he might have been but hed also been generous imaginative and had never been afraid to put his money where his heart lay the building was a strong gray granite spreading over a full block with its towering columns its wings and squaredoff archways the original structure had been a museum with carefully tended grounds huge old shade trees and a quiet rather sternfaced dignity andrew had wanted more hed seen the institute as a showcase for art and for artists as an arena where art was displayed restored taught and analyzed so he had cut down the trees slabbed over the grounds and erected the graceful and somewhat fanciful additions to the original structure there were classrooms with high lightfilled windows carefully designed laboratories lofty storerooms and a beehive of offices gallery space had been more than tripled students who wished to study there were taken on merit those who could afford to pay paid dearly for the privilege those who couldnt and were deemed worthy were subsidized art was holy at the institute and science was its deity carved in a stone lintel above the main entrance were the words of longfellow art is long and time is fleeting studying preserving and displaying that art was how the institute spent its time it remained basically true to andrews conception fifty years later with his grandchildren at the helm the museum galleries it held were arguably the finest in maine and the work represented there had been carefully chosen and acquired over the years beginning with charless and then andrews own collections the public areas swept the main floor gallery spilling into gallery through wide archways classrooms and studios jammed the second level with the restoration area separated from them by a small lobby where visitors with the correct passes could tour the work spaces the labs occupied the lower level and shot off into all wings they were despite the grand galleries and educational facilities the foundation the labs miranda often thought were her foundation as well setting her briefcase aside she moved to the federal library table under her window to brew coffee as she switched the pot on her fax line rang after opening her blinds she moved to the machine and took out the page welcome home miranda did you enjoy florence too bad your trip was cut so rudely short where do you think you made your mistake have you thought about it or are you so sure youre right prepare for the fall its going to be a hard jolt ive waited so long ive watched so patiently im watching still and the waits almost over miranda caught herself rubbing a hand up and down her arm to warm it as she read the message though she made herself stop the chill remained there was no name no return number it read like a sly chuckle she thought the tone taunting and eerily threatening but why and who her mother it shamed her that elizabeths name was the first to form in her mind but surely a woman of elizabeths power personality and position wouldnt stoop to cryptic and anonymous messages shed already hurt miranda in the most direct way possible it was more likely a disgruntled employee at either standjo or the institute someone who felt shed been unfair in her policy or work assignments of course that was it she decided and tried to breathe clearly again a technician shed reprimanded or a student who was unhappy with a grade this was only meant to unsettle her and she wouldnt allow it to work but rather than discarding it she slipped it into her bottom drawer and turned the key in the lock putting it out of her mind she sat to outline her day on paper by the time shed completed the first tasks on her list reading her mail and memos organizing her phone messages the sun was up and streaming in bands through the slats of her blinds miranda a quick rap on the door jolted her yes come in she glanced at the clock noting her assistant was punctual as always i saw your car in the lot didnt know you were coming back today no it was unscheduled so how was florence lori moved briskly around the room checking for messages adjusting the slant of the blinds warm sunny sounds wonderful satisfied all was in its proper place lori sat and perched her notebook on her knee she was a pretty blonde with a kewpie doll mouth a voice like betty boop and an edge of efficiency sharp as a honed razor its nice to have you back she said with a smile thanks because the welcome was sincere miranda smiled in return its nice to be back ive got a lot to catch up on right now i need updates on the carbello nude and the bronzino restoration the routine was soothing so much so that miranda forgot everything but the matters at hand for the next two hours leaving lori to set up appointments and meetings she headed out to check in with the lab because she was thinking of andrew miranda decided to detour by his office before heading down his domain was in the opposite wing closer to the public areas the galleries acquisitions and displays were his province while miranda preferred working mainly behind the scenes she strode down the corridors her practical boots treading over marble here and there the wide square windows allowed streams of pale light to streak over the floor offered the muffled sound of street traffic glimpses of buildings and bare trees office doors were discreetly closed the occasional sound of phones or the whine of faxes echoed dully a secretary carried a ream of paper out of the supply room and shot miranda a startledrabbit look before murmuring a good morning dr jones then scurrying on was she that intimidating miranda thought that unfriendly because it made her think of the fax she narrowed her eyes at the womans back as she scooted through a door and closed it behind her maybe she wasnt outgoing maybe the staff didnt have the same easy affection for her that they seemed to have for andrew but she wasnt hard was she it disturbed her to think so to wonder if her innate reserve was perceived as coldness like her mother no she didnt want to believe that those who knew her wouldnt think so she had a solid relationship with lori an easy camaraderie with john carter she didnt run the lab here like a boot camp where no one could speak their mind or tell a joke though no one joked with her she thought she was in charge she reminded herself what else could she expect deliberately she relaxed her shoulders again she couldnt let one timid secretary set her off on a tangent of selfanalysis because happily she had no appointments or public meetings scheduled she wore the same sweater and trousers shed slipped into that morning to watch the dawn her hair was bundled back in an excuse for a braid and curls were already escaping from the messy plait she was thinking that it was past midday in italy and the bronze would be in intense testing it made her shoulders knot up again she stepped through the door of her brothers outer office inside was a sturdy victorian desk two viciously straightbacked chairs filing cabinets in nononsense gray and the woman who guarded it all good morning ms purdue andrews assistant was somewhere on the downside of fifty tidy as a nun and just as strict she wore her streaky saltandpepper hair in an identical knot every day year in year out and was never without a starched blouse and dark blazer and skirt she was always ms purdue she nodded removed her busy fingers from her keyboard and folded them neatly good morning dr jones i didnt know you were back from italy i got back yesterday she tried a smile thinking it was as good a time as any to be more personable with the staff its a bit of a shock coming back to this cold when ms purdue responded only with a brisk nod miranda gave up on the idea gratefully of a chat is my brother in dr jones just stepped downstairs to greet a guest he should be back momentarily would you care to wait or shall i take a message no its nothing ill see him later she turned when she heard male voices echo up the stairs if ms purdues critical eyes hadnt been on her miranda would have made a dash for cover rather than risk the possibility of socializing with andrews guest she wouldnt be stuck if shed gone straight to the lab she thought and briskly brushed the hair out of her eyes and fixed on a polite smile her smile wavered when andrew and his companion reached the top of the stairs miranda this is handy andrew beamed at her and a quick survey showed miranda no sign of a night of drinking saves me from calling your office id like you to meet ryan boldari of the boldari gallery he stepped forward took mirandas hand and brought it smoothly to his lips how nice to meet you finally he had a face that could have been reproduced with rich bold strokes on one of the institutes paintings the dark wild good looks were only marginally tamed by an impeccably cut gray suit and perfectly knotted silk tie his hair was thick black as ink and gloriously wavy his skin was dusky gold taut over strong bones and marred intriguingly by a small crescentshaped scar at the far tip of his left eyebrow his eyes held hers and were a dark rich brown that took little drifts of gold from the light his mouth might have been sculpted by a master and was curved in a smile designed to make a woman wonder how it would feel against hers and sigh she heard a ping a single and cheerful snapping sound inside her head as her heart bumped twice welcome to the institute mr boldari im delighted to be here he kept her hand in his because it appeared to fluster her however politely she smiled there was a faint line of annoyance between her brows she debated giving her hand one good tug then decided it would seem entirely too female a move why dont we step into my office oblivious to whatever games were being played under his nose andrew gestured toward his office door miranda got a minute actually i was just id appreciate a few moments of your time dr jones ryan flashed that smile at her as he shifted his hand from hers to her elbow i have a proposition for your brother i believe youll be interested in your main field of study is renaissance isnt it trapped she allowed herself to be guided into andrews office thats right a brilliant era so rich in beauty and energy you know the work of giorgio vasari of course late renaissance a mannerist one whose style typified the movement toward elegance ryan has three vasaris andrew gestured toward chairs that thanks to ms purdue werent covered with books and papers as they normally were really miranda took a seat and fixed on another smile andrews office was a great deal smaller than hers because he preferred it that way it was also cluttered colorful and full of the trinkets he liked to surround himself with old bones shards of pottery bits of glass she would have preferred to hold this unexpected meeting in the acerbic formality of her own territory because she was nervous she imagined herself drumming her fingers wiggling her foot yes ryan gave his slacks a casual hitch to preserve the crease as he settled himself into a narrow leatherbacked chair dont you find his work a bit selfconscious overripe that too is typical of mannerism miranda countered vasari is an important artist of that time and style agreed ryan merely smiled on a personal level i prefer the style of the early and high renaissance but business is business he waved a hand he had strong graceful hands miranda noted wide of palm long of finger it irritated her to notice embarrassed her to have for a second or two imagined the feel of them on her skin like a teenager faced with a rock star she thought amazed at herself when she deliberately shifted her gaze from his hands it collided with his he smiled again with a definite gleam in his eyes in defense her voice turned chilly and what business do you have with the institute fascinating woman he thought the body of a goddess the manner of a prude the fashion sense of a refugee and a very appealing hint of shyness around those hot blue eyes he kept his eyes locked on hers delighted when faint and flattering color bloomed in her cheeks in his opinion women didnt blush nearly often enough these days he wondered how she looked in those wireframed glasses that were hooked in the neck of her sweater scholarly sexy i met your brother a few months ago when we were both in dc for the women in the arts benefit i believe he went in your stead yes i couldnt get away miranda was hipdeep in the lab andrew grinned im more easily dispensable he leaned back in his own chair ryans interested in our cellini madonna miranda arched a brow its one of our prizes yes ive just seen it glorious your brother and i discussed a trade the cellini her gaze whipped to her brother andrew not permanent ryan said quickly and didnt bother to disguise the chuckle at her quick distress a threemonth exchange to our mutual benefit im planning on doing a cellini exhibit in our new york gallery and the loan of your madonna would be a coup for me in exchange im willing to lend the institute all three of my vasaris for the same span of time you could do the threestylesoftherenaissance exhibit youve muttered about for years andrew pointed out it was one of her dreams a fullscale exhibit showcasing the full scope of her field of interest art artifacts history documents all on display precisely as she chose she kept her hands neatly folded to stop herself from pumping a triumphant fist in the air yes i suppose i could she felt the quick churn of excitement in her gut but turned placidly to ryan the vasaris have been authenticated ryan inclined his head and both of them pretended not to hear andrews low moan yes of course ill see that you get copies of the documents before we draft the agreement and youll do the same for me on the cellini i can have them for you today my assistant can have them messengered to your hotel good id appreciate it well ill leave you to work out the details but when she rose he rose with her and took her hand again i wonder if i can impose on you to show me around a bit andrew tells me that the labs and restoration facilities are your milieu id very much like to see them i before she could excuse herself andrew was up and giving her a none too subtle jab in the ribs you couldnt be in better hands ill see you back here in a couple hours ryan then well check out that clam chowder i promised you looking forward to it my galleries are for the display of art he began keeping mirandas hand casually in his as she strode down the corridor to the next wing i know next to nothing about the science of it do you ever find yourself at odds merging the two no without one there wouldnt be the other realizing her answer had been abrupt she drew a careful breath the man made her nervous nervous enough to show that would never do the institute was built to house both you might say celebrate both as a scientist who studies art i appreciate that i was a miserable student of science he said with such a charming smile her lips curved in response im sure you had other strong points i like to think so he was an observant man and noted carefully the flow of space between wings the position of the stairs offices storerooms windows and of course the security cameras it was exactly as his information had indicated still he would transcribe the observations into detailed notes later but for now he simply filed them neatly in his mind while he enjoyed the subtle fragrance of mirandas perfume nothing overt for dr jones he thought nothing obviously female and the woodsy scent he imagined came from soap rather than a delicate bottle suited her he decided perfectly at the end of a corridor she turned right then stopped to slide her key card into a slot beside a gray metal door a buzzer sounded locks clicked ryan flicked a mild glance upward at the camera our internal security is tight she began no one passes into this department without a key or an escort we often do independent testing for individuals and for other museums she led him into an area much like standjo florence though on a smaller scale technicians worked at computers and microscopes or walked briskly into anterooms with a flap of their lab coat she noted a staff member working with a crusted pot and guided ryan toward it stanley what can you tell us about this the tech scratched at his blond moustache sucked air in through slightly bucked teeth your father sent it from the dig in utah along with several other artifacts this is probably anasazi twelfth century and was used as a cooking vessel he cleared his throat shooting miranda a quick glance and at her nod continued the beauty is its nearly intact with only this small chip on the lip why a cooking vessel ryan wanted to know and stanley blinked the shape size thickness thank you stanley miranda turned back to ryan nearly bumped into him as hed moved closer when her back was turned she shifted aside immediately but not before noting that he had a good two inches on her in height and that glint in his eyes of amused awareness took his face a step beyond sensual and straight into sexy she heard the damn ping again were primarily an institute for art but as my fathers interests are in archaeology we have a section for artifact display and do quite a bit of testing and dating in that area its not my field now this she walked over to a cabinet opened a drawer and flipped through until she found a small brown bag she transferred the tiny bits of paint inside onto a slide then loaded it onto an unoccupied microscope take a look she invited tell me what you see he bent over adjusted his focus color shape interesting in its way rather like a pollock painting he straightened and fixed those brandycolored eyes on hers what am i looking at dr jones a scraping from a bronzino were restoring the paint is unquestionably sixteenth century we take a sample for security both before we begin the work and after the work is completed in this way theres no doubt weve received an authentic work and no doubt we return the same work to its owners upon completion how do you know this is sixteenthcentury paint do you want a science lesson mr boldari ryan then i can say your name mirandas such a lovely name his voice was like warm cream over whiskey and made her itchy and i might actually enjoy that science lesson with the right teacher youll have to sign up for a class poor students do better with oneonones have dinner with me tonight im a mediocre teacher have dinner with me anyway we can discuss art and science and i can tell you about the vasaris he had an urge to lift his hand and play with the messy curls escaping their confinement shed jump like a rabbit he decided well call it business if it makes you more at ease im not ill at ease well then ill pick you up at seven you know he continued slipping his hand over hers again id love to see that bronzino i admire the formal purity in his work before she could calculate how to free her hand hed tucked it comfortably through his arm and headed for the door chapter six she didnt know why shed agreed to dinner although when she thought back over the conversation she hadnt actually agreed which didnt explain why she was getting dressed to go out he was an associate she reminded herself the boldari gallery had a glossy reputation for elegance and exclusivity the single time shed managed to carve out an hour when in new york to visit it shed been impressed with the understated grandeur of the building almost as much as the art itself it would hardly hurt the institute for her to help forge a relationship between one of the most glamorous galleries in the country and the jones organization he wanted to have dinner to discuss business shed make sure it stayed in the business arena even if that smile of his sent little sparks of undiluted lust straight to her gut if he wanted to flirt with her fine ping or no ping flirting didnt affect her she wasnt some impressionable mush brain after all men who looked like ryan boldari were born with fully developed flirtation skills she liked to think shed been born with an innate immunity to such shallow talents he had the most incredible eyes eyes that looked at you as if everything but you had simply melted away when she realized shed sighed and closed her own she muttered under her breath and yanked up the zipper in the back of her dress it was only a matter of pride and professional courtesy that she chose to be particular about her appearance this evening the first time she saw him shed resembled a scruffy student tonight he would see she was a mature sophisticated woman whod have no problem handling a man over a meal shed selected a black dress in thin soft wool scooped low at the bodice low enough so that the swell of her breasts rose firmly over the straight edge neckline the sleeves were long and snug the skirt narrow and fluid to the ankles she added an excellent and unquestionably sexy reproduction of a byzantine cross its ornate vertical stem rested cozily at the hollow of her breasts she yanked her hair up jamming in pins at random the result was if she said so herself carelessly sexy it was a good look she decided a confident look and a far cry from the too tall socially inept nerd shed been all through college no one who glanced at this woman would realize she had nerves in her stomach over a simple business dinner or that she worried shed run out of intelligent conversation before the appetizers were served they would see poise and style she thought they and he would see exactly what she wanted to be seen she grabbed her purse craned her neck to study her butt in the mirror and assure herself the dress didnt make it look too big then headed downstairs andrew was in the front parlor already into his second whiskey he lowered the glass when she walked in and raised his eyebrows high well wow andrew youre such a poet do i look fat in this theres never a correct answer to that question or if there is no man has ever found it therefore he raised his glass in toast i abstain coward and because her stomach was far too jittery she poured herself half a glass of white wine arent you a little slicked up for a business dinner she sipped let the wine cruise down to dampen some of the butterfly wings arent you the one who lectured me for twenty minutes this afternoon on how beneficial a relationship with the boldari gallery could be to us yeah but he narrowed his eyes though andrew didnt often see his sister as a woman he was seeing her now she looked he thought uncomfortably staggering did he hit on you get a grip on yourself did he no not exactly she amended and if he did or does im a grown woman who knows how to block the blow or hit back as the choice may be where are you going i didnt ask the roads are still pretty crappy its march in maine of course the roads are crappy dont go big brother on me andrew she patted his cheek when she said it more relaxed now because he wasnt that must be ryan she added when the doorbell rang behave for three vasaris ill behave he muttered but his brow creased as he watched miranda walk out sometimes he forgot how outrageous she could look if she took a little time on it the fact that shed obviously taken the time gave him an itch between the shoulder blades the itch might have become a burn if hed seen the way ryans eyes flashed the way the heat in them simmered when miranda opened the door and stood framed in it it was a solid punch to the gut ryan thought and one he should have been better prepared for you look like something titian would have painted he took her hand but this time stepped in and brushed his lips over her cheeks one then the other europeanstyle thank you she closed the door and resisted the urge to lean back against it to catch her balance there was something powerful and unnerving about the way her heeled boots made them of a height so that their eyes and mouths were lined up as they would be she thought in bed andrews in the parlor she told him would you like to come in for a moment yes i would you have a fabulous home he scanned the foyer flicked a glance at the staircase as he followed her toward the parlor dramatic and comfortable at the same time you should commission someone to paint it my grandfather did an oil of it its not very good but were fond of it can i get you a drink no nothing hello andrew he offered his hand im stealing your sister away for the evening unless youd like to join us ryan had played the odds all of his life but he cursed himself now as he saw andrew consider the invitation though he was unaware that miranda was making narroweyed threatening faces behind his back ryan was relieved when andrew shook his head i appreciate it but ive got some plans you two enjoy yourselves ill just get my coat andrew saw them off then dragged his own coat out of the closet his plans had changed he no longer felt like drinking alone he preferred getting drunk in company miranda pursed her lips as she slid into the back of the limo do you always travel this way no ryan slipped in beside her took a single white rose out of a bud vase and offered it but i had a yen for champagne i couldnt indulge if i was driving to prove it he lifted an already opened bottle of cristal from an ice bucket and poured her a flute business dinners rarely start with roses and champagne they should he poured his own glass tapped it to hers when they include women with arresting looks to the beginning of an entertaining relationship association she corrected and sipped ive been in your new york gallery really and what did you think of it intimate glamorous a small polished jewel with art as the facets im flattered our gallery in san francisco is airier more light and space we focus on contemporary and modern art there my brother michael has an eye and an affection for it i prefer the classic and the intimate his voice rippled softly over her skin a telling sign and miranda thought a dangerous one so boldari is a family enterprise yes like yours i doubt it she muttered then moved her shoulders make conversation she reminded herself she was a confident woman she could make conversation how did you become involved with art my parents are artists for the most part they teach but my mothers watercolors are glorious my father sculpts complicated metal structures no one but michael seems to understand but it feeds his soul he kept his eyes on hers as he spoke directly on hers with a quiet intensity that had insistent sexual jolts dancing over her skin and do you paint or sculpt she asked no i havent the hands for it or the soul it was a huge disappointment to my parents that none of their six children had a talent for creating art six miranda blinked as he topped off her glass six children my mothers irish my father italian he grinned quick and charming what else could they do i have two brothers three sisters and im the oldest of the lot you have the most fascinating hair he murmured twirling a loose lock around his finger he was right she jumped how do you keep your hands off it its red and unmanageable and if i wouldnt look like a sixfoot azalea id chop it off short it was the first thing i noticed about you his gaze slid down locked on hers again then it was your eyes youre made up of bold colors and shapes she struggled to repress the fascinating image of grabbing his lapels and simply yanking their bodies together until they were a tangle of limbs on the backseat and despite her fight for control she fidgeted like modern art he chuckled no too much classic practicality for that i like your looks he said when the limo pulled to the curb and stopped when the door opened he took her hand to help her out his mouth nearly grazed her ear lets see if we like each others company she couldnt say when she started to relax perhaps it was sometime during her third glass of champagne she had to admit he was smooth maybe just a tad too smooth but it worked it was a long time since shed sat across a candlelit table from a man and when the man had a face that belonged on a renaissance portrait it was impossible not to appreciate the moment and he listened he might claim to have been a poor student of science but he certainly asked questions and appeared interested in the answers perhaps he was simply putting her at ease by steering the conversation onto professional ground but she was grateful for the results she couldnt remember the last time shed spent an evening talking about her work and talking of it she remembered why she loved it its the discovery she told him the study of a piece of art and finding its history its individuality its personality i suppose dissecting it in a way yes it was so pleasant to sit like this in the cozy warmth of the restaurant with a fire blazing nearby and the cold dark sea just outside the window the paint itself then the brushstrokes the subject the purpose all the parts of it that can be studied and analyzed to give the answers and you dont feel in the end the answer is simply the art itself without the history and the analysis its just a painting when somethings beautiful its enough if i was to analyze your face id take your eyes the bold summer blue of them the intelligence in them the hint of sadness and the suspicion he added with a smile your mouth soft wide reluctant to smile your cheekbones sharp aristocratic your nose slim elegant separate the features study analyze id still come to the conclusion that youre a stunning woman and i can do that by just sitting back and appreciating the whole she toyed with her scrod struggling not to be overly flattered or charmed that was clever im a clever man and you dont trust me her gaze lifted to his again i dont know you what else can i tell you i come from a big loud ethnic family grew up in new york studied without a great deal of enthusiasm at columbia then because im not artistic shifted into the business of art ive never married which displeases my mother enough that i once considered it seriously and briefly she arched a brow and rejected it at that particular time with that particular woman we lacked a spark he leaned closer for the pleasure of her and because he enjoyed the cautious awareness that came into her eyes when he did do you believe in sparks miranda sparks she imagined were cousins to pings i believe they fuel initial attraction but sparks die out and arent enough for the long haul youre cynical he decided im a romantic you analyze and i appreciate thats an interesting combination dont you think she moved her shoulder discovering she wasnt quite so relaxed any longer he had her hand again just playing with her fingers on the table he had a habit of touching she wasnt used to and one that made her all too aware of sparks sparks she reminded herself made a pretty light but they could also burn being this quickly and outrageously attracted to him was dangerous and it was illogical it had everything to do with glands and nothing to do with intellect therefore she concluded it could and would be controlled i dont understand romantics they make decisions based on feelings rather than fact andrew was a romantic she thought and hurt for him then theyre surprised when those decisions turn out to be mistakes but we have so much more fun than cynics and he he realized was much more attracted to her than hed anticipated not just her looks he decided as their plates were cleared it was that leading edge of practicality of pragmatism one he found it hard to resist buffing away and yes the big sad eyes dessert he asked her no i couldnt it was a lovely meal coffee its too late for coffee he grinned absolutely charmed youre an orderly woman miranda i like that about you still watching her he signaled for the bill why dont we take a walk you can show me the waterfront jones points a safe city she began when they strolled in the icy wind that whipped off the water the limo followed them at a crawl a fact that both amused and staggered her however much wealth shed come from no jones would ever hire a limo to pace them as they walked its very walkable there are several parks theyre gorgeous in the spring and summer shade trees banks of flowers youve never been here before no your familys lived here for generations yes there have always been joneses in jones point is that why you live here his gloved fingers tangled with hers leather sliding over leather because its expected no its where i come from where i am it was difficult to explain even to herself how deep her roots were sunk in that rocky new england soil i enjoy traveling but this is where i want to be when its time to come home then tell me about jones point its quiet and settled the city itself grew from a fishing village into a community with emphasis on culture and tourism a number of residents still make their living from the sea what we call the waterfront is actually along commercial street lobstering is profitable the packing plant ships all over the world have you ever done it what gone lobstering no she smiled a little i can see the boats and buoys from the cliffs behind the house i like to watch them observe rather than participate he thought this area is old port she continued youll find a lot of galleries in this part of town you might be interested in visiting some of them before you leave i might the city shows best in the spring when you can make use of the parks and beaches there are some beautiful stretches of marsh and sand views of miracle bay and the islands but in dead winter it can be a postcard the pond freezes in atlantic park and people come to iceskate do you he slipped an arm around her shoulder to block her from the edge of the wind their bodies bumped skate yes her blood simmered her throat went dry its excellent exercise he laughed and just beyond the circle of light tossed out by a streetlamp turned her to him now his hands were on her shoulders and the wind at his back streamed through his hair so its for the exercise not for the fun i enjoy it its too late in the year for skating now he could feel her nerves the shimmer of them under his hands intrigued by them he drew her a little closer and how do you get your exercise this late in the year i walk a lot swim when i can her pulse was beginning to jump a sensation she knew she couldnt trust its too cold to stand then why dont we consider this an exercise in sharing body heat he hadnt intended to kiss her eventually yes of course but not this soon still he hadnt lied when he told her he was a romantic and the moment simply called for it he brushed his lips over hers testing his eyes open as hers were the wariness in hers caused his lips to curve as he tasted her a second time he was a man who believed in practicing until he was skilled in a matter he enjoyed he was very skilled in the matter of women and patiently warmed her lips with his until hers softened parted until her lashes fluttered down and she sighed quietly into his mouth maybe it was foolish but what could it hurt the little war of reason in her head faded to whispers as sensation layered over his mouth was firm and persuasive his body long and hard he tasted faintly of the wine theyd shared and was just as amusingly foreign and rich she found herself leaning into him her hands clutching at his coat at the waist and her mind went blank with pleasure suddenly his hands were cupping her face the cold smooth leather of his gloves a shock to her dreaming brain her eyes opened to find his narrowed on her face with an intensity burning in them the easy kiss didnt warrant lets try that again this time his mouth was rough and hot plundering hers until her head roared with sounds like the sea below the cliffs of her home there was demand here and the arrogant certainty it would be answered even as her mind lurched back bent on refusing her mouth answered he knew what it was to want hed wanted a great deal in his life and had made it his business to see his desires were met wanting her was acceptable even expected but wanting her now this forcibly was dangerous even a man who gambled by choice knew to avoid unwinnable risks still he lingered long enough to be certain he would spend a very uncomfortable night alone he couldnt afford to seduce her to take her back to his bed there was work to be done and the timing was already set most of all he couldnt afford to care for her growing attached to a pawn was a certain way to lose the game he never lost he held her away skimming his gaze over her face her cheeks were flushed from the cold and the heat her eyes were clouded still with a passion he imagined had surprised her as much as him she shivered as he stroked his hands down to her shoulders again and she said nothing i should take you home however much he cursed himself his smile was smooth and easy yes she wanted to sit to steady herself to think again its getting late another minute he murmured it would have been too late taking her hand he led her to the waiting limo do you get to new york often now and again the heat seemed to be centered in a ball in her gut the rest of her was cold viciously cold youll let me know when your plans take you there and ill adjust mine all right she heard herself say and didnt feel foolish at all she sang in the shower it was something she never did she didnt have to be told she had a dreadful voice when she could hear it for herself but this morning she belted out making whoopee she had no idea why that tune was lodged in her head had no idea she even knew the lyrics but she gurgled them as water sluiced over her head she was still humming when she dried off bending from the waist she wrapped a towel around her mass of hair swinging her hips as she did so she was no better at dancing though she knew all the proper steps the members of the art council who had guided her through her rigid waltzes would have been shocked to see the cool dr jones bumping and grinding around her efficient bathroom she giggled at the thought of it a sound so unprecedented she had to stop and catch her breath she realized with a kind of jolt that she was happy really happy that too was a rare thing content she often was involved satisfied or challenged but she knew simple happiness often eluded her it was marvelous to feel it now and why shouldnt she she slipped into a practical terry robe and smoothed her arms and legs with quietly scented body cream she was interested in a very appealing man and he was interested in her he enjoyed her company appreciated her work found her attractive on both a physical and an intellectual plane he wasnt intimidated as so many were by her position or her personality he was charming successful to say nothing of gorgeous and hed been civilized enough not to press an obvious advantage and attempt to lure her into bed would she have gone miranda wondered as she briskly dried off the foggy mirror normally the answer would have been a firm no she didnt indulge in reckless affairs with men she barely knew she didnt indulge in affairs period for that matter it had been over two years since shed had a lover and that had ended so miserably shed resolved to avoid even casual relationships but last night yes she thought she could have been persuaded against her better judgment she could have been swayed but he had respected her enough not to ask she continued to hum as she dressed for the day choosing a wool suit with a short skirt and long jacket in a flattering shade of steel blue she took care with her makeup then let her hair tumble as it chose in a last act of female defiance against the elements she slipped into impractical heels she left for work in the chilly dark and was still singing andrew awoke with the mother of all hangovers not being able to stand his own whimpering he tried to smother himself with pillows survival was stronger than misery and he burst up gasping for air and grabbing his head to keep it from falling off his shoulders then he let go praying it would he inched out of bed as a scientist he knew it wasnt possible for his bones to actually shatter but he was afraid they might defy the laws of physics and do just that it was annies fault he decided shed gotten just annoyed enough with him the night before to let him drink himself blind hed counted on her to cut him off as she usually did but no she kept slapping those drinks in front of him every time he called for one he dimly remembered her shoving him into a cab and saying something pithy about hoping he was sick as three dogs shed gotten her wish he thought as he stumbled downstairs if he felt any worse hed be dead when he saw there was already coffee brewed and waiting he nearly wept with love and gratitude for his sister with hands that fumbled and trembled he shook out four extrastrength excedrin and washed them down with coffee that scalded his mouth never again he promised himself pressing his fingers to his throbbing bloodshot eyes he would never drink to excess again even as he vowed the slick longing for just one glass shuddered through him just one glass to steady his hands to settle his stomach he refused it telling himself there was a difference between overindulging and alcoholism if he took a drink at seven am hed be an alcoholic at seven pm now it was fine he could wait he would wait twelve hours the ringing of the doorbell split through his skull like a keenedged blade he very nearly screamed instead of answering he sat at the long trestle table there in the kitchen laid his head down and prayed for oblivion hed nearly dozed off when the back door opened letting in a frigid blast of air and an angry woman i thought youd be curled up somewhere feeling sorry for yourself annie set a grocery bag on the counter slapped her hands on her hips and scowled at him look at you andrew a pitiful mess half naked unshaven bloodshot and smelly go take a shower he lifted his head to blink at her i dont wanna go take a shower while i fix your breakfast when he tried to lower his head again she simply took a handful of his hair and dragged it up again youre getting just what you deserve jesus annie youre going to yank my head off and youd feel considerably better if i could you get your skinny butt out of that chair and go clean up and use some industrialstrength mouthwash you need it christ almighty what the hell are you doing here he hadnt thought there was room for embarrassment in the rage of the hangover but hed been wrong he could feel the flush a curse of his coloring work up his bare chest toward his face go away i sold you the liquor she let his hair go and his head fell back onto the table with a thunk that made him howl you made me mad so i let you keep drinking so im going to fix you a decent breakfast see that you get yourself cleaned up and go to work now go take a shower or ill take you up and toss you in the tub myself okay okay anything was better than having her nag at him with what dignity he could muster in his boxer shorts he rose i dont want anything to eat youll eat what i fix you she turned to the counter and began unloading the bag now get out of here you smell like the floor of a secondclass bar she waited until she heard him shuffle away then closed her eyes and leaned on the counter oh hed looked so pathetic so sad and sick and silly shed wanted to cuddle him to soothe to stroke all those poisons out of him poisons she thought guiltily shed sold him because she was angry it wasnt the liquor not really she thought it was his heart and she just didnt know how to reach it she wondered if she could if she only cared about him a little less she heard the pipes clunk as he ran the shower and it made her smile he was so much like this house she thought a little threadbare a little damaged but surprisingly sturdy under it all he just couldnt see that elise for all her brains and beauty hadnt been right for him theyd made a stunning couple bright and brilliant but that was all surface she hadnt understood his foundation his need for sweetness and the ache in his heart that came from not believing himself worthy of love he needed tending that she could do annie decided pushing up her sleeves if nothing else she could bully him into finding his feet again friends she told herself stood by friends the kitchen was full of homey scents when he came back if it had been anyone but annie he might have locked himself in his room the shower had helped and the pills had shoved the worst of the hangover away the edges of it were still churning in his stomach and rolling in his head but he thought he could manage now he cleared his throat worked up a smile smells great sit down she told him without turning okay im sorry annie no need to apologize to me you should apologize to yourself thats whos being hurt here im sorry anyway he looked down at the bowl she put in front of him oatmeal itll stick to you coat your stomach mrs patch used to make me eat oatmeal he said thinking of the sharp stick of a woman whod cooked for them when he was a boy every day before school fall winter and spring mrs patch knew what was good for you she used to put a little maple syrup in it feeling her lips twitch annie reached into a cupboard she knew his kitchen as well as her own she set the bottle of syrup in front of him and added a plate of hot toasted bread eat yes maam he took the first bite cautiously uncertain anything would stay down its good thanks when she saw he was making headway and his color was no longer sickly gray she sat across from him friends stood by friends she thought again and they were honest with each other andrew youve got to stop doing this to yourself i know i shouldnt have had so much to drink she reached out touched his hand if you take one drink youre going to take the next and the next annoyed he jerked his shoulders nothing wrong with a drink now and then nothing wrong with getting drunk now and then there is when youre an alcoholic im not she sat back i run a bar and i was married to a drunk i know the signs theres a difference between someone who has a couple too many and someone who cant stop i can stop he picked up the coffee shed poured him im not drinking now am i i dont drink at work and i dont let it affect my work i dont get drunk every night but you drink every night so does half the goddamn world whats the difference between a couple glasses of wine with dinner and a shot or two in the evening youll have to figure that out for yourself the way i did we were both half drunk the night we it hurt to say it she thought shed been ready but it hurt and she couldnt say it after all christ annie remembering had him raking a hand through his hair wishing the ball of shame and guilt hadnt just dropped into his gut we were just kids we were old enough to make a baby between us temporarily she pressed her lips together no matter what it cost she would get at least part of it out we were stupid and we were innocent and we were irresponsible ive accepted that oh god she tried to accept that but it taught me what you can lose what it can do if you dont stay in control youre not in control andrew one night fifteen years ago doesnt have anything to do with now the minute the words were out the minute he saw the way her body jerked back he regretted it i didnt mean it like that annie not that it didnt matter i just dont her voice was cool now and distant just dont were better off when we pretend it never happened i only brought it up because you cant seem to see the difference you were only seventeen but you already had a drinking problem i didnt i dont youve managed to get through most of your life without letting it take over now youve crossed the line its starting to rule you andrew and you have to take back the controls im telling you this as a friend she rose cupped his face in her hands dont come in my place anymore i wont serve you come on annie you can come for conversation but dont come for a drink because i wont give it to you she turned picked up her coat and hurried out chapter seven ryan wandered the south gallery admiring the use of light the flow of space the joneses knew their business he mused the displays were elegantly arranged the educational plaques discreet and informative he listened with half an ear as a bluehaired woman with a sharp down east accent led a small tour to one of raphaels magnificent madonnas another tour a bit larger and quite a bit noisier was composed of schoolchildren and led by a perky brunette they were heading off to the impressionists much to ryans relief not that he didnt like children the fact was his nieces and nephews were a great source of delight and amusement for him he took pleasure in spoiling them outrageously as often as possible but children tended to be a distraction during work hours ryan was very much at work the guards were unobtrusive but there were plenty of them he noted their stations and judged by one uniforms surreptitious glance at his watch that they were nearing change of shift he appeared to wander aimlessly stopping here and there to study a painting a sculpture or a display of artifacts in his mind he counted off paces from the doorway to the camera in the southwest corner from the camera to the archway from the archway to the next camera and from there to his goal he lingered no longer in front of the display case than any art lover might when studying the rare beauty of a fifteenthcentury bronze the bronze david was a small jewel young cocky slender his sling whipped back at that historic moment of truth though the artist was unknown the style was leonardos and as the plaque indicated it was assumed to be the work of one of his students ryans client was a particular fan of leonardos and had commissioned for this particular piece after seeing it in the institute six months before ryan thought his client would be very happy and sooner rather than later hed decided to move up his own schedule it was he thought wiser to move along and away before he made a mistake with miranda he was already feeling a little sorry that he would cause her some inconvenience and annoyance but after all she was insured and the bronze was hardly the best piece the institute possessed if he was choosing for himself hed have taken the cellini or perhaps the titian woman who reminded him of miranda but the pocketsized bronze was his clients choice and it would be an easier job than either the cellini or the titian due to his own unplanned reaction to miranda hed spent a productive hour or two after taking her home and changing out of his dinner suit in the tubesized crawl space beneath the institute there as hed already known was the wiring for the buildings security system alarms cameras sensors all hed needed was his laptop and a little time to reset the main to his personal specifications he hadnt diddled with much most of the work would be done in a few hours but a few judicious changes would make his job easier in the long run he completed his measurements then following his schedule executed the first test he smiled at the bluehaired lady edging just past her group with his hands in his pockets he studied a shadowy painting of the annunciation once he had the small mechanism in hand he ran his thumb over the controls until he felt the proper button the camera was directly to his right he smiled at the virgin when he saw out of the corner of his eye the tiny red light on the camera blink out god he loved technology in his other pocket he depressed the stem of a stopwatch and waited he judged nearly two minutes passed before the nearest guards walkietalkie beeped ryan clicked the stopwatch again unjammed the camera with his other hand and strolled over to study the sad and baffled face of saint sebastian more than satisfied ryan walked out of the gallery and stepped outside to use his cell phone dr joness office may i help you i hope you can the wifty little voice of mirandas assistant made him grin is dr jones available ryan boldari calling one moment mr boldari ryan stepped back out of the wind while he waited he liked the look of downtown he decided the variety of architecture the granite and the brick hed passed a dignified statue of longfellow in his wanderings and found that it and the other statues and monuments added to an interesting city perhaps he preferred new york the pace and the demand there but he didnt think hed mind spending a bit more time right here some other time of course it was never wise to linger long after a job was completed ryan her voice sounded slightly breathless sorry i kept you waiting i dont mind ive just taken a busmans holiday and wandered through your galleries best that she know as it was likely theyd be reviewing tapes the following day oh i wish youd told me you were coming id have taken you around myself i didnt want to keep you from your work but i wanted to tell you i believe my vasaris are going to have a wonderful temporary home you should come to new york and see where your cellini will be staying he hadnt meant to say that damn it he shifted the phone to his other hand reminding himself some distance would be required for a time i might do that would you like to come up i can have you cleared i would but i have some appointments i couldnt reschedule id hoped to take you to lunch but i cant blow these meetings off im going to be tied up the rest of the day but wondered if youd have lunch with me tomorrow im sure i can schedule it in what time works for you the sooner the better i want to see you miranda he could imagine her sitting in her office perhaps wearing a lab coat over some bulky sweater oh yes he wanted to see her a great deal of her how about noon he heard papers rustle checking her calendar he thought and for some reason found that delightful yes noons fine um the documentation on your vasaris just came across my desk you work quickly beautiful women shouldnt have to wait ill see you tomorrow ill think of you tonight he broke the connection and suffered a very rare sensation he recognized it as guilt only because he couldnt actually recall experiencing it before certainly not when it came to women or work cant be helped he said softly and replaced his cell phone as he strode toward the parking lot he took out his stopwatch one hundred and ten seconds time enough more than time enough he glanced up toward the window where he knew mirandas office to be thered be time for that too eventually but professional obligations came first he was sure a woman of her practical nature would agree ryan spent the next several hours locked in his suite hed ordered up a quick lunch turned the stereo on to a classical station and spread out his notes for review he had the blueprints for the institute anchored on the conference table with the salt and pepper shakers and the tiny bottles of mustard and ketchup that had come on his room service tray the schematics of the security system were on the screen of his laptop he nibbled on a french fry sipped evian and studied the blueprints had been easy enough to access contacts and cash could access nearly everything he was also very handy with a computer it was a skill hed developed and honed while still in high school his mother had insisted he learn how to type because you just never knew but hed had more interesting things to do with a keyboard than hammer out correspondence hed built the laptop he carried with him himself and had added a number of bonuses that werent strictly legal then again neither was his profession the boldari galleries were completely aboveboard and were now selffinanced and earned a nice comfortable profit but they had been built on funds hed accumulated over the years beginning as a nimblefingered fastthinking boy on the streets of new york some people were born artists others were born accountants ryan had been born a thief initially hed picked pockets and lifted trinkets because money was tight after all art teachers werent raking in dough and there were a lot of mouths to feed in the boldari household later he shifted into secondstory work because well he was good at it and it was exciting he could still remember his first foray into a dark sleeping home the quiet the tension the thrill of being somewhere he had no business being the initial edginess that swam up with the possibility of being caught had added to the kick of it all like having sex in some odd public place in broad daylight with another mans wife since he had a strict code against adultery he limited that wired sensation to stealing nearly twenty years later he would feel that same thrill each time he lifted a lock and slipped into a secured building he fined his craft down and for more than a decade had specialized in art he had a feel for art a love of it and in his heart considered it public domain if he slipped a painting out of the smithsonian and he had he was simply providing a service to an individual for which he was well paid and with his fee he acquired more art to put on display at his galleries for public view and enjoyment it seemed to balance things out nicely since he had a flair for electronics and gadgets why shouldnt he put them to use along with his godgiven gift for larceny turning to his laptop he logged in the measurements hed taken in the south gallery and brought up the threedimensional floor plan onscreen camera positions were highlighted in red with a few keystrokes he requested the machine to calculate the angles the distance and best approach he was he thought a long way from his cat burglar days when he would case a home climb through a window and creep around stuffing glitters in a bag that aspect of the profession was for the young the reckless or the foolish and in these unsettled times too many people had guns in their homes and shot at anything that moved in the night he preferred avoiding triggerhappy homeowners better to put the age of technology to use do the job quick clean and tidy and move on as a matter of habit he checked the batteries in his pocket jammer it was of his own design and fashioned of parts cannibalized from a tv remote control a cell phone and a pager once he studied the security system of a mark which andrew had been kind enough to show him he could easily adjust the range and frequency to apply after hed juryrigged the system at its source his test late that morning had proven hed been successful in that area gaining entrance had been more problematic if he worked with a partner one could work the computer in the crawl space to bypass locks he worked alone and needed the jammer for the cameras locks were a relatively simple matter hed accessed the schematics of the security system weeks ago and had finally cracked it after spending two nights on the scene hed earmarked the side door and had forged a key card the security code itself had again come courtesy of andrew it was amazing to ryan what information people carried around in their wallets the numbers and sequence had been written neatly on a folded piece of paper tucked behind andrews drivers license it had taken ryan seconds to lift the wallet moments to flip through find the numbers and memorize them and nothing more than a friendly pat on the back to slide the wallet back into andrews pocket ryan figured the job had taken him approximately seventytwo hours of work to prep adding the hour it would take to execute and deducting his outlay and expenses he would see a profit of eightyfive thousand nice work if you can get it he thought and tried not to regret that this was his last adventure hed given his word on that and he never went back on a promise not to family he checked the time noted he had eight hours before curtain he spent the first of them dealing with any evidence burning the blueprints in the cheerful fireplace his suite provided locking all of his electronics in a reinforced case then adding additional paths and passwords to his computer work to tuck it away safely that left him time for a workout a steam a swim and a short nap he believed in being alert in mind and body before breaking and entering just past six miranda sat alone in her office to compose a letter she preferred typing herself though she and andrew essentially ran the institute it was still standard procedure for both of their parents to be informed of and to approve any loan or transfer of art she intended to make the letter crisp and businesslike and was willing to work on it word by word until it was as stringent as vinegar just as unfriendly but viciously professional she thought the vinegar would go very well with the crow her mother would soon be sampling shed completed the first draft and was beginning the refinements when the phone rang new england institute dr jones miranda thank god i caught you excuse me annoyed at the clicking she shifted the phone and tugged off her earring whos calling its giovanni giovanni she scanned her desk clock calculated time its after midnight there is something wrong everythings wrong its a disaster i didnt dare call you earlier but i felt you had to know as soon as possible before before morning her heart jerked once brutally hard and the earring shed removed fell to bounce musically on her desk my mother has something happened to my mother yes no shes well shes not hurt im sorry im upset its all right to calm herself she closed her eyes took deep quiet breaths just tell me whats happened the bronze the fiesole bronze its a fake thats ridiculous she sat straight up her voice snapping out of course its not a fake who says so the results came back earlier today from the tests taken in rome arcanajasper laboratories dr ponti oversaw the testing you know his work yes of course you have bad information giovanni i tell you i saw the results myself dr standfordjones called me in along with richard and elise as we were on the original team she even raked vincente shes furious miranda and humiliated and not a little sick the bronze is fake it was probably cast no more than months ago if that the formula was right for the metal even the patina was perfect and could have been mistaken i didnt mistake anything she insisted but could feel crab claws of panic crawling up her spine the corrosion levels were wrong all wrong i dont know how we missed it miranda but they were wrong some attempt had been made to create them in the metal but it wasnt successful you saw the results the computer photos the x rays i know it i told your mother this but but what giovanni she asked me who took the x rays who programmed the computer who ran the radiation tests cara im sorry i understand she was numb now her mind clouding its my responsibility i took the tests i wrote the reports if it hadnt been for the leak to the press we could have swept this under the rug at least part of it ponti could be wrong she rubbed her hand over her mouth he could be wrong i didnt miss something as basic as corrosion levels i need to think about this giovanni i appreciate you telling me i hate to ask miranda but i must if i hope to keep my position your mother cant know i spoke with you about this spoke with you at all i believe she intends to contact you in the morning herself dont worry i wont mention your name i cant talk now i need to think all right im sorry so sorry slowly deliberately she replaced the receiver and sat still as a stone staring at nothing she struggled to bring all the data back into her mind to make order of it to see it again as clearly as she had in florence but there was nothing but a buzzing that made her give in and drop her head between her knees a fake it couldnt be it wasnt possible her breath came short making it impossible to fill her lungs then her fingertips began to tingle as the numbness passed and the shaking began shed been careful she assured herself shed been thorough shed been accurate her heart thudded so painfully she pressed the heel of her hand against her sternum oh god she hadnt been careful enough thorough enough accurate enough had her mother been right despite all her claims to the contrary had she made up her mind about the bronze the moment shed seen it wanted it she admitted and lifted her head to lean back in the chair in the slow deliberate movement of the aged or ill shed wanted it to be real wanted to know that shed held something that important that precious and rare in her hands arrogance elizabeth had called it her arrogance and her ambition had she let that cockiness that wanting that thirst for approval cloud her judgment and affect her work no no no she fisted her hands pressed them against her eyes shed seen the pictures the radiation results the chemical tests studied them they were fact and fact didnt lie every test had proven her belief there had to be a mistake but she hadnt made it because if she had she thought and lowered her fists to the desk it was worse than failure no one would trust her again she wouldnt even trust herself she closed her eyes laid her head back that was how andrew found her twenty minutes later i saw your light i was working late myself and he trailed off pausing at the doorway she was pale as water and when she opened her eyes they were too dark too bright and too blank hey are you sick though illness made him nervous he crossed the room to lay a palm to her brow youre cold instinctively he took her hands between his and began to rub youve got a chill or something ill take you home you should lie down andrew she was going to have to say it say it out loud and her throat was raw on the words the dark lady its fake what hed begun to pat her head now his hand froze there the bronze in florence the retesting the results are in the corrosion growth is wrong the radiation figures are wrong ponti in rome he supervised the tests himself he sat on the edge of the desk knowing brotherly head pats were not going to soothe this sickness away how do you know giovanni he just called he wasnt supposed to if mother finds out she could fire him for it okay giovanni wasnt his concern at the moment are you sure his informations accurate i dont want to think so she crossed her arms over her chest digging her fingers into her biceps squeezing releasing squeezing releasing he wouldnt have contacted me otherwise mother called him and elise and richard hawthorne in to tell them vincente too i imagine she blasted them theyre going to say i screwed up her voice broke causing her to shake her head fiercely as if to deny the emotion just as she predicted did you she opened her mouth to deny that too just as fiercely but closed it again pressing her lips together control she ordered herself at the very least she needed control i dont see how i ran the tests i followed procedure i documented the results but i wanted it andrew maybe i wanted it too much ive never known you to let what you want get in the way of what is he couldnt stand to see her look so stricken of the two of them shed always been the stronger both of them had counted on it could there have been some technical glitch faulty equipment she nearly laughed were talking about elizabeths pride and joy here andrew machines break down or the people inputting data into those machines make mistakes pontis team could have made one she pushed away from the desk now and though her legs trembled began to pace its no more farfetched than my making one i need to see my data again and the results i need to see his i need to see the dark lady youll need to talk to her i know she stopped turned to the window but saw only the dark id call her now if it wouldnt damage giovannis confidence id rather get it over with than wait until she contacts me you were always one to take your medicine in one gulp im a big believer in putting off forever what you dont want to face today theres no avoiding it when the results are made public its going to ripple down ill be either a fool or a fraud and ones as bad as the other vincente will find some spin to put on it but it wont stop the press she was right about that itll affect standjo her me she turned back to face him its going to affect the institute we can handle it this is my mess andrew not yours he walked over put his hands on her shoulder no he said it simply and had tears burning the backs of her eyes well stand together just like always she let out a breath leaned into him and let herself be comforted but she thought their mother might give her no choice if it came down to the institute or her daughter there was no doubt in mirandas mind which would take precedence chapter eight the midnight wind was bitter as a scorned woman and just as badtempered ryan didnt mind it he found it invigorating as he walked the three crosstown blocks from where hed parked his car everything he needed was under his coat in pouches and pockets or in the small briefcase he carried if the cops stopped him for some reason and took a look hed be in a cage before he could exercise his civil right for a phone call but that was just part of the thrill god he would miss it he thought and strode along with the eager step of a man hurrying to meet a lover the planning stage was over and so was that aspect of his life now the execution was approaching his last he wanted to file every detail in his mind so that when he was a very old man with grandchildren at his feet he could bring back this young and vital feeling of power he scanned the streets the trees were bare and shivering in the wind the traffic was spotty the moon faded to a hint of shape by the city lights and the drifting clouds he passed a bar where a blue neon martini glass winked in the window and smiled he might just slip in for a drink after work a small toast to the end of an era seemed appropriate he crossed the street at the light a lawabiding citizen who wouldnt dream of jaywalking at least not when he was in possession of burglary tools he saw the institute up ahead a majestic silhouette of good yankee granite it pleased him that his last job would be to break into such a proud and dignified old building the windows were dark but for the glow of security lights in the lobby he thought it was odd and really rather sweet that people left on lights to keep thieves at bay a good one could steal in broad daylight as easily as under the cover of dark and he was very good his gaze swept up and down the street before he checked his watch his stakeouts had given him the pattern of police cruisers in the area unless there was a call for one he had a good fifteen minutes before a blackandwhite would pass this way he crossed to the south side of the building keeping his gait brisk but unhurried his long coat gave him the illusion of bulk the snappy fedora shadowed his face and the hair beneath it was now a dignified and rather dapper steel gray anyone taking notice of him would see a middleaged businessman slightly overweight he was still two yards from the door and out of range of the camera when he took his jammer out of his pocket and aimed it he saw the red light blink off and moved quickly his forged key card took some finesse but the slot accepted and read it on the third try recalling the code from memory he logged it in and was inside the anteroom within fortyfive seconds he reset the camera there was no use having some gungho guard come out to check then closed the door relocked it he took off his coat and hung it neatly beside the staffs softdrink and snack machines his black doeskin gloves went into the pocket beneath them he wore thin surgical gloves any honest man could buy by the box from a medical supply store he covered his silver hair with a black cap efficiently he checked his tools one last time it was only then that he let himself pause just for a moment and enjoy he stood in the dark listening to the silence that wasnt really silence at all buildings had their language and this one hummed and creaked he could hear the whirl of the heat through the vents the sighs of the wind pressing at the door behind him the guard and security rooms were a level above and the floors were thick he heard nothing from them and they he knew heard nothing from him with his eyes adjusted to the dark he moved to the next door it had a good police lock that required his picks his penlight which he clamped between his teeth and approximately thirty seconds of his time to deal with he smiled at the music of tumblers clicking then slipped through and into the hallway the first camera was at the end of the corridor where it split left and right it didnt overly concern him he was a shadow among shadows here and the camera was aimed toward the gallery he slid along the wall beneath it out of range and took the left fork aladdins cave he thought when he crouched just outside the south gallery the tower of london blackbeards treasure wonderland such a place was all the fairy tales hed read and been read as a child glorious anticipation shimmered along his skin tightened his muscles churned like desire in his gut his for the taking it made him think how easily a professional could succumb to greed and disaster once more he checked his watch the yankee sensibility in such a place would mean guards still did rounds though the cameras and sensors should have sufficed of course he was proof they didnt and if he was in charge of security hed have employed twice as many guards and doubled their rounds but that wasnt his job he didnt use his light now and didnt need it even the pinhole glow would set off the sensors using his measurements and excellent night vision he moved to the corner of the gallery aimed his jammer and shut down the bothersome camera in one part of his brain he counted off seconds the rest of him moved fast by the time he crouched in front of the display his glass cutter was in hand he made a neat circle slightly larger than his fist suctioned it off with barely a tickle of sound and set it neatly on the top of the cabinet he worked quickly but with a smooth economy of motion that was as innate as the color of his eyes he wasted no time in admiring his take or considering the delight of taking more than what hed come for that was for amateurs he simply reached in picked up the bronze and tucked it into the pouch on his belt because he appreciated order and irony he fitted the circle of glass back into place then catfooted it back to the corner he turned the camera on again and started back the way he came by his count it had taken him seventyfive seconds when he reached the anteroom he transferred the bronze to the briefcase snuggling it between two thick slabs of foam he switched hats stripped off the surgical gloves and rolled them neatly into his pocket he bundled into his coat keyed himself out locked up tidily behind him and was a block away in less than ten minutes from the time hed entered the building smooth slick and neat he thought a good way to end a career he eyed the bar again nearly went inside at the last minute he decided hed go back to the hotel and order up a bottle of champagne instead some toasts were private matters at six am after a sleepless night miranda was shocked out of her first real doze by the ringing of the phone headachy disoriented she fumbled for the receiver dr jones pronto no not italy maine home hello dr jones this is ken scutter security mr scutter she got no image from the name and was too bleary to try for one what is it weve had an incident an incident as her mind began to clear she pushed herself up in bed the sheets and blankets were tangled around her like wrappings on a mummy and she cursed under her breath as she fought her way free what sort of incident it wasnt noticed until the change of shifts moments ago but i wanted to contact you immediately weve had a breakin a breakin she bolted up fully awake the blood rushing into her head in a flood at the institute yes maam i thought youd want to come right over was there damage was something stolen no real damage dr jones one item is missing from the south gallery display cataloguing indicates its a fifteenthcentury bronze artist unknown of david a bronze she thought she was suddenly plagued by bronzes im on my way she bolted out of bed and without bothering with her robe raced in her blue flannel pajamas to andrews room she burst in shot toward the mound in the bed and shook viciously andrew wake up theres been a breakin huh what he shoved at her hand ran a tongue around his teeth started to yawn his jaw cracked as he shot up in bed what where when at the institute theres a bronze missing from the south gallery get dressed lets move a bronze he rubbed a hand over his face miranda were you dreaming scutter from security just phoned she snapped out i dont dream ten minutes andrew she said over her shoulder as she hurried out within forty she was standing beside her brother in the south gallery staring down at the perfect circle in the glass and the empty space behind it mirandas stomach rolled once then dropped to her knees call the police mr scutter yes maam he signaled to one of his men i ordered a sweep of the building its still under way but so far weve found nothing out of place and nothing else missing andrew nodded ill want to review the security tapes for the last twentyfour hours yes sir scutter heaved a sigh dr jones the night chief reported a small problem with two of the cameras problem miranda turned she remembered scutter now he was a short barrelshaped man a former cop whod decided to trade the streets for private security his record was spotless andrew had interviewed and hired him personally this camera scutter shifted gestured up it blanked for about ninety seconds yesterday morning no one thought much of it though the standard diagnostic was run last night at about midnight the exterior camera on the south entrance failed for just under a minute there were high winds and the glitch was attributed to weather this interior camera also went off for about eighty seconds between midnight and one the exact times will be stamped on the tapes i see andrew stuck his hands in his pockets and balled them into fists opinion mr scutter my take would be the burglars a pro with a knowledge of security and electronics he got in through the south side bypassed the alarm and the camera he knew what he was after didnt piss around excuse me dr jones he muttered with an apologetic nod toward miranda it tells me he knows the museum the setup and he waltzes in miranda said with barely suppressed fury takes what he wants then waltzes out despite a complex and expensive security system and half a dozen armed guards yes maam scutters lips thinned as he pressed them together that pretty much sums it up thank you will you go out in the lobby and wait for the police please she waited until his footsteps receded then because she was alone with andrew she allowed the steam to show son of a bitch son of a bitch andrew she stalked in a straight line to the camera in question scowled at it then stalked back that man wants us to believe that someone can override the security slide in here and steal one specific piece of art in less than ten minutes thats the most likely theory unless you think the guards have a conspiracy going and the lot of them suddenly developed an obsession for small naked italian boys cast in bronze he was sick inside hed loved that piece the vitality and the pure arrogance of it it could have been a hell of a lot worse miranda our security failed our property was taken how could it be worse from the looks of it this guy could have loaded up a santa sack and cleaned out half this area one piece or a dozen weve still been violated god she covered her face with her hands nothings been taken from the institute since the six paintings in the fifties and four of them were recovered then maybe we were due he said wearily bullshit she spun on her heel we protected our property sparing no expense with security no motion detectors he murmured you wanted them the system i wanted would have meant taking up the floor he looked down at the thick and lovely marble the brass wouldnt go for it by brass he meant their parents his father had been appalled at the idea of destroying the floor and nearly as appalled by the estimated cost of the proposed system probably wouldnt have mattered he said with a shrug just as likely hed have found a way to get past that too damn it miranda securitys my responsibility this is not your fault he sighed and desperately viciously wanted a drink its always somebodys fault ill have to tell them i dont even know how to contact the old man in utah shell know but lets not move too fast let me think a minute she closed her eyes and stood still as you said it could have been much worse we only lost one piece and we may very well recover it meanwhile its insured and the police are on their way everythings being done we have to let the police do their job i have to do mine miranda i have to call florence he worked up a weak smile look at it this way our little incident might push your problem with her to the back burner for a while she snorted if i thought that would happen i might have stolen the damn thing myself dr jones a man stepped into the room his cheeks red with cold his eyes of pale green narrowly focused under heavy graying brows and dr jones detective cook he held up a gold shield word is youve lost something by nine mirandas head was pounding violently enough for her to give in and lay it down on her desk she had her door closed had barely resisted the urge to lock it and was allowing herself ten minutes to indulge in despair and selfpity shed only managed five when her intercom buzzed miranda im sorry there was both concern and hesitation in loris voice dr standfordjones in on line one do you want me to tell her youre unavailable oh it was tempting but she drew a deep breath straightened her spine no ill take it thank you lori because her voice sounded rusty she cleared it then punched line one hello mother the testing on the fiesole bronze has been completed elizabeth said without preamble i see your findings were inaccurate i dont believe they were whatever you insist on believing they have been disproved the bronze is nothing more than a clever and wellexecuted attempt to mimic renaissance style and materials the authorities are investigating carlo rinaldi the man who claimed to have found the piece i want to see the results of the second test that is not an option you can arrange it im entitled to youre entitled to nothing miranda lets understand each other my priority at this point is to prevent this damage from spreading weve already had two government projects canceled your reputation and as a result my own is under attack there are some who believe you purposely doctored tests and results in order to take credit for a find with slow care miranda wiped away the ring of moisture that a teacup had left on her desk is that what you believe the hesitation spoke more clearly than the words that followed it i believe you allowed ambition haste and enthusiasm to cloud judgment logic and efficiency i take the responsibility as i involved you im responsible for myself thank you for your support sarcasm is unbecoming im sure the media will attempt to contact you over the next few days youll be unavailable for comment i have plenty of comments which youll keep to yourself it would be best if you took a leave of absence would it her hand was starting to tremble so she balled it into a fist thats a passive admission of guilt and i wont do it i want to see those results if i made a mistake at least i need to know where and how its out of my hands fine ill find a way around you she glanced over in irritation as her fax rang and whined ill contact pond myself ive already spoken to him he has no interest in you the matter is closed transfer me to andrews office oh ill be delighted to he has some news for you furious she jabbed the hold button and buzzed lori transfer this call to andrew she ordered then shoved away from her desk she took a deep breath first she would give andrew a few moments then go in to him she would be calm when she did calm and supportive to manage that she had to push her own problem aside for a while and concentrate on the breakin to distract herself she walked over and snagged the page from the fax tray and her blood iced over you were so sure werent you it appears you were wrong how will you explain it whats left for you now miranda now that your reputation is in tatters nothing thats all you were a reputation a name a chestful of degrees now youre just pitiful now you have nothing now i have everything how does it feel miranda to be exposed as a fraud to be found incompetent to be a failure she clutched one hand between her breasts as she read it through her ragged rapid breathing made her head go light so that she staggered back leaned heavily on the desk to steady herself who are you anger leaked through balancing her again who the hell are you it doesnt matter she told herself she wouldnt let these mean petty messages affect her they meant nothing but she slipped the fax into the drawer with the other and locked it shed find out eventually there was always a way to find out putting her hands to her cheeks she pressed to bring the blood back into her face and when she found out she promised herself she would deal with it now wasnt the time to concern herself with nasty little taunts she drew in air exhaled rubbed her hands together until they were warm again andrew needed her the institute needed her her eyes squeezed tightly shut as the pressure in her chest built into pain she wasnt just a name a collection of degrees she was more than that she intended to prove it squaring her shoulders she marched out of her office with the intention of marching into andrews at least two members of the family would stand by each other detective cook stood by loris desk another moment of your time dr jones of course even as her stomach dipped she composed her features and gestured please come in and sit down lori hold my calls please can i get you coffee detective no thanks im cutting back caffeine and tobacco theyre real killers he settled into a chair took out his notebook dr jones dr andrew jones tells me that the piece that was taken was insured the institute is fully insured against theft and fire five hundred thousand dollars isnt that a lot for a little piece like that it wasnt signed or anything either is that right the artist was unknown but believed to be a student of leonardo da vinci she longed to nurse the nagging ache in her temple but kept her hands still it was an excellent study of david circa shed tested it herself she thought sourly and no one had questioned her findings five hundred thousand is well within the range should the piece have been auctioned or sold to a collector she added you do that kind of thing here cook pursed his lips sell off occasionally we also acquire its part of our purpose he let his gaze skim around her office efficient neat with highend equipment and a desk that was probably worth a small fortune as well it takes a lot of money to run a place like this yes it does the fees we generate for classes consulting work and admissions cover a large part of it theres also a trust fund set up by my grandfather in addition patrons often donate funds or collections though it flickered through her mind that it might be wise to call their lawyer she leaned forward detective cook we dont need five hundred thousand dollars in insurance money to run the institute i guess its a drop in the bucket of course for some people its a nice chunk of change especially if they gamble or have debts or just want to buy a fancy car however tight her neck and shoulders were now she met his gaze levelly i dont gamble i dont have any difficult debts and i have a car if youll excuse me saying so dr jones you dont seem particularly upset about this loss is my being upset going to help you recover the bronze he clucked his tongue you got a point your brother now hes pretty shaken up because her eyes clouded she dropped her gaze and stared into the remains of her tea he feels responsible he takes things to heart and you dont feel responsible or take things to heart she countered then lifted her hands a few inches off the desk in this case neither just for my notes would you mind going over your evening for me all right her muscles had bunched up again but she spoke calmly andrew and i both worked until around seven i sent my assistant home just after six i had a longdistance call shortly after from florence italy an associate of mine distress burned under her breastbone like an ulcer i imagine we were on the phone for ten minutes maybe a little less andrew dropped by here a bit after that we had a discussion and left together right around seven do you usually come and go to work together no we dont our hours dont always coincide i wasnt feeling well last night so he took me home we share the house our grandmother left us we had a little dinner i went upstairs around nine and stayed in the rest of the night yes as i said i wasnt feeling very well and your brother was at home all night she had no idea yes he was i woke him right after i got the call from mr scutter in security just after six this morning we came in together assessed the situation and ordered mr scutter to call the police that little bronze cook rested his pad on his knee youve got pieces in that gallery worth a lot more id guess funny he only took that piece only one piece after hed gone to all the trouble to get inside yes she said evenly i thought the same myself how would you explain that detective he had to smile it was a good comeback id have to say he wanted it theres nothing else missing the gallery spaces are being checked thoroughly nothing else appears to be missing i dont know what else i can tell you that should do it for now he rose tucked his notebook away well be interviewing your staff and its likely ill need to talk to you again were more than willing to cooperate she rose as well she wanted him out you can contact me here or at home she continued as she walked to the door when she opened it she saw ryan pacing the outer office miranda he came straight to her took both of her hands i just heard for some reason tears swam close again and were battled back bad day she managed im so sorry how much was taken do the police have any leads i ryan this is detective cook hes in charge detective this is ryan boldari an associate detective ryan could have spotted him as a cop from six blocks at a dead run in the opposite direction mr boldari you work here no i own galleries in new york and san francisco im here on business for a few days miranda what can i do to help theres nothing i dont know it hit her again like a wave and made her hands tremble in his you should sit down youre upset mr boldari cook held up a finger as ryan turned to nudge miranda back into her office what are the names of your galleries boldari he said with an arch of brow the boldari gallery he slipped out a hammeredsilver case and removed a business card the addresses for both are there excuse me detective dr jones needs a moment it gave him a quiet satisfaction to shut the door in cooks face sit down miranda tell me what happened she did as he asked grateful now for the firm grip of his hand on hers only one piece ryan said when shed finished odd he had to be a stupid thief she said with some spirit he could have cleaned out that display without much more time and no more effort ryan tucked his tongue in his cheek and reminded himself not to be offended apparently he was selective but stupid difficult to believe a stupid man or woman for that matter could get past your security with such apparent ease and speed well he might know electronics but he doesnt know art unable to sit she rose and flipped on her coffeepot the david was a lovely little piece but hardly the best we have oh it doesnt matter she muttered dragging a hand through her hair i sound as though im annoyed he didnt take more or choose better im just so angry that he got in at all as i would be he walked over to kiss the top of her head im sure the police will find him and david cook struck me as an efficient type i suppose once he eliminates andrew and me from his list of suspects and can concentrate on finding the real thief that would be typical id imagine the little worm of guilt wriggled again as he turned her to face him youre not worried about that part are you no not really annoyed but not worried i appreciate you coming by ryan i oh lunch she remembered im not going to be able to make it dont give it a thought well reschedule when i make my next trip in next trip i have to leave this evening id hoped to stay another day or two for personal reasons but i need to get back tonight oh she hadnt thought it possible to be any more unhappy he lifted her hands to his lips sad eyes he thought were so compelling it wouldnt hurt to miss me it might help take your mind off all this i have a feeling im going to be busy for the next few days but im sorry you cant stay longer this wont this problem isnt going to change your mind about the exchange is it miranda he enjoyed the moment playing the stalwart and supporting hero dont be foolish the vasaris will be in your hands within the month thank you after the morning ive had i appreciate the confidence more than i can tell you and youll miss me her lips curved i think i will now say goodbye she began to but he stopped her mouth with his indulged himself by taking it deep sliding past her initial surprise her initial resistance like the thief he was it would be he knew a considerable amount of time before he saw her again if he ever did their lives separated here but he wanted to take something with him so he took the sweetness hed just begun to sense under the strength and the passion hed just begun to stir under the control he eased her back studied her face let his hands stroke once up her arms down again until the touch lingered just on fingertips goodbye miranda he said with more regret than was comfortable and left her certain she would deal with the small inconvenience hed caused in her life chapter nine by the time andrew got off the phone with his mother he would have betrayed his country for three fingers of jack daniels it hung on him he accepted that the daytoday running of the institute was his responsibility and security was first priority his mother had pointed that out in short declarative sentences it would have done no good to counter that since that security had been breached they should be kicking up their heels that only one item had been lost to elizabeth the breakin was a personal insult and the loss of the small bronze david was as bitter as a wholesale clearing of the galleries he could accept that too he could and would shoulder the responsibility of dealing with the police the insurance company the staff the press but what he couldnt accept what made him wish he had access to a bottle was her complete lack of support or sympathy but he didnt have access to a bottle keeping one in his office was a line he hadnt crossed and one that allowed him to shrug off any suggestion that he had a drinking problem he drank at home at bars at social events he didnt drink during business hours therefore he was in control fantasizing about slipping out to the nearest liquor store and getting a little something to help him through a long hard day wasnt the same as doing it he depressed the intercom button on his phone ms purdue yes dr jones run down to freedom liquors would you ms purdue darling and pick me up a fifth of jack daniels black its a family tradition could you come in please right away sir andrew pushed away from the desk and turned to the window his hands were steady werent they his stomach might have been rolling in greasy waves his spine might have been damp with clammy sweat but his hands were still steady he was in control he heard her come in shut the door quietly the insurance investigator will be here at eleven he said without turning make sure my calendars clear ive canceled all but essential appointments for the day dr jones good thank you ah he pinched the bridge of his nose hoping to relieve some pressure well need to schedule a staff meeting department heads only as early in the afternoon as possible one oclock dr jones fine send a memo to my sister id like her to work with publicity on a statement inform any and all reporters who call that well be issuing a statement by end of day and have no comment at this time yes sir dr jones detective cook would like to speak with you again as soon as possible hes downstairs ill go down shortly we need to draft a letter to dr standfordjones and dr charles jones detailing this incident and its current status they he broke off at the knock on the door then turned when miranda stepped in im sorry andrew i can come back if youre busy thats all right well save ms purdue a memo can you work with publicity on a statement ill get right on it she could see the strain around his eyes you talked to florence he smiled thinly florence talked to me im going to draft a letter telling the sad tale and copy her and father why dont i do that the shadows under his eyes were too dark she thought the lines around his mouth too deep save you a little time and trouble id appreciate it the insurance investigator will be here shortly and cook wants me again oh she linked her hands together to keep them still ms purdue would you give us a moment of course ill set up the staff meeting dr jones department heads andrew told miranda when the door closed again one oclock all right andrew about cook hes going to want to know about last night where you were what you were doing who you were with i told him we left here together about seven and that both of us were home all night fine her fingers twisted were you what home yes he angled his head eyes narrowing why i didnt know if youd gone out or not unlinking her fingers she rubbed her hands over her face i just thought it best to say you hadnt you dont have to protect me miranda i havent done anything which according to our mother is the problem i know you havent i didnt mean that she reached out touched a hand to his arm it just seemed less complicated to say youd been home all night then i started thinking what if you had gone out and youd been seen bellied up to a bar bitter resentment coated his voice or skulking around the building oh andrew miserable she lowered herself to the arm of a chair lets not snipe at each other its just that cook makes me nervous and i started to worry that if he caught me in a lie however harmless it would just make it all worse with a sigh he dropped into the chair looks like were in shit up to our knees im up to my waist she muttered she ordered me to take a leave of absence i refused are you standing up for yourself or just kicking at her miranda frowned and studied her nails how does it feel to be a failure no she wouldnt give in to that i can do both be careful you dont fall on your butt last night i would have agreed with her not for the same reason but id have agreed today changes things i need you here im not going anywhere he patted her knee before he rose ill go talk to cook send me a copy of the press release and the letter oh she gave me fathers address in utah he tore a piece of notepaper from the pad on his desk and handed it to her overnight the letters the sooner they have it in writing the better ill see you at one then oh andrew ryan said to tell you goodbye he stopped with his hand on the doorknob goodbye he had to get back to new york tonight he was here damn it he knows about this mess already the vasaris hes completely supportive he assured me this problem wouldnt affect the trade im ah thinking about going down to new york in a couple of weeks in fact shed just thought of it to expedite the loan distracted he nodded good thats fine well talk about that later a new exhibits just what we need to offset this mess he started downstairs glancing at his watch it amazed him it was barely ten it felt as if hed been running on this particular wheel for days cops both uniformed and plainclothes swarmed the main floor what he assumed was fingerprint powder was smeared over the display cabinet the little circle of glass was gone tucked away in some evidence bag he figured andrew questioned one of the uniformed officers and was told hed find detective cook at the south entrance andrew traveled the route trying to imagine the thief doing the same dressed in black he imagined a man with a hard face maybe a scar sliced down the cheek had he carried a gun a knife a knife andrew decided he would have wanted to kill quietly and quickly should it become necessary he thought of how many nights miranda worked late in the lab or her office and cursed violently fresh fury was bubbling under his skin as he pushed into the anteroom and found cook perusing the offerings of the snack machine is this how you find this son of a bitch andrew demanded by munching on potato chips actually im going for the pretzels calmly cook pushed the proper buttons im cutting down on fat grams the bag thunked against the metal tray cook pushed through the slot nipped it out great a healthconscious cop you got your health cook claimed as he ripped open the bag you got everything i want to know what youre doing to find the bastard who broke into my building my job dr jones why dont we sit down here he gestured to one of the little cafe tables you look like you could use some coffee andrews eyes flashed the sudden brilliant blue of temper that turned his aesthetic face into something tough and potentially mean the quick change had cook reconsidering the man i dont want to sit down andrew shot back and i dont want any coffee he would have killed for some my sister works late detective she often works late alone in this building if she hadnt been ill last night she might have been here when he broke in i might have lost something a great deal more valuable to me than a bronze i understand your concern no you couldnt possibly i got family myself despite andrews refusal cook counted out coins and turned to the coffee machine how do you take it i said black andrew muttered just black i used to drink it the same way still miss it cook breathed in deep as the coffee began to spurt into the insulated cup let me relieve your mind a bit dr jones typically a bande man especially a smart one isnt looking to hurt anyone fact is hell back off a job before hell get into that kind of tangle he wont even carry a weapon because if he does that adds years onto his time if hes caught he set the coffee on the table sat waited after a moment andrew relented and joined him as the hot edge of temper faded from his eyes his narrow face smoothed out his shoulders slipped back into their slight hunch maybe this guy wasnt typical id say he wasnt but if hes as smart as i think hed have followed that rule no weapons no contact with people in and out if your sister had been here hed have avoided her you dont know my sister the coffee made him feel slightly more human a strong lady your sister shes had to be but she was mugged recently right in front of our house the guy had a knife shes terrified of knives there was nothing she could do cook pursed his lips when was this a couple of weeks ago i guess he dug fingers through his hair he knocked her down took her purse her briefcase he trailed off took another breath another sip of coffee it shook her shook us both and thinking that she might have been here when this guy broke in this type of thief its not his style to knock women around and grab their purses maybe not but they never caught him he terrified her took her things then he walked mirandas had enough between that and the problems in florence andrew caught himself realizing he was relaxing and chatting about miranda for gods sake this isnt what you wanted to talk to me about actually its helpful dr jones a mugging and a burglary in less than a month same victim it was cook decided interesting you say your sister wasnt well last night what was wrong with her a problem in florence he said briefly some difficulty with our mother it upset her your mothers in italy she lives there she works there she heads standjo its a laboratory for testing art and artifacts its part of the family business an offshoot of the institute so theres some friction between your mother and your sister andrew took another sip of coffee to steady himself and watched cook over the rim his eyes went hard again my family relationships arent police business just trying to get the whole picture this is a family organization after all theres no sign of forced entry andrews hand jerked nearly spilling his coffee as he tried to make the sharp turn excuse me theres no overt sign of forced entry on either of these doors cook wagged a finger to the exterior and interior doors both were locked outside you need a key card and a code correct yes only department heads can use this entrance this area is used as a staff lounge theres another lounge for general staff on level three ill need a list of department heads of course you think its someone who works here i dont think anything biggest mistake is to come onto a scene with an idea he smiled a little its just procedure the breakin at the institute was the lead story on the local eleven oclock news in new york it earned thirty seconds in the lower half of the hour stretched out on the sofa in his apartment on central park south ryan sipped a brandy enjoyed the tang of a slim cuban cigar and noted the details there werent many then new york had plenty of its own crime and scandals to fill the time if the institute hadnt been a landmark and the joneses quite such a prominent new england family the burglary wouldnt have merited so much as a blip outside of maine police were investigating ryan grinned around the cigar as he thought of cook he knew the type dogged thorough with a solid record of closing cases it was satisfying to have a good cop investigating his last job rounded off his career nicely pursuing several leads well that was bullshit there were no leads but they would have to say there were and save face he sat up as he caught a glimpse of miranda leaving the building her hair was smoothed back in a twist shed done that for the cameras he thought remembering how it had been loose and tangled when hed kissed her goodbye her face was calm composed cold he decided the lady had quite a cold streak which inspired him to melt her which he would have done he thought if thered been a bit more time still he was pleased to see she was handling the situation well she was a tough one even with those pockets of shyness and sadness she was tough another day or two he calculated and her life would slip back into routine the little bump hed put into it would smooth out the insurance would kick in and the cops would file the case and forget it and he ryan thought as he blew cheerful smoke rings at the ceiling had a satisfied client a perfect record and some leisure time coming maybe just maybe hed bend the rules in this case and take miranda to the west indies for a couple of weeks sun sand and sex it would do her good he decided and it sure as hell wouldnt hurt him any annie mcleans apartment would have fit into ryans living room but she did have a view of the park if she leaned far enough out her bedroom window twisted her neck until it ached and strained her eyes but that was good enough for her maybe the furniture was secondhand but she had bright colors the rug might have come from a garage sale but it had shampooed up just fine and she liked the overblown cabbage roses around the border shed put the shelves together herself painted them a deep dark green and crammed them with books she bought when the library held its annual sale classics for the most part books shed neglected to read in school and longed to explore now she did so whenever she had a free hour or two bundling under the cheerful blueandgreenstriped throw her mother had crocheted and diving into hemingway or steinbeck or fitzgerald her cd player had been an indulgent christmas present to herself two years before deliberately shed collected a wide range of music eclectic she liked to think of it shed been too busy working to develop a wide range of tastes in books and music when she was in her teens and early twenties a pregnancy miscarriage and broken heart all before her eighteenth birthday had changed her direction shed been determined to make something of herself to have something for herself then shed let herself be charmed by slicktalking highliving nogood sonofabitching buster hormones she thought and a need to make a home to build her own family had blinded her to the impossibility of marriage with a mostly unemployed mechanic with a taste for coors and blondes shed wanted a child she thought now maybe lord help her to make up for the one shed lost live and learn she often told herself shed done both now she was an independent woman with a solid business one who was taking the time and making the effort to improve her mind she liked to listen to her customers their opinions and views and measure them against her own she was broadening her outlook and calculated that in the seven years shed had annies place shed learned more about politics religion sex and the economy than any college graduate if there were some nights when slipping into bed alone she longed for someone to listen to her to hold her to laugh with her when she spoke of her day it was a small price to pay for independence in her experience men didnt want to listen to what you had to say they just wanted to do a little bitching and scratch their butts then yank off your nightgown and fuck she was much better off on her own one day she thought she might buy a house with a yard she wouldnt mind having a dog she would cut back on her hours hire a bar manager maybe take a vacation ireland first naturally she wanted to see the hills and the pubs of course but shed suffered the humiliation of not having enough money of having doors shut in her face when she asked for a loan of being told she was a bad risk she never intended to go through that again so her profits were fed back into her business and what she sliced off of them was tucked into conservative stocks and bonds she didnt need to be rich but she would never be poor again her parents had skirted the slippery edge of poor all of annies life theyd done what they could for her but her father bless him had held on to money as a man holds a handful of water it had continually trickled through his fingers when they moved to florida three winters before annie had kissed them both goodbye cried a little and slipped her mother five hundred dollars it had been hardearned but she knew her mother could make it stretch through several of her fathers getrichquick schemes she called them every week on sunday afternoons when the rates were down and sent her mother another check every three months she promised to visit often but had managed only two short trips in three years annie thought of them now as she watched the end of the late news and closed the book shed been struggling to read her parents adored andrew of course theyd never known about that night on the beach about the baby shed conceived then lost with a shake of her head she put it all out of her mind she switched off the television picked up the mug of tea shed let go cold and took it into the closet her landlord claimed was a kitchen she was reaching to switch off the light when someone knocked at her door annie glanced at the louisville slugger she kept by the door the twin of one she kept behind the bar at work though shed never had occasion to use either they made her feel secure who is it its andrew let me in will you your landlord keeps these halls in a deep freeze though she wasnt particularly pleased to find him on her doorstep annie slipped off the chain released the dead bolt and thumb lock and opened the door its late andrew youre telling me he said though she wore a plaid robe and thick black socks i saw your light under the door come on annie be a pal and let me in im not giving you a drink thats okay once he was inside he reached under his coat and pulled out a bottle i brought my own its been a long miserable day annie he gave her a hound dog look that wrenched at her heart i didnt want to be home fine annoyed she stalked to the kitchen and got out a short glass youre a grown man youll drink if you want i want he poured lifted his glass in a halfsalute thanks i guess youve heard the news yes im sorry she sat on the couch and slipped the copy of moby dick out of sight between the cushions though she couldnt have explained why it would embarrass her to have him see it cops think it was an inside job he drank laughed a little i never thought id use that phrase in a sentence theyre taking a hard look at miranda and me first why in the world would they think youd steal from yourself people do all the time insurance companys investigating were being thoroughly studied its just routine concerned now she reached up to take his hand and draw him down beside her yeah routine sucks i loved that bronze what the one that was taken it said something to me the young david taking on the giant willing to pit a stone against a sword courage the kind ive never had why do you do that to yourself irritation rang in her voice as she shoved against him i never take on the giants he said and reached for the bottle again i just roll with the flow and follow orders my parents say its time you took over the running of the institute andrew and i say when do you want me to start you love the institute a happy coincidence if theyd told me to go to borneo and study native habits i bet id have a hell of a tan by now elise says its time we got married i say set the date she says i want a divorce i say gee honey do you want me to pay for the lawyer i tell you im pregnant annie thought and you ask if i want to get married he studied the liquor in his glass watched the way the light from her floor lamp slipped through the amber i never bucked the system because it never seemed to matter enough to make the effort and that doesnt say much for andrew jones so you drink because its easier than seeing if it matters maybe but he set the glass down to see if he could to see how it felt to say what else was on his mind without the crutch i didnt do the right thing by you annie didnt really stand by you the way i should have all those years ago because i was terrified of what theyd do i dont want to talk about that we never have mostly because i didnt think you wanted to but you brought it up the other day i shouldnt have a little finger of panic curled in her stomach at the thought of it its old business its our business annie he said it gently because he heard a trace of that panic let it alone she drew away from him folded her arms defensively all right why scratch at old wounds he decided when you had fresh juicy ones well just move along through the life and times of andrew jones at this point in it im waiting patiently for the cops to tell me i dont have to go to prison this time when he reached for the bottle she grabbed it stood up and walking into the kitchen poured the contents down the sink goddamn it annie you dont need whiskey to make yourself miserable andrew you do fine all on your own your parents didnt love you enough thats rough temper she hadnt known crouched inside her sprang free mine loved me plenty but im still sitting alone at night with memories and regrets that rip at my heart your wife didnt love you enough either tough break my husband would get himself oiled up on a couple of sixpacks and love me whether i wanted him to or not annie christ he hadnt known that hadnt imagined that im sorry dont tell me youre sorry she fired back i got through i got through you and i got through him by realizing id made a mistake and fixing it dont do that out of nowhere his own anger spurted up a dangerous light glinted in his eyes hardening them as he got to his feet dont compare what we had with what you had with him then dont you use what we had the same way you use what you had with elise i wasnt its not the same damn right because she was beautiful and she was brilliant annie jabbed a finger into his chest hard enough to make him take a step back and maybe you didnt love her enough if you had youd still have her because ive never known you to go without what you really want you may not pick up a stone and go to war for it but you get it she wanted out he shouted it you cant make someone love you she leaned on the tiny counter closed her eyes and to his surprise began to laugh you sure as hell cant she wiped at the tears the fit of laughter had brought to her eyes you may have a phd dr jones but youre stupid youre a stupid man and im tired im going to bed you can let yourself out she stormed by him half hoping shed made him angry enough to grab her but he didnt and she walked into the bedroom alone when she heard him go out heard the door click behind him she curled onto the bed and indulged herself in a good hard cry chapter ten technology never failed to delight and amaze cook when he started out as a beat cop twentythree years before hed seen that a detectives job involved hours of phone calls paperwork and doortodoors not as exciting as hollywood liked nor as he young and eager had intended to settle for once he joined the ranks hed planned to spend this particular sunday afternoon doing some fishing in miracle bay as the weather had turned calm and the temperatures had crept into the sixties but hed detoured by the station house on a whim he believed in following whims which he considered a short step down from hunches there on his desk stacked among the files cluttering his in box was the computergenerated report from pretty young officer mary chaney for himself cook approached the computer with the caution and respect of a street cop approaching a junkie in a dark alley you had to deal with it you had to do the job but you knew damn well anything could go wrong if you missed a step the jones case was a priority because the joneses were rich and the governor knew them personally as the case was on his mind hed asked mary to run a computer check searching for like crimes such information as he had in his hands would have taken weeks if hed ever been able to gather it in his early days at this desk now he had a pattern in front of him that made his fishing plans slide out of his mind as he tipped back in his chair and studied it he had six likes over a period of ten years and twice that many other hits similar enough to warrant a mention new york chicago san francisco boston kansas city atlanta a museum or gallery in each of those cities had reported a breakin and the loss of one item in the past decade the value of each item ranged from a hundred thousand to just over a cool million no damage to the property no mess no alarm sounded each piece had been covered by insurance and no arrest had been made slick he thought the guy was slick in the dozen that followed there were some variations two or more pieces had been taken and in one case a guards coffee had been drugged and the security system was simply shut off for a period of thirty minutes in another an arrest had been made a guard had attempted to pawn a fifteenthcentury cameo he was arrested and confessed but claimed that hed taken the cameo after the breakin the renoir landscape and the manet portrait that had also been stolen were never recovered interesting cook thought again the profile that was forming in his mind of his quarry didnt include sloppy trips to pawnshops could be he enlisted a guard as an inside source it was something to check out and it wouldnt hurt to see where the joneses had been during the dates of the other thefts it was after all just another kind of fishing the first thing on mirandas mind when she opened her eyes on sunday morning was the dark lady she had to see it again examine it again how else would she know how she had been so completely mistaken for as the days passed she had come to the painful conclusion that shed been wrong what other explanation was there she knew her mother too well to save standjos reputation elizabeth would have questioned every detail of the second testing she would have insisted on and received absolute proof of its accuracy she would never have settled for less the practical thing to do was to accept it to salvage her pride by saying nothing more on the matter until the situation cooled stirring the pot could accomplish nothing positive because the damage had already been done deciding she could make better use of her time than brooding she changed into sweats a couple hours at the health club might sweat some of the depression out of her two hours later she returned to the house to find andrew stumbling around nursing a hangover she was just about to go upstairs when the doorbell chimed let me take your jacket detective cook she heard andrew say cook on a sunday afternoon miranda pushed her hands at her hair cleared her throat and sat down as andrew led cook in miranda offered him a polite smile do you have news for us nothing solid dr jones just a loose end or two please sit down great house cops eyes below their bushy gray brows scanned the room as he walked to a chair really makes a statement up here on the cliffs old money he thought it had its own smell its own look here it was beeswax and lemon oil it was heirloom furniture and faded wallpaper and floortoceiling windows framed in a burgundy waterfall of what was probably silk class and privilege and just enough clutter to make it a home what can we do for you detective ive got a little angle im working on i wonder if you could tell me where you were where both of you were last november first week last november it was such an odd question andrew scratched his head over it i was here in jones point i didnt do any traveling last fall did i he asked miranda not that i recall why is that important detective just clearing up some details were you here as well dr jones i was in dc for a few days in early november some consult work at the smithsonian id have to get my desk calendar to be sure would you mind he smiled apologetically just so i can tidy this up all right she couldnt see the point but she couldnt see the harm either its up in my office yes sir cook continued when she left the room this is quite a place must be a bear to heat we go through a lot of firewood andrew muttered you do much traveling dr jones the institute keeps me pretty close to home mirandas the frequent flier she does a lot of consulting the occasional lecture he tapped his fingers on his knee and noted that cooks gaze had shifted to linger on the bottle of jack daniels on the table beside the sofa his shoulders hunched defensively what does last november have to do with our breakin im not sure it does just tugging on a line you do any fishing no i get seasick too bad according to my records miranda said as she came back in i was in washington from november third through the seventh and the burglary in san francisco had occurred in the early hours of the fifth cook recalled i guess you flew down there yes into national she checked her book usair flight fouroneoheight departing jones point at tenfifty arriving national at twelve fiftynine i stayed at the four seasons is that specific enough for you sure is being a scientist youd keep good records yes i do she walked over to andrews chair sat on the arm beside him they became a unit whats this about just getting things ordered in my head would you have where you were in june in that book say the third week of course steadied by andrews hand on her knee she flipped back to june i was at the institute the entire month of june lab work some summer classes you taught a couple yourself didnt you andrew when jack goldblooms allergies kicked up and he took a few days off yeah he closed his eyes to help him think back that was toward the end of june oriental art of the twelfth century he opened his eyes again and grinned at her you wouldnt touch it and i had to cram we can easily get the exact dates for you detective he continued we keep excellent records at the institute as well fine appreciate it well cooperate mirandas voice was brisk and stern and we expect you to do the same it was our property taken detective i think we have the right to know what avenues youre investigating no problem he rested his hands on his knees im checking out a series of burglaries that match the profile of yours maybe you heard something seeing as youre in the same line about a theft up in boston last june the harvard university art museum a shudder climbed up mirandas spine the kuang chinese tomb piece thought to be late thirteenth to early twelfth century bc another bronze youve got a good memory for detail yes i do it was a huge loss its one of the most beautifully preserved pieces of chinese bronze ever recovered and worth a great deal more than our david november it was san francisco a painting that time not a bronze she thought and for some reason all but trembled with relief it was the m h de young memorial museum thats right american art andrew put in colonial period wheres the connection i didnt say there was but i think there is cook rose could be weve got a thief with what you could call an eclectic taste in art me i like that georgia okeeffe stuff its bright looks like what it is i appreciate your time he turned away turned back i wonder if i could borrow that datebook of yours dr jones and if the two of you would have written records of the year before just to help me put it all in order miranda hesitated again thought of lawyers but pride had her standing and holding the slim leather book out to him youre welcome to it and i have calendars for the last three years stored at my office at the institute appreciate it ill just give you a receipt for this he tucked her book away and took out his own to scrawl the information and his signature andrew rose as well ill have mine messengered over to you that would be a big help its difficult not to be insulted by this detective cook raised his eyebrows at miranda im sorry about that dr jones im just trying to do my job i imagine you are and once you put my brother and me off your list of suspects youll be able to do it with more speed and efficiency which is why were willing to tolerate this sort of treatment ill show you out cook nodded at andrew and followed her into the foyer didnt mean to put your back up dr jones oh yes you did detective she wrenched open the door good afternoon maam a quartercentury on the force hadnt made him immune to the sharp tongue of an angry woman he ducked his head and grimaced a bit when the door shut loudly at his back the man thinks were thieves fuming she stalked back into the parlor it annoyed her but didnt surprise her to see andrew pouring himself a drink he thinks were bouncing around the country breaking into museums would be kind of fun wouldnt it what just trying to relieve the tension he lifted his glass one way or the other this isnt a game andrew and i dont care to be smeared on a slide under a police microscope theres nothing for him to find but the truth its not the end that worries me its the means were under investigation the press is bound to get ahold of some of this miranda he spoke softly and added an affectionate smile youre sounding dangerously close to mother theres no reason to insult me im sorry youre right im going to make a pot roast miranda announced as she walked toward the kitchen a pot roast his mood lifted dramatically with the little potatoes and carrots you peel the potatoes keep me company andrew she asked as much for herself as to get him away from the bottle i dont want to be alone sure he set the glass down it was empty anyway and slipped an arm over her shoulders the meal helped as did the preparation of it she enjoyed cooking and considered it another science it was mrs patch who had taught her pleased that the young girl had shown an interest in kitchen work it had been the warmth of that kitchen and the company that drew miranda the rest of the house had been so cold so regimented but mrs patch had ruled in the kitchen even elizabeth hadnt dared to intrude more likely she hadnt cared to miranda thought as she prepared for bed shed never known her mother to fix a meal and that simple fact made learning how herself more appealing she would not be a mirror of elizabeth the pot roast had done its work she thought now good solid meat and potatoes drop biscuits shed made from scratch conversation with andrew maybe hed had more wine with dinner than she liked but at least he hadnt been alone it had been almost a happy time theyd tactically agreed not to discuss the institute or the trouble in florence it was much more relaxing to argue over their diverse views on music and books theyd always argued about them she remembered as she tugged on her pajamas theyd always shared views and thoughts and hopes she doubted she would have survived childhood intact without him theyd been each others anchor in a chilly sea for as long as she could remember she only wished she could do more to steady him now and convince him to seek help but whenever she touched on the subject of his drinking he only closed up and drank more all she could do was watch and stand with him until he fell off the edge of the cliff he was so tenuously poised on then she would do what she could to help him pick up the pieces she climbed into bed arranging her pillows to support her back then picked up her volume of bedtime reading some might say rereading homer wasnt a particularly relaxing occupation but it worked for her by midnight her mind was full of greek battles and betrayals and clear of worries she marked her place set the book aside and turned off her light in moments she was dreamlessly asleep deeply enough that she didnt hear the door open close again she didnt hear the lock click smoothly into place or the footsteps cross the room toward the bed she awoke with a jolt a gloved hand hard over her mouth another clamped firmly at her throat and a mans voice softly threatening in her ear i could strangle you part two the thief all men love to appropriate the belongings of others it is a universal desire only the manner of doing it differs alain rené lesage chapter eleven her mind simply froze the knife for a hideous moment she would have sworn she felt the prick of a blade at her throat rather than the smooth grip of hands and her body went lax with terror dreaming she must be dreaming but she could smell leather and man she could feel the pressure on her throat that forced her to dig deep for air and the hand that covered her mouth to block any sound she could see a faint outline the shape of a head the breadth of shoulders all of that blipped into her stunned brain and was processed in seconds that seemed like hours not again she promised herself never again in instinctive reaction her right hand balled into a fist and came off the mattress in a snap of movement he was either faster or a mind reader as he shifted an instant before the blow landed her fist bounced harmlessly off his biceps lie still and keep quiet he hissed the order and added a convincing little shake however much id like to hurt you i wont your brothers snoring at the other end of the house so its unlikely hell hear you if you scream besides you wont scream will you his fingers gentled on her throat with a shivering caress of thumb itd bruise your yankee pride she muttered something against his gloved hand he removed it but kept the other on her throat what do you want i want to kick your excellent ass from here to chicago damn it dr jones you fucked up i dont know what youre talking about it was hard to keep her breathing under control but she managed it that too was pride let go of me i wont scream she wouldnt because andrew might hear and might come roaring in and whoever was currently pinning her to the bed was probably armed well she thought this time so was she if she could manage to get into her nightstand drawer and grab her gun in response he sat on the bed beside her and still holding her in place reached out for the switch on the bedside lamp she blinked rapidly against the flash of light then stared wideeyed slackjawed ryan how could you make such a stupid sloppy unprofessional mistake he was dressed in black snug jeans boots a turtleneck and bomber jacket his face was as strikingly handsome as ever but his eyes werent warm and appealing as she remembered they were hot impatient and unmistakably dangerous ryan she managed again what are you doing here trying to clean up the mess you made i see perhaps hed had some sort of breakdown it was vital to remain calm she reminded herself and not to alarm him slowly she put a hand on his wrist and nudged his hand away from her throat she sat up instinctively and primly tugging at the collar of her pajamas ryan she even worked up what she thought was a soothing smile youre in my bedroom in the middle of the night how did you get in the way i usually get into houses that arent my own i picked your locks you really ought to have better you picked the locks she blinked blinked again he simply didnt look like a man in the middle of a mental crisis but one who was simmering with barely suppressed temper you broke into my house and the phrase had a ridiculous notion popping into her head you broke in she repeated thats right he toyed with the hair that tumbled over her shoulder he was absolutely crazy about her hair its what i do but youre a businessman youre an art patron youre why youre not ryan boldari at all are you i certainly am for the first time that wicked smile flashed reaching his eyes turning them gold and amused and have been since my sainted mother named me thirtytwo years ago in brooklyn and up to my association with you that name has stood for something the smile vanished into a snarl reliability perfection the goddamn bronze was a fake the bronze the blood simply drained out of her face she felt it go drop by drop how do you know about the bronze i know about it because i stole the worthless piece of shit and cocked his head or maybe youre thinking of the bronze in florence the other one you screwed up i got wind of that yesterday after my client reamed me out for passing him a forgery a forgery for sweet christs sake too incensed to sit he sprang off the bed and began to pace the room over twenty years without a blemish and now this and all because i trusted you trusted me she shoved up to her knees teeth clenched there was no room for fear or anxiety when temper percolated so hard and fast through the bloodstream you stole from me you son of a bitch so what what i tooks worth maybe a hundred bucks as a paperweight he stepped closer again annoyed that he found the hot gleam in her eyes and the angry color in her cheeks so appealing how many other pieces are you passing off in that museum of yours she didnt think she acted she was off the bed like a bullet launching herself at him at fiveeleven she was no flyweight and ryan got the full impact of her welltoned body and welloiled temper it was an innate affection for women that had him shifting his body to break her fall a gesture he instantly regretted as they hit the floor to spare both of them he rolled over and pinned her flat you stole from me she bucked wriggled and didnt budge him an inch you used me you son of a bitch you came on to me oh and that was the worst of it hed flattered romanced and had her on the edge of slipping into temptation the last was a side benefit he clamped her wrists with his hands to keep her from pounding his face youre very attractive it was no trouble at all youre a thief youre nothing but a common thief if you think that insults me youre off target im a really good thief now we can sit down and work this out or we can lie here and keep wrestling but im going to warn you that even in those incredibly ugly pajamas youre an appealing handful up to you miranda she went very still and he watched with reluctant admiration as her eyes went from fire to frost get off me get the hell off me okay he eased off then nimbly rocked up to his feet though he offered her a hand she slapped it away and pushed herself up if youve hurt andrew why the hell should i hurt andrew youre the one who documented the bronze and youre the one who stole it she snatched her robe from the foot of the bed what are you going to do now shoot me then clean out the house i dont shoot people im a thief not a thug then youre remarkably stupid what do you think im going to do the moment youre gone she tossed that over her shoulder as she tugged on the robe im going to pick up that phone call detective cook and tell him just who broke into the institute he merely hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans the robe he decided was as amazingly unattractive as the pajamas there was absolutely no reason why he should have to block an urge to start nibbling his way through all that flannel if you call the cops youll look like a fool first because no one would believe you im not even here miranda im in new york his smile spread cocky and sure and there are several people wholl be more than happy to swear to it criminals thats no way to talk about my friends and family especially when you havent met them second he continued while she ground her teeth youd have to explain to the police why the stolen item was insured for six figures and was worth pocket change youre lying i authenticated that piece myself its sixteenth century yeah and the fiesole bronze was cast by michelangelo he smirked at her that shut you up now sit down and ill tell you just how were going to handle this i want you out of here she tossed up her chin i want you to leave this house immediately or what it was impulse a wild one but for once she followed the primal instinct she made a dive had the drawer open and the gun at her fingertips his hand closed over her wrist and he cursed lightly as he yanked the gun free with his other hand he shoved her back onto the bed do you know how many accidental shootings happen in the home because people keep loaded guns he was stronger than shed estimated and faster this wouldnt have been an accident you could hurt yourself he muttered and neatly removed the clip he pocketed it and tossed the gun back in her drawer now she made a move to get up and he placed his spread hand on her face and pushed her back sit stay listen you owe me miranda i she almost choked i owe you i had a spotless record every time i took on a job i satisfied the client and this was my last one damn it i cant believe id get to the end and have some brainy redhead sully my reputation i had to give my client a piece out of my private collection and refund his fee in order to satisfy our contract record client contract she barely resisted tearing at her hair and screaming youre a thief for gods sake not an art dealer im not going to argue semantics with you he spoke calmly a man totally in charge i want the little venus the donatello excuse me you want what the small venus that was in the display with your forged david i could go back and take it but that wouldnt square the deal i want you to get it give it to me and if its authentic well consider this matter closed no amount of willpower could stop her from gaping youre out of your mind if you dont ill arrange for the david to find its way on the market again when the insurance company recovers it and has it tested as is routine your incompetence will be uncovered he angled his head and saw by the way her brow creased that she was following the path very well that on top of your recent disaster in florence would put a snug and unattractive cap on your career dr jones id like to spare you that embarrassment though i have no idea why dont do me any favors youre not blackmailing me into giving you a donatello or anything else the bronze is not a fake and youre going to prison just cant admit you made a mistake can you you were so sure werent you it appears you were wrong how will you explain it she shuddered once before she could control it when i make one i will the way you did in florence he countered and watched her eyes flicker news of that blunders trickling through the art world opinions are about fiftyfifty as to whether you doctored the tests or were just incompetent i dont care what the opinions are but the statement was weak and she began to rub her arms for warmth if id heard about it a few days earlier i wouldnt have risked lifting something youd authenticated i couldnt have made a mistake she closed her eyes because suddenly the thought of that was worse much worse than knowing hed used her to steal not that kind of a mistake i couldnt have the quiet despair in her voice had him tucking his hands in his pockets she looked fragile suddenly and unbearably weary everybody makes them miranda its part of the human condition not in my work there were tears in her throat as she opened her eyes to stare at him i dont make them in my work im too careful i dont jump to conclusions i follow procedure i her voice began to hitch her chest to heave she pressed her crossed hands between her breasts to try to control the hot tears that rose inside her like a tide okay hold on lets not get emotional im not going to cry im not going to cry she repeated it over and over like a mantra theres good news this is business miranda those big blue eyes were wet and brilliant and distracting lets keep it on that level and well both be happier business she rubbed the back of her hand over her mouth relieved that the absurdity of the statement had stemmed the tide of tears all right mr boldari business you say the bronze is a fake i say its not you say i wont report this to the police i say i will what are you going to do about it he studied her a moment in his line of work both of them he had to be a quick and accurate judge of people it was easy to see that she would stand by her testing and that shed call the police the second part didnt worry him overmuch but it would cause some inconvenience okay get dressed why well go to the lab you can test it again in front of me satisfy the first level of business its two in the morning so we wont be interrupted unless you want to go in your pajamas get some clothes on i cant test what i dont have i have it he gestured toward the leather bag hed set just inside the door i brought it with me with the idea of ramming it down your throat but reason prevailed dress warm he suggested and sat comfortably in her armchair the temperatures dropped im not taking you into the institute youre a logical woman be logical i have the bronze and your reputation in my hands you want a chance of getting the first back and salvaging the second im giving it to you he waited a moment to let that sink in ill give you the time to test it but im going to be right there breathing down your neck when you do thats the deal dr jones be smart take the deal she needed to know didnt she to be sure and once she was sure she would toss him to the police before he could blink those pretty eyes of his she could handle him she decided the fact was her pride demanded she take the opportunity to do just that im not going to change clothes in front of you dr jones if i had sex on my mind wed have dealt with that when we were on the floor business he said again and youre not getting out of my sight until weve concluded it i really hate you she said it with such loathing he saw no cause to doubt her word but he smiled to himself as she shut herself into the closet and hangers began to rattle she was a scientist an educated woman with unimpeachable breeding and an unblemished reputation she had had papers published in a dozen important science and art journals newsweek had done an article on her shed lectured at harvard and had spent three months as a guest professor at oxford it wasnt possible that she was driving through the chilly maine night with a thief intending to break into her own lab and conduct clandestine tests on a stolen bronze she hit the brakes and swung her car to the shoulder of the road i cant do this its ridiculous not to mention illegal im calling the police fine ryan merely shrugged as she reached for her car phone you do that sweetheart and you explain to them what youre doing with a worthless hunk of metal you tried to pass off as a work of art then you can explain to the insurance company youve already made a claim havent you how it happens you expected them to pay you five hundred grand for a fake one you authenticated personally its not a fake she said between her teeth but she didnt punch in prove it his grin flashed in the dark to me dr jones and to yourself if you do well negotiate negotiate my ass youre going to jail she told him and shifted in her seat so they were facetoface im going to see to it first things first amused he reached out and gave her chin a friendly pinch call your security tell them you and your brother are coming in to do some work in the lab im not involving andrew andrews already involved just make the call use whatever excuse you like you couldnt sleep so you decided to get some work done while its quiet go on miranda you want to know the truth dont you i know the truth you wouldnt know it if it jumped up and bit you you lose a little of that highsociety cool when youre pissed off he leaned forward kissed her lightly before she could shove him back i like it keep your hands off me that wasnt my hands he took her shoulders caressed those were my hands make the call she elbowed him aside and jabbed in the number the cameras would be on she thought hed never pass as andrew so they were finished before they began her security chief if he had any sense at all would call the police all shed have to do was tell her story and ryan boldari would be cuffed and penned and out of her life this is dr miranda jones she slapped out as ryan patted her knee in approval my brother and i are on our way in yes to work with all the confusion of the last few days im behind in my lab work we should be there in about ten minutes well use the main door thank you she disconnected sniffed she had him now she decided and hed turned the key himself theyre expecting me and will switch off the alarm when i get there fine he stretched out his legs as she pulled onto the road again im doing this for you you know i cant tell you how much i appreciate it no thanks necessary he waved them away grinning while she snarled really despite all the trouble youve caused me i like you why im all aflutter see youve got style not to mention a mouth that just begs to be savored over long hours in the dark i really regretted not having more time with that mouth of yours her hands tightened on the wheel the hitch in her breathing was fury she wouldnt allow it to be anything else youll have more time ryan she said sweetly this mouth of mine is going to chew you up and spit you out before were done i look forward to it this is a nice area he made the comment conversationally as she followed the coast road into town windswept dramatic lonely but with culture and civilization close at hand it suits you the house came down through your family i take it she didnt answer however ludicrous her actions she wasnt about to add to them by holding a conversation with him its enviable he continued unoffended the heritage and the money of course but beyond the privilege its the name you know the joneses of maine just reeks of class unlike the boldaris of brooklyn she muttered but that only made him laugh oh we reek of other things youd like my family its impossible not to and what i wonder would they make of you dr jones perhaps well meet at your trial still determined to bring me to justice he appreciated her profile almost as much as the shadows of ragged rocks the quick glimpses of dark sea ive been in this game for twenty years darling ive no intention of making a misstep on the eve of my retirement once a thief always a thief oh in the heart i agree with you but indeed he sighed once i clear my record im done if you hadnt messed things up id be taking a welldeserved vacation on st barts right now how tragic for you yeah well he moved his shoulders again i can still salvage a few days he unhooked his seat belt and turned to reach into the backseat for the bag hed tossed there what are you doing nearly there he whistled lightly as he took out a ski cap and pulled it down low over his head until his hair was concealed next came a long black scarf of cashmere that he wrapped around his neck and over the lower part of his face you can try to alert the guards he began flipping down the visor to check the result in the vanity mirror but if you do you wont see the bronze or me again you play it straight go in head to the lab just like you would normally and well be fine andrews a little taller than i am he considered as he unrolled a long dark coat shouldnt matter theyll see what they expect to see people always do when she pulled into the parking lot she had to admit he was right he was so anonymous in the cold weather gear that no one would look twice at him more when they got out of the car and started toward the main entrance she realized she might have taken him for andrew herself the body language the gait the slight hunch in the shoulders were perfect she yanked her card through the slot with one irritable flick of the wrist after a pause she punched in her code she imagined herself making wild faces at the camera tackling ryan and pounding her fists into his smug face while the guards scrambled instead she tapped her key card lightly against her palm and waited for the buzzer to sound and the locks to open ryan opened the doors himself laying one brotherly hand on her shoulder he kept his head down muttering to her as they walked in no detours dr jones you dont really want the trouble or the publicity what i want is the bronze youre about to get it temporarily at least he kept his hand on her shoulder guiding her down the corridors down the stairs to the lab doors again she keyed them in you wont be walking out of here with my property he turned on the lights run your tests he suggested peeling out of his coat youre wasting time he kept his gloves on to take out the bronze and hand it to her i do know something about authenticating dr jones and ill be watching you closely and this he told himself was one of the biggest risks of his long career coming here with her hed boxed himself in and was damned if he could rationalize the reason oh coming back was one thing he thought as he watched her take a pair of wirerim glasses out of a drawer and slip them on hed been right about that he mused the sexy scholar tucking that thought away he made himself comfortable while she took the bronze to a workstation for an extraction his reputation his pride which were one and the same were at stake the job which should have been a nice tidy and uneventful close to his career had ended up costing him a great deal of trouble money and loss of face but what he should have done and had intended to do was confront her threaten her blackmail her into offsetting his losses and walk away he hadnt been able to resist outwitting her he had no doubt in his mind she intended to slant the tests in her favor to try to convince him that the bronze was genuine and when she did it was going to cost her he thought the cellini would be fair payment for his indulgence the institute he decided slipping his hands in his pockets as he watched her work was about to make a generous donation to the boldari gallery it was going to kill her her brows were knit as she straightened from the microscope there was a twist in her stomach that no longer had anything to do with anger or with irritated arousal she didnt speak at all but made notes in a steady hand she took another scraping from the bronze both the patina and the metal now put it on a slide and studied that in turn her face was pale and set as she placed the bronze on a scale took additional notes i need to test the corrosion level take x rays for the tool work fine lets go he moved through the lab with her imagining just where he would display the cellini the little bronze venus she would give him would go into his own collection but the cellini was for the gallery for the public and would add a nice splash of prestige to his business he pulled a slim cigar out of his pocket reached for his lighter no smoking in here she snapped he merely clamped it between his teeth and lighted it call a cop he suggested how about some coffee leave me alone be quiet the twist in her stomach was sharper now and spread like acid as the minutes ticked away she followed procedure to the letter but she already knew she heated the clay waiting praying for the flash of light from the crystals and had to bite her lip to hold back the gasp she wouldnt give him the satisfaction but when she held the x ray up saw her instincts confirmed her fingers were icy cold well he arched a brow and waited for the con this bronze is a forgery because her legs were weak she sat on a stool and missed the flicker of surprise in his eyes the formula as far as i can tell with preliminary tests is correct the patina however has been recently applied and the corrosion levels are inconsistent with those of a bronze of the sixteenth century the tool work is wrong its well done she continued with one hand unconsciously pressed hard against her churning stomach but its not authentic well well dr jones he murmured you surprise me this is not the bronze i authenticated three years ago he tucked his thumbs in his pockets and rocked back on his heels you screwed up miranda youre going to have to face it this is not the bronze she repeated and her spine snapped straight as she pushed off the stool i dont know what you thought you could prove bringing me this forgery taking us through this ridiculous charade thats the bronze i took from the south gallery he said evenly and one i took on your reputation doctor so lets cut the bullshit and deal im not dealing with you she snatched up the bronze and shoved it at him you think you can break in my home then try to pass this obvious fake off as my property so that ill give you something else youre a lunatic i stole this bronze in good faith oh for gods sake im calling security he grabbed her arm shoved her roughly against the counter look sweetheart i went through this little game against my better judgment now its done maybe you werent trying to pass anything off maybe it was an honest mistake but i didnt make a mistake i dont make mistakes does the name fiesole ring a bell the angry flush died out of her cheeks her eyes unfocused went glassy for a moment he thought shed slip through his hold like water if she was feigning distress he realized hed underestimated her i didnt make a mistake she repeated but now her voice shook i can prove it i have the records my notes the x rays and results for the tests on the original bronze the vulnerability got to him enough for him to let her go as she twisted he shook his head and followed her into a room lined with file cabinets the weight was wrong she said quickly as she fumbled with keys to unlock a drawer the scraping i took didnt jibe but the weight i knew it was wrong as soon as i picked it up it was too heavy but where the hell is the file miranda it was too heavy just slightly too heavy and the patina its close but its not right its just not right even if youd miss that you couldnt possibly mistake the corrosion levels you cant mistake them babbling now she slammed the drawer shut unlocked another then another its not here the files arent here theyre missing fighting for calm she closed the drawer the pictures the notes the reports everything on the bronze david is missing you took them to what purpose he asked with what he considered saintly patience look if i could get in here and take a fake i could have taken anything i wanted what would be the point in going through this routine miranda i have to think just be quiet i have to think she pressed her hands to her mouth and paced logical be logical she ordered herself deal with the facts hed stolen the bronze and the bronze was fake what was the point in stealing a fake then bringing it back none none at all if it had been genuine why would he be here he wouldnt therefore the story hed told her however absurd was true shed tested it and agreed with his conclusions had she made a mistake oh god had she made a mistake no logic not emotion she reminded herself she made herself stop her erratic movements and stand perfectly still logic when properly applied was amazingly simple someone beat you to it she said quietly someone beat you to it and replaced it with a forgery she turned to him seeing by the considering look on his face that he was likely reaching the same conclusion well dr jones it looks like weve both gotten that kick in the ass he angled his head to study her what are we going to do about it chapter twelve miranda decided to accept that it was a day for abnormal behavior when she found herself sitting in a truck stop off route at six am their waitress brought them a pot of coffee two thick brown mugs and a pair of laminated menus what are we doing here ryan poured sniffed sipped then sighed now thats coffee boldari what are we doing here having breakfast he kicked back and studied the menu she took a deep breath its six oclock in the morning ive had a difficult night and im tired i have some serious thinking to do and i dont have time to sit in some truck stop trading witticisms with a thief so far you havent been that witty but as you said youve had a difficult night are you going to run into anyone you know here of course not exactly we need to eat and we need to talk he set his menu down and shot a smile at their waitress when she came over pad in hand ill go for the halfstack of hotcakes eggs over easy and side of bacon please you got it capn how bout you honey i resigned miranda squinted and scanned the menu in search of something nonlethal just the um oatmeal do you have skim milk for that ill see what i can do and be back to you in a jiff okay lets outline our situation ryan continued three years ago you acquired a small bronze statue of david my research indicates this came through your father from a private dig outside of rome your research is correct the majority of the finds were donated to the national museum in rome he brought the david home for the institute for study and authentication and display and you studied it you authenticated it yes who worked with you without my notes i cant be sure just try to picture it it was three years ago because her mind was fuzzy she tried the coffee it was like sipping lightning andrew of course she began he was very fond of that piece it appealed to him i think he might have done sketches of it my father was in and out of the lab checking the progress of the testing he was pleased with the results john carter she added rubbing an ache in the center of her forehead hes lab manager so hed have had access to it who else almost anyone working in the lab during that period it wasnt a priority project how many work in the lab anywhere from twelve to fifteen depending all of them have access to the files no she paused as their breakfasts were served not all the assistants and techs would have keys trust me miranda keys are overrated he flashed that smile again as he topped off their coffee well assume that anyone who worked in the lab had access to the files youll need to get a list of names from personnel will i really you want to find it youve got a threeyear time span he explained from the time you authenticated the piece until i relieved you of the forgery whoever replaced it had to have access to the original to make the copy the smartest simplest way to do that would be to make a silicon mold a wax reproduction from that i imagine you know all about forgeries she said with a sniff as she spooned up oatmeal only what a man in my field fields needs to know youd need the original to make the mold he continued so obviously unoffended she wondered why she bothered to snipe at him the most efficient way to do that would be to make it while the bronze was still in the lab once its displayed youve got to get around security and yours is pretty good thank you so much this isnt skim milk she complained frowning at the little pitcher the waitress had brought with the oatmeal live dangerously he dashed salt on his eggs heres how i see it someone in the lab at that time saw the way your tests were leaning its a nice little piece one a collector would pay a fair price for so this person maybe he has debts or hes pissed off at you or your family maybe hes just decided to try his luck he makes the mold some night its not a complicated process and hes already in a lab nothing easier if he doesnt know how to cast it himself he certainly knows someone who does more he knows how to make the bronze appear to be on the surface several centuries old when its done he switches the pieces likely just before its moved to display nobodys the wiser it couldnt have been done on impulse it takes time it takes planning im not saying it was impulse but it wouldnt have taken that much time either how long was the bronze in the lab i dont know for sure two weeks maybe three more than enough ryan gestured with a slice of bacon before biting it if i were you id ran tests on some of my other pieces others she didnt know why it hadnt occurred to her not when it hit her now with such force oh god he did it once and did it well enough to pull it off why not do it again dont look so devastated darling im going to help you help me she pressed her fingers to her gritty eyes why because i want that bronze after all i guaranteed it to my client she dropped her hands youre going to help me get it back so you can steal it again ive got a vested interest finish your breakfast weve got work to do he picked up his coffee and grinned at her partner partner the word made her shudder perhaps she was too tired to think clearly but at the moment she couldnt see her way to recovering her property without him hed used her she remembered as she unlocked the front door of her house now she would use him then she would see that he spent the next twenty years of his life taking group showers in a federal installation you expecting anyone today housekeeper cable guy appliance repairman no the cleaning company comes on tuesdays and fridays cleaning company he took off his jacket you wont get homey casseroles and sage advice from cleaning companies you need a housekeeper named mabel who wears a white bib apron and sensible shoes the cleaning company is efficient and unobtrusive too bad andrews left for work by now he noted by his watch it was eightfifteen what time does your assistant get in lori gets in by nine usually a bit before youll need to call her got her home number yes but give her a call tell her youre not going to make it in today of course im going in i have meetings shell cancel them he moved into the parlor and made himself at home by stacking kindling for a fire tell her to get copies of personnel records for the lab going back three years its the best place to start have her shoot them to your computer here he lighted the starter and within seconds the kindling was crackling she said nothing as he chose two logs from the woodbox and placed them on the flaming kindling with the efficiency of an eagle scout when he rose turned her smile was as sharp and unfriendly as an unsheathed blade is there anything else i can do honey youre going to have to take orders a bit more cheerfully somebodys got to be in charge you know and youre in charge thats right he crossed over to her took her by the shoulders i know a lot more about larceny than you do most people wouldnt consider that an attribute for leadership most people arent trying to catch a thief his gaze roamed down lingered on her mouth dont even think about it i never censor my thoughts it gives you ulcers we could enjoy this association a lot more if you were a little friendlier friendlier more flexible he drew her closer in certain areas she let her body bump lightly against his allowed her lashes to flutter such as well for starters he lowered his head drew in her scent anticipated that first taste and his breath whooshed out in a pained rush as her fist plowed into his stomach i told you to keep your hands off of me so you did with a slow nod he rubbed his gut another few inches to the south he thought and her fist would have unmanned him youve got a good solid punch dr jones be grateful i pulled it boldari though she hadnt not by an inch or youd be on your hands and knees whistling for air i take it we understand each other on this point perfectly make the call miranda and lets get to work she did what he asked because it made sense the only way to proceed was to begin and to begin you needed a starting point by ninethirty she was in her home office calling up data on her desktop the room was as efficient as her office at the institute if slightly cozier ryan had lighted a fire there as well though she didnt consider it cold enough to indulge in one flames crackled cheerfully in the stone hearth the latewinter sun beamed through the curtains hed swept back they sat hip to hip at her desk scanning names looks like you had an unusually large turnover about eighteen months ago he pointed out yes my mother revamped her lab in florence several staff members transferred there or moved from there to the institute im surprised you didnt jump at it at what a move to florence she shot the file to the printer a hard copy would mean she didnt have to sit next to him it wasnt an option andrew and i run the institute my mother runs standjo i see and he thought he did some friction between you and mama my family relationships are none of your concern more than some friction id say how about your father i beg your pardon are you daddys little girl she laughed before she could stop herself then rose to retrieve the printout ive never been anyones little girl thats too bad he said and meant it my family isnt the issue here she sat on the raspberrycolored love seat and tried to concentrate on the names that kept blurring in front of her tired eyes they could be yours is a familyrun business maybe someone took a shot at your family by taking the bronze your italians showing she said dryly and made him smile the irish are every bit as interested in revenge darling tell me about the people on the list john carter lab manager got his doctorate from duke hes worked at the institute for sixteen years oriental art is his primary interest no get personal is he married does he pay alimony gamble drink his lunch dress in womens clothes on saturday night dont be ridiculous she tried to sit up straight then gave in and curled up her legs hes married no divorces two children i think the oldest just started college takes a lot of money to raise kids send them to college he scanned across noted the annual salary he makes a decent living but decent doesnt satisfy everyone his wifes a lawyer and likely makes more than he does money isnt a problem for them moneys always a problem what kind of car does he drive i dont have any idea how does he dress she started to sigh but thought she saw what he was getting at old jackets and silly ties she began closing her eyes to try to bring her lab manager into focus no flash though his wife bought him a rolex for their twentieth anniversary she stifled a yawn and snuggled down a little farther into the cushions he wears the same shoes every day hush puppies when theyre ready to fall off his feet he buys another pair take a nap miranda im all right whos next she forced her eyes open oh elise my brothers exwife ugly divorce i dont imagine theyre ever pretty but she was very gentle with him she was johns assistant here then transferred to florence shes lab manager for my mother she and andrew met at the institute in fact i introduced them he fell like a tree they were married six months later she yawned again and didnt bother to stifle it how long did it last a couple of years they seemed very happy for most of it then it just started to fall apart what did she want snazzy clothes european vacations a big fancy house she wanted his attention miranda mumbled and pillowed her head on her hands she wanted him to stay sober and focused on their marriage its the jones curse we just cant do it were relationshipjinxed i have to rest my eyes a minute sure go ahead he went back to studying the list right now they were just names on a page to him he intended for them to be a great deal more before it was done he would know the intimate details bank balances vices habits and to that list he added three names andrew jones charles jones and elizabeth standfordjones he rose then bent down to slip her glasses off lay them on the table beside her she didnt look like an innocent young girl in sleep he decided but like an exhausted woman moving quietly he took the chenille throw from the back of the love seat and tossed it over her hed let her sleep an hour or two recharge her mind and her body somewhere inside her were the answers he was sure of it she was the link while she slept he made a call to new york there was no point in having a brother who was a genius with computers if you didnt use him once in a while patrick its ryan he eased back in the chair and watched miranda sleep ive got several things on my plate here and a little hacker job i dont have time to deal with interested he laughed yeah it pays church bells were ringing the music of them echoed over the redtiled roofs and out to the distant hills the air was warm the sky as blue as the inside of a wish but in the dank basement of the villa the shadows were thick she shivered once as she pried off the stair tread it was there she knew it was there waiting for her wood splintered as she hacked at it hurry hurry her breath began to wheeze in her lungs sweat dripped nastily down her back and her hands trembled as she reached for it drew it out of the dark and played her flashlight over the features uplifted arms generous breasts a seductive tumble of hair the bronze was glossy without the bluegreen patina of age she could trace her fingers over it and feel the chill of the metal then there was harpsong and the light laughter of a woman the eyes of the statue took on life and luster the bronze mouth smiled and said her name miranda she awoke with a jolt her heart galloping for a moment she would have sworn she smelled perfume floral and strong and could hear the faint echo of harp strings but it was the buzzer on the front door that sounded repeatedly and with some impatience shaken miranda tossed back the throw and hurried out of the room it was surprising enough to see ryan at the open front door but it was a shock to the heart to see her father standing on the doorstep father she cleared the sleep out of her voice and tried again hello i didnt know you were coming to maine just got in he was a tall man trim browned by the sun his hair was full and thick and shiny as polished steel it matched his trim beard and moustache and suited his narrow face his eyes the same deep blue as his daughters peered out of the lenses of wirerim glasses and studied ryan i see you have company i hope im not intruding sizing up the situation quickly ryan offered a hand dr jones what a pleasure rodney j pettebone im an associate of your daughters and a friend i hope just in from london he continued stepping back and drawing charles neatly inside he glanced toward the stairs where miranda continued to stand staring at him as if hed grown two heads mirandas been kind enough to give me a bit of her time while im here miranda dear he held out a hand and a ridiculously adoring smile she wasnt sure which baffled her more the puppy dog smile or the uppercrust british accent that was rolling off his tongue as if hed been born a royal pettebone charles frowned as miranda stood stiff and still as one of her bronzes rogers boy no hes my uncle uncle i didnt realize roger had siblings half brother clarence my father can i take your coat dr jones yes thank you miranda i was just at the institute i was told you werent feeling well today i was a headache nothing weve been caught darling ryan moved up the stairs to take her hand squeezing it hard enough to rub bone im sure your father will understand no miranda said definitely he wont its completely my fault dr jones i only have a few days in the country he accented this by kissing mirandas fingers lovingly im afraid i persuaded your daughter to take the day off shes helping me with my research on flemish art of the seventeenth century id be nowhere without her i see obvious disapproval flickered in charless eyes im afraid i was about to make some tea miranda interrupted neatly she needed a moment to realign her thoughts if youll excuse us father why dont you wait in the parlor it wont take long rodney youll give me a hand wont you love to he beamed a smile when she returned the vise squeeze on his hand have you lost your mind she hissed as she slammed through the kitchen door rodney j pettebone who the hell is that at the moment i am im not here remember he pinched her chin you gave my father the impression we were playing hooky for gods sake she grabbed the kettle from the stove and took it to the sink not only that but that we were spending the day playing pattycake pattycake he just couldnt resist it and wrapped his arms around her back to hug he didnt even mind the elbow in the ribs youre so cute miranda i am not cute and i am not happy with this ridiculous lie well i suppose i could have told him im the one who stole the bronze then we could explain to him how its a forgery and the institute is now hipdeep in insurance fraud somehow i think the fact that youre playing pattycake with some british twit is more palatable teeth clenched she warmed the teapot why a british twit for gods sake just came to me i thought he might be your type he smiled engagingly when she sent a withering look over her shoulder the point is miranda your fathers here hes been to the institute he obviously wants some answers you have to figure out just which answers to give him you dont think i know that do i look stupid not at all but id say youre an inherently honest person lying takes skill what you have to do here is give him everything you knew up until the point where i joined you in bed this morning i could have figured that out for myself rodney but her stomach was already busy tying itself into knots over the lie youve had less than three hours sleep youre sluggish where are your cups he reached into a cupboard no dont use the everyday she waved an absent hand get the good china out of the breakfront in the dining room he lifted his brows good china was for company not for family it gave him another insight into miranda jones ill get two i believe rodney perceives your father wants to have a private chat with you coward she muttered she arranged the pot the cups the saucers meticulously on the tray and tried not to be annoyed that ryan had gone up the back steps and left her to deal with it alone she squared her shoulders lifted the tray and carried it out to the parlor where her father stood in front of the fireplace reading from a small leather notebook he was so handsome was all she could think tall and straight and tanned his hair shining when she was very young shed thought he looked like a picture out of a fairy tale not a prince or a knight but a wizard so wise and dignified shed so desperately wanted him to love her to give her piggyback rides and cuddle her in his lap to tuck the blankets around her at night and tell her foolish stories instead shed had to settle for a mild and often absent kind of affection no one had ever given her piggyback rides or told her foolish stories she sighed the sorrow of that away and continued into the room i asked rodney to give us a few minutes alone she began i imagine you want to talk to me about the burglary yes i do its very upsetting miranda yes were all very upset she set the tray down settled into a chair and poured out as she had been taught the police are investigating we have hopes to recover the bronze in the meantime the publicity is damaging for the institute your mother is distressed and ive had to leave my project at a very key time to come here there was no reason for you to come hands steady she held out his cup everythings being done that can be done obviously our security is not at an acceptable level your brother is responsible for that this isnt andrews fault we put the institute in his hands and yours he reminded her and idly sipped his tea hes doing a marvelous job class attendance is up ten percent gate receipts have increased the quality of our acquisitions over the past five years has been astonishing oh and it galled so to have to defend and justify when the man across from her had walked away from the responsibilities of the institute as easily as he had the responsibilities of family the institute was never one of your priorities she said it mildly knowing he would only tune out anger you preferred fieldwork andrew and i have put all our time and energy into it and now we have our first theft in more than a generation it cant be overlooked miranda no but the time and sweat and work and the improvements weve made they can be overlooked no ones faulting your enthusiasm he waved it aside however this must be dealt with and with the negative publicity from your misstep in florence added to it it leaves us in a difficult position my misstep she murmured how like him to use some limp euphemism for a crisis i did everything i was required to do in florence everything when she felt the emotion spurting up she swallowed it and met him on the dispassionate level he expected if i could see the results of the retesting i could analyze my own results and determine where the mistakes were made thats something you have to take up with your mother though i can tell you shes very displeased if the press hadnt been notified i never talked to the press she rose now unable to sit unable to pretend she was calm i never discussed the dark lady with anyone outside of the lab damn it why would i he paused a moment set his teacup aside he hated confrontations disliked messy emotions that interfered with smooth production he was well aware that there were floods of those messy emotions simmering inside his daughter hed never been able to understand where they came from i believe you and to be accused what i believe you while you may be headstrong and often wrongminded in my opinion ive never known you to be dishonest if you tell me you didnt speak to the press about this matter then i believe you i the back of her throat burned thank you it hardly changes the situation however the publicity must be downplayed through circumstances youre at the center of the storm so to speak your mother and i believe it would be best if you took an extended leave the tears that had swum into her eyes dried up ive already discussed that with her and ive told her i wont hide from this ive done nothing what youve done or havent done isnt the issue until both of these matters are resolved your presence at the institute is detrimental he brushed off the knees of his slacks then stood starting today youre to take a month personal leave if necessary you may go in clear up any pending business but it would be best if you do that from here within the next fortyeight hours you might as well paint a g for guilty on my forehead youre overreacting as usual and youre walking away as usual well i know where i stand alone though it was humiliating she tried one last time once just once couldnt you take my side this isnt a matter of sides miranda and its not a personal attack this is whats best for everyone involved and for both the institute and standjo it hurts me he cleared his throat and avoided her eyes im sure once you have time to think it through youll agree this is the most logical course to take ill be at the regency until tomorrow if you need to reach me ive never been able to reach you she said quietly ill get your coat because he felt some regret he followed her into the foyer you should take this time do a little traveling get some sun perhaps your ah young man would join you my what she took his coat out of the closet then glanced up the stairs and began to laugh oh sure she had to wipe at her eyes even as she recognized the jittery onset of hysteria i bet old rodney would just love to go traveling with me she waved her father out of the house then sat on the bottom step and laughed like a loon until she started to weep chapter thirteen a man who had three sisters knew all about womens tears there were the slow rather lovely ones that could slide down a female cheek like small liquid diamonds and reduce a man to begging there were hot angry ones that spurted out of a womans eyes like clear fire and induced a wise man to run for cover and there were those that were hidden so deep in the heart that when they broke loose and stormed free they were a deluge of pain beyond any mans comfort so he let her be let her curl into herself on the bottom step while those heartborn tears raged he knew that the hurt that spawned such a flood closed her off all he could do was give her privacy and wait when those harsh ripping sobs quieted he walked down the hall opened the closet and pushed through until he found a jacket here he held it out to her lets get some air she stared at him out of swollen and confused eyes shed simply forgotten he was there what lets get some air he repeated and because she was still largely helpless he pulled her to her feet he slid the jacket over her arms turned her and efficiently fastened the buttons id prefer to be alone she tried for coolness but her throat was still raw and she fell far short youve been alone long enough he grabbed his own jacket shrugged it on then pulled her out the front door the air was bracing the sun strong enough to sting her sore eyes humiliation was beginning to seep through tears were useless enough she thought but at least when they were private no one saw your control fail this is a great spot he said conversationally he kept her hand in his even when her fingers flexed for release privacy a kickass view the smell of the sea just outside the door grounds could use some work the joneses he concluded didnt spend enough time outside across the tumbling lawn there were a pair of grand old trees that begged to have a hammock stretched between them he doubted miranda had ever explored the miracles of a hammock in the shade on a summer afternoon there were shrubs ragged from winter that he imagined bloomed beautifully and without any care in the spring there were bare patches in the lawn crying out to be reseeded and fed but the fact that there was grass shrubs old trees and an impressive windbreak of pines on the north side indicated that someone had cared enough once to plant or at least to hire a staff to plant he might have been an urbanite through and through but he appreciated rural atmosphere youre not taking care of what you have here you surprise me miranda id think a woman with your practical nature would insist on maintaining her property and guarding a legacy like this its a house yeah it is it should be a home did you grow up here no her head felt stuffy and thick from the weeping she wanted to go back inside take some aspirin lie down in a dark room but she didnt have quite enough strength worked up to resist when he pulled her along the cliff path it was my grandmothers makes more sense i couldnt see your father choosing to live here as an adult wouldnt suit him at all you dont know my father sure i do the wind whipped circling them as they climbed centuries of its constant stroking had worn the rocks here made them smooth rounded they glowed like pewter in the sunlight hes pompous hes arrogant he has the kind of narrow focus that likely makes him brilliant in his field and an inconsiderate human being he didnt hear you he added when theyd reached the flattened ledge that speared out over the sea because he doesnt know how to listen obviously you do now she jerked her hand from his and defensively wrapped her arms around her body i dont know why it should surprise me that someone who steals other peoples property for a living should stoop to eavesdropping on private conversations i dont know either but the real point is youve been left to twist in the wind now what are you going to do about it what can i do whatever authority i might have at the institute it still comes down to the fact that i work for them ive been temporarily relieved of my duties and thats that that if you have any spine is never that until its the way you want it you dont know anything about it she whirled on him and the selfpity that had been in her eyes flashed away into fury they run the show and they always have whatever gloss you put on it i do what im told i manage the institute with andrew because neither of them wanted to bother with the daytoday business of it and weve always known that they could pull that particular rug out from under us whenever they chose now they have and youre going to tolerate being dumped on your ass this way kick back miranda he grabbed a handful of her hair while the wind tossed the rest of the hot red curls madly show them what youre made of the institute isnt the only place you can shine do you think theres any major museum or lab that would have me after this the fiesole bronze has ruined me i wish to god id never seen it defeated she sat on the rocks staring out at the point where the lighthouse stood like white marble against a hard blue sky so start your own lab thats a pipe dream a lot of people said the same thing to me when i wanted to open the gallery in new york he sat beside her crosslegged she let out a short laugh the difference here might just be that i dont intend to steal to outfit a business we all do what we do best he said lightly he took out a cigar cupped his hands around the tip as he lighted it you have contacts dont you youve got a brain youve got money ive got a brain and money the contacts she moved her shoulders i cant count on them now i love my work she heard herself say i love the structure of it the discovery most people think of science as a series of steps forged in concrete but its not its a puzzle and not all of the pieces will ever be firmly in place when youre able to fit some of them together to see an answer its thrilling i dont want to lose that you wont unless you give up the minute i saw the fiesole bronze understood what the project was i was totally entranced in the possibilities i knew it was part ego but who cared id authenticate it id prove how smart and clever i was and my mother would applaud the way mothers do watching their children on stage at a school play with sentimental enthusiasm and pride she dropped her head on her knees thats pathetic no its not most of us go through adulthood performing for our parents and hoping for that applause she turned her head to study him do you i still remember the opening of my new york gallery the moment my parents walked inside my father in his good suit the one he always wore to weddings and funerals and my mother in a new blue dress and her hair ruthlessly styled from a trip to bettys salon i remember the look on their faces sentimental enthusiasm and pride he laughed a little and not a little bit of shock it mattered to me turning her head she rested her chin on her hands and looked out to sea again where the waves broke strong and white and cold i remember the look on my mothers face when she fired me from the fiesole project she sighed i would have handled disappointment or regret better than that iceedged disdain forget the bronze how can i its what started this whole downhill slide if i could just go back and see where i went wrong she pressed her fingers to her eyes test it again like i did the david slowly she lowered her hands her palms had gone damp like the david she murmured oh my god she sprang to her feet so quickly for one wild moment ryan feared she meant to jump hold on he took a firm hold of her hand as he got to his feet youre a little too close to the edge to suit me its like the david she shoved away from him then grabbed his jacket i followed procedure step by step i know what i had in my hands i know it she pushed him again spun away with a clatter of boots on rock i did everything right i detailed everything the measurements the formulas the corrosion levels i had all the facts all the answers someone switched it switched it like the david she rapped a fist on his chest as if to knock the truth into him just like the david what pontis lab had was a forgery but it wasnt the same bronze it was a copy it had to be a copy thats a pretty big leap dr jones and the possibilities swam like fine wine in his head interesting it fits it makes sense its the only thing that makes sense why he lifted his eyebrows why isnt it more logical that you made a mistake because i didnt oh i cant believe i let this cloud what i know she pulled her hands through her hair pressing her fists to the side of her head i wasnt thinking clearly when youre told youre wrong often enough strongly enough you believe it even when you arent wrong she began to walk in those long purposeful strides letting the wind clear her head letting her blood bubble id have gone on believing it if it hadnt been for the david good thing i stole it she slanted a look at him he was matching his pace to hers and appeared to be enjoying a casual walk on a breezy afternoon apparently she muttered why that piece why did you steal that particular piece i told you i had a client who his lips curved really miranda some things are sacred they could be connected my david and your lady thats reaching my david and my lady and its not that long a reach theyre both bronzes both renaissance works standjo and the institute are connected and i worked on both those are facts both were genuine both were replaced by copies and those are speculations not facts its an educated and logical theory she corrected and the basis for a preliminary conclusion ive known this client for several years believe me he isnt interested in complicated plots and schemes he simply sees something he wants puts in an order if i think its doable i do it we keep it simple simple it was an attitude she was grateful she would never understand and he added he would hardly have commissioned me to steal a forgery her brow creased at that i still believe whoever replaced the david replaced the dark lady ill agree its a definite and intriguing possibility id be able to solidify that conclusion if i was able to examine both pieces and compare them okay okay what lets do it she stopped at the base of the lighthouse where the shale crunched under her feet do what compare them we have one its just a matter of getting the other stealing it dont be ridiculous he grabbed her arm as she turned away you want to know the truth dont you yes i want the truth but im not flying to italy breaking into a government facility and stealing a worthless copy no reason we cant take something worthwhile while were there just a thought he added when her mouth dropped open if youre right and we prove it youll more than salvage your reputation youll make it it was impossible insane it couldnt be done but she saw the gleam in his eye and wondered why would you bother what would you get out of it if youre right it brings me a step closer to the original david i have my reputation to salvage too and if she was right he thought and the dark lady was real hed be a step closer to that as well hed find her what a marvelous addition she would make to his private collection im not breaking the law you already are youre standing here with me arent you youre an accessory after the fact dr jones he swung his arm companionably over her shoulder i didnt hold a gun to your head or a knife to your back you took me in past your security he continued walking back toward the house youve spent the day with me fully aware im holding stolen property youre already in he gave her a friendly kiss on top of the head might as well see it through he checked his watch calculated you go up and pack well need to swing through new york first i have some things to tidy up there and i need to pick up some clothes and tools tools she pushed her hair away from her face better not to know she decided i cant just fly off to italy i have to talk to andrew i have to explain leave him a note ryan suggested and pulled open the back door make it brief and tell him youre going away for a couple of weeks leave it at that and you leave him out of it if the cops get too nosey the police if i leave this way before the investigation is complete they might think i was involved adds to the excitement doesnt it better not use your phone he murmured always a possibility of the records being checked ill get mine out of my bag i need to call my cousin joey her head was reeling your cousin joey hes a travel agent go pack he repeated hell get us on the first flight out dont forget your passport and your laptop well want to finish going through those personnel files she tried a deep breath anything else i should bring along an appetite he pulled his phone out of his bag we should be in new york in time for dinner youre going to love my mothers linguine it was nearly six before andrew managed to get home hed tried to call miranda half a dozen times but had only reached their answering machine he wasnt certain what shape hed find her in manic with temper or desolate with hurt he hoped he was prepared to deal with either or both but all he found was a note on the refrigerator andrew im sure youre aware ive been ordered to take a leave of absence from the institute im sorry to leave you in the lurch at a time like this i dont want to say i dont have a choice so ill say im making the only one that works for me ill be gone for a couple of weeks please dont worry ill be in touch when i can dont forget to take out the trash theres enough roast left over from sunday to keep you going for another meal or two see that you eat love miranda shit he yanked the note free and read it through again where are you chapter fourteen i dont see why we didnt just fly to florence miranda was well past second thoughts and into third thoughts by the time ryan took the wheel of a natty little bmw and navigated out of la guardia if were going to do something this insane theres no point in taking a detour it isnt a detour its a scheduled stop i need my things you could have bought clothes in italy i probably will if the italians dressed the world it would be a much more attractive place however there are certain things i need that cant always be easily bought in the retail market your tools she muttered burglary tools among others fine fine she shifted in her seat drummed her fingers on her knee somehow she had to accept the fact that she was now working with a criminal a thief who by definition was without integrity without his help she saw no way she would ever see the bronze again or the forgery and there was a forgery she assured herself it was a logical theory one that required more data and study in order to be proven if she swallowed her pride and took the theory to her mother the idea nearly made miranda laugh elizabeth would dismiss it and her daughter in a snap putting it down to arrogance stubbornness and a bit of desperation and not entirely without cause miranda admitted the only one who was willing to listen to explore the possibility was a professional thief who was certainly working toward his own ends and expected her to hand over the donatello venus as a consultant fee well they would see about that he was a factor in the equation she reminded herself nothing more finding and authenticating the dark lady was more important than the formula she used to gain that end theres no reason to go into brooklyn sure there is ryan thought he had a pretty good idea what was running around in that admirable brain of hers she had a very expressive face when she didnt know anyone was paying attention to her i miss my mothers cooking he beamed at her and zipped around a poky sedan it was so easy to read her she was hating every minute of this juggling the pros and cons in her mind to try to find full justification for the choice shed made and i have a couple of things to straighten out familywise before i go to italy my sisters going to want shoes he muttered she always wants shoes shes addicted to ferragamo you steal shoes for your sister please genuinely insulted he scowled at traffic im not a shoplifter excuse me but stealing is stealing his scarred eyebrow arched wickedly not by a long shot and theres no reason for me to go to brooklyn why dont you just drop me off at whatever hotel im staying in first youre not staying in a hotel youre staying with me her head whipped around her eyes narrowed i certainly am not and second youre going to brooklyn because as you appear to have forgotten were joined at the hip until this is finished where i go you go dr jones thats ridiculous and inconvenient she needed time alone time completely to herself in order to put everything down on paper in an orderly fashion to weigh and consider he hadnt given her time to think you said yourself im too deeply involved to do anything but cooperate if you dont trust me its only going to complicate matters trusting you would complicate matters he corrected your problem is youve got a conscience its going to kick in from time to time and tempt you to call some cop and confess all he reached over to pat her hand just consider me the bad angel on your shoulder kicking the good angel in the face whenever he starts spouting about honesty and truth im not staying with you i have no intention of sleeping with you now youve done it whats the point of living the laughter in his voice put her teeth on edge so that she had no choice but to speak through them you know very well you want me to sleep with you its been my lifelong dream and now its crushed i dont know how im going to go on i despise you she hissed it out and when he laughed again she did her ego and her temper the favor of staring out the side window and ignoring him for the rest of the drive she didnt know what shed expected but it wasnt the pretty twolevel house with yellow trim in a quiet neighborhood you grew up here here no he smiled at the shock in her voice he imagined shed expected him to take her to some nasty little slum where the sound of raised voices was as pervasive as the smell of garlic and garbage the family moved here about ten years ago come on theyre expecting us and mamas likely got some antipasto ready what do you mean expecting i called to let her know we were coming you called who am i supposed to be thats a question everyone has to decide for themselves what did you tell her miranda demanded and clung to the handle as he leaned across to open her door that i was bringing a woman home to dinner he stayed where he was a moment his body angled and pressed to hers his face close dont be shy theyre very easy people im not shy but there was the faintly sick sensation in her stomach she experienced whenever she had to meet new people on a social level in this case she told herself such things were absurd i just want to know how youve explained stop that she demanded when his gaze lowered and lingered on her mouth hmm he really wanted to take a slow tasty bite of that stubborn bottom lip sorry i was distracted you smell interesting dr jones the moment called for action and movement and not the ridiculous fantasy that leaped into her brain of grabbing two handfuls of his hair and yanking his mouth to hers instead she slapped one hand on his chest yanked the door open with the other and scooted out he chuckled a little which helped relieve the ball of tension that had gathered low in his gut and climbed out the opposite side hey remo the big brown dog whod been sleeping in the yard uncurled himself let out one bark that echoed like a cannon blast then jumped lovingly on ryan i thought you were going to learn some manners grinning he scratched the delighted dogs ears what happened to obedience school you flunked out again didnt you ryan asked as they headed toward the door as if avoiding the question the dog slid his eyes to the side and gazed at miranda his tongue lolled out in a canine grin not afraid of dogs are you no i like them she replied as ryan pushed open the front door through it emerged the sound of the evening news voices male and female raised in what appeared to be a bitter and violent argument delicious aroma of roasted garlic and spices and a large spotted cat who dashed for freedom and began an immediate war with the dog home sweet home ryan murmured and pulled her into the melee if you cant behave like a decent human being i dont want you to speak to any of my friends ever again all i did was mention that if she had some really basic plastic surgery she would improve her looks her selfesteem and her sex life youre a pig patrick yeah well your friend has a nose like a tail fin on a fiftyseven chevy not only a pig but a shallow superficial asshole on top of it im trying to hear the news here take it outside until the sports are over for sweet christs sake this miranda said in prim and precise tones is obviously a bad time no this is normal ryan assured her and dragged her into the spacious cluttered and noisy living room hey ry the man boy really miranda noted as he turned with a grin nearly as lethal as ryans took a few gangly strides and punched ryan in the shoulder a sign miranda assumed of affection his dark hair was curly his eyes a glinting golden brown in a face that miranda supposed had caused the girls in his high school to sigh into their pillows at night pat with equal affection ryan caught him in a headlock for the introduction my baby brother patrick miranda jones behave he warned patrick sure hey miranda hows it going before she could answer the young woman patrick had been arguing with stepped up she gave miranda a long measuring look as she slipped her arms around ryan and rubbed cheeks missed you hello miranda im colleen she didnt offer a hand but kept her arms proprietarily around her brother she had the onyx and gold good looks of the boldaris and a sharp assessing gleam in her eyes its nice to meet you both miranda offered colleen a cool smile and let it warm a little for patrick you gonna leave the girl at the door all day or you bringing her in so i can get a look at her this boomed out of the living room and had all three boldaris grinning im bringing her in papa lets have your coat she gave it up with some reluctance heard the door close at her back with the enthusiasm of a woman hearing a cell snap shut giorgio boldari rose out of his easy chair and politely muted the television ryan hadnt gotten his build from his father miranda decided the man who studied her was short stocky and sported a graying moustache over his unsmiling lips he wore khakis a neatly pressed shirt scuffed nikes and a medallion of the madonna on a chain around his neck no one spoke mirandas ears began to buzz with nerves youre not italian are you he asked at length no im not giorgio pursed his lips let his gaze skim over her face hair like that you probably got some irish in you my fathers mother was a riley miranda fought back the urge to shift her feet and lifted a brow instead he smiled then fast and bright as lightning this ones got a classy look to her ry get the girl some wine for gods sake colleen you gonna leave her standing here thirsty yankees blew it today you follow baseball no i ought to its good for you then he turned to his son and enveloped ryan in a fierce bear hug you should stay home more im working on it mama in the kitchen yeah yeah maureen the shout could have cracked concrete ryans here with his girl shes a looker too he sent miranda a wink how come you dont like baseball i dont dislike it in particular i just ryan played third base hot corner he tell you that no i carried a four twentyfive batting average his senior year nobody stole more bases than my ryan miranda shifted her eyes to ryan i bet we got trophies ry you show your girl your trophies later papa colleen and patrick went back to arguing in hissy undertones as she brought in a tray of glasses the dog was barking incessantly at the front door and giorgio shouted again for his wife to come the hell out and meet ryans girl at least miranda thought she wasnt going to be required to make a great deal of conversation these people simply took over carrying on as if there was no stranger in the house the house itself was cluttered full of light and art she saw ryan had been right about his mothers watercolors the three dreamy new york street scenes on the wall were lovely there was an odd and intriguing tall tangle of black metal most likely his fathers work behind a couch with thick blue cushions peppered with dog hair there were trinkets and framed snapshots everywhere a ratty knotted rope on the floor that showed evidence of remos teeth and a scatter of newspapers and magazines on the coffee table no one scurried to pick them up to make excuses for the clutter welcome to the boldaris with a twinkle in his eye ryan took two glasses off the tray handed her one and toasted your life may never be the same she was beginning to believe him even as she took the first sip a woman hurried into the room wiping her hands on an apron splattered with sauce maureen boldari was a good three inches taller than her husband slim as a willow and possessed of striking blackirish looks her glossy hair waved attractively around her strong face and vivid blue eyes sparkled with pleasure as she opened her arms theres my boy come kiss your mama ryan obeyed lifting her off her feet as he did so and making her let loose a rich hearty laugh patrick colleen stop that bickering before i give the pair of you the back of my hand weve got company giorgio where are your manners turn that television off remo stop that barking and as it was all done quickly and without comment miranda got a solid clue as to who ran the household ryan introduce me to your young lady yes maam maureen boldari the love of my life meet dr miranda jones pretty isnt she mama yes she is welcome to our home miranda its very kind of you to have me mrs boldari good manners maureen said with a brisk nod patrick bring out the antipasto and well get acquainted ryan show miranda where she can freshen up ryan led her out of the living room down a short hall and into a small pink and white powder room she grabbed his shirt in her fist you told them we were involved we are involved you know what i mean she said in the same furious whisper your girl thats ridiculous i didnt tell them you were my girl because it amused him he lowered his voice to a whisper as well im thirtytwo they want me married and making babies they assume why didnt you make it clear we were business associates youre beautiful youre single youre female they wouldnt have believed we were just business associates whats the big deal for one your sister looked at me as if shed pop me in the nose if i didnt adore you enough for another its just deceitful not that such niceties as honesty matter to you im always honest with my family sure you are undoubtedly your mother is very proud of her son the thief of course she is she stuttered losing whatever it was shed planned to say are you trying to convince me that she knows you steal sure she does does she look stupid he shook his head i dont lie to my mother now hurry up in there will you he gave her a nudge into the powder room when she only gaped at him im hungry he wasnt hungry for long no one could have been there was in short order enough food being offered to feed a small and starving third world army because there was company they had the meal in the dining room with its attractive striped walls and handsome mahogany table there was good china the glint of crystal and enough wine to float a battleship conversation never lagged in fact if you didnt heave your words out fast and furiously there was no room for them when she noted that the level of her wineglass rose back up to the rim whenever she sipped miranda left it alone and concentrated on the food ryan had been right about one thing she loved his mothers linguine she was brought uptodate on the family michael the second son ran boldari gallery san francisco he was married to his college sweetheart and had two children the last tidbit of info was delivered by the proud grandpa with a meaningful look at ryan and an eyebrowwiggling grin for miranda you like children maureen asked her um yes in a vague and cautious manner miranda thought center your life children do give you real purpose and celebrate the love that brings a man and woman together maureen passed a basket of irresistible bread to miranda im sure youre right take my mary jo and miranda was treated to the virtues of her eldest daughter who owned a boutique in manhattan and had three children then there was bridgit whod taken a sabbatical from a career in publishing in order to stay at home with her baby daughter you must be very proud of them theyre good kids educated she beamed at ryan as she said it all my children went to college patricks a freshman he knows all about computers really it seemed a much safer topic so miranda smiled at him its a fascinating field its like playing games for a living oh ry ive got some of the data you asked me to access great what data colleen stopped eyeing miranda and narrowed her eyes suspiciously at ryan just cleaning up a little business baby he gave her hand a casual squeeze mama you outdid yourself tonight dont change the subject ryan colleen maureens voice was mild with honed steel beneath we have company help me clear the table i made tiramisu your favorite ry were going to discuss this colleen said between her teeth but rose obediently to clear plates let me help miranda started to rise and was waved back by her hostess guests dont clear you sit dont worry about colleen patrick said the moment she was out of earshot well handle her shut up patrick though ryan smiled over at miranda she caught a glint of discomfort in his eyes i dont think we mentioned what colleen does no you didnt shes a cop with a sigh he rose ill give them a hand with the coffee oh wonderful blindly miranda reached for her wine she kept out of the way obeying the house rules by retiring to the living room after coffee and dessert since giorgio was busy grilling her on what she did why she wasnt married her mind was well engaged no one seemed bothered by the angry words coming out of the kitchen when colleen stormed out patrick only rolled his eyes here she goes again you promised ry you gave your word im keeping it obviously frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair im just finishing what i started baby then its done and what does she have to do with it she jabbed a finger at miranda colleen its not polite to point giorgio told her oh hell and tossing something uncomplimentary in italian over her shoulder colleen strode out of the house damn it ryan blew out a breath offered miranda an apologetic smile be right back um she sat another moment nearly squirming as giorgio and patrick stared at her ill go see if mrs boldari needs any help after all she escaped into what she hoped was some area of sanity the kitchen was big and airy and carried the warm friendly smells of the meal with its bright counters and sparkling white floor it was a picture out of a grocery store checkout magazine dozens of incomprehensible pictures executed with crayon crowded the front of the refrigerator there was a bowl of fresh fruit on the table and cafe curtains at the windows normality miranda decided i hoped youd bend your rule and let me give you a hand sit maureen gestured to the table have coffee theyll finish arguing soon i should wallop them both for making a scene in front of company my kids she turned to an efficient home cappuccino maker and began to fix a cup they got passion good brains and wide stubborn streaks take after their father do you think so i see a lot of you in ryan it was exactly the right thing to say maureens eyes turned warm and loving the firstborn no matter how many you have theres only one first you love them all so much its a wonder your heart doesnt break from it but theres only one first youll know one day hmmm miranda declined to comment as maureen frothed the milk it must be a little worrying having a child go into law enforcement colleen she knows what she wants never goes any way but forward that girl one day shell be a captain youll see shes mad at ryan she continued conversationally as she set the cup in front of miranda hell charm her out of it im sure he will hes very charming girls always chased after him but my ryans very particular hes got his eye on you it was time miranda decided to put the record straight mrs boldari i dont think ryan was completely clear about this were just business associates you think so maureen said placidly and turned back to load the dishwasher he doesnt look good enough to you he looks very good but maybe because he comes from brooklyn and not park avenue he isnt classy enough for a phd no not at all its simply its simply that were business associates he doesnt kiss you he i for gods sake was all she could think and filled her mouth with hot foamy coffee to shut it up i thought so id worry about that boy if he didnt kiss a woman who looks like you he likes brains too hes not shallow but maybe you dont like the way he kisses it matters she added while miranda stared into her coffee a man doesnt get your blood up with his kisses you arent going to have a happy relationship sex is important anybody who says different never had good sex oh my was all she could think of what you dont think i know my boy has sex you think i have brain damage i havent had sex with ryan why not why not miranda could only blink as maureen tidily closed the dishwasher and began to fill the sink to wash the pots i barely know him she couldnt believe she was having this conversation i dont just have sex with every attractive man i meet good i dont want my boy going around with easy women mrs boldari she wondered if it would help to bang her head on the table were not going around our relationship is strictly a business one ryan doesnt bring business associates home to eat my linguine since she had no comment for that miranda shut her mouth again she glanced up with relief as ryan and his sister came through the archway as expected hed charmed colleen out of her snit the two of them miranda noted were smiling their arms around each others waists for the first time colleen sent miranda a friendly look sorry about that just a few things we needed to straighten out no problem so colleen sat at the table rested her feet on the opposite chair do you have any solid feeling for who might have stolen the original bronze miranda just blinked at her excuse me ryan filled me in maybe i can help you sort it out six months out of the academy and shes sherlock holmes ryan bent over kissed her hair want me to dry the pots mama no its patricks turn she glanced around somebody steal something from your lady i did he said easily and joined the women at the table it turned out to be a forgery were straightening it out good wait wait just a minute miranda lifted both hands good is that what you said good youre telling me you know your sons a thief what am i a moron maureen neatly wiped her hands before fisting them on her hips of course i know i told you she knew ryan pointed out yes but she simply hadnt believed it baffled she shifted studied maureens pretty face and thats just dandy with you thats just fine and you she pointed at colleen youre a police officer your brother steals how do you resolve the two hes retiring colleen lifted her shoulders a little behind schedule i dont understand she pressed her lifted hands to her head youre his mother how can you encourage him to break the law encourage maureen gave that rich laugh again who had to encourage him deciding to give her guest the courtesy of an explanation she set down her dishcloth do you believe in god what what does that have to do with this dont argue just answer do you believe in god beside miranda ryan grinned she couldnt know it but when his mother used that tone it meant shed decided she liked you all right yes when god gives you a gift its a sin not to use it miranda closed her eyes a moment youre saying that god gave ryan a talent and that it would be a sin for him not to break into buildings and steal god couldve given him a gift for music like he did my mary jo who plays the piano like an angel god gave him this gift instead mrs boldari dont argue ryan murmured youll just give yourself a headache she scowled at him mrs boldari she tried again i appreciate your loyalty to your son but do you know what he does with this gift yes as a matter of fact he buys this house for his family because the old neighborhood isnt safe anymore she opened her arms to encompass the lovely kitchen then wagged a finger he sees that his brothers and sisters get a college education none of this would be however hard giorgio and i worked you cant send six kids to college on teachers salaries god gave him a gift she said again and rested her hand on ryans shoulder you going to argue with god ryan was right again she did have a headache she nursed it with silence during the drive to manhattan she wasnt sure which baffled her more just then the stand maureen had taken to defend her sons choice of career or the warm hugs shed been given by each family member before they left ryan let her have her quiet when he pulled up in front of his building he gave the keys to the doorman hi jack arrange to have this rental returned to the airport would you and send dr joness bags theyre in the trunk up to my apartment sure thing mr boldari welcome home the twenty that slipped discreetly from palm to palm had jacks smile widening have a nice evening i dont understand your life miranda began as he escorted her through an elegant lobby decked out with glossy antiques and attractive art thats all right i dont understand yours either he stepped into an elevator and used a key to access the top floor you must be worn out jackll have your things up in a minute you can get comfortable your mother wanted to know why i wasnt having sex with you i wonder the same thing all the time the elevator opened into a spacious living area done in bold blues and greens wide terrace windows offered a pricey view of new york hed obviously indulged himself in his affection for the finer things she decided with a quick scan art deco lamps chippendale tables baccarat crystal she wondered how much of it hed stolen all purchased legitimately he said reading her perfectly well that erté lamp was hot but i couldnt resist it want a nightcap no no i dont the floor was glossy honeytoned wood accented with one of the most beautiful orientals shed ever seen art on the walls ranged from a misty corot to a soft lovely watercolor of what she recognized as the irish countryside your mothers work yes shes good isnt she very confusing but very good she likes you with a sigh miranda wandered to the window i like her too for some reason her own mother had never hugged her that way with a good solid squeeze that communicated approval and affection her own father had never grinned at her with that lively twinkle in his eyes as ryans father had she wondered how despite it all his family had seemed so much more blissfully normal than her own thatll be your bags when the buzzer sounded ryan moved over to check the intercom then released the elevator the delivery was made quickly with another exchange of bills when the elevator whispered closed again ryan left her bags where they were and crossed to her youre tense he murmured after he began kneading her shoulders id hoped an evening with my family would relax you how does anyone relax with all that energy around them she arched back against his hands before she could stop herself you must have had an interesting childhood i had a terrific childhood far from the privileged one shed known and from all appearances a great deal more loving long day he murmured and because he knew she was beginning to relax bent down to nibble at her neck yes very dont i was about to work my way aroundhere he turned her covered her mouth with his and stole her breath his mother had said kisses should get the blood up hers was up bubbling close under her skin swimming in her head pumping much too hard and fast through her veins dont she said again but it was a weak protest easily ignored by both of them he could feel the need simmering inside her it didnt matter that it wasnt for him in particular he wouldnt let it matter he wanted her wanted to be the one to crack through the shield and discover the volcano he was sure was inside of her something about her pulled at him with a slow and steady strength that refused to be ignored let me touch you even as he asked he took his hands running up her sides to skim her breasts let me have you oh yes the sigh of it circled around in her cloudy brain as if searching for a place to land touch me have me god please dont let me think no it was a shock to hear herself say it to realize she was pulling away even as she yearned to strain closer this wont work it was working just fine for me he hooked his hand in the waistband of her trousers and gave her a yank and id say it was working just fine for you too i wont be seduced ryan she concentrated on the annoyed flash in his eyes and ignored the screams of her own system for the release his mouth had promised i wont be had if were going to finish this arrangement successfully it has to be on a business level and only that level i dont like that level thats the deal and its nonnegotiable your tongue ever get frostbite when you use that tone he jammed his hands in his pocket as she studied him balefully okay dr jones its all business ill show you your room he walked back to pick up her suitcases and carried them up a fluid curve of metal stairs with a soft green patina then setting her bags down just inside the door he nodded you should find this comfortable enough and private were booked out tomorrow evening thatll give me time to tie up a few loose ends here sleep well he added and shut the door in her face before she had the chance to shut it in his she started to shrug then her eyes widened when she heard the click of a lock in one leap she was at the door rattling the knob you son of a bitch you cant lock me in here an ounce of prevention dr jones his voice was soft as silk through the door just to make sure you stay where i put you until tomorrow he walked away whistling while she pounded and promised vengeance chapter fifteen though she knew it was a useless gesture miranda locked the door to the bathroom in the morning she showered quickly struggling to keep one eye on the door in case ryan decided he wanted to play games she wouldnt have put it past him once she was safely bundled into her robe she took her time she wanted to be completely dressed with a confident shield of makeup and tidily groomed hair before she saw him there would be she determined no cozy little breakfast chat in pajamas of course he had to let her out first the bastard let me out of here boldari she called as she rapped smartly on the door her answer was silence incensed she knocked harder shouted louder and began to add inventive threats kidnapping she decided shed add kidnapping to the list of charges against him she hoped the other inmates at whatever federal facility he spent the rest of his life in rejoiced in torturing him frustrated she started to rattle the knob it turned smoothly under her hand and caused her angry flush to deepen into embarrassment she stepped out glanced cautiously down the hallway doors were open so she walked to the first one determined to confront him she found herself in a library with floortoceiling shelves stocked with books cozy leather chairs a small marble fireplace with an ornate pendulum clock gracing the mantel a hexagonshaped glass cabinet held an impressive collection of oriental snuff bottles she sniffed once he might be slick on taste and culture but he was still a thief she tried the next doorway and found his bedroom the big halftester with rococo head and footboards was impressive enough but the fact that it was tidily made with the pearlgray duvet cover nicely fluffed had her brow lifting either he hadnt slept in it or his mother had trained him very well after meeting maureen she voted for the latter a very masculine room she decided yet subtly sensual with jadegreen walls and creamy trim sinuous women in the art deco style he seemed fond of held frostedglass shades that would soften the light an oversized chair in that same moonlight gray was tilted invitingly toward a fullsized fireplace fashioned of roseveined marble ornamental lemon trees in huge urns flanked the wide window where the curtain had been drawn open to let in the sunlight and the view the chest of drawers was duncan phyfe and along with the bronze of the persian god mithras was a scatter of loose change a ticket stub a book of matches and other ordinary contents of a mans pocket she was tempted to poke into his closet open drawers but resisted it wouldnt do for him to pop in while she was at it and get the impression she was at all interested there was a third room obviously an office of a man who could afford the best for his athome work two computers both with laser printers the expected fax and desktop copier a twoline phone oak filing cabinets sturdy oak shelves held books and trinkets and dozens of framed photographs of his family the young children would be his nieces and nephews she thought pretty faces mugging for the camera the serene madonnalike woman holding an infant was likely his sister bridgit the sleekly handsome man with the boldari eyes would be michael and the woman his arm was draped around his wife they lived in california she remembered there was a shot of ryan with colleen grinning identical grins and a group picture of the entire family obviously taken near christmas the lights from the tree were prettily blurred behind the crowd of faces they looked happy she thought unified and not at all stiff the way people often appeared in posed photos she found herself lingering over them studying another of ryan kissing the hand of his sister who wore a princessinafairytale wedding gown and the glow that matched it envy moved through her before she could stop it there were no sentimental photographs arranged in her home to capture family moments she wished foolishly that she could slide into one of those photographs snuggle under one of those casually welcoming arms and feel what they felt feel love she shook the thought off turned determinedly away from the shelves it wasnt the time to speculate on why the boldari family was so warm and her own so cold she needed to find ryan and give him a piece of her mind while her annoyance was still fresh she headed downstairs biting her tongue to keep from calling his name she didnt want to give him the satisfaction he wasnt in the living room nor in the somewhat hedonistic den with its big screen tv complicated stereo and fullsized pinball machine appropriately titled cops and robbers she imagined he thought that ironic nor was he in the kitchen but there was a halfpot of coffee left on warm he wasnt in the apartment at all she snatched up the phone with some wild idea of calling andrew and telling him everything there was no dial tone cursing viciously she dashed back out into the living room and jabbed the button on the elevator it didnt make a sound snarling she turned to the door found it locked eyes narrowed she flicked on the intercom and heard nothing but static the son of a bitch had unlocked the bedroom but hed simply expanded the perimeters of her cage it was after one before she heard the quiet hum of the elevator she hadnt whiled away the morning shed taken the opportunity to go over every inch of his living quarters shed pawed through his closet without guilt he definitely leaned toward italian designers shed riffled through his drawers he preferred sexy silk boxers and shirts and sweaters of natural fibers the desks bedroom library and office had all been annoyingly locked shed wasted quite a bit of time attacking the locks with hairpins the passwords on his computers had blocked her the stone terrace off the living room had charmed her and the caffeine shed continued to drink as she pried had her system jumping she was more than ready for him when he walked through the elevator door how dare you lock me in this way im not a prisoner just a precaution he set aside the briefcase and shopping bags he carried whats next handcuffs not until we know each other better how was your day hate loathe and despise me he finished as he took off his coat yes weve covered that he hung it up neatly shed been right his mother had trained him well i had a few errands i had to run i hope you made yourself at home while i was out im leaving i must have been temporarily insane when i thought we could work together he waited until she was at the base of the stairs the dark lady is being held in a storeroom at the bargello until it can be decided where she came from and who cast her she stopped as hed known she would and turned slowly back how do you know its my business to know now with or without you im going to italy and liberating her i can with little trouble find another archeometrist and will eventually figure out just what happened and why you walk out youre all the way out youll never get it out of the bargello oh yes his smile was quick and wolfish i will you can have a pass at her once i do or you can run along back to maine and wait for your parents to decide youre not grounded anymore she let the last comment pass she supposed it was close enough to the truth how will you get it out thats my problem if im going to agree with this moronic plan i have to have details ill fill you in on what you need to know as we go along thats the deal in or out dr jones times wasting it was here she realized where she crossed the line passed the point of no return he was watching her waiting with just enough arrogance in his eyes to scrape at her pride if you manage to perform a miracle and actually get inside the bargello you take nothing but the bronze it isnt a shopping spree agreed if we do end up in possession of the bronze im in full charge of it youre the scientist he added with a smile she was welcome to the copy he thought he wanted the original thats the deal he repeated in or out in her breath exploded out god help me good now he opened the briefcase tossed items onto the table these are for you she picked up the dark blue book this isnt my passport it is now this isnt my name how did you get this picture she stared down at the image of herself this is the photo in my passport exactly no my passport and my drivers license she continued snatching it up you stole my wallet borrowed certain items in your wallet he corrected she vibrated there was no other word for it you came in my room while i was sleeping and took my things you were restless he remembered lots of tossing and turning maybe you should try meditation to release some of that tension thats despicable no it was necessary it would have been despicable if id climbed into bed with you fun but despicable she drew air in through her nose looked down it what have you done with my proper identification its safe you wont need it until we get back just playing it on the side of caution darling if the cops are snooping around better that they dont know youve left the country she tossed the passport down again im not abigail oconnell mrs abigail oconnell were on our second honeymoon and i think ill call you abby its friendly im not pretending im married to you id rather be married to a sociopath she was green after all he reminded himself a little patience was in order miranda were traveling together well share a hotel suite a married couple isnt going to raise eyebrows or cause questions to be asked all this does is keep things simple for the next several days im kevin oconnell your devoted spouse im a stockbroker youre in advertising weve been married for five years live on the upper west side and were considering starting a family so now were yuppies no one uses that term anymore but basically yes i got you a couple of credit cards there she glanced down at the table how did you get this identification contacts he said easily she imagined him in a dark smelly room with an enormous man with a snake tattoo and bad breath who sold forged ids and assault weapons it was nowhere close to the splitlevel town house in new rochelle where ryans accountant cousin second once removed created documents in his basement its illegal to enter a foreign country with false identification he stared at her for ten full seconds then roared with laughter youre wonderful seriously now i need a detailed description of the bronze i need to be able to recognize her quickly she studied him wondering how anyone could keep up with a man who flipped from hilarity to brisk business in the blink of an eye ninety point four centimeters in height twentyfour point sixtyeight kilograms in weight a nude female with the bluegreen patina typical of a bronze more than five hundred years old as she spoke the image of it flashed brilliantly in her head shes standing on the balls of her feet her arms lifted it would be easier if i just sketched it for you great he walked over to a cabinet took a pad and pencil from a drawer as precise as you can i hate to make mistakes she sat and with a speed and skill that had his brows lifted put the image in her mind on paper the face that sly and sensuous smile the seeking spread fingers lifted high the fluid arch of the body gorgeous absolutely gorgeous he murmured struck by the power of the image as he leaned over mirandas shoulder youre good do you paint no why not because i dont she had to struggle not to jerk her shoulder his cheek nearly rested against her as she sketched in the last details you have real talent why waste it i dont a skilled sketch can be very helpful in my work a gift for art should give you pleasure in your life he took the sketch studied it another moment youve got a gift she set her pencil down and rose the drawings accurate if youre lucky enough to stumble across it youll recognize the bronze luck has very little to do with it idly he flicked a fingertip down her cheek you look a bit like her the shape of the face the strong bone structure it would be interesting to see you with that cagey selfaware smile on your face you dont smile very often miranda i havent had much to smile about lately i think we can change that the car will be here in about an hour abby take some time and get used to your new name and if you dont think you can remember to call me kevin he winked at her just call me sweetheart i will not oh one last thing he pulled a small jewelers box out of his pocket when he flipped the lid the flash of diamonds made her blink by the power invested in me and so forth he said plucking it out of the box and taking her hand no dont be such an idiot its window dressing it wasnt possible not to look down and be dazzled when he shoved it on her finger the wedding band was studded with brilliant squarecut diamonds four in all that sparkled like ice some window i suppose its stolen you wound me ive got a friend who runs a place in the diamond district i got it wholesale i need to pack she worried the ring on her finger while he started up the stairs it was absurd but she wished the ring hadnt fit quite so perfectly ryan can you really do this he sent her a wink over his shoulder watch me he knew immediately shed been into his things shed been neat but not quite neat enough in any case she wouldnt have seen the small telltales he left scattered through his room the single strand of hair placed over the knobs of his double closet doors the slim bit of invisible tape over the top of his dresser drawer it was an old habit and one hed never broken even with the high security in his building he only shook his head she wouldnt have found anything he hadnt wanted her to find he opened his closet pressed a mechanism hidden under a portion of the chair rail and stepped into his private room selecting what he needed didnt take much time hed already thought it through he would need his picks the pocket electronics of his trade the coil of thin flexible rope surgical gloves spirit gum hair color a couple of scars two pairs of glasses he doubted the job would call for disguises and if it went correctly it wouldnt call for anything but the most basic of tools still he preferred to be prepared for anything these he packed carefully in the false bottom of his suitcase he added the expected choices a man on a romantic vacation to italy would take filling the case and a garment bag in his office he outfitted his own laptop chose the disks he wanted he clicked off his mental list as he packed adding a few items hed picked up at spy downtown and had beefed up himself satisfied he locked his current identification in the safe behind the complete volumes of edgar allan poe the father of the lockeddoor mystery and on impulse took out the plain gold band he kept there it had been his grandfathers wedding ring his mother had given it to him at the wake two years ago though hed had occasion to wear a wedding ring as cover before hed never used this one without questioning why he wanted to this time he slipped it on locked up and went back for his suitcases the intercom buzzed announcing the car as he carried them downstairs miranda had already brought her things down her suitcases laptop and briefcase were stacked neatly ryan lifted his brows i like a woman who knows how to be ready on time all set she drew a deep breath this she thought was it lets get going i hate to rush at the airport he smiled at her thats my girl he said and bent down to pick up one of her cases i can carry my own things she pushed his hand away and picked it up herself and im not your girl with a shrug he stepped back waiting until shed managed to sling straps over her shoulders heft the cases after you dr jones it shouldnt have surprised her that hed managed to book two firstclass seats on ridiculously short notice because she jolted every time the flight attendant addressed her as mrs oconnell miranda buried herself in the pages of kafka immediately after takeoff ryan passed some time with the latest lawrence block burglar novel then sipped champagne and watched arnold schwarzenegger kick bigtime ass on his video screen miranda drank mineral water and tried to concentrate on a nature documentary midway over the atlantic the restless night caught up with her doing her best to ignore her seat companion she took her seat back down stretched out and ordered her brain to sleep she dreamed of maine of the cliffs with the sea thrashing below and a thick gray fog that smothered shapes the light flicked in a blurry swath and she used it to guide her toward the lighthouse she was alone so completely alone and she was afraid terribly afraid stumbling groping fighting not to let her breath sob out no matter how it burned her lungs a womans laughter soft and menacing taunted her so that she ran and running found herself on the edge of the cliff over a boiling sea when a hand gripped hers she held on tight dont leave me alone beside her ryan looked down at their joined hands hers were whiteknuckled even in sleep what chased her there he wondered and what kept her from reaching out he soothed her fingers with his thumb until they relaxed but he kept her hand in his finding it curiously comforting as he closed his own eyes and slept chapter sixteen theres only one bedroom miranda saw nothing of the lovely suite but the single bedroom with its gracious kingsized bed and elegant white coverlet in the parlor ryan opened the double doors and stepped out on an enormous terrace where the air was ripe with spring and the italian sun shone cheerfully on the soft red rooftops check this view this terrace is one of the reasons i wanted to book this room again you could live out here good she pushed open the doors from the bedroom and stepped out why dont you plan to do just that she would not be charmed by the throataching view of the city nor the cheerful geraniums that lined the boxes just under the stone parapet nor the man who leaned over them looking as though hed been born to stand in precisely that spot theres only one bedroom she repeated were married which reminds me how about getting me a beer im sure theres a certain kind of woman who finds you irresistibly amusing boldari i dont happen to be that certain kind she stepped up to the rail there is only one bed in the only one bedroom if youre shy we can take turns on the parlor sofa you first he draped an arm over her shoulders and added a friendly squeeze relax miranda getting you in the sack would be fun but its not my first priority a view like this makes up for a long plane flight doesnt it the view isnt my first priority its here might as well appreciate it theres a young couple who lives in that flat there he steered her over a bit and pointed to a topfloor window on a soft yellow building just to the left theyd work on the rooftop garden on saturday mornings together and one night they came out and made love there you watched them only until the intent was unmistakable im not a pervert the jurys still out on that one youve been here before then kevin oconnell stayed here for a few days last year which is why were using him again in a wellrun hotel like this the staff tends to remember guests more so if they tip well and kevins a generous soul why were you here as kevin oconnell a little matter of a reliquary with a bone fragment of giovanni battista you stole a relic a relic john the baptists bone a fragment thereof hell pieces of him are scattered all over italy especially here where hes patron saint he couldnt help himself he got a huge kick out of her staggered shock very popular guy old johnny nobodys going to miss a splinter or two of bone i dont have words miranda murmured my client had cancer convinced himself that the relic would cure him of course hes dead but he lived nine months longer than the doctors gave him so whos to say lets get unpacked he patted her arm i want a shower then well get to work work ive got some shopping to do im not spending the day looking for ferragamos for your sister that wont take long and ill need trinkets for the rest of the family look boldari i think we have a higher priority than gathering souvenirs for your family he infuriated her by leaning over and kissing the tip of her nose dont worry darling ill buy you something too wear comfortable shoes he advised her and strolled back inside to shower he bought a fluid gold bracelet set with emerald cabochons in a shop on the ponte vecchio his mothers birthday was coming up and had it sent back to the hotel obviously enjoying the press of tourists and bargain hunters who swarmed the bridge over the placid arno he added gold chains in shimmering italian gold marcasite earrings and florentinestyle brooches for his sisters he told miranda as she waited impatiently and refused to be charmed by the tumbling glitter in display windows stand here long enough he commented you can hear every language in the world have we stood here long enough he slipped an arm around her shoulders shaking his head as she stiffened dont you ever let yourself fall into the moment dr jones its florence were standing on the oldest of the citys bridges the suns shining take a breath he suggested and drink it in she nearly did nearly leaned into him and did just that we didnt come here for the atmosphere she said in what she hoped was a tone cool enough to dampen his enthusiasm and her own uncharacteristic urges the atmospheres still here and so are we undaunted he took her hand and pulled her along the bridge the little shops and stands appeared to delight him miranda noted watching him bargain for leather bags and trinket boxes near the piazza della repubblica she ignored his suggestion that she treat herself to something and giving her attention to the architecture waited for him in simmering silence now this is robbie he took a totsized black leather jacket with silver trim from a rack robbie my nephew hes three hed get a big kick out of this it was beautifully made undoubtedly expensive and adorable enough to have her pressing her lips together to keep them from curving its completely impractical for a threeyearold it was made for a threeyearold he corrected thats why its little quanto he asked the hovering merchant and the game was on when hed finished the round he headed west but if hed hoped to tempt her with the flawless fashions of the via dei tornabuoni he underestimated her willpower he bought three pairs of shoes in ferragamos cathedral to footwear she bought nothing including a gorgeous pair of pearlgray leather pumps that had caught her eye and stirred her desire the credit cards in her wallet she reminded herself werent stamped with her name shed go barefoot before she used one most women he observed as he walked toward the river would have a dozen bags and boxes by now im not most women so ive noticed youd look damn good in leather though in your pathetic fantasies boldari theres nothing pathetic about my fantasies he stepped to a storefront and opened a glass door what now cant come to florence without buying some art we didnt come here to buy anything this is supposed to be business relax he took her hand bringing it up in a sweep to his lips trust me those are two phrases that will never go together when applied to you the shop was crowded with marble and bronze reproductions gods and goddesses danced to lure tourists into plunking down their gold cards and purchasing a copy of a masters work or an offering by a new artist patience straining miranda prepared to waste another precious hour while ryan fulfilled his family obligations but he surprised her by nodding toward a slender statue of venus within five minutes what do you think of her soberly she stepped up circled the polished bronze figure its adequate not particularly good but if one of your legion of relatives is looking for some lawn art it would do well enough yeah i think shell do well enough he aimed a delighted smile toward the clerk then made mirandas brows draw together as he fumbled with guidebook italian throughout the shopping spree hed spoken the language fluidly often peppering his speech with casual colloquialisms now he slaughtered the most basic of phrases with a miserable accent that had the clerk beaming at him youre american we can speak english yeah thank god he laughed and tugged miranda by the hand to bring her closer my wife and i want something special to take home we really like this piece itll look great in the sunroom wont it abby her answer was a hmmm he didnt bargain well this time either just winced over the price then pulled her away as if to hold a private consult whats this all about she found herself whispering because his head was bent close to hers i wouldnt want to buy it without being sure my wife approved youre a jackass thats what i get for being a considerate husband he lowered his head kissed her firmly on the mouth and only by instinct avoided her teeth promise me youll try that again later before she could retaliate he turned back to the clerk well take her when the deal was made the statue wrapped and boxed he refused the offer to send it to their hotel thats okay were about to head back anyway he hefted the bag then put an arm around miranda bumping her with one of the two cameras slung over his shoulders lets get some of that ice cream on the way abby i dont need any ice cream she muttered when they stepped outside again sure you do gotta keep your energy up weve got one more stop to make look im tired my feet hurt and i dont care for shopping ill just meet you back at the hotel and miss all the fun were going to the bargello now what chased up her spine was a combination of dread and excitement were going to do it now now were going to play tourist some more he stepped off the curb giving her room on the narrow sidewalk well check the place out get a feel for things take some pictures he winked case the joint as they say in the movies case the joint she murmured where are the security cameras how far from the main entrance is michelangelos bacchus though he knew precisely it wouldnt be his first trip under any guise how far is it across the courtyard how many steps to the firstfloor loggia when do the guards change shift how many all right all right i get the point she threw up her hands i dont know why we didnt go there in the first place everything in its time honey abby and kevin would want to see some of the city on their first day wouldnt they she imagined they looked exactly like american tourists cameras shopping bags and guidebooks he bought her an icecream cone as they walked because she decided it might help cool the hot ball of tension in her stomach she licked at the tart frothy lemon ice as he strolled along pointing out buildings statues loitering at shop windows or over menus posted outside trattorias perhaps there was a point to it all she decided no one would look twice at them and if she concentrated she could almost believe she was meandering through the city for the first time it was a bit like being in a play she thought abby and kevins italian vacation if only she werent such a lousy actress fabulous isnt it he paused his fingers twining with hers as he studied the magnificent cathedral that dominated the city yes brunelleschis dome was a revolutionary achievement he didnt use scaffolding giotto designed the campanile but didnt live to see it completed she adjusted her sunglasses the neogothic marble facade echoes his style but was added in the nineteenth century she brushed at her hair and saw him smiling at her what you have a nice way with a history lesson dr jones when her face went carefully blank he framed it with his hands no dont that wasnt a dig it was a compliment his fingers brushed her cheekbones lightly so many sensitive spots he mused tell me something else if he was laughing at her he was doing a good job of disguising it so she took a chance michelangelo carved his david in the courtyard of the museo dellopera del duomo really he said it so seriously her lips twitched yes he also copied donatellos saint john for his own moses it would have been a compliment but the pride of the museum i think is his pietà the figure of nicodemus is believed to be a selfportrait and is brilliantly done but the figure of mary magdalene in the same sculpture is inferior and obviously the work of one of his students dont kiss me ryan she said it quickly closing her eyes as his mouth hovered a breath from hers it complicates things do they have to be simple yes she opened her eyes again looked into his in this case yes normally id agree with you thoughtfully he skimmed the pad of his thumb over her lips were attracted to each other and that should be simple but it doesnt seem to be he dropped his hands from her face to her shoulders skimmed them down her arms to her wrists her pulse was rapid and thick and should have pleased him but he stepped back okay lets keep it as simple as possible go stand over there why so i can take your picture honey he tipped his sunglasses down and winked at her we want to show all our friends back home dont we abby though she considered it overkill she posed in front of the grand duomo with hundreds of other visitors and let him snap pictures of her with the magnificent white green and rose marble at her back now you take one of me he walked over holding out his snazzy nikon its basically pointandshoot you just i know how to work a camera she snatched it from him kevin she moved back blocked and focused maybe her heart tripped a little he was such a staggering sight tall and dark and grinning cockily at the camera there satisfied now almost he snagged a couple of tourists who happily agreed to take a picture of the young americans this is ridiculous miranda muttered as she found herself posing once again this time with ryans arm around her waist its for my mother he said then followed impulse and kissed her a flock of pigeons swarmed up with a rush of wings and a flutter of air she had no time to resist less to defend his mouth was warm firm sliding over hers as the arm around her waist angled her closer the quiet sound she made had nothing to do with protest the hand she lifted to his face had everything to do with holding him there the sun was white the air full of sound and her heart trembled on the edge of something extraordinary it was either pull away or sink ryan thought he turned his lips into the palm of her hand sorry he said and didnt smile couldnt quite pull it off i guess i fell into the moment and leaving her there with her knees trembling he retrieved his camera he strapped it back on picked up the shopping bag then with his eyes on hers held out a hand lets go shed almost forgotten the purpose almost forgotten the plan with a nod she fell into step with him when they reached the gates of the old palace he tugged the guidebook out of his back pocket like a good tourist it was built in he told her from the sixteenth to the midnineteenth century it was a prison executions were carried out in the courtyard apt under the circumstances she muttered and i know the history dr jones knows the history he gave her butt an affectionate pat abby honey the minute they were inside the principal groundfloor room he dug out his video camera great place isnt it abby look at this guy hes knocked back a few huh he aimed the camera at the glorious bronze of the drunken bacchus then began to slowly pan the room wait until jack and sally see these theyll be green he swung the camera toward a doorway where a guard sat keeping an eye on the visitors wander around he told her under his breath look awed and middleclass her palms were sweating it was ridiculous of course they had a perfect right to be here no one could possibly know what was going on inside her head but her heart pounded painfully in her throat as she circled the room wonderfully awful isnt it she jolted a little when he came up beside her as she pretended to study bandinellis adam and eve its an important piece of the era only because its old it looks like a couple of suburbanites who hang out at a nudist colony every other weekend lets go see giambolognas birds in the loggia after an hour miranda began to suspect that a great deal of criminal activity involved the tedious they went into every public room capturing every inch and angle on camera still shed forgotten that the sala dei bronzettí held italys finest collection of small renaissance bronzes because it made her think of the david her nerves began to twitch again havent you got enough yet nearly go flirt with the guard over there i beg your pardon get his attention ryan lowered the camera and briskly undid the top two buttons on mirandas crisp cotton blouse what do you think youre doing making sure his attentions focused on you cara ask him some questions use bad guidebook italian bat your eyes and make him feel important what are you going to do nothing if you cant hold his eye for five minutes give me that long ask him where the bathroom is then head there meet me back in the courtyard in ten but do it he snapped it out with a flick of steel theres just enough people in here that i should be able to pull this off oh god all right her stomach tilted down toward her shaky knees as she turned away to approach the guard ah scusi she began giving the word a hard american accent per favore she watched the guards eyes dip to the opening of her blouse then skim back up to her face with a smile she swallowed hard then spread her hands helplessly english si signora a little oh wonderful she experimented with fluttering her lashes and saw by the warming of the guards smile that such pitiful ploys actually worked i studied up on italian before i left but it just gets all jumbled up in my mind such a scatterbrain its terrible isnt it that americans dont speak a second language the way most europeans do the way his eyes were glazing she deduced she was speaking much too quickly for him to follow all the better everythings so beautiful here i wonder if you could tell me anything about she chose a sculpture at random ryan waited until he saw the guards focus fix on mirandas cleavage then slipping back he took a thin pick out of his pocket and went to work on a side door it was easy enough even dealing with it behind his back the museum hardly expected its visitors to come armed with lockpicks or to want entrance to locked rooms in broad daylight the floor plan of the museum was on a disk in his files as were dozens of others if his source was to be trusted ryan would find what he wanted beyond the door in one of the jumbled storerooms on this level he kept one eye on the security camera biding his time until a group of art lovers shuffled in front of him before theyd gone by he was through the door and closing it softly behind him he took one long breath of appreciation tugged on the gloves hed tucked in his pocket then flexed his fingers he couldnt take much time it was a rabbit warren of little rooms crowded with statues and paintings most of which were in desperate need of restoration generally he knew those who made their living through or around art werent the most organized of souls several pieces caught his eye including a sadeyed madonna with a broken shoulder but he was looking for another type of lady altogether the sound of tuneless whistling and clicking footsteps sent him searching quickly for cover she waited the ten minutes then fifteen by twenty she was wringing her hands on the bench where she sat in the courtyard and imagining what it would be like to spend some time in an italian prison maybe the food would be good at least they didnt kill thieves these days and hang their corpses from the bargellos windows as a testament to rough justice once again she checked her watch rubbed her fingers over her mouth hed been caught she was sure of it right now he was being interrogated inside some hot little room and hed give up her name without a qualm the coward then she saw him strolling across the courtyard like a man without a care in the world and no shadow of larceny in his heart her relief was so great that she sprang up threw her arms around him where have you been i thought youd been he kissed her as much to stop her babbling as to take advantage of the situation lets go get a drink well talk about it he said against her mouth how could you just leave me out here like this you said ten minutes its been nearly half an hour it took me a little longer they were still mouth to mouth and he grinned at her miss me no i was wondering what was on the menu in jail tonight have a little faith he clasped hands swinging arms with her as they walked some wine and cheese would be nice right now the piazza della signoria isnt as picturesque as others but its close where did you go she demanded i fiddled around with the guard as long as i could and when i looked around you were gone i wanted to see what was behind door number three that place might have been a palace once and a cop shop later but the interior doors are childs play how could you take a chance like that breaking into an offlimits area with a guard not three yards away usually thats the best time he glanced in a shop window as they passed and reminded himself to carve out some more time for shopping i found our lady he said casually its irresponsible foolish and nothing more than an egocentric what i found her his grin flashed like the tuscan sun and i dont think shes too happy being tucked away in the dark to gather dust patience he told her before she could question him im thirsty youre thirsty how can you think about wine and cheese for gods sake we should be doing something planning out our next step we cant just sit under an awning and drink chianti thats just what were going to do and stop looking over your shoulder as if the polizia were on our tail he pulled her toward one of those wide awnings in front of a bustling trattoria maneuvered her through the tables to an empty one youre out of your mind shopping buying souvenirs scouting out leather jackets for toddlers wandering around the bargello as if youve never been there before and now she broke off shocked when he pushed her into a chair his hand closed hard over hers as he leaned across the table the smile he sent her was as tough and chilly as his voice now were just going to sit here awhile and youre not going to give me any trouble no trouble at all the smile turned easy as he glanced up at the waiter since the cover seemed absurd at the moment he rattled off a request for a bottle of local wine and a selection of cheeses in perfect italian im not tolerating your feeble attempts at bullying me sweetheart youre going to tolerate what i tell you to tolerate ive got the lady youre laboring under what the color that had rushed into her face faded again what do you mean youve got the lady shes sitting under the table under the when she would have scraped her chair back and dived under he simply tightened his grip on her hand until she had to muffle a yelp look at me cara and pretend youre in love he brought her bruised fingers to his lips are you telling me that you walked into a museum in broad daylight and walked out with the bronze im good i told you but just now now you were only gone for thirty minutes if a guard hadnt wandered into the storage area to sneak a wine break id have cut that in half but you said we had to check the place out to tape it to take measurements get the feel he kissed her fingers again i lied he kept her hand in his kept his eyes dreamily on hers while the waiter set their wine and cheese on the table recognizing lovers the waiter smiled indulgently and left them alone you lied if id told you i was going in to get it youd have been nervous jumpy and very likely have screwed things up he poured wine for both of them sampled and approved the wine from this region is exceptional arent you going to try it still staring at him she lifted her glass and downed the contents in several long swallows she was now an accessory to theft if youre going to drink like that you better soak some of it up he sliced off some cheese offered it here she pushed his hand away and reached for the bottle you knew going in that you were going to do this i knew going in that if the opportunity presented itself id make the switch what switch the bronze we bought earlier i put that in her place i told you most people see what they expect to see theres a bronze statue of a woman sitting in the storeroom odds are no ones going to notice its the wrong bronze for a bit he sampled some cheese approved and built some onto a cracker when they do theyll look for the right one likely figure it was moved and when they dont find her they wont be able to pinpoint when she was taken if our luck holds well be back in the states by that time anyway i need to see it theres time for that i gotta tell you knowingly stealing a forgery it just doesnt give you that rush doesnt it she murmured nope and im going to miss that rush when im fully retired you did a good job by the way oh she didnt feel a rush at all just a sinking sensation in her stomach distracting the guard better fortify yourself he offered cheese again weve still got work to do it was surreal sitting in the hotel room and holding the dark lady in her hands she examined it carefully noting where samples and scrapings had been taken judging the weight critiquing the style it was a beautiful and graceful piece of work with the bluegreen patina giving it the dignity of age she set it on the table beside the david shes gorgeous ryan commented as he puffed on his cigar your sketch of her was very accurate you didnt capture the spirit but you certainly got the details youd be a better artist if you put some heart into your work im not an artist her throat was dry as dust im a scientist and this isnt the bronze i tested he lifted a brow how do you know she couldnt tell him it felt wrong she couldnt even acknowledge to herself that it simply didnt give her the same tingle in her fingertips when she held it so she gave him facts its very possible for someone with training to recognize the work of the twentieth century just by a visual exam in this case i certainly wouldnt depend on that alone but i took scrapings here and here she used a fingertip to point to the back of the calf the curve of the shoulder theres no sign of them on this piece pontis lab took scrapings from the back and the base those arent my marks i need equipment and my notes to verify but this isnt the bronze i worked on considering ryan tapped his cigar in an ashtray lets verify it first no one will believe me even when i verify it no one will believe this isnt the bronze she looked over at him why should they theyll believe you when we have the original how one step at a time dr jones youre going to want to change basic black works best for an entertaining evening of breaking and entering ill arrange for transportation she moistened her lips were going into standjo thats the plan he sensed her waffling and leaned back in his chair unless you want to call your mother explain all this to her and ask her to give you a little lab time mirandas eyes cooled as she rose ill change the bedroom door didnt have a lock so she dragged over the desk chair and lodged the back under the knob it made her feel better he was using her was all she could think as if she were just another tool the idea of them being partners was an illusion and now shed helped him steal she was about to break into her familys business and how would she stop him if he decided to do more than run a few basic tests she could hear him talking on the phone in the parlor and took her time changing into a black shirt and slacks she needed a plan of her own needed to enlist someone she could trust ive got to run down to the desk he called out snap it up in there ill only be a minute and i need to change too ill be ready and the minute she heard the door shut she was dragging the chair away from the door be there be there be there she murmured frantically as she yanked her address book out of her briefcase flipping through she found the number and made the call pronto giovanni its miranda miranda it wasnt pleasure in his voice but caution where are you your brothers been im in florence she interrupted i need to see you right away please giovanni meet me inside santa maria novella ten minutes but please its vital she hung up quickly then moving fast covered the bronzes sloppily in bubble wrap and stuffed them back in their bag she grabbed the bag and her purse and ran she took the stairs hurrying down the carpeted treads with her heart banging in her chest her arms straining against the weight of the bag she pulled up short at the base eased out she could see ryan at the desk chatting cheerfully with the clerk she couldnt risk crossing the lobby and tried to slide invisibly around the corner and jog through the lounge she kept going through the glass doors that led to the pretty courtyard with its sparkling swimming pool and shady trees pigeons scattered as she raced through though the bag weighed heavily she didnt stop for breath until shed circled the building and made it out to the street even then she took only time enough to shift hands readjust the weight cast one nervous glance behind her then she headed straight for the church santa maria novella with its beguiling patterns of green and white marble was just a short walk from the hotel miranda controlled her need to run and walked into its cool dim interior her legs wobbled as she headed down and found a seat near the left of the chancel once there she tried to understand what the hell she was doing ryan was going to be furious and she couldnt be sure just how much violence simmered under that elegant surface but she was doing the right thing the only logical thing even the copy had to be protected until there was resolution you couldnt trust a man who stole for a living giovanni would come she told herself shed known him for years however flirtatious however eccentric he might be he was at heart a scientist and hed always been her friend he would listen he would assess he would help trying to calm herself she shut her eyes there was something in the air of such places temples of age and faith and power religion had always been on some levels about power here that power had manifested itself in great art so much of it paid for from the coffers of the medicis buying their souls she wondered balancing out their misdeeds and sins by creating grandeur for a church lorenzo had betrayed his wife with the dark lady however acceptable such affairs had been and his greatest protege had immortalized her in bronze had he known no no she remembered hed been dead when the bronze was cast she would have been making the transition to piero or one of the younger cousins she wouldnt have given up the power her beauty granted her by turning away a new protector she was too smart for that too practical to prosper or even to survive during that period a woman needed the shield of a man or her own wealth a certain acceptable lineage or great beauty with a cool mind and heart that knew how to wield it giulietta had known shivering miranda opened her eyes again it was the bronze she reminded herself not the woman that mattered now it was science not speculation that would solve the puzzle she heard the rapid footsteps and tensed hed found her oh god she jumped up whirled and nearly wept with relief giovanni her limbs went weak as she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him bella what are you doing here he returned the embrace with a combination of exasperation and affection why do you call me with fear in your voice and ask me to meet you like a spy he glanced over at the high altar and in church its quiet its safe sanctuary she said with a weak smile as she drew back i want to explain but i dont know how much time i have he knows im gone by now and hell be looking for me who knows too complicated sit down a minute her voice was a whisper as suited churches and conspiracies giovanni the bronze the dark lady it was a forgery miranda my english comes and goes but to be a forgery makes it necessary to have something to forge the bronze was a fake a bad joke a he groped for a word bad luck he decided the authorities have questioned the plumber but it appears he was no more than a dupe is this the word someone hoped to pass the statue off as genuine and nearly succeeded it was genuine he took her hands i know this is difficult for you you saw the test results si but it hurt seeing both doubt and suspicion in the eyes of a friend do you think i doctored them i think there were mistakes we moved too fast all of us miranda the pace doesnt alter the results that bronze was real this one is a forgery she reached down and brought the wrapped bronze to the top of the bag what is this its the copy the one ponti tested dio mio how did you get it his voice rose on the question causing a few heads to turn wincing he leaned closer and whispered it was being held in the bargello thats not important what is important is that this is not the bronze we worked on youll be able to see that for yourself once you have it in the lab in the lab miranda what madness is this this is sanity she had to cling to that im barred from standjo the records are all there giovanni the equipment is there i need your help theres a bronze david in this bag as well its a forgery ive already tested it but i want you to take them both in examine them run what tests you can youll compare the results of the fiesole bronze with the ones that were run on the original youll prove its not the same bronze miranda be sensible even if i do as you ask ill only prove you were wrong no you get my notes your own richards you run the tests you compare we couldnt all have been wrong giovanni id do it myself but there are complications she thought of ryan furious tearing the city apart to find her and the bronzes and running them myself wont convince anyone it needs to be objective i cant trust anyone but you she squeezed his hands knowing she played on his weakness for friendship she could have stopped the tears that swam into her eyes but they were genuine its my reputation giovanni its my work its my life he cursed softly then winced when he remembered where he was quickly added a prayer and the sign of the cross this will only make you unhappy i cant be any more unhappy for friendship giovanni for me ill do what you ask she squeezed her eyes shut as her heart swelled with gratitude tonight right away the sooner its done the better the lab its closed for a few days so no one will know closed why he smiled for the first time tomorrow my lovely pagan is good friday and this was not the way hed intended to spend his holiday weekend he sighed nudged the bag with his foot where will i reach you when its done ill reach you she leaned forward to touch her lips to his grazzie giovanni mille grazie ill never be able to repay you for this an explanation when its done would be a fine start a full one i promise oh im so glad to see you i wish i could stay but i have to get back and well i suppose wed say face the music ill find a way to call you in the morning take good care of them she added and nudged the bag toward him with her foot wait a minute or two before you leave will you just in case she kissed him again warmly then left him because she looked neither right nor left she didnt see the figure standing in the dimness turned as if to contemplate the faded frescoes of dantes inferno she didnt feel the fury or the threat it was as if a burden had been lifted the weight that had pressed down on her head her heart her conscience she stepped outside into the gilded light from the sun that was melting into the west on the off chance that ryan was out on foot searching for her she walked in the opposite direction of the hotel toward the river it wouldnt do she thought to have him find her before she and giovanni had plenty of distance between them it was a long walk and gave her time to calm herself time to think and time for once to wonder about the couples who strolled along hand in hand who shared long looks or long embraces giovanni had once told her romance lived in florentine air and she had only to sniff at it it made her smile then it made her sigh she simply wasnt fashioned for romance and hadnt she proven it the only man whod ever stirred her to the point of aching was a thief with no more integrity than a mushroom she was better much better off alone as shed always been she reached the river watched the dying sun sprinkle its last lights on the water when the roar of an engine sounded behind her when that engine revved violently impatiently she knew hed found her shed known he would get on she glanced back saw his furious face the way that anger could turn those warm golden eyes to deadly ice he was all in black now as she was and astride a blue motorbike the wind had blown his hair into disorder he looked dangerous and absurdly sexy i can walk thanks get on miranda because if i have to get off and put you on its going to hurt since the alternative was to run like a coward and likely be run over for her trouble she shrugged carelessly she walked to the curb swung a leg over to sit behind him she gripped the back of the seat for balance but when he took off like a bullet survival instinct took over and had her wrapping her arms tightly around him chapter seventeen i guess i should have used the handcuffs after all after taking the narrow winding streets with a reckless and risky speed that suited his mood ryan jerked the bike to a halt in the piazzale michelangelo it seemed apt and it gave them a heartshattering view of florence with the tuscan hills rising beyond as well as the privacy he wanted should he decide to commit violence it was nearly empty with the vendors that crowded the area gone for the day and a broody storm gathering in the western sky where the sun clung tenuously to the horizon off he ordered and waited for her to pry her hands from their death grip around his waist hed given her a couple of good scares on the ride hed meant to you drive like a lunatic half italian half irish what do you expect he swung off himself then dragged her to the wall where florence spread like an old jewel below there were still a few tourists taking pictures of the grand fountain but since they were japanese he thought he could risk ripping into her in either english or italian he chose the latter because he considered it more passionate where are they safe i didnt ask how they were but where what have you done with the bronzes the sensible thing its going to storm she said as lightning licked the sky with the same edgy sizzle as the nerves riding in her stomach we should get inside somewhere he simply pushed her back against the wall and held her there body against body i want the bronzes miranda she kept her eyes on his she wouldnt appeal to the handful of lingering tourists for help this she promised herself she would deal with on her own theyre worthless to you thats for me to decide damn it i trusted you now her eyes fired back you mean you couldnt lock me into the suite the way you did in your apartment she kept her voice low its already husky tone rough with temper you couldnt make me wait the way you did at the bargello while you went ahead and acted without telling me what you planned to do this time i went ahead he put his arms around her so that they looked like desperate lovers too involved with each other to notice storm or city his grip shortened her breath considerably went ahead and what made arrangements youre hurting me not yet im not you had to give them to someone your mother no he decided when she continued to stare at him not your mother youre still hoping to make her grovel for doubting you got a boyfriend here in florence dr jones someone you could sweettalk into tucking the bronzes away until you figure id give up now i want the bronzes both of them thunder grumbled rolled closer i told you theyre safe i made arrangements i did what i thought best do i look like i give a rats ass what you think i want to prove theyre copies so do you if i run the tests and the comparisons it could be claimed i slanted them wed be no better off than we are now it was your job to get the bronze from the bargello its mine to determine how to prove its a forgery you gave them to someone from standjo he drew back only far enough to take her face in his hands what kind of idiot are you i gave them to someone i trust to someone ive known for years she took a deep breath hoping to trade temper for reason hell do the work because i asked him and tomorrow ill contact him and get the results he had a vicious urge to bounce her head off the wall just to see if it was really as hard as he suspected follow this logic dr jones the dark lady is a forgery therefore someone at standjo made the copy someone who knows what the tests would show how to make it look real enough to pass prelims someone who likely has a source whod pay some excellent lire for the real thing he wouldnt do that his works important to him mines important to me lets go where he was already dragging her across the plaza to the bike when the first fat drops of rain fell to the lab sweetheart well check up on your friends progress dont you understand if we break into the lab the tests will be moot no one will believe me you forget i already believe you thats part of the problem now get on or i leave you here and take care of business myself she considered it then decided the last thing giovanni needed was a furious ryan breaking into the lab let him do the tests she pushed at her wet hair its the only way theyll have validity he simply gunned the engine get on she got on and as he tore out of the plaza she tried to convince herself shed make him see reason once they got to standjo half a block from standjo he pulled the bike into a small forest of others along the curbing be quiet he said jumping off to remove pouches from the saddlebags do what youre told and carry this he shoved one of the bags into her hands then took her arm in a firm grip and led her down the street well go in the back just in case anyones curious enough to be looking out into the rain well cross directly over the photo lab to the stairs how do you know the setup i do my research ive got blueprints of the whole facility on disk he drew her around the back of the building then pulled out a pair of surgical gloves put these on this isnt going to i said be quiet and do what youre told youve already caused me more trouble than necessary im going to disable the alarm in this sector which means you dont go more than one foot away from me while were inside he pulled on his own gloves as he spoke and thought nothing of the rain now pounding over them if we need to access another area of the building ill deal with the security from inside itll be easier therere no guards its all electronic so its unlikely wed run into anyone but your good pal over a holiday weekend she started to protest again then backed off it occurred to her that once she was inside shed have giovanni behind her surely the two of them could handle one irritating thief if hes not inside with the bronzes im going to make you very sorry hes there he gave me his word yeah like you gave me yours he approached the door setting down his bag to prepare to work then his eyes narrowed as he studied the fixture beside the door alarms off he murmured your friends careless dr jones he didnt reset the system from inside she ignored the rippling chill over her skin i suppose he didnt think it necessary umhmm doors locked though that would be automatic once it was shut well fix that he unrolled a soft leather strip using his body to shield his tools as best he could hed have to wipe them down well later he mused couldnt risk rust this shouldnt take long but keep your eye out anyway he hummed lightly a tune she recognized as a passage from aida she crossed her arms over her chest turned her back to him and stared into the driving rain whoever had installed security hadnt wanted to deface the beautiful old door with dead bolts the brass knobs were sadfaced cherubs that suited the medieval architecture and guarded a series of efficient but aesthetically discreet locks ryan blinked rain out of his eyes and wished vaguely for an umbrella he had to work by feel alone the pounding of the rain prevented him from hearing that faint and satisfying click of tumblers but the sturdy british locks surrendered degree by degree bring the bag he told her when he pulled the heavy door open he used his penlight to guide them to the stairs you explain to your friend that im helping you out and ill take it from there that is if hes here i said hed be here he promised me then he must like to work in the dark he shined his light straight ahead thats your lab right yes her brows drew together it was black as pitch he just hasnt gotten here yet who turned off the alarm i hes probably in the chem lab thats his field well check that out in a minute meanwhile well just see if your notes are still in your office through here yes through the doors and to the left it was only my temporary office you put the data on your computers hard drive yes then well get it the doors were unlocked which gave him an unhappy feeling deciding to err on the side of caution he shut off his flashlight stay behind me why just do it he eased through the door blocking her body with his for several humming seconds he listened and hearing nothing but the whoosh of air through the vents reached over to turn on the lights oh god instinctively she gripped his shoulder oh my god i thought scientists were tidy he murmured it looked as if someone had indulged in a vicious tantrum or a hell of a party computers were smashed and the glass from monitors and test tubes littered the floor worktables had been overturned papers scattered stations that had been surgically ordered were now a jumble of wreckage the stench of chemicals unwisely mixed smeared the air i dont understand this whats the point of this it wasnt burglary he said easily not with all these computers busted instead of lifted looks to me dr jones like your friends come and gone giovanni would never do this she pushed past ryan to kick her way through the rubble it had to be vandals kids on a rampage all this equipment all this data she mourned it even as she stormed through the room destroyed ruined vandals he didnt think so where was the graffiti where was the glee this had been done in rage and with purpose and he had a hunch it was going to circle right around on them lets get out of here i have to check the other sections see how extensive the damage is if they got to the chem lab she broke off shoving her way through the mess with the terrible idea of a gang of young hoods with a volatile supply of stolen chemicals you cant fix it he muttered under his breath and started after her when he caught up she was standing in an open doorway staring swaying giovanni had kept his promise and he wasnt going anywhere he lay on his back his head twisted at an odd angle and resting in a dark glossy pool his eyes open and dull were fixed on the dark lady who lay with him her graceful hands and smiling face covered with blood sweet jesus it was as much prayer as oath as ryan jerked her back forced her around so that she stared into his eyes instead of at what lay in the room beyond is that your friend i giovanni her pupils had dilated with shock and her eyes were as black and lifeless as a dolls hold it together you have to hold it together miranda because we might not have much time our fingerprints are all over that bronze do you understand and the bronze had recently graduated from forgery to murder weapon those are the only ones the cops will find on it weve been set up here there was a roaring in her ears the ocean rising up to strike rock giovannis dead yeah he is now stand right here for expedience sake he propped her against the wall he stepped into the room breathing through his teeth so as not to absorb the smell of death the room reeked with it and the smell was obscenely fresh though it made him grimace he picked up the bronze stuffed it into his bag doing his best to stop his gaze from locking on the face staring up at him he did a quick search of the wrecked room the david had been heaved into a corner the dent in the wall showed where it had struck very smart he thought as he pushed it into the bag very tidy leave both pieces and tie it together tie it right around mirandas neck like a noose she was exactly as hed left her but now she was shaking and her skin was the color of paste you can walk he said roughly you can run if you have to because weve got to get out of here we cant cant leave him in there like this giovanni hes dead and theres nothing you can do for him were going i cant leave him rather than wasting time arguing he caught her up in a firemans carry she didnt struggle only hung limply and repeated the same words over and over like a chant i cant leave him i cant leave him he was out of breath by the time he hit the outside door still he shifted her weight opened the door only far enough to give him a view of the street he saw nothing out of place but the back of his neck continued to prickle as though it felt the business end of a blade when they were out in the rain he dumped her on her feet and shook her hard you dont fall apart until were out of here put it on ice miranda and do what needs to be done next without waiting for her assent he pulled her around the building and down the street she slid on the bike behind him held on so that he could feel the jumping skip of her heart against his back as he drove through the rain he wanted to get her inside quickly but forced himself to drive through the city taking narrow side streets at random to be certain they werent being followed whoever had killed giovanni might have been watching the building waiting for them he was reserving judgment on that until he managed to get the full story out of miranda satisfied there was no tail he parked in front of the hotel he gathered his bags then turned to push the wet hair out of her face you listen to me pay attention he held on to her face until her glazed eyes focused we have to cross the lobby i want you to walk straight to the elevator ill handle the clerk you just go and stand by the elevator understand yes it felt as if the words came from somewhere over the top of her head rather than out of her mouth words floating there meaningless and confusing when she walked it was like swimming through syrup but she walked intensely focused on the gleaming doors of the elevators that was her goal she thought she just had to walk to the elevator dimly she heard ryan talking with the desk clerk a rumble of male laughter she stared at the door reached out and ran her fingertip down the surface as if to gauge the texture so smooth and cool odd shed never noticed that before she laid her palm on it as ryan came up beside her and pushed the up button it rumbled like the thunder she realized gears shifting engaging and the door made a soft hissing sound when it opened she didnt have any more color in her cheeks than the corpse theyd left behind ryan noted and her teeth were starting to chatter he imagined she was chilled to the bone god knew he was and not just from an open ride in drenching rain just walk down the hall he ordered shifting his bags so that he could wrap an arm around her waist she didnt lean on him didnt seem to have enough substance in her body to give weight but he kept his arm around her until they were inside the suite he locked the door added the safety latch before taking her into the bedroom get out of the wet clothes into a robe hed have preferred to dump her in a hot bath but was afraid shed just slip under and drown he checked the terrace doors made certain they too were locked before he searched out a bottle of brandy from the minibar he didnt bother with glasses she was sitting on the bed exactly as hed left her youve got to get out of those clothes he told her youre soaked through i my fingers dont work okay okay here swallow he broke the seal on the bottle then held it to her lips she obeyed mindlessly until the fire spurted down her throat and into her belly i dont like brandy i dont like spinach but my mother made me eat it one more time come on be a good soldier he managed to pour another swallow down her throat before she sputtered and pushed his hand away im all right im all right sure you are hoping to ease the queasiness in his own stomach he tipped back the bottle and took a healthy gulp himself now the clothes he set the bottle aside and went to work on the buttons of her shirt dont miranda realizing his legs werent completely steady he sat beside her does it look like im going to cop a feel here youre in shock you need to get warm and dry so do i i can do it i can she got shakily to her feet and stumbled into the bath when the door clicked shut he resisted the urge to open it again to be certain she wasnt in a heap on the floor for a moment he lowered his head into his hands ordered himself to breathe just breathe it was his first upclose and personal experience with violent death fresh violent and real he thought and took one more shot of brandy from the bottle it wasnt an experience he wanted to repeat im going to order up some food something hot he peeled out of his wet jacket as he spoke keeping an eye on the door he stripped tossed his wet clothes aside and pulled on slacks and a shirt miranda with his hands in his pockets he frowned at the door modesty be damned he decided and pushed it open shed put on a robe but her hair was still streaming with wet as she stood in the center of the room her arms wrapped tight around her body as she rocked herself she sent ryan one look of unspeakable misery giovanni okay all right he put his arms around her cradled her head on his shoulder you did good you did fine its okay to fall apart now she only clenched and unclenched her hands against his back who could have done that to him hes never hurt anyone who could have done that well figure it out we will were going to talk about it step by step he cuddled her closer stroking a hand down her wet hair as much to soothe himself as her but your mind has to be clear i need your brain i need your logic i cant think i keep seeing him lying there all the blood he was my friend he came when i asked him to he and the full horror of it struck her a brutal slice to the heart that cleared her head to shocking vicious clarity oh god ryan i killed him no he pulled her back so that their eyes were level again whoever bashed in the back of his head killed him you get over that miranda because its not going to help he was only in there tonight because of me if i hadnt asked him hed have been at home or out on a date or sitting in some trattoria drinking wine with friends she pressed her fisted hands to her mouth the eyes over them swimming with horror hes dead because i asked him to help me because i didnt trust you and because my reputation is so important so vital i had to have it done my way she shook her head im never going to get over that however miserable her eyes her color was back and her voice was stronger guilt could energize as well as paralyze okay then use it dry your hair while i order some food weve got a lot to talk about she dried her hair and slipped into white cotton pajamas then wrapped the robe over them she would eat she told herself because she would be ill if she didnt she needed to be well strong and clearheaded if she was going to avenge giovanni avenge she thought with a shudder shed never believed in vengeance now it seemed perfectly sane perfectly logical the term an eye for an eye circled grimly in her head whoever killed giovanni had used her as a weapon as coldbloodedly as theyd used the bronze whatever it took however long it took she would see that they paid for it when she came out of the bedroom she saw that ryan had ordered the waiter to set up the meal on the terrace the rain had stopped and the air was fresh the table sat cheerfully under the bright greenandwhitestriped awning and candles flickered over the linen cloth she supposed it was designed to make her feel better because she was grateful to him she did her best to pretend it did this looks very nice she managed what passed for a smile what are we eating minestrone to start then a couple of florentine steaks itll help sit and eat she took a chair even picked up her spoon and sampled the soup it stuck like paste in her throat but she forced herself to swallow and he was right the heat of it thawed some of the ice in her belly i need to apologize to you okay i never turn down an apology from a woman i broke my word to you she lifted her gaze locked on his i never meant to keep it i told myself a promise to a man like you didnt have to be kept that was wrong of me and im sorry the simplicity the quiet tone touched his heart hed have preferred it otherwise were going at this at crosspurposes thats the way it is still weve got a mutual goal we want to find the original bronzes and now someones upped the stakes it may be smarter for you to back off let this go proving you were right isnt worth your life it cost me a friend she pressed her lips together then made herself spoon up more soup i wont back off ryan i couldnt live with myself if i did i dont have many friends im sure thats my fault i dont relate well to people youre being too hard on yourself you relate fine when you let your guard down like you did with my family i didnt let my guard down they just didnt pay any attention to it i envy you what you have with them her voice trembled a little so she shook her head and forced down more soup the unconditional love the sheer delight all of you have with each other you cant buy that kind of gift she smiled a little and you cant steal it you can make it it just takes the wanting to someone has to want the gift youre making she sighed and decided to risk a sip of wine if my parents and i had a better relationship you and i wouldnt be sitting here right now it really goes back to that dysfunction doesnt always show itself in raised voices and fists sometimes it can be insidiously polite have you ever told them how you feel not the way i imagine you mean she looked past him over the city where the lights gleamed and the moon was beginning to ride the clearing sky im not sure i knew how i felt until recently and it doesnt matter now finding who did this to giovanni matters he let it rest and since hed decided it was his turn to deal with practicalities he removed the covers from the steaks nobody understands the way a slice of red meat should be treated better than the florentines tell me about giovanni it was a fist to the heart and the shock of it had her staring at him i dont know what you want me to say first tell me what you knew about him and how you came to know it it would ease her in he thought to the details he wanted most hes he was brilliant a chemist he was born here in florence and joined standjo about ten years ago he worked here primarily but did some time in the lab at the institute thats where i worked with him initially about six years ago the first time she lifted a hand and rubbed at her temple he was a lovely man sweet and funny he was single he enjoyed women and was very charming and attentive he noticed details about you if you wore a new blouse or did your hair a different way were you lovers she winced but shook her head no we were friends i respected his abilities very much i trusted his judgment and i depended on his loyalty i used his loyalty she said quietly then pushed away from the table to walk to the parapet she needed a moment to adjust yet again he was dead she couldnt change it how many times she thought for how many years would she find herself adjusting to those two single facts it was giovanni who called me to tell me the bronze had been discredited she continued he didnt want me unprepared when my mother contacted me so he was in her confidence he was part of my team here on the project and hed been called on the carpet when my findings were questioned steadier she walked back to the table sat again i used his loyalty and our friendship i knew i could today was the first time you talked to him about the bronze being a copy yes i called him when you went downstairs i asked him to meet me inside santa maria novella i told him it was urgent where did you call him at the lab i knew i could catch him before the end of the workday i took the bronzes and i went down the stairs out the back courtyard while you were at the desk he came right away it couldnt have been more than fifteen minutes enough time ryan mused for him to have told someone of the call the wrong someone what did you tell him almost everything i explained that i had the bronze that ponti had tested that it wasnt the same one wed worked on i told him as much as i could about the david i dont think he believed me but he listened she stopped pushing her steak around on her plate pretending to eat was too much effort i asked him to take the bronzes into the lab to run tests to do a comparison i said id contact him tomorrow i didnt give him the hotel because i didnt want him to call or come over i didnt want you to know what id done with the bronzes ryan sat back deciding neither of them was going to do the meal justice instead he took out a cigar that may very well be why were sitting here enjoying the moonlight what do you mean put your brain to work dr jones your friend had the bronzes and now hes dead the murder weapon and the david were left on the scene what connects the two you do he lighted the cigar to give her time to absorb the thought if the cops had found those statues on the crime scene theyd have gone hunting for you whoever did it knows youve put enough together to look for answers and that youre skirting the law enough to prevent you from bringing in the police killing giovanni to implicate me it was too cold too hideous to be contemplated and too logical to ignore an added benefit if he was straight hed have begun to wonder himself after the tests hed take another look at your notes your results thats why the lab was trashed she murmured well never find my documentation now taken or destroyed ryan agreed your friend was in the way and miranda so are you yes i see somehow it was better that way easier its more important than ever to find the original whoever replaced it killed giovanni you know what they say about killing the first ones tough after that its just business she ignored the chill that danced over her skin if that means you want to end our deal here and now i wont blame you wouldnt you he leaned back again drawing idly on the cigar he wondered how much the fact that she would think him a coward played into it and how much the need to protect her weighed on the decision hed already made i finish what i start relief spread like a river but she picked up her wineglass raised it in a halfsalute so do i chapter eighteen it was still shy of midnight when carlo left the trattoria and began to walk home hed promised his wife he wouldnt be out late the boundaries of their marriage included one evening a week for him to sit and drink and tell lies with his friends sofia had her evening as well a gossipfest at her sisters which he supposed amounted to the same thing habitually he stayed till twelve or a bit after drawing the male oasis out but just lately hed been cutting it short hed been the butt of jokes since the papers had announced his dark lady was a hoax he didnt believe it not for a minute hed held the statue in his hands hed felt the whisper of breath on his cheeks an artist recognized art but whenever he said so his friends laughed the authorities had grilled him like a criminal dio mio hed done nothing but what was right perhaps hed made a small error of judgment by taking the statue out of the villa but he had found her after all he had held her in his hands looked at her face felt her beauty and her power like wine in his blood she had transfixed him he thought now bewitched him and still in the end hed done the right thing and given her up now they tried to say she was nothing a clever scheme to dupe the art world he knew in his heart in his bones that was a lie sofia said she believed him but he knew she didnt she said it because she was loyal and loving and because it caused less arguing in front of the children the reporters hed talked to had taken down all his statements and had made him sound like a fool hed tried to talk to the american woman the one who ran the big laboratory where his lady had been taken but she wouldnt listen hed lost his temper with her demanded to speak to the dr miranda jones who had proven his lady was real the direttrice had called security and had him tossed out it had been humiliating he should never have listened to sofia he thought now as he made his way down the quiet road outside the city toward home stumbling a bit as the wine brooded in his head he should have kept the lady for himself as hed wanted to he had found her he had taken her out of the damp dark cellar and brought her into the light she belonged to him now even though they claimed she was worthless they wouldnt give her back to him he wanted her back hed called the lab in rome and demanded the return of his property he had shouted and raved and called them all liars and cheats hed even called america and left a desperate and rambling message on mirandas office machine he believed she was his link to his lady she would help him somehow he couldnt rest until he saw the lady again held her in his hands he would hire a lawyer he decided inspired by wine and the humiliation of sly laughter he would call the american woman again the one in the place called maine and convince her it was all a plot a conspiracy to steal the lady from him he remembered her picture from the papers a strong face an honest one yes she would help miranda jones she would listen to him he didnt glance behind him when he heard the oncoming car the road was clear and he was well onto the shoulder he was concentrating on the face from the papers on what he would say to this woman scientist it was miranda and the dark lady who occupied his mind when the car struck him at full speed standing on the terrace in the strong morning light miranda gazed out at the city perhaps for the first time she fully appreciated the beauty of it the end of giovannis life had irrevocably changed hers somewhere inside her a dark place would remain formed of guilt and sorrow and yet she sensed more light than she had ever known before there was an urgency to grab hold to take time to savor details the quiet kiss of the breeze that fluttered over her cheeks the flash of sun that shimmered over city and hill the warm stone under her bare feet she wanted to go down she realized to get dressed and go out and walk the streets without destination without some purpose driving every step just to look in store windows to wander along the river to feel alive miranda she drew in a breath glanced over her shoulder and saw ryan standing in the terrace doorway its a beautiful morning spring rebirth i dont think i really appreciated that before he crossed the terrace laid a hand over hers on the parapet she might have smiled if she hadnt seen the look in his eye oh god what now what happened the plumber carlo rinaldi hes dead hitandrun last night i just heard it on the news her hand turned in his gripped he was walking home near midnight there werent many more details a cold fury worked through him he had three children and another on the way it could have been an accident she wanted to cling to that thought she might have been able to if she hadnt looked into ryans eyes but it wasnt why would anyone kill him he isnt connected to the lab he cant know anything hes been making a lot of noise for all we know he might have been in on the whole thing from the beginning either way he found it he had it for several days he would have studied it he was a loose end miranda and loose ends get snipped like giovanni she moved away from him she could live with it she told herself she had to was there anything in the news about giovanni no but there will be get dressed were going out out she thought but not to wander the streets to stroll along the river to just be all right no arguments he raised an eyebrow no where what why not this time she stepped into the bedroom and closed the doors thirty minutes later they were at a phone booth and ryan was doing something hed avoided all of his life he was calling the cops he pitched his voice toward the upper scale used a nervous whisper and colloquial italian to report a body in the secondfloor lab at standjo he hung up on the rapid questions that should do it lets get moving in case the italian police have callerid are we going back to the hotel no he swung onto the bike were going to your mothers you navigate my mothers her vow not to question was swallowed up in shock why are you crazy i cant take you to my mothers i figure there wont be a nice linguine and red sauce for lunch but well catch a pizza on the way that should give it enough time for what for the cops to find the body for her to hear about it what do you figure shell do when she does shell go straight to the lab thats what im counting on that should give us a nice window to search her place were going to break into my mothers home unless she leaves a spare key under the mat put this on he pulled a ball cap out of the saddlebags the neighbors will spot that hair of yours a mile away i dont see the point in this miranda said an hour later sitting on the bike behind him half a block down from her mothers home i cant justify breaking into my mothers home rummaging through her things any paperwork dealing with your tests that was kept at the lab is a loss theres a chance she might have copies here why would she because youre her daughter it wouldnt matter to her but it matters to you ryan thought maybe maybe not is that her miranda looked back at the house caught herself ducking behind ryan like a schoolgirl playing hooky yes i guess you called this part of it attractive woman you dont look much like her thank you so much he only chuckled and watched elizabeth ruthlessly groomed in a dark suit unlock her car keeps her cool he noted you wouldnt know to look at her that shes just been told her business has been broken into and one of her employees is dead my mother isnt given to outward displays of emotion like i said youre not much like her okay well walk down from here she wont be back for a couple of hours but well do this in one to keep it simple theres nothing simple here she watched him sling his bag over his shoulder oh yes she decided her life would never be the same she was a criminal now he walked right up to the front door and rang the bell she have a staff a dog a lover she has a housekeeper i believe but not a livein she doesnt care for pets she tugged the ball cap more securely over her hair i dont know anything about her sex life he rang the bell again there wasnt much more embarrassing to his mind than stepping into what you believed was an empty home to do your job and discovering the owner was home sick with the flu he slipped out his picks and defeated the locks in little more time than if hed used a key alarm system i dont know probably okay well deal with it he stepped in saw the panel on the wall and the light indicating the system required a code he had a minute he concluded and pulling out a screwdriver removed the facing snipped a couple of wires and put it to rest because the scientist in her couldnt help but admire his quick economic efficiency she made her voice bland you make me wonder why anyone bothers with this sort of thing why not just leave the doors and windows open my sentiments exactly he winked at her then scanned the foyer nice place very appealing art a bit on the static side but attractive wheres her office she only stared at him a moment wondering why she found his casual critique of her mothers taste amusing she should have been appalled second floor to the left i think i havent spent a great deal of time here lets try it he climbed up a graceful set of stairs place could have done with a bit more color he thought a few surprises everything was as perfect as a model home and had the same unoccupied feel it was certainly classy but he much preferred his own apartment in new york or mirandas elegantly shabby house in maine he found the office feminine but not fussy polished but efficient cool but not quite brittle he wondered if it reflected the occupant and thought it likely safe i wouldnt know so look around he suggested and began to do so by tipping forward the backs of paintings here it is behind this very nice renoir print ill deal with this you go through the desk she hesitated even as a child shed known better than to enter any room of her mothers without permission she would never have strolled in and borrowed earrings or copped a spritz of perfume and she certainly would never have touched the contents of her mothers desk it appeared she was about to make up for lost time she shoved aside the conditioning of a lifetime and dived in with a great deal more enthusiasm than shed ever admit there are a lot of files here she told ryan while she flipped through most seem to be personal insurance receipts correspondence keep looking she sat in the desk chair another first and pawed through another drawer excitement was bubbling in her belly now guilty shameful excitement copies of contracts she murmured and reports i guess she does some work here oh her fingers froze the fiesole bronze she has a file take it well look through it later he listened to the last tumbler click into place now i have you my little beauty very nice very nice he whispered opening a velvet case and examining a double rope of pearls heirlooms theyd suit you put those back im not stealing them i dont do jewelry but he opened another box and hmmed at the glitter of diamonds very classy earrings about three carats each squarecut looks like russian whites probably first water i thought you didnt do jewelry doesnt mean i dont have an interest these would be killers with your ring its not my ring she said primly but her gaze shifted to the diamond winking on her finger its window dressing right look at this he pulled out a thin plastic holder look familiar the x rays she was away from the desk and grabbing for them in two thumping heartbeats the computer printouts look look at them its there you can see it the corrosion level just look its there its real suddenly swamped with emotion she pressed the heel of her hand to her brow and squeezed her eyes shut its there i wasnt wrong i didnt make a mistake i never thought you did she opened her eyes again smiled liar you broke into my bedroom and threatened to strangle me i said i could strangle you he circled her throat with his hands again and that was before i knew you tidy up honey weve got enough to keep us busy for a while they spent the next several hours in the hotel suite with miranda going over the copies of her reports line by line and ryan huddled at his computer its all here everything i did stage by stage every test every result admittedly its light on documentation but it stands why didnt she see that take a look at this and see if ive got it right what ive done a crosscheck he motioned her over these are the names i come up with people who had access to both bronzes theres probably more but these are the key players she rose and read over his shoulder she only set her teeth when she noted her name topped the list her mother was there as was her father andrew giovanni elise carter hawthorne vincente andrew didnt have access to the dark lady a tendril of the hair shed pinned up fell and tickled his cheek the immediate tightening of his loins had him letting out a long quiet breath if nothing else he thought her hair was going to drive him to drink before they were done hes connected to you your mother and elise close enough she sniffed and shoved her glasses more securely on her nose thats insulting i want to know how accurate it is save the comments its fairly complete and insulting oh yeah there was that prissy tone of voice too it just destroyed him with wanting to turn it into moans was hawthornes wife with him in florence no richards divorced what the hell he thought and tortured himself by turning his head just enough to get a good solid sniff of her hair was he a couple when he did his stint in maine i dont know i barely met him in fact i didnt remember him until he reminded me wed met annoyed she turned her head found her eyes locked on his and something in his wasnt focused on work her heart did a quick cartwheel and shot little springs of lust into her belly why does it matter why does what matter he wanted that mouth goddamn it he was entitled to that mouth the uh richard being divorced because people tell their lovers and spouses all kinds of confidential things sex he murmured and wrapped that loose tendril around his finger is a great communicator one tug he thought one little tug and her mouth would be on his hed have all that hair in his hands all the wild curling mass of it hed have her naked in five minutes except for the glasses he was starting to have incredible fantasies about miranda wearing only her glasses it was with real regret that he didnt tug but unwound her hair turned and scowled at the screen we need to go through the worker bees too but we need a break a break there wasnt a single organized thought in her mind her nerves were sizzling along the surface of her skin like little licks of lightning if he touched her now if he kissed her now she knew shed go off like a rocket she straightened closed her eyes and yearned what did you have in mind lets put this away and go have a meal her eyes popped open again a what food dr jones he tapped keys concentrating and didnt see her scrub her hands over her face behind his back yes food her voice shook slightly laughter or despair she couldnt be sure good idea what would you like for your last night in florence the last night things might get sticky here were better off working on home ground but if the dark lady is here well come back for her he shut off his machine pushed away from the little desk florence isnt a big city dr jones sooner or later someone you know is going to spot you he flicked a finger over her hair you just dont blend now fast fancy or rowdy home she discovered she very much wanted to go home to see it with these new eyes i think id like rowdy for a change excellent choice i know just the place it was loud it was crowded and the harsh lights bounced off the unapologetically garish paintings that crowded the wall they suited the hanks of hanging sausages and whole smoked hams that were the restaurants primary decor tables were pushed together so that diners friends and strangers alike ate the hearty portions of meat and pasta elbow to elbow they were wedged in a corner by a round man with a stained apron who took ryans order for a bottle of local red with a nod at mirandas left was one half of a gay american couple who were touring europe they shared a basket of bread while ryan engaged them in conversation with an ease and openness miranda admired she would never have talked to strangers in a restaurant except in the most limited fashion but by the time the wine was set on the table and poured she knew they were from new york ran a restaurant in the village and had been together for ten years it was they said their anniversary trip its our second honeymoon enjoying himself ryan picked up mirandas hand and kissed it right abby darling at sea she stared at him then responded to his light kick under the table oh yes um we couldnt afford a honeymoon when we were first married kevin was just getting started and i was only a junior exec at the agency now were treating ourselves before kids come along stunned at herself she gulped down wine while ryan beamed at her it was worth the wait you breathe romance with every inhale in florence defying every law of physics the waiter pushed his way through the excuse for space between the tables and demanded what they wanted less than an hour later miranda wanted more wine its wonderful its a wonderful place she shifted in her chair to smile affectionately at a table of brits who chatted in polite voices while a table of germans beside them downed local beer and sang i never go to places like this it all spun in her head scents voices wine i wonder why want some dessert sure i do eat drink and be merry she poured another glass of wine and grinned tipsily at him i love it here yes i can see that he nudged the bottle farther out of her reach and signaled the waiter werent they a nice couple she smiled sentimentally at the space their table companions had recently vacated they were really in love were going to look em up right when we get home no when they get home were going home tomorrow well try the zabaglione ryan told the waiter eyeing miranda under lifted brows as she began to hum along with the drunk germans and cappuccino id rather have more wine not a good idea why not filled with love for her fellowman she picked up her glass and drained it i like it its your head he said with a shrug when she snagged the bottle again keep it up and youre not going to have a pleasant flight home im a very good flier eyes narrowed she poured until the wine was precisely a halfinch from the rim of the glass see that steady as a rock dr jones is always steady she giggled and leaned forward conspiratorially but abbys a lush kevin is more than a little concerned that shes going to pass out at the table so that he has to carry her home nah she rubbed the back of her hand over her nose dr jones wouldnt permit that too embarrassing lets walk down by the river i want to walk by the river in the moonlight abbyll let you kiss her thats an interesting offer but i think wed better get you home i love maine she leaned back swinging the glass in her hand i love the cliffs and the fog and the waves crashing and the lobster boats im going to plant a garden this year im really going to do it mmmm this was her opinion of the creamy dessert set in front of her i like indulging she set the glass down long enough to dive a spoon in i never knew that about me she said with her mouth full try the coffee he suggested i want the wine but when she grabbed for it he snatched it up can i interest you in something else she studied him thoughtfully then grinned bring me the head of the baptist she ordered then collapsed into giggles did you really steal his bones i just cant understand a man whod steal the bones of a saint but its fascinating time to go ryan decided and quickly dug out more than enough lire to cover the tab lets take that walk honey okay she popped up then had to brace a hand against the wall oh my theres quite a bit of gravity in here maybe theres not as much outside he scooped an arm around her waist and pulled her through the restaurant laughing himself as she called cheerful goodbyes youre a handful dr jones what was the name of that wine it was lovely wine i want to buy a case of it you were doing a good job of working your way through a case he guided her along the uneven sidewalk across the quiet street grateful theyd opted to walk rather than take the scooter hed have had to tie her on im going to paint my shutters good idea your mother has yellow shutters so cheerful everyone in your family is so cheerful wrapping an arm around his waist in turn she led him in a wide drunken circle but i think a nice bright blue would suit my house a nice bright blue and ill put a rocker on the front porch nothing like a porch rocker watch your step up the curb atta girl i broke into my mothers house today i heard that somewhere im sharing a hotel suite with a thief and i broke into my mothers house coulda robbed her blind you only had to ask left turn thats the way almost there it was great what was the breaking in i didnt want to say so at the time but it was great she threw up her arms and caught him neatly on the chin maybe you could teach me how to pick locks wouldya do that ryan oh yeah thats going to happen he wiggled his jaw and steered her toward the front entrance of the hotel i could seduce it out of you she turned plowing into him at the edge of the elegant lobby carpet and crushed her mouth against his before he could gain his balance this time his head spun as she sucked the blood right out of it miranda thats abby to you pal she murmured as the desk clerk discreetly averted his eyes so how about it lets talk upstairs he dragged her toward the elevator and out of sight dont want to talk she plastered herself against him and attacked his earlobe with her teeth i want wild crazy sex right now who doesnt said the male half of a formally dressed couple who stepped off the elevator see miranda pointed out as ryan yanked her into the car he agrees with me i wanted to jump you ever since i saw you and heard the ping ping he was becoming breathless trying to unwind her from around him i hear pings with you my heads just full of pings right now kiss me again ryan you know you want to cut it out a little desperately he shoved at her hands before they could unbutton his shirt youre hammered what do you care she threw back her head and laughed youve been trying to get me into bed all along nows your chance there are rules he muttered lurching like a drunk as she draped herself over him one of them he thought needed a cold shower oh now therere rules laughing she tugged his shirt free of his slacks as her hands streaked over his back around to his belly he fought to shoot the key into the lock god help me miranda jesus christ those busy hands had worked their way down look i said no his eyes were crossed when they stumbled inside together get ahold of yourself cant got ahold of you she released him only long enough to bounce up wrap her legs around his waist fist her hands in his hair and fuse her mouth to his i want you oh i want you her breath came fast as her lips raced over his face make love with me touch me i want your hands on me they already were he couldnt stop them from molding that tight lovely bottom his blood was screaming for her his tongue tangling with hers the little beam of sanity that remained in his mind was growing dimmer youre going to hate both of us in the morning so what she laughed again and her eyes were wildly blue as they looked into his she shook back her hair turning his system into one pulsing gland this is now fall into the moment with me ryan i dont want to go there alone their gazes remained locked as he carried her through the doorway into the bedroom then lets see how long now can last and remember dr jones he caught her bottom lip in his teeth bit tugged released you asked for it they fell on the bed together with the moonlight streaming through the doors and shadows dancing in the corners the weight of him thrilled her the hard lines of his body pressing hers onto the mattress their mouths met again in a kiss that was near violent with greed then went on and on with tongues hotly tangled teeth nipping she wanted all then more everything then the impossible and knew with him shed find it she molded herself to him unwilling to take the passive role now the rough movements made her head spin her breath come out on moaning laughter oh god she was free and alive so alive in her rush to feel flesh she tugged at his shirt popping buttons off the elegant silk oh yes she whispered when he ripped the sleeve of her blouse hurry he couldnt have slowed the pace any more than he could stop time his quick and clever hands were rough as they yanked off her bra then filled themselves with her breasts white as marble soft as water when touch wasnt enough he twisted her under him again and devoured she cried out arching as his lips and teeth and tongue laid siege to her her nails dug into his back scraped along the tensed ridge of muscle as shock waves of pleasure swarmed through her body sensations slammed into her in a riotous confusion of glorious aches and dark delights and raw nerves now now right now but his mouth streaked down her torso not yet not nearly yet he yanked the neat cotton slacks down her hips and plunged his tongue into the center of that driving heat she came instantly violently all but paralyzing them both with the glory of it she sobbed out his name her fingers tangling in his hair as release built back to need and need ground desperately toward demand her body was a miracle a work of art with long legs and torso milkpale skin quivering muscles he wanted to savor it to lick his way up then down again he wanted to bury his face in that free fall of hair until he was deaf and blind but the animal inside him clawed frantically for freedom they rolled again wrestling over the bed and tormenting each other with nips and gropes vision blurred lungs burned as another orgasm erupted raging through her system spiking it with outrageous energy her breath was a series of short screams burning in her chest her body unbearably awake to every touch every taste his face seemed to swim over hers then came into focus every feature distinct as if etched with a diamond on glass their breath mingled her hips arched up and he drove into her all movement stopped for one humming and timeless instant joined with him buried deep inside her they watched each other slowly in one long stroke she took her hands down his back then gripped his hips together they began to move the speed building and rising bodies slick with sweat sliding pleasure tumbling over pleasure until it battered the system and overpowered the mind all and then more she thought dizzily as she climbed toward the peak everything then the impossible she found it as she clamped herself around him and shattered chapter nineteen it was the brilliant wash of sunlight that woke her for one horrible moment she thought her eyes were on fire and beat on them with her open palms before she was fully coherent she discovered she was not spontaneously combusting and that she was not alone in bed the best she could manage was a muffled moan as she squeezed her aching eyes shut again what had she done well it was pretty obvious what shed done in fact if memory served shed done it twice in between which ryan had made her swallow three aspirin and a small ocean of water she supposed it was that small consideration that was currently keeping her head in place on her shoulders cautiously she slid her glance over he was flat on his stomach his face buried in the pillow she imagined he wasnt too wild about the brilliance of the sun either but neither of them had had their mind on pulling the drapes the night before oh good god shed jumped him groped at him torn at his clothes like a madwoman and even now in the full light of day her mouth watered at the thought of doing it all again slowly hoping to preserve her dignity as least long enough to get into the shower she eased from the bed he didnt move a muscle or make a sound and thankful for this small blessing she made the dash into the bathroom fortunately for her state of mind she didnt see him pop one eye open and grin at her naked butt she talked to herself through the shower pitifully grateful for the hot steam of the water it eased some of the aches away but the deeper ones the sweeter ones that she accepted came from good healthy sex remained she took another three aspirin anyway hoping he was on the terrace when she came out chatting casually with the room service waiter since it was too late to duck back inside she managed a small smile for both of them buon giorno the day is beautiful you enjoy the waiter took the signed bill with a small bow grazie buon appetito he left them alone with a table full of food and a pigeon who walked along the ledge of the terrace wall eyeing the offerings avariciously well i she stuffed her hands in her robe pockets because they wanted to flutter have some coffee he suggested he wore soft gray slacks and a black shirt that made him look very at ease and cosmopolitan and made her remember her hair was damp and tangled she nearly leaped at the diversion but shook her head she was a woman who faced the music squarely ryan last night i think i should apologize really he poured two cups of coffee and made himself comfortable at the table i had too much to drink thats not an excuse just a fact darling you were plowed cute too he added studying her as he added jam to a croissant and amazingly agile she closed her eyes gave in and sat down my behavior was inexcusable and regrettable and im sorry i put you in a very awkward position i recall several positions he sipped his coffee charmed at the faint blush that worked its way up her throat none of which were the least awkward she picked up her coffee sipped fast and scalded her tongue why does it need to be excused he wondered choosing a little cake from the basket and putting it on her plate whats the point in regrets did we hurt anyone the issue is the issue if there has to be one is were both single unattached healthy grownups who have a strong attraction for each other last night we acted on it he took the cover from a glistening golden omelet i for one enjoyed myself very much he cut the omelet in two and added a portion to her plate how about you shed been conscientiously set to humiliate herself to apologize to take full responsibility why wasnt he letting her youre missing the point no im not i dont agree with the point youre fumbling to make ah there a little flash of that chilly temper in your eyes much better now while i appreciate the fact that youre sensible enough not to put the blame on me for taking advantage of the situation as you were tearing off my clothes its just as foolish to blame yourself im blaming the wine she said stiffly no you already said that wasnt an excuse he laughed took her hand and put a fork in it i wanted to make love with you the minute i saw you wanted it more the longer i knew you you fascinate me miranda now eat your eggs before they get cold she stared down at her plate it wasnt possible to be annoyed with him i dont have casual sex you call that casual he blew out a long breath god help me when we get serious she felt her lips twitch and gave up it was fabulous im glad you remember i wasnt sure how clear your mind would be i wish we had more time here he toyed with her damp hair florence is good to lovers she took a long breath looked directly into his eyes and made what for her was an unprecedented commitment maines beautiful in the spring he smiled and stroked a finger down her cheek im going to enjoy experiencing it the dark lady stood under a single beam of light the one who studied her sat in the dark the mind was cold calm and clear as it had been when murder was done murder had not been planned the driving forces had been power and what was right if all had gone correctly if all had gone well violence would not have been necessary but it had not gone correctly or well so adjustments had been made the blame for the loss of two lives lay with the theft of the david who could have anticipated who could have controlled such an event it would be termed a wild card yes a wild card but murder was not as abhorrent as one would think that too brought power nothing and no one could substantiate the existence of the dark lady and be permitted to exist that was simple fact it would be taken care of it would be dealt with cleanly completely and finally when the time was right it would end with miranda it was a pity such a bright and clever mind had to be destroyed reputation alone would have sufficed once now everything had to be taken there was no room for sentiment in science or in power an accident perhaps though suicide would be best yes suicide it would be so satisfying how odd not to have anticipated how satisfying her death would be it would take some thought some planning it would take a smile spread as slyly as that on the glorious face of the bronze it would take patience when the dark lady was left alone under that single beam of light there was no one to hear the quiet laughter of the damned or the mad spring was drifting over maine there was a softness in the air that hadnt been there even a week before or at least miranda hadnt felt it on its hill the old house stood with its back to the sea its windows going gold in the setting sun it was good to be home she stepped inside and found andrew in the den keeping company with a bottle of jack daniels her quietly optimistic mood plummeted he got to his feet quickly swaying a little she noted that it took his eyes several seconds to focus that he hadnt shaved in the last day or two that his clothes were wrinkled he was she realized well drunk and likely had been for a couple of days whereve you been he took a couple of lurching steps then caught her up in a sloppy hug ive been worried about you i called everybody i could think of nobody knew where youd gone despite the heavy fumes of whiskey that hung around him she knew his concern was sincere though she hugged him back wanting that connection her intention of telling him everything wavered how much could a drunk be trusted im on leave she reminded him i left you a note yeah and it didnt tell me dick he drew back studied her face then patted her head with one of his big hands when the old man came to the institute i knew we were hipdeep i got back here as soon as i could but you were already gone they didnt leave me any choice did he come down hard on you no more than expected he shrugged that off even with the whiskey hampering his instincts he could see something was different whats going on miranda whatd you do i went away for a few days she made the decision to keep what she knew to herself with regret i ran into ryan boldari in new york she turned away because she was a poor liar under the best of circumstances and had never lied to andrew hes back in maine now hes going to stay here for a few days here yes i were involved youre oh he ran his tongue around his teeth and tried to think okay that was quick not really we have a lot in common she didnt want to dwell on that has there been any progress in the investigation we hit a snag we cant find the documentation on the david though shed been expecting this her stomach jumped she ran a nervous hand over her hair and prepared to continue the deception cant find it it should be in the fries i know where it should be miranda irritated he picked up the bottle and poured another drink its not there its not anywhere in the institute ive looked everywhere he pressed his fingers to his eyes insurance companys balking if we dont come up with it were going to take the loss you did the testing yes she said carefully i did the testing i authenticated the piece and the documentation was properly filed you know that andrew you worked on it too yeah well its gone now the insurance companys rejecting the claim until they have documents our mother is threatening to come in and see why were so inept that we lose not only a fine piece of art but its paperwork and cooks giving me the fucking fish eye im sorry i left you alone with this sorrier now that she could see how he was handling it andrew please she walked over and took the glass out of his hand i cant talk to you when youre drunk he only smiled dimples popping into his cheeks im not drunk yet yes you are shed been there herself recently enough to know the signs you need to get into a program the dimples faded jesus christ was all he could think just what he needed what i need is a little cooperation and support irked he snatched the glass back and took a long gulp maybe youre sorry you left me alone with this but thats just what you did and if i want a few drinks after a miserable day of dealing with the police running the institute and tap dancing for our parents its nobodys fucking business as she stared at him her chest tightened squeezing her heart with the pressure i love you the words hurt just a little because she knew neither of them said them often enough i love you andrew and youre killing yourself in front of my eyes that makes it my business there were tears in her eyes and in her voice that played on his guilt and infuriated fine ill kill myself in private then it wont be any of your goddamn business he grabbed the bottle and strode out he hated himself for it for putting that disappointment and hurt in the eyes of the only person hed ever been able to fully depend on but goddamn it to hell and back it was his life he slammed the door of his bedroom didnt notice the stench of stale whiskey from his binge the night before he sat in a chair and drank straight from the bottle he was entitled to relax wasnt he he got his work done he did his job for all the good it did him so why did he have to get grief for having a couple of drinks or a couple dozen he thought with a snicker who was counting maybe the blackouts worried him a little those weird and empty pockets of time he couldnt seem to account for that was probably stress and a good stiff drink was the best solution to stress you bet it was he told himself he missed his wife though it was becoming more and more difficult to bring up a clear picture of her face or to remember the exact pitch of her voice occasionally when he was sober he had a flash of truth he didnt love elise any longer and maybe had never loved her as much as he liked to think so he drank to blot out that truth and allowed himself to enjoy the sense of betrayal and misery he was beginning to see the value of drinking alone now that annie had barred him from her place alone you could drink until you couldnt stand and when you couldnt stand you lay down and passed out it got a man through the night a man had to get through the night he thought brooding at the bottle before tipping it back again it wasnt that he had to drink he was in control of it and could quit whenever he wanted he didnt want that was all still hed stop cold turkey just to prove to miranda to annie to every damn body they were wrong about him people had always been wrong about him he decided stewing in resentment beginning with his parents theyd never known who the hell he was what he wanted much less what the hell he needed so fuck them fuck all of them hed quit drinking all right tomorrow he thought with another chuckle as he lifted the bottle he saw the lights cut across the room headlights he decided after a long wavering study where his mind blinked out and his mouth hung open companys coming probably boldari he took another long gulp and grinned to himself miranda had a boyfriend hed get some mileage out of that it had been a long time since hed been able to tease his sister over something as interesting as a man might as well get started on it now he decided he got to his feet snorting with laughter as the room revolved join the circus see the world he thought and stumbled toward the door hed just find out what old ryan boldaris intentions were yes indeed he had to show that slick new yorker that little miranda had herself a big brother looking out for her he took another long chug from the bottle as he lurched down the hall and grabbing the banister at the top of the steps looked down there was his baby sister right at the foot of the steps in a hot liplock with new york hey he called out gesturing wildly with the bottle then laughing when miranda whirled around whatcha doing with my sister mr new york hello andrew hello andrew my ass you sleeping with my sister you bastard not at the moment he kept his arm around mirandas rigid shoulders well i wanna talk to you buddy andrew started down made it halfway on his feet and tumbled the rest it was like watching a boulder fall down a cliff miranda leaped forward kneeling beside his sprawled body there was blood on his face which terrified her oh god andrew im all right im all right he muttered shoving at her hands as they poked and probed for broken bones just took a little spills all you could have broken your neck steps are a tricky thing ryan said mildly he crouched beside miranda noting that the cut on andrews forehead was shallow and mirandas hands were shaking why dont we get you back up them clean you up shit andrew brushed his fingers over his forehead studied the smear of blood look at that ill get the firstaid kit ryan glanced over at miranda shed gone pale again but her eyes were shuttered well take care of it come on andrew my brother tripped over a curb the night of his bachelor party and did more damage than this he was hauling andrew to his feet as miranda got to hers but when she started to go up with them ryan shook his head at her no women this is a guy thing right andrew damn right boozily he made ryan his best friend women are the root of all evil god love them i had one for a while she dumped me who needs her ryan steered andrew to the left thats the spirit i cant see a fucking thing theres blood dripping into your eye thank christ thought id been struck blind know what ryan boldari pal whats that im going to be really sick now oh yeah ryan dragged him into the bathroom you are what a family ryan thought as he held andrews head and wondered vaguely if it was possible to throw up internal organs if not andrew was giving it the old college try by the time it was over andrew was wrecked white as death and trembling it took three tries for ryan to prop him on the toilet seat so he could deal with the cut on his face mustve been the fall andrew said weakly you threw up the best part of a fifth ryan said as he wiped blood and sweat away you embarrassed yourself and your sister took a header that would have snapped several bones if they hadnt been permeated with whiskey you smell like a four oclock bar and look worse sure it was the fall andrew closed his eyes he wanted to curl up somewhere and sleep until he died maybe i had a couple too many wouldnt have if miranda hadnt started on me save the lame excuses youre a drunk ruthlessly ryan swabbed antiseptic over the wound and felt no sympathy when andrew sucked in his breath at least be man enough to take the responsibility for it fuck you thats a clever and original comeback you shouldnt need stitches but youre going to have a hell of a black eye to go with the war wound satisfied he pulled andrews ruined shirt over his head hey you need a shower pal trust me i just want to go to bed for gods sake i just want to lie down i think im dying not yet but youre on your way grimly ryan pulled him to his feet bracing himself to hold the weight while he reached out and turned on the shower he decided it was more trouble than it was worth to remove andrews pants so dragged him half dressed into the tub jesus im going to be sick again then aim for the drain ryan suggested and held him in place even when andrew began to sob like a baby it took the best part of an hour to pour andrew into bed when he came downstairs ryan noted that the shattered glass from the bottle had been swept up and the splash of whiskey that had hit walls and floors on the fall had been scrubbed when he couldnt find miranda in the house he grabbed a jacket and headed outside she was on the cliffs he studied the silhouette she made there alone tall slender against the night sky with her hair blowing free and her face turned to the sea not just alone he thought lonely he didnt think hed ever seen anyone lonelier he climbed up to her draped the jacket over her shoulders shed managed to steady herself somehow the restless tossing of the sea could always calm her im terribly sorry you were dragged into that her voice was cool he noted automatic defense her body was stiff and still turned away from him i wasnt dragged in i was here he laid his hands on her shoulders but she stepped away thats the second time youve had to deal with an embarrassingly drunk jones one nights foolishness is a long distance from what your brothers doing to himself miranda however true that is it doesnt change the facts we behaved badly and you cleaned up the mess i dont know if i could have handled andrew tonight by myself but i would have preferred it thats too bad annoyed he spun her around to face him because i was here and im going to be here for a while until we find the bronzes thats right and if im not done with you by then he cupped her face lowered his head and took her mouth in an angry and possessive kiss youll have to deal with it i dont know how to deal with it her voice rose over the crash of waves im not equipped for this for you every relationship ive ever had has ended badly i dont know how to handle that kind of emotional tangle no one in my family does so they just untangle at the first possible opportunity youve never tangled with me before it was said with such blatant arrogance she might have laughed instead she turned away stared at the steady circling beam from the lighthouse he would be the one to run when it was done she thought and this time with him she was desperately afraid she would suffer it didnt matter that she understood why he was there what his primary purpose was she would suffer when he left her everything thats happened since i met you is foreign to me i dont function well without guidelines youve been winging it pretty well so far two men are dead ryan my reputations in ruins my family is more divided than ever ive broken the law ive ignored ethics and im having an affair with a criminal but you havent been bored have you she let out a weak laugh no i dont know what to do next i can help you with that he took her hand and began to walk tomorrows soon enough to take the next steps soon enough to talk about what they should be i need to put everything in order she glanced back toward the house i should check on andrew first then organize andrews asleep and hes not going to surface until tomorrow organizing takes a clear focused mind youve got too much on yours to be clear or focused excuse me but organization is my life i can organize three different projects outline a lecture and teach a class at the same time youre a frightening woman dr jones then lets say im not clear or focused and ive never been inside a lighthouse he studied it as they approached enjoying the way its beam cut through the dark and lay shimmering on the surface of the sea how old is it she let out a breath if it was avoidance so be it it was built in the structure is original though my grandfather had the interior revamped in the forties with the idea of using it as his art studio the fact is according to my grandmother he used it for illicit sexual affairs because it amused him to have them within sight of the house and in such an obviously phallic symbol good old grandpa he was only one of the insufferable emotionally stunted joneses his father again according to my grandmother who was the only one who would discuss such matters flaunted his mistresses in public and conceived several illegitimate children he refused to acknowledge my grandfather carried on that lofty tradition the joneses of jones point are many she waited for the insult to sink in then shook her head it was amusement she felt instead yes i suppose so in any case my greatgrandmother chose to ignore his habits and spent most of the year in europe avenging herself by squandering as much of his money as was possible unfortunately she chose to travel back to the states on a luxurious new ship they called it the titanic really ryan was close enough to see the rusted lock on the thick wooden door cool well she and her children boarded a lifeboat and were rescued but she caught pneumonia from the exposure in the north atlantic and died of it a few weeks later her husband mourned by taking up with an opera singer shortly thereafter he was killed when the opera singers husband being somewhat displeased with the arrangement set the house where they were living in sin on fire i imagine he died happy ryan took a leatherman knife kit out of his pocket chose his tool and went to work on the lock dont i have a key in the house if you want to see the inside this is more fun and quicker see he replaced the knife opened the door damp he said and took out his penlight to shine it around the large lower room yet cozy the walls were paneled with oldfashioned knotty pine that reminded him of a suburban rec room from the fifties various shapes were tucked efficiently under holland covers and a small fireplace layered with cold gray ash was built into the far side he thought it was a shame that whoever had designed this area had chosen to build in the walls to square them off rather than going with the round so is this where grandpa entertained his ladies i imagine she pulled the jacket more securely around her shoulders the air inside was chilly and stale my grandmother detested him but she stayed in the marriage raised my father then nursed her husband through the last two years of his life she was a wonderful woman strong stubborn she loved me he turned back skimmed the back of his hand over her face of course she did theres no of course when it comes to love in my family because she saw the flicker of sympathy in his eyes she turned away youd see more in here if you wait for daylight he said nothing for a moment he remembered hed once thought she had a cold streak it was rare for him to be so completely wrong when analyzing a mark shed been a mark then and now that was something to think about later it wasnt coldness inside her but a wellbuilt defense against hurts of a lifetime from neglect indifference from the very coldness hed believed lived in her he walked around pleased when he spotted both an oil lamp and candles he lighted both appreciating the eerie glow they gave the room spooky he put his penlight away and grinned at her you ever come in here as a kid and look for ghosts dont be ridiculous honey you had a deprived childhood well have to make up for that come on what are you doing going up he was already climbing the metal tightwinder stairs dont touch anything she scurried after him as the lights he carried sent bobbing glows and shadows against the walls its all automated now he found a small bedroom with little more than a stripped mattress that looked inhabitable and a scruffy chest of drawers the grandmother he decided had likely pirated the place of any valuables good for her he walked over and admired the view from the portholestyle window the sea raged sliced by the light churning under it through it small islands like humped backs brooded off the ragged coastline he caught the sway of buoys heard the hollow bong of them punch through the sweeping crash and suck of sea great spot drama danger and challenge its rarely calm she said from behind him theres a view of the bay from the other window some days or nights the water there is as smooth as glass it looks as though you could walk on it all the way to shore he glanced over his shoulder which do you like best im fond of both but i suppose im usually drawn to the sea restless spirits are drawn to restless spirits she frowned at that brooding after him as he moved out of the room no one she thought would term her a restless spirit least of all herself dr miranda jones was stable as granite she thought and often too often just as boring with a vague shrug she followed him into the pilot room amazing place he was already ignoring her order and touching what he chose the equipment was efficiently modern and hummed along as the great lights circled overhead the room was round as it should have been with a narrow ledge circling outside the iron rails were rusted but he found them charming when he stepped out the wind slapped at him like an insulted woman and made him laugh fabulous damned if i wouldnt have brought my women here too romantic sexy and just a little scary you ought to fix it up he said glancing back at her itd make a terrific studio i dont need a studio you would if you worked on your art the way you should be im not an artist he smiled stepped back inside and closed out the wind i happen to be a very important art broker and i say you are cold a little she was hugging herself inside the jacket its very damp in here youre going to have rot if you dont deal with that that would be a crime im also an expert on crime he put his hands on her arms rubbing to warm her with friction the sea sounds different from in here mysterious almost threatening during a good nor easter it would sound a lot more threatening the light still functions to guide ships and keep them from coining too close to the shallows and the rocks even with it there were a number of wrecks off the coast last century the ghosts of shipwrecked sailors rattling bones haunting the shore hardly i can hear them he slipped his arms around her moaning for mercy you hear the wind she corrected but hed managed to draw a shudder out of her seen enough not nearly he lowered his mouth to nibble on hers but i intend to she tried to wiggle free boldari if you think you can seduce me inside a damp and dusty lighthouse youre delusional is that a dare he nipped around to the side of her neck no its a fact but the muscles in her thighs were already going lax he had the most inventive tongue theres a perfectly good bedroom in the house several in fact theyre warm convenient and have excellent mattresses well have to try them out later have i mentioned what a delightful body you have dr jones his hands were already busy exploring it those quick and clever fingers flipped open the hook of her slacks drew the zipper down before she could do more than gasp out a protest ryan this isnt the place for it was good enough for grandpa he reminded her then slowly slipped his fingers inside her she was already hot already wet and he kept his eyes on hers watching them go blind and dark and desperate just let go i want to feel you come right here i want to watch what i do to you take you over her body gave her no choice it hummed like a welloiled machine toward one purpose one goal the long deep thrill slid through her a sudden tangling of circuits a sparking of nerve ends then a long liquid wave of pleasure that swamped the system her head fell back on a moan and he moved in to ravage the exposed column of her throat still cold he murmured no god no her skin was on fire her blood pumping like a hot river beneath it gripping his shoulders for balance she rocked against his busy hand now when his mouth came back to hers she answered the demand with one of her own time and place were nothing against the hard and driving need her slacks pooled at her feet the jacket slipped from her shoulders pliant as softened wax she molded against him as he braced her on the counter where equipment whirred efficiently to send the light circling the sea lift your arms miranda she obeyed her breath snagging on every inhale as he slowly slipped her sweater up he watched nervy pleasure flicker over her face as he used his thumbs to trace her nipples through the thin fabric of her bra no wine tonight to blur the edges his fingers skimmed lightly over the swell above the simple white silk i want you to feel everything to wonder what youll feel next he nudged one strap down with a fingertip then the other lowered his head to nibble at her bare shoulders it was like being sampled she thought as her heavy eyes shut savored lavishly savored his tongue licked lightly over her flesh his teeth grazed and his fingertips slid up and down up and down the sides of her body gradually thrillingly lowering the thin swatch of cotton at her hips he stood intimately between her spread legs while she gripped the edge of the counter and understood what it was to be completely under someone elses control to want to be to crave it everything he did to her was a shock a jolt to the ruthlessly ordered pattern of her mind that only seconds later was desired again and welcomed a part of her brain knew the image she made almost naked skin flushed body arched in surrender while the man who handled her was fully dressed but when he slipped the bra aside lowered that skilled mouth to her breast she didnt care he hadnt known she could be like this or how powerful an arousal it was to have a strong and cautious woman yield to him completely she was his utterly to take pleasure from to give pleasure to but the thrill of that rather than dark and edgy was almost unbearably tender the backwash from the great light slid over her turning her skin to brilliant white then it was gone leaving her glowing gold in the flicker of candlelight her hair so recently chased by the wind tumbled like silken fire over her shoulders her mouth soft and swollen parted under his the kiss deepened wanned and delved beyond the heady desire neither had anticipated for a moment they clung together staggered and trembled it was like a dream now where the air was thick and sweet hot candy melted over slow heat neither noticed the damp or the chill they lowered to a floor that was layered with dust that was hard and cold and drew together as gently as a couple on a feather bed without words she removed his shirt her hands steady and she pressed her lips to his heart lingering there because she knew that somehow hed stolen hers he wanted to give her tenderness here the compassion in mating as well as the thrill so he was gentle with his mouth with his hands loving her in a way that gleamed with emotion as well as need a murmur a sigh a long slow arch toward warm waves that cradled rather than battered so when she wrapped around him pressing her face into his throat he stroked he soothed he gave himself the gift of that same tenderness when he shifted her over him cupping her hips until she took him in took him deep she knew what it was to love her lover chapter twenty miranda awoke beside ryan for the second morning in a row and on another continent it was an oddly thrilling experience that seemed both carelessly wicked and decidedly sophisticated sinning in style she had an urge to comb her fingers through his hair play them over his face explore that dashing little scar over his eye foolish sentimental little strokes and pats that might lead to slow and lazy morning sex it was so odd all these feelings crowding inside of her taking up room she hadnt known she had in store warming up places shed assumed would always stay cool and uninhabited so much more inside her now she thought than that first hot gush of lust too much more and it left her completely vulnerable and that was terrifying so instead of touching what she wanted to touch she eased out of bed and tiptoed into the shower as she had done the morning before this time however shed barely dunked her head under the spray when arms slid around her waist why do you do that she waited until her heart had dropped back in place do what sneak out of bed in the morning ive seen you naked already i didnt sneak she tried to wiggle free but his teeth clamped lightly on her shoulder i just didnt want to wake you i know a sneak when i see one he lifted a brow at her mutter and saying pot and kettle doesnt apply i have never sneaked out of a womans bed in yes out no very funny now if youll excuse me im trying to shower ill help you more than willing to assist he picked up the soap sniffed it then began to rub it over her back it was he thought a very excellent back i mastered the art of the shower years ago i can do it solo why because her voice had been delightfully prim he turned her around snuggling her wet slippery body against his because its she could feel her color rise and hated it its personal oh i see he said tongue planted in cheek and the sex wasnt personal its different okay with his eyes laughing into hers he skimmed his soapslicked hands over her breasts well compromise and combine the two it was far from the brisk and basic hygiene shed had in mind when she was gulping in steam and quaking from the aftershocks he nuzzled at her throat that he said was personal then he sighed i have to go to mass what she shook her head sure there was water in her ears did you say you had to go to mass easter sunday yes yes it is struggling to keep up with him she shoved dripping hair out of her eyes it seems like an odd line of thought under the circumstances they might not have had the benefit of indoor plumbing in biblical times but they had plenty of sex she supposed he had a point but it still made her vaguely uncomfortable to think of religion when his wet hands were sliding over her wet butt youre catholic at his lifted brow she shook her head yes i know irish and italian what else could you do i didnt realize you practiced mostly im lapsed he stepped out of the shower handed her a towel and got one for himself and if you tell my mother i said that ill swear youre a dirty rotten liar but its easter sunday he gave his hair a quick rub then draped the towel around his hips if i dont go to mass my mother will kill me i see i feel obliged to point out that your mother isnt here shell know he said it mournfully she always knows and ill go straight to hell because shell see to it he watched her align the ends of the towel wrap then neatly tuck them between her breasts the efficiency of the gesture did nothing to detract from the sexiness of it the room smelled of her clean soap with woodsy overtones abruptly he didnt want to leave her not even for an hour the realization had him rolling his shoulders as if he needed to displace a sudden and uncomfortable weight why dont you come with me you can wear your easter bonnet not only dont i own a bonnet of any kind but i have to get my thoughts in order she took a portable hair dryer from the cabinet beside the sink and i need to talk to andrew hed been toying with the idea of afternoon mass so he could slip the knot on her towel but he put that aside now what do you intend to tell him not very much and it shamed her under the circumstances as long as hes i hate that hes drinking like this i hate it it shamed her too that when she drew in a breath it was shaky and for a minute last night i hated him hes all ive ever had and i hated him no you didnt you hated what hes doing yes youre right but she knew what had bloomed inside her when she looked up and saw him weaving at the top of the steps in any case i have to talk to him ill have to tell him something ive never lied to him before not about anything there was nothing ryan understood more than family ties or the knots they could tie themselves into until he deals with his drinking hes not the man you know or one you can trust i know it was eating at her heart in the bathroom in the next wing where the smell of stale vomit still hung in the air andrew leaned on the sink and forced himself to study the face in his mirror it was gray the eyes bloodshot the skin pasty his left eye was a sunburst of bruising and above that was a shallow cut perhaps an inch in length it ached like a fever he couldnt remember more than pieces from the evening before but what did swim back into his mind made his raw stomach clench again he saw the image of himself standing at the top of the stairs waving a nearly empty bottle and shouting down slopping the words out while miranda stared up at him and there had been something like loathing in her eyes he closed his own it was all right he could control it maybe hed stepped over a line the night before but he wouldnt do it again hed take a couple of days off from drinking prove to everyone he could it was the stress that was all he had reason to be stressed he downed some aspirin pretended his hands werent shaking when he dropped the bottle and pills spilled out on the tile he left them there he walked out carrying his sickness with him he found miranda in her office dressed casually in a sweater and leggings her hair bundled on top of her head and her posture perfect as she worked at her computer it took him more time than he cared to admit to gather the courage to step inside but when he did she glanced over then quickly clicked her data to save and blanked the screen good morning she knew her voice was frigid but couldnt find the will to warm it theres coffee in the kitchen im sorry im sure you are you may want to put ice on that eye what do you want from me i said im sorry i had too much to drink i embarrassed you i acted like an idiot it wont happen again wont it no the fact that she didnt give an inch infuriated him i went past my limit thats all one drink is past your limit andrew until you accept that youre going to continue to embarrass yourself to hurt yourself and the people who care about you look while youve been off having your little fling with boldari ive been here up to my ears dealing with business and part of that business is your screwup in florence very slowly she got to her feet i beg your pardon you heard me miranda im the one whos had to listen to our mother and our father complain and bitch about the mess with that bronze of yours and im the one who spent days looking for the goddamn documents on the david that you were in charge of im taking the heat for that too because youre out of it you can waltz off and spend your time fucking some the crack of her hand across his face shocked them both left them staring and breathless she curled her fingers into her stinging palm pressed it to her heart and turned away from him he stood where he was wondering why the new apology that ached in his heart couldnt be forced out of his mouth so saying nothing at all he turned and walked out she heard the slam of the front door moments later then looking out the window saw his car drive off all of her life hed been her rock and now she thought because she simply wasnt capable of enough compassion shed struck out when he needed her and shed pushed him away she didnt know if she had it in her to pull him back her fax phone rang then picked up the transmission with its highpitched squeal rubbing the tension out of the back of her neck miranda walked over as the message slid into the tray did you think i wouldnt know did you enjoy florence miranda the spring flowers and the warm sunshine i know where you go i know what you do i know what you think im right there inside your mind all the time you killed giovanni his bloods on your hands can you see it i can with a sound of fury miranda crushed the paper into a ball heaved it across the room she pressed her fingers to her eyes waiting for the red haze that was fury and fear to fade when it had she walked over calmly picked up the paper smoothed it out with great care and put it neatly into the drawer ryan came back with an armload of daffodils so bright and sunny she couldnt do anything but smile but because it didnt reach her eyes he tipped up her chin what its nothing theyre wonderful what he repeated and watched her struggle to overcome her habitual reluctance to share trouble andrew and i had a scene he left i dont know where hes gone and i know theres nothing i can do about it you have to let him find his own level miranda i know that too i need to put these in water on impulse she picked up her grandmothers favored rose medallion vase and taking it to the kitchen busied herself arranging the flowers on the kitchen table ive made some progress i think she told him ive put together some lists she thought about the fax wondered if she should tell him later she decided later when shed thought it all through lists organizing thoughts and facts and tasks on paper ill go get the hard copies so we can go over them fine he opened the refrigerator perused the contents want a sandwich since she was already gone he shrugged and began to decide what an inventive man could put together both your lunch meat and your bread are on the edge he told her when she came back in but we risk it or starve andrew was supposed to go to the market she watched him slice undoubtedly soft tomatoes and frowned he looked very much at home she decided not just helping himself to the contents of the kitchen but preparing them i suppose you can cook no one got out of our house unless they could cook he glanced her way i suppose you dont im a very good cook she said with some annoyance really how do you look in an apron efficient i bet you dont why dont you put one on and let me see youre fixing lunch i dont need an apron and just as a passing observation youre a bit locked into regular meals foods a passion he licked tomato juice slowly from his thumb im very locked into regular passions so it would seem she sat and tapped the edges of her papers together to align them now mustard or mayo it doesnt matter now what ive done coffee or something cold whatever she heaved out a breath telling herself he couldnt possibly be interrupting her train of thought just to annoy her in order to milks off he said sniffing the carton he pulled out of the fridge dump the damn stuff down the sink then and sit down her eyes flashed as she looked up and caught him grinning at her why do you purposely aggravate me because it puts such pretty color in your face he held up a can of pepsi diet she had to laugh and when she did he sat down at the table across from her there thats better he decided pushed her plate closer then picked up his own sandwich i cant concentrate on anything but you when youre sad oh ryan how could she possibly defend her heart against these kinds of assaults im not sad youre the saddest woman ive ever known he kissed her fingers but were going to fix that now what have you got she gave herself a moment to regain her balance then picked up the first sheet the first is an amended draft of the list you had of personnel with access to or contact with both of the bronzes amended ive added a tech who i remembered flew in from florence to work with giovanni on another project during the given time period he was only here for a few days as i recall but for accuracys sake should be included his name wasnt on the records we accessed because he was technically employed by the florence branch and only here on temporary loan i also added length of employment which may factor into loyalty and base salaries as it could be assumed that money is a motivation shed also alphabetized the names he noted god love her your family pays well hed noted that before quality staff demands appropriate financial reward on the next list i worked up a probability ratio youll note my name remains but the probability is low i know i didnt steal the originals ive taken giovanni off as he couldnt have been involved why she blinked up at him his bloods on your hands because he was murdered hes dead im sorry miranda that only makes him dead its still possible he was involved and killed for any number of reasons but he was testing the bronzes when he was killed hed have needed to to be sure maybe he was panicking demanding a bigger cut or just pissed off one of his associates his name stays on it wasnt giovanni thats emotion not logic dr jones very well jaw stiff she added giovannis name you may disagree but ive rated my family low in my opinion they dont apply here theyve no reason to steal from themselves he only looked at her and after a long moment she pushed the sheet aside well table the probability list for now here ive made a time line from the date the david came into our hands the length of time it remained in the lab without my notes and records i can only guess at the times and dates of the individual tests but i believe this is fairly close you made graphs and everything he leaned closer admiring the work what a woman i dont see the need for sarcasm im not being sarcastic this is great nice color he added you put it at two weeks but you wouldnt have worked on it seven days at a stretch or twentyfour hours a day here she referred him to another chart and felt only a little foolish these are approximated times the david was locked in the lab vault getting to it would have required a key card security clearance a combination and a second key or she added tilting her head a very good burglar his gaze slid over to hers dark gold and mocking i was in paris during this time were you really i have no idea but in your probability ratio i dont compute because there would have been no reason for me to steal a copy and get sucked into this mess if id already taken the original head angled she smiled sweetly maybe you did it just to get me in bed he glanced up grinned now theres a thought that she said primly was sarcasm this is a time line of the work period on the dark lady we have the records on this and its very fresh in my mind so this is completely accurate in this case the search for documentation was still ongoing and the authentication not yet official project terminated ryan read and glanced at her that was the day you got the ax if you prefer to simplify yes it still stung both pride and heart the following day the bronze was transferred to rome the switch had to be made in that small window of time as id run tests on it just that afternoon unless it was switched in rome he murmured how could it have been switched in rome did anyone from standjo go along for the transfer i dont know someone from security perhaps my mother there would have been papers to sign on both ends well its a possibility but only gives them a few extra hours in any case they had to be ready the copy fully prepared the plumber had it for a week or so he said then the government took it over another week for them to fiddle with the paperwork and contract standjo your mother contacts you and offers you the job she didnt offer me the job she ordered me to come to florence mmm he studied her chart why did it take you six days between the phone call and the flight your description doesnt lead me to believe shes a patient woman i was told and had planned to leave the following day two at the most i was delayed how i was mugged what this very large man in a mask came out of nowhere put a knife to my throat her hand fluttered there as if to see if the thin trickle of blood was indeed only a bad memory ryan took her fingers to draw them away and look for himself though he knew there was no mark still he could imagine it and his eyes went flat what happened i was just coming back from a trip got out of the car in front of the house and there he was he took my briefcase my purse i thought he was going to rape me and i wondered if i had a chance to fight him off against that knife i have a bit of a phobia about knives when her fingers trembled lightly he tightened his grip did he cut you a little just just enough to scare me then he knocked me down slashed my tires and took off he knocked you down she blinked at the cold steel in his voice at the unbearable tenderness of his fingers as they stroked over her cheek yes he was blind with fury at the thought of someone holding a knife to her throat terrorizing her how bad were you hurt nothing just bruises and scrapes because her eyes began to sting she lowered her gaze she was afraid that the emotions flooding through her were showing the wonder and bafflement of her feelings for him no one but andrew had ever looked at her with that kind of concern that kind of care it was nothing she said again then stared helplessly as he tipped up her chin and touched his lips to each of her cheeks dont be kind to me a tear spilled over before she could blink it away i dont handle it well learn he kissed her again lightly then brushed the tear away with his thumb have you ever had trouble like that before around here no never she managed one hitching breath then a steadier one thats why i was so shocked i guess so unprepared its a very lowcrime area the fact is this was such an aberration it played on the local news for days they never caught him no i couldnt give them a very detailed description he wore a mask so i could only give them his build give it to me she didnt want to recall the incident but knew he would push her until she relented white male six four or five twofifty twosixty brown eyes muddy brown long arms big hands lefthanded wide shoulders short neck no distinguishing scars or marks that i could see seems like you gave them quite a bit considering not enough he never spoke not a word that was another thing that frightened me he went about everything so quickly so silently and he took my passport drivers license all my id it took me several days even pulling strings to arrange for new ones a pro ryan concluded with an agenda andrew was furious she remembered with a ghost of a smile he walked around the house every night for a week with a golf club a nine iron i think hoping the man would come back so he could beat him to a pulp i appreciate the sentiment thats a mans reaction id have preferred to handle it myself it was humiliating to know that i hadnt fought back i just froze someone holds a knife to your throat freezing is the intelligent choice i was more frightened than hurt she murmured and stared hard at the surface of the table im sorry you were either he didnt go for the house no just grabbed my purse my briefcase slugged me and ran jewelry no were you wearing any yes i was wearing a gold chain and watch the police wondered about that too but i had my coat on i dont suppose he saw them this watch he held up her wrist examining the slim eighteenkarat cartier an idiot could fence it for a grand minimum he mused a hit and grab like that doesnt sound like an amateur whod miss this sort of easily liquidated asset and he doesnt force you into the house steal any number of excellent and portable items the police figured he was someone passing through short of cash he might figure you had a couple hundred on you if he was lucky not worth armed robbery people kill for designer tennis shoes not this kind of deal he was after your id darling because someone didnt want you to get to florence too soon they needed time to get to work on the copy and couldnt afford you underfoot until they had it under way so they hired a pro someone who wouldnt be messy or make stupid mistakes and they paid him enough so he wouldnt be greedy the explanation was so simple so perfect she only stared wondering why she hadnt made the connection herself but the police never suggested that the cops didnt have all the data we do slowly she nodded and slowly the anger began to inch up into her chest into her throat he held a knife to my throat for my passport it was all to delay me to give them more time id say the probability ratio is very high run through it again for me step by step its a long shot but maybe some of my connections can tag your man if they can she said soberly i dont want to meet your connections dont worry dr jones he turned her hand over and kissed her palm you wont there was no place to buy a bottle on easter sunday when he caught himself driving around and around looking for one andrew began to shake it wasnt that he needed one he told himself he wanted one and that was different he just wanted a couple of drinks to smooth out the edges damn it everybody was on his back everything rested on him he was sick to death of it so fuck them he decided tapping his fist on the wheel fuck them all hed just keep driving hed head south and he wouldnt stop until he was damn good and ready he had plenty of money what he didnt have was any fucking peace he wouldnt stop until he could breathe again until he found a goddamn liquor store that was open on a goddamn sunday he glanced down stared at the fist that was ramming over and over into the steering wheel the fist that was bloody and torn and seemed to belong to someone else someone that scared the hell out of him oh god oh god he was in trouble with his hands trembling he jerked the car to the curb and leaving the engine running rested his head on the wheel and prayed for help the quick knuckle rap on the window had him jolting up and staring through the glass at annies face head cocked she made a circling motion with her finger telling him to roll down the window it wasnt until he saw her that he realized hed headed for her house what are you doing andrew just sitting here she shifted the small bag she carried and studied his face it was a mess she noted bruised sick in color worn out you piss somebody off my sister her eyebrows rose high miranda punched you in the eye what no no embarrassed he probed around the ache with his fingertips i slipped on the stairs really her eyes were narrowed now focused on the fresh cuts and seeping blood on his knuckles did you punch the stairs i he held up his hand his mouth going dry as he stared at it he hadnt even felt the pain what was a man capable of when he stopped feeling pain can i come in i havent been drinking he said quickly when he saw the rejection in her eyes i want to but i havent been you wont get a drink in my place i know he kept his gaze steady thats why i want to come up she studied him another moment then nodded okay she unlocked her door and walked in to set her bag on a table covered with papers and forms and files some of which were anchored with an adding machine im doing my taxes she explained thats why i went out to get this she took an economysized bottle of extrastrength excedrin out of the bag you got a schedule c you got a headache ive already got the headache figured lets do some drugs with a halfsmile she turned to pour two glasses of water she opened the bottle and shook out two tablets for each of them solemnly they swallowed she moved back took a bag of frozen peas out of the freezer put that on your hand for now well clean it up in a bit thanks he might not have felt the pain when hed pounded the steering wheel but he was feeling it now from wrist to fingertip his hand was one obscene scream but he bit back the wince as he laid the cold bag over it hed done enough to damage both ego and manhood in front of annie mclean now what did you do to piss off your sister he very nearly lied made up some idiotic sibling spat ego and manhood aside he couldnt manage to lie to those quiet assessing eyes it might have been getting stinking drunk and humiliating her in front of her new boyfriend mirandas got a guy yeah sort of sudden nice enough i entertained him by falling down the stairs then throwing up part of my stomach lining sympathy fluttered in her stomach but she only cocked her head youve been a busy boy andrew oh yeah he tossed the bag of peas into the sink so he could pace he had jitters tangled around his jitters couldnt keep still his fingers patted at his thighs at his face at each other as he prowled then this morning i decided to round things out by jumping all over her about work family problems her sex life he traced his fingers over his cheek remembering the jolt of shock when shed slapped him because she caught herself taking a step toward him annie turned and rooted out antiseptic from a cabinet behind her it was probably the sex life crack that did it women dont like their brothers poking into that area yeah maybe youre right but weve got a lot of trouble at the institute im under a lot of stress right now she pursed her lips glanced down at the piles of papers and forms the envelopes of receipts the worndown stubs of pencils and the reams of adding machine tape if youre breathing you have stress you drink yourself blind the stress is right there when your vision clears up look maybe ive got a little problem im going to deal with it i just need to take a little time give my system a rest i he pressed his fingers to his eyes swayed youve got a big problem and you can deal with it she crossed to him took his wrists and tugged his hands down so he would look at her you need a day because its only today that has to count so far today sucks she smiled rose on her toes to kiss his cheek its probably going to get worse sit down ill doctor those knuckles tough guy thanks then he sighed said it again thanks annie he kissed her cheek in turn then rested his head against hers just for the comfort of it she still held his wrists lightly and her fingers felt so competent so strong her hair smelled so fresh and simple he pressed his lips to it then to her temple then somehow his mouth was on hers and the taste of her was flooding his ragged system like sunlight when her fingers flexed in his he released them but only to frame her face with his hands to draw her into him hold her there while the sheer warmth of her soothed like balm on a wound so many contrasts was all he could think the tough little body the soft sweep of hair the clipped voice and generous mouth the strength and the softness of her so endearing so familiar and so necessary to him shed always been there hed always known shed be there it wasnt easy to break free not from his hold she could have easily stepped away his hands were gentle as bird wings on her face the mouth both needy and tender shed wondered had let herself wonder once if it would be the same the feel of him the taste but that was long ago before shed convinced herself that friendship was enough now it wasnt easy to break free of what that one long quiet kiss stirred what it asked what it took out of her she needed all of her strength of will to step back from the slowly kindling need hed brought back to life a need she told herself that wouldnt help either of them he nearly pulled her back was already reaching out blindly when she held up her hands palms out in warning he jerked back as if hed been slapped a second time oh christ im sorry annie im sorry what had he done how could he have ruined the single friendship he didnt think he could live without i didnt mean to do that i wasnt thinking im sorry she let him wind down let the miserable guilt settle on his face i bounced a twohundredpound man out of my bar last night because he thought he could buy me along with a beer and a bump she clamped her hand around andrews left thumb and gave it a quick twist his eyes widened his breath hissed as she held it i could have you on your knees pal whimpering if i gave this one little digit a good yank back were not seventeen anymore not quite so stupid and a hell of a lot less innocent if i hadnt wanted your hands on me youd have been flat on your back checking out the cracks in my ceiling plaster sweat began to pearl on his forehead ah could you let go sure obligingly she released his thumb and kept her eyebrows arrogantly cocked want a coke you look a little sweaty she turned and stepped to the refrigerator i dont want to ruin things he began ruin what us you matter annie youve always mattered she stared blindly into the refrigerator youve always mattered too ill let you know when you ruin things i want to talk about before he waited while she popped the tops on two bottles grace in economy of motion he thought a steel spine in a welltoned body had he noticed those things before noticed the little flecks of gold in her eyes or had he just stored them up so theyd all come to him in a flood in a moment just like this why maybe to face things something i didnt realize until lately was stuck inside me he flexed his fingers felt the ache im not in the best shape right now but i have to start somewhere sometime she set the bottles on the counter forced herself to turn to meet his eyes and hers were swimming with emotions shed struggled to keep locked in for years its painful for me andrew you wanted the baby the breath he released hurt his chest hed never spoken of the baby before not out loud i could see it in your face when you told me you were pregnant it scared the hell out of me i was too young to know what i wanted then she closed her eyes because it was a lie yes yes i wanted the baby i had this idiotic fantasy that id tell you and youd be happy and just sweep me up then wed well thats as far as it went but you didnt want me his mouth was dry as dust his gut raw he knew one drink would smooth it all away cursing himself for thinking of that at such a time he snagged one of the bottles off the counter and gulped down soda that seemed sickly and sweet i cared about you you didnt love me andrew i was just a girl you got lucky with on the beach one night he slammed the bottle down again it wasnt like that goddamn it you know it wasnt like that it was exactly like that she said evenly i was in love with you andrew and i knew when i lay down on the blanket with you that you werent in love with me i didnt care i didnt expect anything andrew jones of jones point and annie mclean from the waterfront i was young but i wasnt stupid i would have married you would you her voice went chilly your offer didnt even hit lukewarm i know it and that was something that had eaten away at him slowly a nibble at a time for fifteen years i didnt give you what you needed that day i didnt know how if i had you might have made a different choice if id taken you up on it you would have hated me when you offered part of you already did she moved her shoulders picked up her own coke and looking back i cant blame you id have ruined your life the bottle froze halfway to her lips as he stepped toward her the hot glint of fury in his eyes had her bracing against the counter he snatched the bottle out of her hand set it down then took a hard grip on her shoulders i dont know how it would have been and thats something ive asked myself more than once over the years but i know how it was maybe i wasnt in love with you i dont know but making love with you mattered to me and that he realized was something else hed never said aloud something neither one of them had faced however badly i handled things afterward that night mattered and damn it annie damn it he added giving her a brisk shake you might have made my life i was never right for you she said in a furious whisper how the hell do you know we never had a chance to find out you tell me youre pregnant and before i can absorb it you had an abortion i never had an abortion you made a mistake he said tossing the words shed once heaved at him back in her face and you fixed it i would have taken care of you both of you pain long and shallowly buried cracked through the surface in pummeling fists i would have done my best for you his fingers tightened on her arms but it wasnt good enough okay it was your decision your body your choice but goddamn it it was a part of me too shed lifted her hands to push him away and now curled them into his shirt his face was sheetpale under the bruises his eyes burning dark the ache around her heart was for both of them now andrew i didnt have an abortion i lost the baby i told you i had a miscarriage something flickered deep in his eyes his grip relaxed on her shoulders and he stepped back you lost it i told you when it happened i always thought i assumed youd he turned away walked to the window without thinking he yanked it open and resting his palms on the sill dragged in air i thought you told me that to make it easier on both of us i figured that you hadnt trusted me enough to stand by you to take care of you and the baby i wouldnt have done that without telling you you avoided me for a long time afterward we never talked about it never seemed to be able to talk about it i knew you wanted the baby and i thought all this time i thought that youd terminated the pregnancy because i hadnt stood by you the way you needed you she had to swallow the hot ball in her throat you wanted the baby i didnt know even now he didnt know but ive never regretted anything more in my life than not holding on to you that day on the beach then everything drifted almost like it never happened it hurt me i had to get over it over you slowly he pulled the window down again did you i made a life for myself a lousy marriage an ugly divorce thats not an answer when he turned back his eyes very blue and level on hers she shook her head its not a fair question just now im not going to start something with you thats based on what was then maybe wed better take a look at where we are and start from there chapter twentyone miranda went back to work on the computer revising charts making new ones it kept her mind occupied except for the times she caught herself looking out the window willing andrews car to come up the hill ryan had settled in the bedroom with his cell phone she imagined he didnt want several of the calls he was making to pop up on her records that was something she wasnt going to worry about hed given her a whole new line of worry if he was right the quick and rough daylight robbery hadnt simply been a matter of chance hadnt been some itinerant thief looking for fast cash it had been a wellplanned carefully orchestrated part of the whole shed been a specific target the motive behind it nothing more than delaying her trip to italy and her work on the bronze whoever had stolen it copied it had already decided to discredit her had that been personal or the luck of the draw she wondered she believed as she had few genuine friends she had few genuine enemies shed simply avoided becoming close enough to anyone to create them but the messages coming over her fax were very personal the attack had been personal she thought designed to terrify the silence the little nick at the throat with the knife had that all been routine for the attacker or had he been given instructions to leave his victim frozen in shock and fear it had cost her a large slice of her confidence her sense of safety certainly her dignity and it had delayed her trip by almost a week the delay had put her at odds with her mother before the project even began layers she mused very cleverly applied layers that coated the core yet it hadnt begun with the attack but with the forgery and theft of the david what had been going on in her life then what was she missing that tied the one to the other shed been working on her doctorate she remembered splitting her time between the institute her studies her thesis her social life never a glitter ball of events had been nil what had been going on around her that she realized was harder to pin down paying attention to the people around her wasnt her strong suit that was something she intended to change for now she closed her eyes and tried to bring the time span and the people in it into focus elise and andrew had been married and still by all appearances deeply in love she could remember no fights or squabbles andrews drinking had been routine but nothing shed worried about then again shed done her best to give him and elise as much privacy as possible giovanni and lori had entertained each other with a brisk friendly affair shed known they were sleeping together but since it hadnt interfered with the quality or quantity of their work miranda had kept out of that as well her mother had come into the institute briefly a day or two miranda thought now no longer theyd had a handful of meetings one stiff family dinner and had parted ways her father had stayed only long enough to see the bronze through initial testing hed only sat in on a portion of the meetings and had made some excuse to avoid attending the family meal vincente and his wife had come in her fathers place but even their vivid personalities hadnt brightened the event if memory served gina had come into the lab only once richard hawthorne she remembered only as a vague presence buried in books or hunched over a computer john carter had been a constant presence overseeing projects worrying over reports miranda rubbed her temples as she struggled to pull in details had he been a little off his stride sluggish out of sorts a touch of the flu she remembered hed had a touch of the flu but had worked through it how was she supposed to remember in disgust she dropped her hands it had been routine simply routine with her work as the driving force everything else was blips once she had that small lovely statue in her hands shed seen the acquisition of the david as another step in her career and had used the authentication as the basis for one of her papers shed gotten quite a bit of attention for that she recalled in the academic and scientific worlds shed been invited to lecture on it and had won a considerable amount of acclaim it had she supposed been the true beginning of her rise in her career that little bronze had lifted her out of the pack and put her solidly in the lead she stared blindly at the words on her screen heard a dim buzzing in her ears the fiesole bronze would have sent her reputation rocketing it would have cemented her as one of the top archeometrists in the world not just academic acclaim this time but the lay press as well we were talking michelangelo here romance mystery money she shut her eyes and struggled to think it through both pieces were hers both pieces had offered her a solid boost up the reputational ladder and both pieces had been forged what if they hadnt been the target at all what if she was she folded her hands waited for her insides to settle it had logic it had reason it was more than plausible but where was the motive what other pieces had she authenticated that could be retested without too much speculation or comment within the institute the cellini her stomach twisted painfully at the thought of it the statue of nike she thought forcing herself to be calm and thorough there was the paperweightsized bronze of romulus and remus nursing at the shewolf she would have to get back into the lab she would have to be sure none of those had been replaced with forgeries she jerked as the phone rang stared at it for several long seconds before she picked up the receiver hello miranda i have some difficult news mother she rubbed a hand over her heart i think someones trying to hurt me i think theyre trying to destroy me it was real the bronze was real you have to listen but the words only raced in her head what is it sometime on thursday night the lab was broken into equipment records data were destroyed destroyed she said dully yes im being destroyed giovanni the pause was long and for the first time in too long to remember miranda heard raw emotion in her mothers voice giovanni was killed giovanni you cared oh god you cared she shut her eyes as tears began to swim giovanni she said again from all appearances he must have decided to come in and take advantage of the holiday quiet in the lab to work weve been unable to tell what project he was dealing with the police again that hitch in rhythm and though the voice was stronger it remained uneven the police are investigating but they have no leads to date ive been attempting to assist them for the last two days the funeral is tomorrow tomorrow i thought it best that you hear it from me i trust youll inform andrew i realize you were fond of giovanni i believe we all were theres no need for you to fly in for the services theyre to be simple and private his family ive spoken with his family though weve made arrangements to have donations to charity made in his name i believe they would appreciate flowers this is a very difficult time for all of us i hope that you and i can put our professional differences aside and agree to send an arrangement as a family yes of course i could fly out tonight thats neither necessary nor wise elizabeths voice was brisk again the press is well aware that you worked together on the fiesole bronze this has already been rehashed in the media your presence here would only stir it all up again for giovannis familys sake the services should be kept quiet and dignified she remembered the words of the last fax again his bloods on your hands can you see it youre right theres nothing i can do there but make matters worse she closed her eyes the better to concentrate on keeping her tone even do the police know why the lab was broken into was anything stolen its difficult to tell but it doesnt appear that anything was taken a great deal was destroyed the alarm was shut off from inside the authorities believe its possible he knew his assailant id like you to keep me informed of the progress he mattered very much to me i know you had a personal relationship we werent lovers mother miranda nearly sighed it we were friends i didnt intend to elizabeth stopped remained silent for several seconds ill see that youre kept uptodate if you go out of town you might see that andrew has your location this time i plan to stay home miranda said and garden she smiled a little as there was no response an enforced leave of absence gives me time to develop a hobby theyre supposed to be good for the soul so im told im glad youre making productive use of your time rather than brooding tell andrew i want an update on the investigation there as soon as possible i may be coming in for a short time and would appreciate having everything dealing with the matter of the david recorded in a cohesive fashion ill warn him ill be sure he understands good goodbye miranda goodbye mother she replaced the receiver neatly then sat staring at it until she realized ryan had come in and stood behind her she had me fooled for a minute i started to believe she was human she sounded genuinely grieved when she told me about giovanni but before it was over she reverted to her usual self im to stay away because my presence at giovannis funeral would be disruptive her instinct was to stiffen when his hands came to her shoulders that alone infuriated her she shut her eyes and willed herself to relax under his hands im instructed to inform andrew of my location should i choose to leave town again and to tell him to give her an update at the soonest opportunity of the burglary investigation shes got a lot on her mind miranda everyone in your family does just now and when your family has a crisis what do they do he crouched turned her swivel chair around until she faced him your family and mine arent the same and cant be expected to react in the same way no my mother remains at all times the director my father maintains his distance and general apathy and andrew drowns himself in a bottle and what do i do i ignore all of it as long as its humanly possible so it wont interfere with my routine thats not what ive seen youve seen a blip on the screen not the usual sweep she nudged him aside so she could stand im going for a run miranda he caught her arm before she could hurry out of the room if you didnt care if they didnt matter to you you wouldnt be so sad im not sad ryan im resigned she shook free and walked out to change her clothes she didnt often run she considered walking a more efficient and certainly more dignified method of exercise but when events and emotions built up to a high inside her she ran she chose the beach below the cliffs because the water was close and the air fresh she headed north digging into the shale while the waves gleefully attacked the rocky shore and spewed droplets of water into the sunlight gulls swooped letting out their eerily feminine screams as her muscles warmed she tugged off the light jacket and tossed it aside no one would steal it crime she thought with a giddy lurch in her stomach was low in jones point orange buoys bobbed on the surface of the dark blue water others tall gray and weathered swayed and spoke in hollow mournful bongs a short pier lay drunkenly askew in the water ignored because neither she nor andrew sailed farther out boats skimmed and sailed as people took advantage of the hint of spring and a sunday holiday she followed the curve of the beach ignoring the burning in her calves and chest the trickle of sweat between her breasts a lobster boat swayed on the current while the waterman in his bright red cap checked his pots he lifted a hand and waved and the simple gesture from a stranger made her eyes burn while her vision blurred she waved in return then stopped bending over hands on knees while her breath screamed out of her laboring lungs she hadnt run far she thought but shed run too fast she hadnt paced herself everything was happening too fast she couldnt quite keep up yet she didnt dare slow down and sweet god she didnt even know where she was going there was a man in her house a man shed known for only a matter of weeks a man who was a thief likely a liar and undoubtedly dangerous yet shed put a part of her life in his hands shed become intimate with him more intimate than shed ever allowed herself to become with anyone she looked back and up and studied the moonwhite spear of the lighthouse shed fallen in love with him inside that tower it didnt matter if shed been sliding toward it all along it was there shed fallen and she had yet to be certain she would land on her feet hed walk away when he finished what he had come to do hed be charming about it and clever not cruel but he would go back to his life hers she realized would still be in shambles they could find the bronzes shore up their reputations solve the puzzle and even catch a killer but her life would remain in shambles and with no precedent no formula no data she couldnt make an educated guess on how long it would take her to rebuild it at the tips of her feet was the edge of a tidepool the water calm and clear life scurried under it in otherworldly colors and shapes when she was a child her grandmother had walked this beach with her or with both her and andrew theyd studied the tidepools together but it hadnt been like a lesson some sneaky education ploy of adult to child no she remembered they had crouched down and looked for the pleasure of it had laughed when what appeared to be a rock squirted at them in annoyance little worlds her grandmother had called them ripe with passion sex violence and politics and often more sensible than the life thats led on the dry part of the planet i wish you were here miranda murmured i wish i still had you to talk to she looked away from the busy world at her feet out to sea again let the wind rage through her hair over her face what was she to do now she wondered now that she knew what it was to love someone until it hurt to prefer the pain to the emptiness that had been so familiar it was rarely noticed she sat on the smooth dome of a rock brought her knees up to rest her head on them this she supposed was what happened when the heart was allowed to control the mind the actions the decisions with everything else in tatters around her she was sitting on a rock looking out to sea and brooding over a love affair that was destined to end an oystercatcher landed near the shoreline then stalked up and down the verge looking important it made her smile a little apparently even birds worry about appearances look at me he seemed to say im very cool wed see how cool you are if id brought some bread crumbs she told him youd be scrambling to gulp them all down before your buddies got wind of it and swooped down to fight you for them ive heard that people who drink too much start believing in talking birds andrew saw her shoulders stiffen but kept walking toward her you dropped this he laid her jacket in her lap i got too warm you sit here without it after a run youll get chilled im fine suit yourself it took a great deal of courage for him to sit on the rock beside her miranda im sorry i believe weve covered that ground miranda he knew just how far hed pushed her away when she wouldnt let him take her hand i came down here to be alone for a while and he knew just how stubborn she could be when shed been crossed ive got a few things to say when im done you can hit me again if you want i was way over the line this morning theres no excuse for what i said to you i didnt want to hear what you were saying to me so i hit hard and low understood well agree that were better off staying out of each others personal choices no this time he ignored her jerk away and clamped her hand no were not weve always been able to depend on each other well i cant depend on you anymore andrew can i she looked at him now saw how haggard his face was against the dark glasses hed put on he should have looked rakish she thought instead he looked pitiful i know ive let you down i can take care of myself youve let yourself down miranda please hed known it wouldnt be easy but he hadnt realized how completely her rejection would rip at him i know ive got a problem im trying to come to terms with that im im going to a meeting tonight aa he saw the flicker in her eyes of hope of sympathy of love and shook his head i dont know if its going to be for me im just going to go listen see how i feel about it its a good start its a good step he rose stared out over the restless water when i left this morning i went looking for a bottle i didnt realize it didnt consciously think about it not until i got the shakes until i found myself driving around looking for a liquor store or a bar anything that was open on a sunday morning he looked down at his hand flexed the fingers felt the small aches it scared the hell out of me ill help you andrew ive read all the literature ive been to a couple of alanon meetings he turned back to stare at her she was watching him twisting the jacket in her hands and the hope was deeper in her eyes i was afraid youd started to hate me he said i wanted to just cant she wiped at tears ive been so angry with you for taking you away from me when you left today i kept thinking youd come back drunk or youd finally be stupid enough to drive when youd been drinking and kill yourself i would have hated you for that i went to annies didnt know i was going there either until i was parked in front of her building shes im hell im going to stay at her place for a few days give you some privacy with ryan give you and me a little space annies youre going to stay with annie im not sleeping with her annie she said again gaping at him annie mclean is that a problem for you it was the defensive way he said it that had her lips curving up no not at all thats something i think id like very much to see shes a strongwilled ambitious woman and she wont take any crap from you annie and i he wasnt sure how to explain it weve got a history maybe now were going to see about having a present i didnt know you were anything but friends he stared down the beach thought he could almost pick out the spot where two reckless teenagers had lost their innocence we were then we werent i dont know what we are now but finding out he thought was giving him a direction and purpose he hadnt had in too long im sleeping on her couch for a couple of nights im going to get my feet under me again whatever it takes but the odds are im going to disappoint you again before i do shed read everything she could get her hands on about alcoholism treatment recovery she knew about backsliding starting over failure youre not disappointing me today she held out a hand linking fingers tight when he took it ive missed you so much he picked her up off the rock to hold her he knew she was crying could feel it in the little quivers her body made against his but she made no sound dont give up on me okay tried cant he laughed a little and pressed his cheek to hers this thing youve got going with new york how come he was ryan before and now hes new york because now hes messing around with my sister and im reserving judgment this thing youve got he repeated its working for you she drew back its working today okay since weve made up why dont we go up and have a drink to celebrate his dimples winked drunk humor how about a pot roast its too late in the day to start one ill make you a very manly meat loaf good enough as they started back she braced herself knowing she would have to tell him and shatter the moment andrew mother called a bit ago cant she take easter off like everybody else andrew she stopped kept a hand on his arm someone broke into the lab in florence giovanni was there alone he was murdered what giovanni oh my god he turned walked to the edge of the water stood there with the surf soaking his shoes giovannis dead murdered what the hell is going on she couldnt risk telling him his strength of will his emotions his illness it was too unstable a mix i wish i knew she said the lab had been vandalized equipment and records destroyed and giovanni they think he was working late and someone came in a burglary i dont know it doesnt seem she said she didnt think anything of value had been taken it makes no sense he whirled around his face grim and battered someone breaks into the gallery here takes a valuable bronze and doesnt squash a fly on his way in or out now someone breaks into the lab at standjo kills giovanni wrecks the place and takes nothing i dont understand it either that at least was partially true whats the connection he muttered and had her gaping at him connection there are no coincidences jingling the change in his pocket he began to walk up and down the beach two breakins within a couple of weeks at different divisions of the same organization one lucrative and quiet the other violent and without apparent reason theres always a reason giovanni worked at both locations at some time behind the dark lenses his eyes narrowed he did some of the work on the david didnt he ah yes yes he did the davids stolen the documents are missing and now giovannis dead whats the connection he didnt expect an answer and she was spared from fumbling for a lie im going to pass this on to cook for whatever good it does maybe i should go to florence andrew her voice wanted to quake she wouldnt risk him wouldnt let him go anywhere near florence or the person who had killed giovanni thats not a good idea right now you need to stay close to home rebuild your routine and stability let the police do their jobs its probably better to try to figure it out from here anyway he decided im going up to call cook give him something to chew on besides his easter ham ill be there in a minute she worked up a smile to start your easter meat loaf he was distracted enough not to notice how quickly her smile slipped away into worry but he spotted ryan on the cliff path pride ego shame and brotherly resistance built very quickly boldari andrew ryan decided to avoid an unproductive pissing match and stepped aside but andrew was already primed maybe you think since shes a grown woman and her familys screwed up that theres nobody to look out for her but youre wrong you hurt her you son of a bitch and ill break you in two his eyes went to slits when ryan grinned at him you hear a joke no its just that the last part of that statement is very similar to what i said to my sister mary jos husband when i caught them necking in his chevy id already dragged him out and punched him first much to mjs annoyance and distress andrew rocked on his heels youre not my sisters husband neither was he at the time the words were out glibly delivered before the potential meaning struck ryan the humor blinked out of his eyes and discomfort blinked on what i mean to say is yeah enjoying himself now andrew nodded what do you mean to say a man could do a lot of thinking in the time it took to clear the throat i mean to say that i have a great deal of affection and respect for your sister shes a beautiful interesting and appealing woman youre light on your feet ryan it seemed they were back to ryan for the moment good balance they both looked down to where miranda stood on the narrow beach watching the waves rise and shes not as sturdy as she thinks she is andrew added she doesnt let herself get too close to too many because when she does the soft centers exposed she matters to me is that what you want to hear yeah particularly andrew thought since it had been said with a great deal of heat and some reluctance thatll do by the way i appreciate what you did for me last night and for not rubbing my nose in it today hows the eye hurts like a bastard well then thats punishment enough id say maybe he turned and started up the path were having meat loaf he called back go make her put her jacket on will you yeah ryan murmured i think ill do that he started down picking his way over rocks skidding a bit on pebbles she started up steady as a mountain goat those arent the right kind of shoes for this youre telling me then he caught her against him your arms are cold why dont you have your jacket on the suns warm enough andrews going to an aa meeting tonight thats great he pressed his lips to her brow its a good start he can do it the breeze tugged hair out of the elastic band shed pulled on and forced her to shake it out of her face i know he can hes going to be staying with a friend for a couple of days just to give himself time to steady a bit and i think hes not quite comfortable with sleeping under the same room while were sleeping yankee conservatism dont knock a cornerstone she drew in a breath theres something else i told him about giovanni hes made the connection what do you mean hes made the connection i mean for the past year or so hes been killing his brain cells and id nearly forgotten how smart he is he put it together in minutes a connection between the breakin here and the one there hes going to talk to detective cook about it great bring in the cops its the reasonable thing to do its too coincidental for andrew speaking quickly she ran back over what her brother had said hell explore this i didnt tell him what i know or suspect i cant risk his state of mind right now when he should be concentrating on recovery but i cant go on lying to him either not for much longer then well have to work faster he had no intention of playing team ball or sharing the bronzes once he had them he was keeping them the winds picking up he commented and draped an arm around her as they walked up the path i heard a rumor about meat loaf youll get fed boldari and i can promise my meat loaf is very passionate in some cultures meat loaf is considered an aphrodisiac really odd that was never covered in any of my anthropology courses it only works if you serve it with mashed potatoes well then i guess well have to test that theory they cant be instant please dont insult me i think im crazy about you dr jones she laughed but the soft center her brother had spoken of was laid bare part three the price wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand before envy proverbs chapter twentytwo the country quiet kept ryan awake and made him think of new york of the comforting and continual buzz of traffic of the pace that got into your blood so that you lengthened your stride to get to the next corner beat the light keep the clip steady places this close to the ocean made you slow down once you slowed down you could get settled in and rooted before you realized it was happening he needed to get back to new york to his gallery which hed already left too long in other hands of course he often did but that was when he was traveling moving from place to place not when he was planted this way he needed to pull up stakes and soon she was sleeping beside him her breathing echoing the slow steady ebb and flow of the sea outside she didnt curl up against him but maintained her own space and gave him his he told himself he appreciated that but he didnt it irked him that she didnt cuddle and cling and at least pretend that she was trying to hold him down it would have been so much easier to resist staying if she did he couldnt concentrate this way she was a constant distraction from the work at hand just by being close enough to touch she was an infinitely touchable woman if only because she was always vaguely surprised by little strokes and pats and because he wanted to do so to nudge her awake and into arousal with little strokes and pats with quiet sips and nibbles until she was hot and slippery and eager for him he got out of bed sex was supposed to be a simple form of entertainment not an obsession for gods sake he tugged on a pair of loose black pants found a cigar and his lighter and quietly opened her terrace doors and stepped out breathing the air was like drinking a lightly chilled and mellow white he decided it could become a casual habit one easily taken for granted the height gave him a full view of the sea of the ragged spit of land with the glowing spear of the lighthouse and that spears straight beaming lance it held a sense of age and tradition of security again easily taken for granted by those who saw it day after day things changed slowly here if they flexed their muscles and decided to change at all you would see the same view morning after morning he decided a similar scatter of boats over the same moody sea and all with the beat and pulse of that sea as a backdrop he could see the stars brilliantly clear like bright studs pinned to velvet the moon was waning losing its edge he was afraid he was losing his annoyed with himself he lighted the cigar blew a fume of smoke into the wind that never seemed to rest they were getting nowhere he thought miranda could create her charts and graphs calculate her time lines and input her data until she generated reams of paperwork none of it delved into the hearts and minds of the people involved it couldnt touch on greed or anger jealousy or hate a chart couldnt illustrate why one human took the life of another over a piece of metal he needed to know the players to understand them and hed barely begun he thought hed come to know her she was an efficient woman with a practical shell an aloof nature that could with the proper key be unlocked to expose the warmth and needs under the surface her upbringing had been privileged and cold shed reacted to that by distancing herself from people honing her mind fixing her goals and setting along a straight linear path to achieving them her weakness was her brother theyd stuck together bonding initially out of defense or rebellion or genuine affection it didnt matter what had forged that bond it existed it was real and strong and unified them what came out of it was loyalty and love hed seen for himself what andrews drinking his unpredictability had done to her it left her shaken and angry and baffled and hed seen the hope and the happiness in her eyes during the dinner theyd shared that evening she believed he was climbing back toward the brother shed known she needed that belief that faith he couldnt stand the idea of shattering it so he would keep his suspicions to himself he knew just what addictions any kind of addictions could do to warp a man to make him consider and to make him commit acts he would never have considered or committed otherwise andrew headed the institute he had power the ease of motion within the organization to have managed the switch of the first bronze the motive could have been money or a simple lust to own or the surrendering to blackmail no one was in a better position to have orchestrated the thefts and the forgeries than one of the joneses he considered charles jones hed been the one to discover the david it wasnt unreasonable to theorize that hed wanted it for himself he would have needed help andrew possibly giovanni just as possibly or any of the most trusted staff elizabeth jones proud cold driven shed based her life on art the science of it rather than the beauty she like her husband had put their family in the shadows in order to concentrate energy and time and effort on gaining prestige their own wouldnt a priceless statue make the perfect trophy for a lifetime of work giovanni a trusted employee a brilliant scientist or he would never have been a part of mirandas team charming by her account a single man who enjoyed flirting with women maybe hed flirted with the wrong one or had craved more than his position at standjo offered elise exwife exwives were often vengeful shed transferred from the institute to standjo florence she was in a position of trust and power she might have used andrew then discarded him as lab manager shed be privy to all data she would have held both bronzes in her hands had she coveted them richard hawthorne bookworm still waters often ran deep and often ran violent he knew his history knew how to research his type was largely overlooked in favor of the more flamboyant the more demanding it could eat at a man vincente morelli longtime friend and associate with a very young very demanding wife hed given the institute and standjo years of his life of his work of his skills why not cash in on more than a paycheck and a pat on the back for services rendered john carter with his worn shoes and ridiculous ties stable as granite why not just as hard hed been with the institute for more than fifteen years plodding his way along following orders clinging to routines maybe he was still following orders any one of them could have planned it he decided but he didnt believe any one of them could have executed two such flawless switches alone there was teamwork here gears meshing and a cool and clever mind behind it all he was going to need more than personnel records and time lines to uncover that mind he watched a star fall streaking toward the sea with an arc of light and he began to plan what do you mean youre going to call my mother id call your father ryan said peeking over her shoulder to see what she was up to on the computer but i get the impression your mothers more involved in the business what are you doing there nothing why are you going to call my mother what is that a gardening web page i need some data thats all on flowers yes shed already printed out several informative documents on soil treatments perennials and planting seasons so closed the page my mother in a minute why do you need data on flowers because im going to start a garden and i know nothing about it so youre taking the scientific approach he bent down to kiss the top of her head you really are cute miranda she removed her glasses and put them on the desk im delighted ive amused you now will you answer my question your mother he sat on the desk facing her im going to call her to tell her my conditions for the loan of the vasaris and a raphael and botticelli raphael and botticelli you never agreed to loan us anything but the vasaris new deal five paintings and i may let her talk me into tossing in a donatello sculpture a threemonth loan with the boldari gallery suitably acknowledged in all advertising with the proceeds from the fundraiser going to the national endowment for the arts fundraiser ill get to that the reason im choosing the new england institute of art history is because of its reputation its dedication to not only displaying art but teaching restoring studying and preserving it i was very impressed when i was here a few weeks ago and was taken through the facility by dr miranda jones he tugged on her hair sent it tumbling to her shoulders as he liked it best and ignored her curse of annoyance i was particularly intrigued by her idea of creating a display of the history and progress he went on with its social religious and political underlayment of the italian renaissance were you she murmured were you really i was riveted he picked up her hand to toy with her fingers and noted shed taken off the ring hed put there the fact that the lack of it caused his brows to draw together in annoyance was something to ponder later i was struck by her vision of this showing and by the idea of arranging a similar display after the threemonth period in my own gallery in new york i see a partnership exactly we were of one mind and during the preliminary stages of discussion you brought up the idea of holding a fundraiser at the institute benefiting the nea as boldari galleries are staunch supporters of the organization i was caught it was very clever of you to dangle that lure yes she murmured wasnt it im ready to move forward on this mutual project at the earliest possible date but having been told that dr jones is on a leave of absence im quite concerned i cant possibly work with anyone else the delay has led me to consider working with the art institute in chicago instead she wont care for that i didnt think she would he nipped the pins out of her hand before she could bundle her hair back up and carelessly tossed them over his shoulder damn it ryan dont interrupt we need you back inside the institute we need whoevers behind the forgeries to know youre back on the job then once weve got everything in place we need everyone who was connected to the two bronzes here together in one spot you may very well be able to manage the first a display such as the one youre describing would be very prestigious she would have gotten up to retrieve the pins but he was playing with her hair again watching her face as he gathered it twined it um my mother appreciates the power of prestige obviously the second part would be a given after that but i dont know how you expect to manage the last of it ill tell you he grinned and leaned over to flick a finger down her cheek were going to throw a hell of a party a party the fundraiser thats right he rose and began poking around on her shelves in her drawers and were going to have it in giovannis name a kind of memorial giovanni it turned her blood cold youd use him for this hes dead you cant change that miranda but well arrange it so that whoever killed him comes and well be one step closer to the bronzes i dont understand you im working out the details dont you have a sketch pad yes of course wavering between irritation and confusion she rose and took one from a filing cabinet i should have known well bring it along get yourself a couple of pencils bring it along where to the back porch you can sit and sketch your garden while i make some phone calls you expect me to sketch a garden while all this is going on itll relax you he chose some pencils from her desk tucked them in his shirt pocket picked up her glasses tucked them in hers and youll plant a better one if you know what you want to look at he grabbed her hand and pulled her out of the room when did you come up with all this last night couldnt sleep were spinning wheels when we need action weve been letting someone else run the show and weve got to start pushing the buttons thats all very interesting and metaphorical ryan but holding a fundraiser in giovannis name wont guarantee his killer will show and it certainly doesnt put the bronzes in our hands one step at a time baby you going to be warm enough dont fuss sitting outside and sketching isnt going to relax me if were going to pull off this display i should be working on that youll be putting your nose to the grindstone soon enough resigned she stepped out on the porch april had decided to make its entrance gently bowing in balmy breezes and sunny skies it could change she knew in a surprising instant to wet spring snow and high winds it was part of the appeal she supposed the caprices of coastal weather just sit he gave her a brotherly kiss on the brow ill handle this part well then i just wont worry my pretty little head he laughed and took out his cell phone the only thing little about you dr jones is your tolerance level but somehow i find that alluring whats your mothers number she adjusted her thoughts accepted that he was innately skilled at arousing and annoying often simultaneously thats her home number she told him after shed recited it with the time difference thats most likely where youll find her as he punched it in she looked out over the lawn he would charm elizabeth miranda decided his talent with women was inarguable and something it didnt suit her to consider too deeply he would know just how to appeal to elizabeth as hed known just how to appeal to her daughter with enough time she doubted there was a woman on the planet he couldnt convince to eat the menu selection of his choice right out of his talented hands she sighed hearing the way his voice flowed over her mothers name as the connection was made then she blocked it out the shattering blue of the sky the glimpses of sea and rock that sparkled under the sun only made her lawn look shabbier she could see the paint peeling on the porch rail and winterbrowned weeds poking up through the chipped surface of the flagstones that formed a walkway to the cliffs her grandmother had tended the house and the grounds as a mother tends beloved children she remembered now she and andrew had let it go ignoring the small details shrugging off what they considered the more tedious responsibilities major repairs and maintenance were simple you just hired someone to deal with it she didnt think either she or andrew had ever mowed their own lawn raked leaves pruned a bush or yanked a weed it would be a good change she thought something they could share the manual labor the satisfaction of seeing the improvements would be good therapy for him and she decided for her one way or another the cycle her life was in just now would end when it did she would need something to fill the hole casting her mind back she tried to remember how the side garden had looked when she was a child and her grandmother had still been fit and well enough to tend it tall spiky flowers she recalled with deep purple and deep red blooms something butter yellow and daisylike in a flower with stems that bent gracefully under the weight her pencil began to move as she brought it back into her mind clumps of green with a slender stem shooting up and ending with an upturned white cup there was a scent too from flowers that looked something like carnations with red and white blooms and a strong spicy fragrance others with rich blue trumpets yes and snapdragons she was ridiculously thrilled she finally put a name to a variety while ryan made his pitch on the phone to the mother he watched the daughter she was relaxing he noted smiling a little as she drew fast sketching the kind that took innate talent and a good eye her hair was tousled her fingers long the nails neat short and unpainted shed taken her glasses out of her pocket and put them on her sweater bagged at the shoulders her trousers were the color of putty he thought she was the most stunning woman hed ever seen and because thinking that he lost his thread he turned away and wandered to the far end of the porch please call me ryan i hope i may call you elizabeth im sure you know just how brilliant and how delightful your daughter is but i must tell you what a tremendous impression she made on me when i learned shed taken a leave of absence well disappointed is a mild term he listened for a moment smiling to himself he wondered if miranda was aware her voice had that same uppercrust pitch when she was trying to disguise annoyance oh yes i have no doubt there are members of the staff at the institute who could take the basic idea and implement it but im not interested in working with the second line although lois berenski at the chicago art institute you know lois i assume yes shes very competent and quite interested in this proposal ive promised to get back to her within fortyeight hours which is why im taking the liberty of bothering you at home my preference is the institute and miranda but if this cant be accomplished before my deadline ill have to he trailed off grinning openly now as elizabeth began a hard sell getting comfortable he swung a leg over the rail straddling it while he let his gaze sweep the coast watch the gulls swoop and allowed elizabeth to wheel and deal until she gave him exactly what he wanted it took forty minutes during which time he wandered into the kitchen made himself a small snack plate of crackers cheese and olives and carried it back outside when it was done he and elizabeth had agreed to have drinks the evening before the gala he was calling it a gala now and raise a toast to their mutual project he hung up popped an olive in his mouth miranda she was still sketching well into her third angle on her proposed garden hmmm answer the phone what she glanced up vaguely annoyed with the interruption the phones not ringing he winked wait for it he told her then grinned when the kitchen phone pealed thatll be your mother if i were you id act surprised and just a little reluctant she agreed answer the phone and find out she was already leaping up dashing into the house to snatch the phone off the hook hello hello mother she pressed a hand to her speeding heart and listened it came as a demand but that was to be expected more it was outlined as a fait accompli her leave was to be terminated immediately and she was to contact the boldari gallery and make arrangements to proceed her schedule was to be adjusted this was to be priority and the display would be conceived planned erected and completed the second weekend in may thats barely a month how i realize its a short amount of time for something of this scope but mr boldari has other commitments and conflicts hell work with andrew of the publicity for the gala with vincente pitching in your only concern for the next four weeks is

supervise the final touches be sure to send me the proper reports youll get everything goodbye its done miranda murmured as she replaced the receiver just like that i didnt mention giovanni ryan told her that cant come from me youll have the idea for this tomorrow and after running it by me and securing my agreement youll send her a memo he set his plate on the counter chose a cracker for her and topped it with cheese out of that will come the notion that all key staff members from all jones organizations will attend the event in a show of unity support and respect theyll come she murmured my mother will see to it but i dont see what good this does logistics everyone connected in one place at one time he smiled and ate another cube of cheese im looking forward to it i have to get to work she pushed both hands through her hair i have an exhibit to design ill be flying in from new york tomorrow she paused at the doorway and glanced back oh will you yes morning flight its going to be a pleasure to see you again dr jones chapter twentythree its good to have you back lori set a steaming cup of coffee on mirandas desk i hope you feel that way by the end of the week im about to run you ragged i can handle it lori touched a hand to mirandas arm im so sorry about giovanni i know you were friends we all liked him so much i know his bloods on your hands hell be missed i need to work lori to dive in all right she walked to a chair poised her pencil over her notebook where do we start deal with what needs to be done miranda told herself one step at a time set up meetings with carpentry get drubeck he did good work on the flemish display a couple of years ago i need to talk to legal to contracts and well need to pull someone out of research i want someone who can check data quickly ill need ninety minutes with andrew and i want to be notified the moment mr boldari arrives arrange for lunch to be set up in the vip loungemake it for one oclock and see if andrew can join us

after her collection the avaricious look sharpened mirandas eyes i think i can convince her shed enjoy seeing her paintings in this showing with a nice tasteful brass plaque saying on loan from the collection of and if she couldnt convince mrs collingsforth miranda thought shed sic ryan on her ill need measurements of the south gallery if they arent on record here get me a tape measure i want them today oh and i want to see a decorator loris busy pencil paused a decorator i have an idea for atmosphere i need someone inventive efficient and who knows how to take orders instead of giving them miranda drummed her fingers oh yes she knew what she wanted right down to the last inch of fringe ill need a drawing board in here and one delivered to my home send a memo to andrew requesting that i be copied on all steps of the publicity and all conceptions for the fundraiser mr boldari is to be put through at any time and is to be accommodated in his wishes whenever possible of course ill need to talk to security check in four weeks ask me for a raise loris lips curved double check lets get started one thing lori flipped her book closed you had a message on your machine i left it on it was in italian so most of it was lost on me she rose moved over to click back the counter on mirandas machine punched it in immediately there was a flood of excited emotional italian mildly irritated miranda stopped the recording and began again with her mind adjusted to translate dr jones i must speak with you i try to reach you here there is no one else who will believe me i am rinaldi carlo rinaldi i found the lady i held her i know she is real you know this is true the papers they said you believed in her no one will listen to me no one pays attention to a man like me but you you are important you are a scientist they will listen to you please you will call me we will talk we know what we know it must be proven no one listens your mother she tosses me out of her office tosses me out like a beggar or a thief the government they think i help make a fraud this is a lie a terrible lie you know this is a lie please we will tell everyone the truth he recited a phone number twice and repeated his plea and now he was dead miranda thought as the message ended hed asked her for help but she hadnt been there now he was dead what was it concerned by the devastated look on mirandas face lori reached out to touch her arm my italians limited to pasta orders is it bad news no miranda murmured its old news and i was too late she clicked the delete button but she knew the message from the dead would play in her mind for a long time it was good to be back in the saddle to have specific tasks and goals ryan had been right about that she decided shed needed action she was in restoration checking out the progress of the bronzino personally when john carter came in miranda ive been trying to track you down welcome back thanks john its good to be back he removed his glasses polished them on his lab coat its terrible about giovanni i cant take it in she had a flash the sprawled body the staring eyes blood i know he had a lot of friends here i had to make the announcement yesterday the labs like a morgue he puffed out his cheeks blew out a breath im going to miss the way hed perk things up whenever he came in for a few days anyway we all wanted to do something we came up with a few ideas but the one everyone liked best was having a tree planted in the park a lot of us take our lunch break there in good weather and we thought it would make a nice memorial i think thats lovely john something he would have liked very much i wanted to clear it with you first youre still lab director consider it cleared i hope the fact that im management doesnt mean i cant contribute to the fund everybody knows you were friends that comes first you ah spent time with him when he came here and whenever you went over to standjo yeah he used to say i was a branch in the mud carter smiled wistfully he meant stick but i got such a kick out of it i never corrected him hed talk me into going out and sharing a bottle of wine or a meal hed say how he was getting me out of my rut how hed teach me to flirt with the pretty girls then hed ask to see the latest pictures of my kids his voice thickened his eyes glistened with moisture before he turned away and cleared his throat so ill ah arrange for the tree yes thank you john she turned away herself ashamed that shed let ryans suspicions lure her into probing into the mans grief meanwhile um i hope youll get back to the lab soon youre missed ill be swinging through but ive got a priority project for the next few weeks new renaissance display he managed a smile again when she looked back at him if you could tap the grapevine around here youd have a hell of a potent wine a major exhibit like thats just what we need after the bad taste weve got in our mouths over the breakin nice thinking yes well she trailed off spotting detective cook as he wandered in sorry john id better deal with this yeah i dont know why he lowered his voice to a whisper he makes me nervous looks like he suspects everybody of doing something with barely a nod for cook he scurried out his dusty shoes scarcely making a sound detective what can i do for you this is some setup youve got here dr jones rather than take out what he thought of as his closeup glasses he squinted at the painting thats the real thing isnt it yes its a bronzino sixteenthcentury italian renaissance artist the institute is very pleased to have it the owners have agreed to lend it to us for display mind if i ask what shes doing there the restorer barely glanced at him giving him one flick of a look from behind her magnifying goggles the painting was part of a collection long neglected of a recluse in georgia miranda said this piece as well as several others suffered some damage dirt damp direct sunlight for an unfortunate period of time its been cleaned in itself thats a slow careful process we cant risk damaging the work so it takes a great deal of time and skill now were attempting to repair some damage to the paint we use only ingredients which would have been available when the painting was created so as to preserve its integrity this takes research talent and patience if weve done our job the painting will be as it was when the artist finished it a lot like police work he commented is it its a slow careful process you cant risk damaging the case you only use information that comes through it it takes research a kind of talent he said with a ghost of a smile and a hell of a lot of patience you do it right you got the whole picture when youre done a very interesting analogy detective and one that made her incredibly nervous and are you getting the whole picture just bits and pieces dr jones just bits and pieces he dug around in his pocket and came up with an open pack of juicy fruit gum no thank you quit smoking he took out a piece carefully unwrapped it and put the paper and the foil into his pocket again still driving me nuts got this patch on but its not all its cracked up to be let me tell you you smoke no i dont smart girl me i used to suck down two packs a day then it got to be you cant smoke here you cant smoke there youre catching a couple drags in some closet or going outside in the rain makes you feel like a criminal he smiled again miranda barely resisted shifting her feet and instead imagined herself tapping her foot snapping her fingers im sure its a difficult habit to break an addictions what it is its a hard thing to face up to an addiction it can take over your life make you do things you wouldnt do otherwise he knew about andrews drinking she could see it in his eyes and thought he wanted her to see it i never smoked she said flatly would you like to go to my office no no i wont keep you long he drew a breath of air that smelled of paint and turpentine and commercial cleaner didnt think id run into you at all since id been told you were out on leave took a little vacation she started to agree she wasnt sure if it was instinct or simple fear that stopped her im sure youre aware that i was told to take leave detective due to the breakin here and some difficulties that came out of my trip to florence last month she was quick he thought and not easily tripped i heard something about it another bronze piece right you had some trouble authenticating it i dont think so others do she moved away from the painting well aware ears were pricked it caused you some trouble anyway two bronzes funny dont you think theres nothing funny to me about having my reputation on the line i can understand that still you only had to stay out a few days this time she didnt even hesitate it would have been longer but were beginning an important project that falls into my specific field of knowledge somebody mentioned that to me and i heard about your man in italy the murder thats a rough one distress came into her eyes made her look away he was a friend a good one got any idea whod take him out that way she looked back now coldly detective cook if i knew who had crushed my friends skull id be in florence talking to the police cook moved the gum to the other side of his mouth with his tongue i didnt know theyd released the fractured skull my mother was informed she said in the same chilly voice as was giovannis family she could only pray that was true are you investigating his murder or our burglary just curious cops are curious he spread his hands i came in because your brothers got a theory on how maybe the two incidents are connected yes he told me do you see a connection sometimes you dont see it until youre on top of it you also authenticated the ah he took out his notebook flipped through as if to refresh his memory bronze david sixteenth century in the style of leonardo though she felt her palms go damp she resisted rubbing them on her trousers thats correct nobody can seem to lay their hands on the paperwork for that the reports documents pictures andrew told me that as well i can only assume the thief took the authenticating documents as well as the bronze that makes sense but hed have to know just where to look wouldnt he camera blips only put him inside for he flipped pages again about ten minutes hed have to be fast as greased lightning to have added a trip to the lab for records i did the route at a fast walk myself takes a full minute that doesnt seem like much but when you put it into an eighttotenminute time span its a chunk she couldnt afford to allow her gaze to waver her voice to weaken all i can tell you is the records were filed and now theyre missing as is the bronze you have many people work alone here at night after hours like your friend in florence occasionally though it would only be senior staff security wouldnt allow anyone else entrance once the building was closed like you and your brother coming in the week after the burglary excuse me i got a statement here from your night security he says that on march twentythree about twothirty am you called in and informed him you and dr andrew jones were coming in to do some lab work would that be accurate i wouldnt argue with it thats late hours you keep not habitually her heart was stampeding in her chest but her hands were steady enough as she realigned a loosened pin in her hair we decided to come in and get some work done while it was quiet is that a problem detective not for me just keeping it tidy he tucked his notebook away scanned the room again you know its hard to find a paper clip out of place here you and your brother run a tidy organized place at home he leaves his socks on the living room floor and never puts his keys in the same place twice was she getting too good at this she wondered was she in some nasty little way actually starting to enjoy dancing with a cop i bet you do keep everything in its place i mean i bet you put everything in the same place every time a routine a habit you could call it an addiction yes she realized in some small way she was enjoying it enjoying the fact that she was holding her own detective i have an appointment very soon and im pressed for time didnt mean to keep you so long appreciate the time and the explanation he added gesturing toward the painting looks like an awful lot of work almost be easier to paint the whole thing over again then it wouldnt be a bronzino a lot of people wouldnt know the difference you would he nodded at her i bet you could spot a forgery just by eyeballing it she wondered if the blood had drained from her face or if it merely seemed that way hed gotten so close and so quickly while shed been smugly congratulating herself on playing her part to perfection not always a visual study isnt cant be conclusive if the fake is well executed it takes laboratory tests like the ones you run here the ones you were doing in florence last month yes exactly like those the sweat that ran in a thin trail down her back was ice cold if you have an interest i can arrange a demonstration but not at the moment she said with a glance at her watch i really she broke off swamped by a war of relief and nerves when ryan came through the door miranda how nice to see you again your assistant said i might find you here butter smooth he took her hand brought it to his lips im sorry im a bit late traffic thats all right she heard the words but couldnt feel her own mouth move ive been tied up for a while detective cook oh yes we met didnt we ryan offered a hand the morning after the burglary here has there been any progress were working on it im sure you are i dont mean to interrupt shall i wait for you in your office miranda yes no are we finished for now detective yes maam im glad to hear youre not put off by the theft here mr boldari not everyone would loan a gallery all that art after its security was breached i have every confidence in dr jones and the institute im sure my property will be well protected still it wouldnt hurt to add on a few men its being done miranda told cook i could give you the names of a couple of good cops who moonlight in private security thats very kind of you you could give the names to my assistant no problem dr jones mr boldari there was something between those two cook thought as he headed out the door maybe it was just sex and maybe it was something else and there was something a definite something about boldari maybe everything about him checked out neat as pins in a cushion but there was something ryan he cut miranda off with an almost undetectable shake of the head im sorry you havent recovered your property we ah havent given up on it ive arranged for lunch in our vip lounge i thought that would give us time to go over some of the plans for the exhibit perfect he offered her his arm im anxious to hear your plans in more detail he walked her down the hall up the stairs keeping up inane chatter until they were safely alone in the small elegant lounge had he been grilling you for long it seemed like all my life he talked about forgeries wanted to know if i could detect one by just looking really the table was already set for three with appetizers of crackers and black olive pate on hand he spread one hes a sharp cop though the columbo routine wears a little thin columbo lieutenant columbo ryan bit into the cracker peter falk cheap cigar rumpled trench coat when she only looked blank he shook his head your education in popular culture is sadly lacking doesnt matter he waved it away he may actually be some help in all this before its over ryan if he makes the connection if he pursues that angle it could lead him to you youve got the forgeries it wont lead him to me or to you and in a month give or take a few days i wont have the forgeries ill have the originals and well both polish the smear off our reputations she pressed her fingers to her eyes and tried to bring back that momentary sense of satisfaction shed experienced it just wasnt there i dont see how this is going to work you have to trust me dr jones this is my particular field of expertise he gestured toward the place settings whos joining us andrew you cant tell him miranda i know she linked her hands together and came perilously close to wringing them hes trying to get his life back im not going to add to his stress by telling him im involved in planning a robbery if things go according to plan itll be a burglary and he added taking her hands to soothe her nerves all were doing is taking back what was stolen so why dont we say youre involved in planning a recovery that doesnt make it less of a crime that doesnt make me feel less guilty when cook gives me that houndonthescent look and asks me about forgeries you handled him and i was starting to enjoy it she muttered i dont know whats happening to me every step im taking or planning to take is outside the law inside outside he gave a slight shrug the line shifts more often than you might think not my line ryan my lines always been firmly dug in one place she turned away there was a message on my phone machine here from carlo rinaldi rinaldi he set down the cracker hed just spread what did he want help she squeezed her eyes shut she wasnt helping anyone except possibly herself what did that make her he asked me for help no one believed him about the bronze he must have gone to see my mother because he said she tossed him out of her office he said i was the only one who could help him prove the bronze was authentic and thats what youre going to do hes dead ryan he and giovanni are dead theres nothing i can do to help them youre not responsible for what happened to them youre not he insisted turning her to face him now ask yourself this he held her shoulders firmly kept their gazes locked and on level do you think either of them would want you to stop until youve finished until youre able to prove the bronze is genuine until by proving that youre able to point the finger at whoever killed them i dont know i cant know she drew in a breath let it out slowly but i do know i cant live with myself unless i do finish one asked me for help the other did me a favor i cant stop until ive finished the lines shifted miranda whoever killed them drew it this time i want revenge she shut her eyes i keep waiting to feel ashamed of that but i dont i cant darling do you always question every human emotion you feel i suppose ive been feeling a lot more of them lately it makes it difficult to think in a logical pattern you want to think in a logical pattern ill help you i want to hear your plans for the exhibition no you dont of course i do the boldari gallery is lending you some very important pieces he lifted her hand to his lips i want to know what you intend to do with them this is business ryan she wasnt sure what she wanted to say and never had the chance to say it as andrew opened the door and came in things are moving fast he commented eyeing the way ryan nibbled on his sisters fingers hello andrew ryan lowered mirandas hand but kept it in his why dont the two of you tell me whats going on here happy to we decided to go ahead with our earlier plan for a cooperative loan between my gallery and your organization expanded on it it has the benefit of raising a great deal of money for the nea and putting miranda back where she belongs ryan turned to the table lifted a glass pitcher and poured three glasses of water your mother was very enthusiastic about the project yeah ive spoken with her which partially explained his sour mood he supposed she told me you called her from new york did she with a smile ryan passed the glasses out i imagine she assumed thats where i was why dont we let her and everyone else go on assuming that so much less complicated miranda and i prefer to keep our personal relationship private then you shouldnt stroll through the building holding hands the gossip mills already chewing up the grist thats not a problem for me is that a problem for you he asked miranda then continued smoothly before she could speak miranda was about to tell me her plans for the exhibit i have some ideas of my own for that and the gala why dont we sit down and see what we can come up with deciding it was best miranda stepped between them this will be an important event for us for me personally im grateful that ryan wants to go ahead with it it got me back here andrew and i need to be here all that aside an exhibit of this scope is something ive hoped to do for years which is one of the reasons i can move quickly on implementing it its been in my head a long time she laid a hand on his arm after what happened in florence mother would never have given me this chance unless ryan had demanded to work with me i know okay i know maybe it just takes me longer to switch gears these days but youre all right i havent had a drink day three he said with a thin smile and two nights of sweats and shakes and desperation i dont want to go there with you miranda okay she let her hand drop it seemed they both had their secrets now ill tell catering were ready for lunch it isnt fair it isnt right she has no business being back being in charge again i wont have her ruining my plans i wont allow it years ive waited sacrificed the dark lady is mine she came to me and in that sly smile i saw a kindred spirit a mind that could wait and watch and plan and accumulate power like coins in a jar and in that smile i saw finally the means to destroy all of my enemies to take what was mine what was always mine i had ruined her i had done it the hand that wrote began to shake used the pen like a blade to stab at the page in the diary viciously until the room was full of ragged breathing gradually all movement stopped and the breathing became slow and deep and even almost trancelike control was slipping sliding out of those competent fingers leaking out of that strong and calculating mind but it could still be wrenched back the effort was painful but it could still be done this is only a reprieve a few weeks in the eye of the storm ill find a way to make her pay to make them all pay for what was denied me the dark lady is still mine weve killed together miranda has the forgery its the only explanation the police dont have the weapon how unlike her how bold of her to go to florence to find a way to steal the bronze i hadnt thought such actions were in her nature so i didnt anticipate didnt add the possibility into the equation i wont make that mistake again did she stand and stare down at giovanni was there horror and fear in her eyes oh i hope so is fear dogging her still like a baying hound snapping at her heels it is i know it is she ran back to maine does she look nervously over her shoulder even as she strides down the hallowed halls of the institute does she know somewhere inside that her time is short let her have her reprieve let her bask in the power shes done nothing to earn it will be all the sweeter when shes stripped of it once and for all id never planned to take her life as well but plans change when shes dead her reputation devoured by scandal ill weep at her grave they will be tears of triumph chapter twentyfour the false moustache itched and was probably unnecessary as were the contacts that changed his eyes from brown to an indistinct hazel and the long blond wig hed fashioned into a streaming ponytail his face and any exposed skin had been carefully lightened toning down the gold hue to the pale and pasty complexion of a man much happier out of the sun three earrings glittered on his right earlobe wireframed glasses with tiny round rosy lenses were perched on his nose he rather liked the bloom they gave everything hed chosen his wardrobe with care tight pegged red pants a saffron silk shirt with flowing sleeves black patent leather boots with small heels after all he didnt want to be subtle he looked like a desperately fashionable fanatically artsy type just skirting the edge of reasonable taste hed seen enough of the breed in his career to know the right moves the right speech patterns he checked his face in the rearview mirror of the midsized sedan hed chosen from rentawreck the car hadnt been a pleasure to drive but it had gotten him the sixtyodd miles to pine state foundry he had hopes it would get him back to the coast when he was finished he took his cheap scarred fauxleather portfolio case out of the car with him inside were dozens of sketches most of which hed borrowed so to speak from miranda the forgery of the david had to have been cast somewhere he thought somewhere due to time constraints locally and this was the closest foundry to the institute the one his quick search of records indicated the staff and students used habitually he took out a roll of peppermints and began chewing one as he studied the foundry the place was a scar on the hillside he decided ugly brick and metal jagging up spreading out with towers puffing smoke he wondered how closely they skirted epa regulations then reminded himself that wasnt his problem or his mission tossing his ponytail behind his back he slung the strap of the portfolio over his shoulder and headed in the direction of a low metal building with dusty windows in the heeled boots adding a little swish was a matter of course inside was a long counter with metal shelves behind stuffed with fat ring binders plastic tubs filled with hooks and screws and large metal objects that defied description at the counter on a high stool a woman sat paging through a copy of good housekeeping she glanced up at ryan her eyebrows shot up instantly her gaze skimmed up and down the slight smirk wasnt quite disguised what can i do for you im francis kowowski a student at the new england institute of art history her tongue was in her cheek now she caught the scent of him and thought of poppies for gods sake what kind of man wanted to smell like poppies is that so yes he moved forward letting eagerness come into his eyes several of my classmates have had bronzes cast here thats my art im a sculptor ive just transferred to the institute arent you a little old to be a student he worked up a flush ive only recently been able to afford to pursue financially you see he looked miserable embarrassed and touched the clerks heart yeah its rough you got something you want cast i didnt bring the model just sketches i want to be sure its forged just exactly to my specifications as if gaining confidence he briskly opened the portfolio one of the other students told me about a small bronze that was done here but he couldnt remember whod done the casting this is a sketch of the piece its david like in goliath right she tilted her head turning the sketch around this is really good did you draw it yes he beamed at her i was hoping to find out who did the casting on this so i could make arrangements for him to do my work it was about three years ago though according to my friend three years she pursed her lips thats going back a ways i know he tried the puppy look again its vitally important to me to find out my friend said that the piece was beautifully done the bronze was perfect and whoever did the foundry work used a renaissance formula really knew his craft the sculpture was like museum quality he took out another sketch showed her the dark lady ive worked desperately hard on this piece its taken all my energies almost my life if you can understand his eyes began to shine as she studied it shes great really great you oughta be selling these drawings kid seriously i make a little money doing portraits he mumbled its not what i want to do its just to eat i bet youre going to be a big success thanks delighted with her he let tears swim into his eyes its been such a long haul already so many disappointments there are times you could just give up just surrender but somehow he held up a hand as if overcome sympathetically she popped a tissue out of a box and handed it to him thank you im so sorry he dabbed delicately under his tinted lenses but i know i can do this i have to do this and for this bronze i need the best youve got ive saved enough money to pay whatever you charge extra if i have to dont worry about extra she patted his hand then turned to her computer terminal three years back lets see what we can find out odds are it was whitesmith he gets a lot of the work from students she began to click and clack with inchlong red nails and shot him a wink lets see if we can get you an a i appreciate this so much when i was driving up here i just knew this was going to be a special day for me by the way i just love your nails that color is fabulous against your skin it took less than ten minutes i bet this is the one pete whitesmith just like i figured hes top of the line around here and most anywhere else if you ask me did a job for this kid i remember this kid harrison mathers he was pretty good too not as good as you she added sending ryan a maternal smile did he get a lot of work done here harrison i mean yeah several pieces always hung around over petes shoulder nervous kid here it shows a small bronze nude of david with sling thats the one thats great amazing whitesmith he still works here sure hes a cornerstone you go on over to the foundry tell pete babs said to treat you right i dont know how to thank you how much would you charge to do a drawing of my kids for you absolutely free he shined a smile at her sure i remember it whitesmith mopped at his face under the bill of a stained blue cap he had a face that should have been carved in granite all blocky square and deep grooves he was built like a bullet broad at the base narrow at the shoulders his voice rose over the roar of furnaces the hard clangs of metal this was the piece whitesmith stared at the sketch ryan showed him yep harry was mighty particular about this one had the formula for the bronze written out wanted me to add some lead so itd cure faster but otherwise it was an old formula im coming up on break lets take this outside grateful ryan followed him out of the heat and noise ive been casting for twentyfive years whitesmith said lighting his break camel and blowing the smoke into the lightly chilled air i gotta say that piece was a little gem ayah one of my favorites you did others for him too harry sure four maybe five in a coupleyear period this was the best of the lot though knew we had something special when he brought in the mold and wax copy now that i think on it and he did taking a long deep drag blowing it out that was the last piece i did for him was it ayah i dont recollect seeing young harry after that students at the institute he shrugged his thin shoulders they come and they go did he work with anybody else no far as i know i did all harrys casting he was interested in the process not all the students give a hot damn about this end of it just what they think of as art he sneered a little lemme tell you pal what i do is goddamn art a good foundryman is an artist i couldnt agree more thats why i was so desperate to find you the artist who worked on this wonderful little david yeah well obviously pleased whitesmith sucked in smoke some of those artist types are snots pure and simple sons of bitches figure a guy like mes just a tool i gotta be an artist and a scientist you get a prize winning sculpture outta here you got me to thank for it most dont bother though i knew a foundryman in toledo ryan sighed lustily i considered him a god i hope harrison was properly appreciative of your work he was okay i guess he used a flexible mold for the david yeah silicon you gotta be careful there whitesmith jabbed with his cigarette for emphasis then nipped it between his thumb and forefingers and flicked it away in a long high arch you can get distortions shrinkage but the kid knew his stuff he went with the lostwax method for the model me i can work with all of them wax sand plaster investment do the finishing and tool work if the client wants and i stick with my work all the way dont like being rushed either oh did harry rush you on that last piece he was a pain in the ass sideways whitesmith snorted through his nose youda thought he was leonardo da fucking vinci on deadline then he shrugged kid was okay had talent though it was a long shot ryan took out the sketch of the dark lady what do you think of her whitesmith pursed his lips well now thats a sexy broad wouldnt mind casting her what are you using for her a little knowledge ryan thought could be a dangerous thing or it could be just enough wax with a plaster investment good we can work fine with that fire the plaster right here too you dont want air bubbles in that wax ace no indeed ryan slipped the sketch away again the man was too solid he thought too cooperative to be involved so did harry ever come around with anyone not that i recollect whitesmiths eyes narrowed why oh i just wondered if the friend who told me about the piece and you ever came by with him he spoke so highly of your work ayah and whod that be james crispin ryan improvised hes a painter so he wouldnt have come around unless he was hanging with harry ive researched the formula he added if i bring it in along with the wax cast and mold youll do the work thats what were here for i appreciate it ryan held out a hand and ill be in touch i like the look of your lady there whitesmith added with a nod toward ryans portfolio as he turned back to the foundry door dont get the chance to work on anything that classy often ill treat her right thanks whistling lightly ryan walked back toward the car he was congratulating himself on an easy and successful mornings work when another car pulled into the lot cook got out stretched his back gave ryan a mild stare morning ryan nodded adjusted his pretty rosecolored glasses and slid behind the wheel of his rented car while cook walked to the offices close very close ryan thought but thered been no flicker of recognition in those cop eyes for now he was still one short step ahead once he was back in the house by the cliffs he removed the moustache took off the wig gratefully blinked out the contacts the precaution had been necessary after all he thought as he happily removed the ridiculous shirt apparently cook had forgery on the brain that was fine when the job was over having cooks investigation slanted toward most of the truth would be an advantage now it was only mildly unnerving he removed the makeup from his face throat and hands brewed a pot of coffee and settled down to work there were eight students whod used the foundry in those critical two weeks hed already eliminated three off the top as their projects had been too large now thanks to good old babs and pete he had the one he wanted it didnt take much time to go back into the records hed already accessed from the institute and there he found harrys class during that final semester renaissance bronzes the human form and miranda had taught the course he hadnt figured that he realized hed wanted to see another name carters andrews anyone he could concentrate on uncovering then he realized he should have expected it the david had been hers the dark lady had been hers she was the key the core and he was beginning to believe she was the reason one of her students had cast a bronze david the bronze david ryan had no doubt he skimmed further calling up final grades she was tough he thought with a smile miranda didnt hand out as like candy only four out of her twenty students had rated one with the edge slanted heavily toward bs a scatter of cs and one incomplete harrison k mathers incomplete no final project class dropped now why would you do that harrison k ryan wondered when you went to the trouble to have a bronze figure cast ten days before the due date unless youd never intended to worry about the grade he looked up matherss records noted that hed attended twelve classes at the institute over a twoyear period his grades were admirable until the last semester when they took a sharp nosedive taking out his cell phone he dialed the number listed under harrisons personal information hello yes this is dennis seaworth in student records from the new england institute im trying to reach harrison mathers this is mrs mathers his mother harry doesnt live here anymore oh i see were doing an update on our students trying to gather input for next years classes i wonder if you could put me in touch with him he moved out to california she sounded weary he never finished his classes at the institute yes we have those records were hoping to discover if and why any of our former students were dissatisfied with the program here if you find out tell me he was doing so well there he loved it thats good to know if i could talk to him sure she recited a number with a san francisco area code ryan dialed the west coast number and was told by a recording the number had been disconnected well he thought a trip to california would give him a chance to see his brother michael harrison mathers with the most recent plans for the exhibit still crowded in her head miranda frowned at ryan yes harrison mathers he repeated tell me about him she slipped out of her jacket hung it in the foyer closet do i know a harrison mathers he was a student of yours a few years ago youll have to give me more than a name ryan ive had hundreds of students you taught him a course on renaissance bronzes three years ago he got an incomplete an incomplete she struggled to reorder her thoughts harry it came back to her with both pleasure and regret yes he took that course hed been studying at the institute for several years i think he was talented very bright he started out with me very well both in papers and in sketching she circled her neck as she walked into the parlor i remember he started to miss class or come in looking as if hed been up all night he was distracted his work suffered drugs i dont know drugs family problems a girl she moved her shoulders dismissively he was only nineteen or twenty it could have been a dozen things i did talk to him warn him that he needed to concentrate on his work it improved but not a great deal then he stopped coming in just before the end of the course he never turned in his final project he had one cast at the pine state foundry the second week in may a bronze figure she stared then lowered herself into a chair are you trying to tell me hes involved in this im telling you he had a figure cast a figure of david with sling a project he never turned in he was there while the david was being tested and he dropped out shortly after was he ever in the lab the sick and uneasy rolling was back in her stomach she remembered harry mathers not well not clearly but well enough for it to hurt the entire class would have been taken through the lab any student is taken through the labs restoration research its part of the program whod he hang with i dont know i dont get involved in my students personal lives i only remember him as clearly as i do because he had genuine talent and he seemed to waste it at the end she felt the beginnings of a headache creep in behind her eyes oddly enough for hours that day shed forgotten everything but the exhibit the thrill of the planning ryan he was a boy he couldnt have been behind a forgery like this when i was twenty i stole a thirteenthcentury madonna mosaic from a private collection in westchester then went out and had pizza with alice mary grimaldi how can you possibly brag about something like that im not bragging miranda im stating a fact and pointing out that age has nothing to do with certain types of behavior now if i wanted to brag id tell you about the tang horse i stole from the met a few years back but i wont he added because it upsets you she only stared at him is that your way of trying to lighten the mood didnt work did it and because she suddenly looked so tired he walked over to take the bottle of white wine hed already opened and poured her a glass try this instead instead of drinking she passed the glass from hand to hand how did you find out about harry just basic research a short field trip the unhappy look that came into her eyes distracted him he sat on the arm of the chair and began to rub her neck and shoulders ive got to go out of town for a few days what where new york there are some details i have to deal with several of which involve the transport of the pieces for this exhibit i also need to go out to san francisco and find your young harry hes in san francisco according to his mama but his phones been disconnected you found all this out today youve got your work ive got mine hows yours coming she ran her hands nervously through her hair those thiefs fingers were magic and were loosening muscles she hadnt realized were knotted i i chose some fabric for drapings and worked with the carpenter on some platforms the invitations came in today i approved them good were on schedule when are you leaving first thing in the morning ill be back in a week or so and ill keep in touch because he could feel her begin to relax he played with her hair you might want to see if andrew will move back in so youre not alone i dont mind being alone i mind he picked her up slid into the chair and settled her on his lap since she wasnt going to drink it he took the glass of wine out of her hand and set it aside but since hes not here at the moment he cupped the back of her neck and brought her mouth to his hed meant to leave it at that a kiss a nuzzle a quiet moment but the taste of her was warmer than hed expected the morninginthewoods scent of her skin more provocative than it should have been he found himself nipping his teeth into that soft lower lip licking at the little ache as she shivered once and when her arms tightened around him and her mouth moved urgently under his he lost himself slipped into her surrounded himself with her curves lines scent flavors his busy hands unfastened the buttons of her blouse skimmed under to bare those shoulders to trace hypnotically over the swell of her breasts sighs moans shudders i cant get enough of you his words were more irritated than pleased i always think i have then i only have to see you to want you and no one had ever wanted her like this she felt herself falling deep deeper into the rippling warm waters of a wide well of sensation just feelings no thoughts no reason just needs basic as breath his fingers played over her breasts silky bird wings of motion his tongue followed them as he shifted her nudging her up until his mouth could close hotly over her so that the echoing tug low in her belly mirrored the aches he caught her nipple in his teeth a light bite a small exquisite pain willing eager she arched back giving herself to him to the moment delighting in his single focus to feed on her just as intent she took her hands over him stroking sliding seeking finding her way under his shirt to flesh sampling that flesh and feeding herself as they rolled from the chair to the rug her legs parted trapping him in that erotic v her hips arched so that heat pressed against heat each movement tormenting them both he needed to be in her to fill her to bury himself in her the primal need to possess to be possessed had them both grappling with clothes gasping for air as they tumbled over the floor then she was astride him her body bent forward her palms pressed to his chest so their mouths could tangle again slowly slowly he lifted her hips their eyes locked both dark and glazed finally finally she lowered herself to him took him in held him there with muscles clamped and trembling then she rode body arched back hair flowing like wild red rain over her shoulders her eyes narrowed to slits as pleasure overwhelmed speed ruled now here was energy electric waves of power that swam into the blood whipped at the heart fueled the body to bursting faster harder deeper with his fingers digging desperately into her hips her breath expelling in harsh sobs the orgasm lanced through her the desperate edge of it racking her wrecking her still he drove into her his grip locking her to him as he pushed her higher with strong steady thrusts a roaring filled her head like a sea warring with a gale and the next wave was scorching tossing her up on one long hot sweep she thought she heard someone scream and he saw her in that mindless moment hair tumbled body arched arms lifted her eyes half closed her lips curved in a smile of sly female awareness she was as priceless as alluring and magnificent as the dark lady and just as powerful as his own release burst through him he had one clear thought here was his destiny then his mind was wiped clean as the same wave caught him and flipped him over the edge good god it was the best he could do never before had he lost himself so utterly in a woman or felt so bound to one though she still shuddered she seemed to melt onto him her body sliding down until her gasps were muffled against his throat miranda he said her name once stroking a hand down her back up again christ im going to miss you she kept her eyes closed said nothing at all but she let herself sink in let herself go because a part of her didnt believe hed come back he was gone when she awoke in the morning leaving only a note on the pillow beside her good morning dr jones i made coffee itll be fresh enough unless you oversleep youre out of eggs ill be in touch though it made her feel foolish as a lovesick teenager she read it half a dozen times then got up to tuck it like a declaration of undying devotion in her jewelry case the ring hed pushed onto her finger the ring shed kept foolishly in a velvetlined square box in the case was gone his plane landed at ninethirty and ryan was uptown at his gallery by eleven it was a fraction of the size of the institute more like a sumptuous private home than a gallery the ceilings soared the archways were wide and the stairs curved giving the space an airy and fluid feel the carpets hed chosen to scatter over the marble and hardwood floors were as much works of art as the paintings and sculptures his office there was on the fourth level hed kept it small in order to devote every available space to public areas but it was well and carefully appointed and lacked no comfort he spent three hours at his desk catching up on work with his assistant in meetings with his gallery director approving sales and acquisitions and arranging for the necessary security and transportation for the pieces to be shipped to maine he took time to schedule interviews with the press regarding the upcoming exhibit and fundraiser decided to shuffle in a fitting for a new tux and called his mother to tell her to buy a new dress he was sending the whole family to maine for the gala next on the schedule was a call to his travel agent cousin joey its ry hey my favorite traveling man hows it going well enough i need a flight to san francisco day after tomorrow openend return no problemo what name you want to use mine theres a change okay ill get you booked and fax you the itinerary where you at home you can book flights for my family going to maine he gave his cousin the dates got it all firstclass right naturally always a pleasure doing business with you ry well thats nice to hear because i have a favor to ask shoot im going to give you a list of names i need to find out what kind of traveling these people have been doing for the last three and a half years three and a half years jesus christ ry concentrate on international flights to and from italy in particular ready for the names look ry i love you like a brother this kind of thingll take days maybe weeks and its dicey you dont just punch a few buttons and get that kind of info airlines arent supposed to give it out it was a song and dance hed heard before ive got season tickets to the yankees vip lounge with locker room passes there was a short silence give me the names i knew i could count on you joey when he was done he kicked back in his chair he took the ring hed given miranda out of his pocket watched it shine in the light coming through the filtered glass at his back he thought he would have his friend the jeweler pop the stones and make them into earrings for her earrings were safer than a ring women even bright practical women could get the wrong idea about a ring shed appreciate the gesture he thought and he was going to owe her something after all hed have the earrings made then have them shipped to her when he and the bronzes were a comfortable distance away he imagined once she had a chance to think it through shed conclude that hed acted in the only logical fashion no one could expect him to come out of his last job emptyhanded he put the ring back in his pocket so hed stop imagining what it had looked like on her hand she was going to get what she needed he reminded himself and when he rose his fingers were still toying with the ring they would prove her bronze had been genuine theyd uncover a forger a murderer and shed be haloed in the spotlight with her reputation glinting like gold he had several clients who would pay a delightful fee for a prize like the dark lady he had only to choose the lucky winner and that fee would cover his time his expenses his aggravation with a nice little bonus like cream over the top unless he decided to keep it for himself she would be without question the prize of his private collection but business was business if he found the right client and gained the right fee he could start a new gallery in chicago or atlanta or maine no hed have to stay clear of maine after this was done a pity he thought hed come to love it there near the sea near the cliffs catching scents of water and pine hed miss it hed miss her it couldnt be helped he told himself he had to neatly close out one area of his life and start a new one as a completely legitimate art broker hed keep his word to his family and hed have kept his word to miranda more or less everyone would go back where they belonged it was his own fault if hed let his feelings get a little too tangled up most of that he was sure was due to the fact theyd been virtually living together for weeks now he liked waking up beside her a little too much he enjoyed standing with her on the cliffs listening to that husky voice nudging one of those rare smiles out of her the ones that reached her eyes and took that sad look out of them the fact was the very worrying fact was there was nothing about her that didnt appeal to him it was a good thing they had their own spaces back for a while they would put it all back in perspective with a little distance but he wondered why as he nearly convinced himself this was true he felt a nasty little ache around his heart she tried not to think about him to wonder if he thought of her it was more productive she told herself to focus entirely exclusively on her work it would very likely be all she had left before much longer she nearly succeeded through most of the day she had dozens of details demanding her skill and attention if her mind wandered once or twice she was disciplined enough to steer it back to the task at hand if a new level of loneliness had been reached in only a single day she would learn to adjust she would have to miranda was about to shut down for the day and take the rest of her work home when her computer signaled an incoming email she finished her long detailed post to the decorator shed contracted regarding the lengths of fabrics required copying both andrew and the proper procurement clerk in requisitions she scanned the post made a few minor adjustments then clicked to both send and receive her incoming mail flashed onscreen under the header a death in the family uneasy she clicked on read you have the false lady theres blood on her hands she wants it to be yours admit your mistake pay the price and live go on as you are and nothing will stop her killing becomes her miranda stared at the message reading each word over and over until she realized she was curled in the chair rocking they wanted her to be afraid to be terrified and oh god she was they knew she had the forgery it could only mean someone had seen her with giovanni or that he had told someone someone who had killed him and wished her dead struggling for control she studied the return address lost who was lost the url was the standard route all standjo organizations used for electronic mail she did a quick name search but found nothing then hit the reply button who are you she left it at that and sent in took only seconds for the message to flash across her screen denying her not a known user hed been quick she decided but he had taken a chance sending her the post what could be sent could surely be traced she printed out a hard copy saved the post to a file a glance at her watch told her it was nearly six there was no one to help her now no one was waiting for her she was alone chapter twentyfive so have you heard from ryan miranda checked off items on the list fixed to her clipboard as she supervised the maintenance crew in the removal of selected paintings from the wall in the south gallery yes his office faxed the details of the transportation schedule all items will arrive next wednesday im having a team of our security meet their security at the airport andrew studied her profile for another moment then shrugged they both knew that wasnt what hed meant ryan had already been gone a week he dug into the bag of pretzels hed taken to eating by the pound they made him thirsty and when he was thirsty he drank gallons of water then he had to piss like a racehorse hed worked it out in his mind that all the liquid was flushing toxins out of his system ms purdue and clara are dealing with the caterer he told her we dont have a final count for attendees but theyd like the menu approved id like you to take a look at it before we sign the final contract its really your show its our show miranda corrected still checking off her list she wanted both the paintings and the frames cleaned before the opening and had sent a memo to restoration giving them priority it better be a good one closing off this gallery has a lot of the visitors grumbling if they come back in a couple of weeks theyll get more than their moneys worth she took off her glasses and rubbed her eyes youve been putting in a lot of hours on this theres a lot to do and not much time to do it anyway i like being busy yeah he rattled his pretzels neither one of us is looking for loose time right now youre doing okay is that the code for are you drinking it came out with an edge he hadnt intended sorry his fingers dived into the bag again no im not drinking i know youre not it wasnt code im dealing with it im glad you came back home but i dont want you to feel you have to be there with me if youd rather be with annie the fact that ive figured out i want to be with annie makes it a little rough to stay there sleeping on her couch if you get the picture yeah i get the picture she crossed over to dip into the pretzels herself any idea when ryans getting back not exactly they stood for a moment each crunching pretzels and contemplating the annoyance of sexual frustration wanna go out and get drunk later andrew grinned at her just a little recovery humor ha ha she dug into the bag came up with a few grains of salt sighed got any more of these ryans first stop in san francisco was the gallery hed chosen the old warehouse in the waterfront district because hed wanted a lot of space and had decided to separate his business from the dozens of galleries downtown it had worked making boldaris more exclusive unique and allowing him to provide fledgling artists with a chance to show their work in a topflight gallery hed decided on a casual ambiance rather than the elegance hed created in new york here paintings might be spotlighted against raw brick or wood and sculpture often stood on rough metal columns wide unframed windows provided a view of the bay and the busy tourist traffic a secondfloor cafe provided artists and art lovers with foamy cappuccino and lattes at tiny tables reminiscent of a sidewalk trattoria while they looked down on the main gallery or gazed up at the thirdfloor studios ryan settled himself at one of the tables and grinned across at his brother michael so hows business remember that metal sculpture you told me looked like a train wreck i think my opinion was it looked like the wreck of a circus train yeah that was it we sold it yesterday for twenty thousand and change a lot of people have more money than taste hows the family see for yourself youre expected for dinner ill be there he leaned back studying his brother as michael ordered coffee for both of them it suits you ryan commented marriage family the house in the burbs it better im in for the duration and a good thing for you it helps keep mama off your ass it doesnt help much i saw her yesterday im supposed to tell you she needs new pictures of the kids how is she supposed to remember what they look like if you dont send pictures we sent her ten pounds of pictures last month you can deliver the next batch in person i want you and the family to come in for the exhibit and fundraiser at the institute you got the memo on that right yeah i got it any problem with the scheduling michael considered as their coffee was served none that i can think of we should be able to make it the kids always love a chance to go into new york and see the family fight with their cousins have papa sneak them candy and itll give me a chance to see this phd mama told us about whats she like miranda smart very smart capable smart and capable michael sipped his coffee noting the way his brothers fingers lightly tapped the table ryan wasnt often given to restless or wasted motion he thought the smart capable woman was on his mind and his nerves mama said shes a looker lots of red hair yeah shes a redhead you usually go for blondes when ryan only arched an eyebrow michael laughed come on ry spill it whats the story shes beautiful shes complicated its complicated he decided and finally realized he was tapping his fingers were doing business together on a couple of levels this time michaels brow lifted oh really i dont want to get into that right now missing her was like a fire in his gut lets just say were working together on a couple of projects this exhibit for one and we have a personal relationship were enjoying each other thats all if that were all you wouldnt look so worried im not worried or he hadnt been until shed sneaked into his head again its just complicated michael made a hmm of agreement and decided he was going to enjoy telling his wife that ryan was well and truly hooked on a redheaded phd from maine youve always been able to work your way out of complications yeah since it made him feel better to think so ryan nodded in any case thats only part of the reason im here im looking for a young artist ive got an address but i thought id see if you knew him harrison mathers sculptor mathers michaels forehead creased doesnt ring a bell right off i can check look through the files to see if weve taken any of his work well do that i dont know if hes still at this address if hes in san francisco and looking to sell art well find him have you seen his work i believe i have ryan murmured thinking of the bronze david matherss last known address was a thirdfloor walkup apartment on the wrong side of downtown light rain was falling as ryan approached matherss building a small group of young men huddled in a doorway their eyes scanning the street looking for trouble on the line of pitifully narrow mailboxes built into the wall of the dank foyer ryan saw h mathers in b he headed up the stairs into the faint smell of urine and stale vomit on the door of b someone had painted an excellent study of a medieval castle complete with turrets and drawbridge it resembled a fairy tale a dark one ryan thought when you noticed the single face in the top window gazing out in screaming horror harry he mused had talent and an excellent sense of his current circumstances his home might be his castle but he was a terrified prisoner in it he knocked and waited almost immediately the door behind him opened ryan shifted to the balls of his feet and turned the woman was young and might have been attractive if she hadnt already dressed her face for the nights work it was a whores makeup heavy on the lips and eyes the eyes under the weight of shadow and lashes were hard as arctic ice her hair was plain brown and cut short as a boys he imagined she used a wig during working hours though he took all this in as well as the lush body carelessly displayed in a short flowered robe his attention centered on the big black in her hand its muzzle was as wide as the pacific and pointed deadcenter at his chest he decided it was best to keep his eyes on hers his hands in plain view and his explanation simple im not a cop im not selling anything im just looking for harry i thought you were the other guy her voice was straight out of the bronx but didnt make him feel any more secure let me just say under the circumstances im glad im not could you point that cannon somewhere else she studied him another moment then shrugged yeah sure she lowered it and leaned against the doorjamb i didnt like the look of the other guy didnt like his attitude neither as long as youre holding that gun ill adjust my attitude any way you like she grinned at that a quick flash that nearly overcame the sex doll makeup youre okay slick what do you want with rembrandt a conversation well he aint there and aint been around for a few days thats what i told the other guy i see do you know where harry is i mind my own business im sure you do ryan held one hand palm out moved the other slowly to his wallet he saw her lips purse in consideration as he took out a fifty got a few minutes i might another fiftyd buy you an hour but she shook her head slick you dont look like the type who pays to party conversation he said again and held out the fifty it only took her three seconds to reach out nip the bill with the lethal tips of bloodred fingernails okay come on in the room held a bed a single chair two flea market tables and a metal clothes rack crowded with bright eyecatching colors and cheap fabrics hed been right about the wig he noted two of them a long curly blond and a sleek ravenblack sat on plastic foam heads a little desk held a dressing room mirror and a department store array of cosmetics while distressingly bare the room was tidy as an accountants spread sheet for fifty she told him you can have a beer appreciate it while she moved toward the twoburner stove and midget refrigerator that constituted her kitchen ryan stepped up to a bronze dragon that guarded one of her flimsy tables this is a very nice piece yeah its real art rembrandt did it he has talent i guess she moved her shoulders didnt bother to tug her robe back together he was entitled to look at the merchandise she thought in case he wanted to invest another fifty i said how i liked it and we worked out a trade she smiled as she handed him a bottle of budweiser youre friendly with mathers hes okay doesnt try to scam me for freebies once i had a john up here who wanted to use me for a punching bag instead of a mattress kid comes banging on the door when he heard i was in trouble yelled out how he was the cops she snickered into her beer asshole went out my window with his pants around his ankles rembrandts okay gets a little down smokes a lot of grass thats an artists thing i guess he have many friends slick nobody in this building has many friends hes been here a couple years now and this is the first time ive seen two people come around to his door in one day tell me about the other guy she fingered the fifty in the pocket of her robe big ugly face looked like meat to me somebodys arm you know and you could tell he liked breaking legs said how he wanted to buy one of rembrandts statues but that creep wasnt no art lover gave me grief when i said he wasnt around and i didnt know where he was she hesitated a moment then moved her shoulders again he was carrying had a bulge under his jacket i shut the door in his fat face and got out my friend there she jerked her head toward the pieplatesized kitchen counter where shed laid the you only missed him by a few minutes thats why i thought you was him how big was he the other guy about sixfour maybe five twosixty easy gorilla arms and meat cleaver hands spooky eyes like dirty ice you know guy like that comes up to me on the stroll i give him a pass good thinking the description clicked very close to the man whod attacked miranda harrison mathers was very lucky he wasnt home so what do you want with rembrandt im an art dealer ryan took a business card from the case in his pocket handed it to her classy if you hear from harry or he comes back give him that will you tell him i like his work id like to discuss it with him sure she rubbed a finger over the embossing then lifted the dragon and set the card under its serpentine tail you know slick she reached out and trailed one of those scalpelsharp nails down his shirt its cold and rainy out there you want to converse a little more ill give you a discount hed once been mildly in lust with a girl from the bronx the sentiment of it had him taking another fifty out of his wallet thats for the help and the beer he turned for the door giving the dragon a last glance you get tight for money take that to michael at boldari here on the waterfront hell give you a good price for it yeah ill keep that in mind come back anytime slick she toasted him with the beer i owe you a free ride ryan walked directly across the hall finessed the lock and was inside matherss apartment before his second fifty had been hidden away the room mirrored the one hed just been in as to size ryan doubted the tanks for welding metal were approved by the landlord there were several pieces in varying stages of work none of them showed the insight or talent of the dragon hed given a whore for sex his heart was in bronzes ryan decided when he studied the small fluid nude standing on the stained tank of the toilet a selfcritic he thought artists could be so pathetically insecure he managed to search the entire apartment in under fifteen minutes there was a mattress on the floor with a tangle of sheets and blankets a cigarettescarred dresser with drawers that stuck over a dozen sketch pads most of them filled were stacked on the floor miranda had been right ryan mused as he flipped through he had a good hand the only things in the apartment that appeared well cared for were the art supplies which were arranged on armygray metal shelves and stacked in plastic milk cartons the kitchen held a box of rice krispies a sixpack of beer three eggs moldy bacon and six packages of frozen dinners he also found four neatly rolled joints hidden in a jar of lipton tea bags he found sixtythree cents in change and a longforgotten milky way bar there were no letters no notes no stash of cash he located the final disconnect notice for the phone crumpled in the trash along with the empties for another sixpack nowhere was there a clue where harry had gone or why or when he intended to return hed be back ryan mused giving the room one more scan he wouldnt abandon his art supplies or his stash of dope and when he came back hed call the minute he had his hands on the business card starving artists could be temperamental but they were also predictable and every mothers son or daughter of them hungered for one thing more than food a patron come home soon harry ryan murmured and let himself out chapter twentysix miranda stared down at the fax that had just hummed out of her machine this one was all in caps as if the sender was screaming the words i havent always hated you but i watched you year after year do you remember the spring you graduated from grad school with honors of course and had an affair with the lawyer creg rowe was his name and he broke it off dumped you because you were too cold and didnt pay enough attention to his needs remember that miranda he told his friends you were a mediocre fuck i bet you didnt know that well now you do i wasnt very far away not very far away at all did you ever feel me watching you do you feel it now there isnt much time left you should have done what you were told you should have accepted the way things were the way i wanted them to be maybe giovanni would be alive if you had do you ever think of that i didnt always hate you miranda but i do now can you feel my hate you will the paper trembled in her hands as she read it there was something horribly childlike about the big block letters the schoolyardbully taunts it was meant to hurt humiliate and frighten she told herself she couldnt allow it to succeed but when the buzzer on her intercom sounded her breath caught on a gasp and her fingers clenched and crumpled the edges of the fax foolishly she laid it on her desk smoothing out the creases precisely as she answered loris page yes mr boldari is here dr jones he wonders if you have a moment to see him ryan she nearly said his name aloud pressed her fingertips to her lips to keep the word in her mind only would you ask him to wait please of course so he was back miranda rubbed her hands over her cheeks to bring color back into them she had her pride she thought she was entitled to her pride she wasnt going to rush through the door and throw herself into his arms like some moonstruck lover hed been gone nearly two weeks and not once had he called her oh thered been contact she thought as she hunted up her compact and used the stingy mirror to smooth her hair to add lipstick memos and telexes and email and faxes all sent by some office drone and signed in his name he hadnt bothered to ease away kindly when he was done with her hed had his office staff do it for him she wouldnt make a scene they still had business on several levels she would see it through he wouldnt have the satisfaction of knowing shed needed him had needed him every day and night of those two weeks she steadied herself unlocking a drawer to lay the latest fax on a pile of others theyd been coming in daily now some only a line or two others rambling like the one today the printout of the email was with them though lost had never contacted her again she locked the drawer pocketed the key then went to the door ryan she sent him a polite smile sorry to keep you waiting please come in at her desk lori shifted her eyes from face to face cleared her throat should i hold your calls no that wont be necessary would you like some she never finished as she closed the door behind them he pressed her back against it and crushed his mouth to hers in a fiercely hungry kiss that battered against the wall shed so carefully built fisting her hands she kept her arms at her sides and gave him nothing back not even the passion of resistance when he drew away his eyes narrowed in speculation she inclined her head and shifted aside how was your trip long where did you go miranda ive been right here im sure you want to see the final design i have the drawings ill be happy to take you down and show you what weve finished so far i think youll be pleased she moved to the drawing board and began unrolling a large sheet of paper that can wait she looked up angled her head did you have something else in mind entirely but obviously that can wait as well his eyes remained narrowed as he crossed to her as if he were seeing her for the first time and taking in all the details when they were eye to eye he cupped a hand under her chin slowly spread his fingers over her cheek i missed you he said it with a hint of puzzlement in his voice as if hed just solved a complex riddle more than i intended to expected to more than i wanted to really she stepped away because his touch left her shaken is that why you called so often thats why i didnt call he dipped his hands in his pockets he felt like a fool and there was a nervous flutter in his stomach that warned him a man could experience emotions more alarming than foolishness why didnt you call me i made certain you knew how to reach me she tilted her head it was an odd and rare sight she thought seeing ryan boldari uncomfortable yes your various assistants were very efficient in giving me your whereabouts as the project here was proceeding on schedule there wasnt any reason to bother you about it and since you seem to have decided to handle the other area of business on your own there was little i could do about it you werent supposed to matter quite so much he rocked back on his heels as he spoke as if trying to find his balance i dont want you to matter this much its in my way she turned aside hoping she was quick enough to keep him from seeing the hurt she knew flashed into her eyes anything that potent that keen had to show if youd wanted to end our personal relationship ryan you could have done it less coldbloodedly he laid his hands on her shoulders then tightened his grip spun her angrily around when she tried to wrench away do i look like i want to end it he dragged her toward him covering her mouth with his again holding her there as she struggled for freedom does that feel like i want to end it dont play with me this way she stopped fighting and her voice was shaky and weak she could despise herself for it but she couldnt change it im not equipped for this kind of game i didnt know i could hurt you as his anger drained he rested his brow against hers the hands that had gripped her shoulders gentled and skimmed lightly down her arms maybe i wanted to see if i could that doesnt say much for me i didnt think you were coming back desperate for distance and the control she hoped came with it she eased out of his arms people have a remarkably easy time walking away from me he saw now that hed damaged something very fragile and something he hadnt recognized as precious not just her trust in him but her belief in them he didnt think or plan or calculate the odds he just looked at her and spoke im halfway in love with you maybe more and nothing about it is easy her eyes went dark her cheeks went pale she laid a hand on the edge of her desk as she felt her balance shift i ryan no amount of effort could catch any of the words spinning around in her head and form them into coherent thought no logical response for that is there dr jones he stepped to her took her hands what are we going to do about this situation i dont know whatever it is i dont want to do it here can you leave i yes i suppose he smiled brushed his lips over her fingers then come with me they went home she assumed hed want to go somewhere quiet where they could talk sort through these emotions that were so obviously foreign to both of them perhaps a restaurant or the park since spring was dancing prettily into maine but hed driven up the coast road and neither of them spoke she watched the land narrow the water quietly blue in the midday sunlight close in on either side on the long rocky beach to the east a woman stood watching a young boy dance in the playful surf and toss bread crumbs to greedy gulls the road curved just close enough for miranda to see the wide delighted grin on his face as the birds swooped down to snag the feast beyond them the soft red sails of a schooner held the wind and cruised snappily southward she wondered if shed ever been as innocently happy as that young boy or as confidently peaceful as the schooner on the sound side the trees were dressed in that tender green of april more haze than texture she loved that look the best she realized that delicate beginning odd that shed never known that about herself as the road climbed the trees stirred swaying under a soft spring sky laced with white clouds as harmless as cotton and there on the edges of the hill where the old house stood was the sudden ocean of cheery yellow a sea of daffodils a forest of forsythia both of which had been planted before she was born he surprised her by stopping the car and grinning thats fabulous my grandmother planted it all she said that yellow was a simple color and it made people smile i like your grandmother on impulse he got out walked to the verge and picked her a handful of the yellow trumpets i dont think shed mind he said as he climbed back inside and held them out no she wouldnt but she found herself wanting to weep i brought you daffodils once before he laid a hand on her cheek until she turned her head to look at him why dont they make you smile with her eyes closed she pressed her face to the flowers their scent was unbearably sweet i dont know what to do about what i feel i need steps i need reasonable comprehensive steps dont you ever just want to stumble and see where you fall no but she knew thats exactly what shed done im a coward youre anything but that she shook her head fiercely when i step into emotional territory im a coward and im afraid of you he dropped his hand shifted position so he gripped the steering wheel with both of them arousal and guilt churned in his belly thats a dangerous thing to tell me im capable of using that taking advantage of that i know it just as youre capable of stopping by the side of the road and picking daffodils if you were only capable of one of those moods i wouldnt be afraid of you saying nothing he restarted the car drove slowly up the curved lane and parked at the front of the house im not willing to shift back and make it only business between us if you think thats an option here youre mistaken she jolted when his hand whipped out gripped her chin badly mistaken he added and the silky threat in his voice had her pulse pounding with panicked excitement however i feel i wont be pressured she put her hand to his wrist and shoved and i keep my options open with that said she pushed the door open and got out of the car missing his lightning grin and the heat in his eyes well see about that dr jones he murmured and followed her up the steps whatever our personal relationship we have priorities we need to go over the plans for the exhibit we will ryan jingled the change in his pocket as miranda unlocked the front door i need you to give me more details on what you expect to happen when we have everyone together youll get them we need to talk all of this through step by step i need to have it organized in my mind i know she closed the door they stood staring at each other in the quiet foyer her throat went desert dry as he stripped off his leather jacket watched her like hunter to prey she thought and wondered why that sensation should be so damn delightful i have a copy of the design here up in my office here all the paperwork copies are upstairs of course you do he took a step forward i wouldnt expect anything less do you know what i want to do to you dr jones right here right now he stepped closer stopped just short of touching her though he could feel the urgent need for her pulsing in every cell we havent resolved anything in that area and we need to deal with business her heart was knocking against her ribs like a rude and impatient guest banging at a locked door i have the copies here she said again so i could work on them when i wasnt there oh god they leaped at each other hands tugging and fumbling with clothes mouths bumping then fusing heat spewed up like a geyser erupting and scorching them with steam she dragged desperately at his shirt oh god i hate this ill never wear it again no no a shaky laugh trembled out of her throat i hate being so needy touch me i cant stand it touch me im trying to he yanked at the trim paisley vest she wore under her tweed jacket you would pick today to wear all these damn clothes they made it to the base of the stairs stumbled the vest went flying wait i have to his fingers dived into her hair scattering pins as they curled in that rich mass of red miranda his mouth was on hers again oceans of need cresting in that one bruising meeting of lips he swallowed her moans his own fed on them as they tripped up another two steps she was tugging his shirt out of his waistband struggling to drag it down his arms gasping for air sobbing for more as finally finally her hands found flesh his muscles quivered under her hands she could feel his heart pounding as wildly as hers it was just sex it solved nothing proved nothing but god help her she didnt care her starched cotton shirt caught on her wrists at the cuffs and for a moment she was bound by it thrilling helpless as he shoved her back against the wall and feasted on her breasts he wanted a war vicious primal savage and found it in himself in her feral response and demand his fingers rushed down unhooking the mannish trousers sliding over her into her so that her hips pushed forward she came brutally choking out his name as her body quaked from the shock her mouth streaked over his face his throat her hands dug into his hips tore at his clothes and drove him mad he plunged into her where they stood driving her hard against the wall driving himself deeper and deeper she clawed at him now her nails raking down his back the sounds she made primitive groans wanton cries throaty whimpers called to his blood when she went limp he lifted her by the hips blind and deaf to everything but the mindless need to take and take and take each violent stroke was a possession mine more he panted it out stay with me come back i cant her hands slid off his damp shoulders her mind and body drained take more she opened her eyes found herself trapped in his so dark so hot the deep gold glittering like sunburst and focused only on her her skin began to quiver again little jolts of need that shimmered at the nerve endings and spread then those jolts turned to aches raw pulsing aches that turned each breath to a senseless moan pleasure had claws and they ripped at her threatened to tear her to pieces when she screamed he buried his face in her hair and let himself crash it was like surviving a train wreck ryan decided barely surviving they were sprawled on the floor bodies tangled and numb minds destroyed she was lying across him simply because theyd gone down that way her midriff over his belly her head facedown against the persian runner every few minutes her stomach would quiver so he knew she was still alive miranda he croaked it out realizing suddenly his throat was wild with thirst her response was something between a grunt and a moan do you think you can get up when he laughed a little and reached down to rub her bottom now would be good when she didnt move he growled water i must have water cant you just push me it wasnt quite as simple as that but he managed to extract himself from beneath her limp body he braced a hand on the wall to keep his balance as he walked down the stairs in the kitchen he stood naked gulped down two glasses of tap water then poured a third steadier he started back his smile spreading when he scanned the scatter of clothes and flowers she was still on the floor at the top of the steps on her back now eyes shut one arm flung out over her head hair a glorious tangle mat clashed with the deep red of the runner dr jones what would the art revue say about this hmm still grinning he crouched nudged the side of her breast with the glass to get her attention here you could probably use this mmm she managed to sit up took the glass in both hands and downed every drop we never made it to the bedroom theres always next time you look very relaxed i feel like ive been drugged she blinked focused on the painting on the wall behind him and stared at the white bra that hung celebrationally from the top corner of the frame is that mine he looked back ran his tongue over his teeth i dont believe i was wearing one my god he had to give her points for speedy recovery as she leaped up and snatched it loose with her eyes wide now and little gasps of distress sounding in her throat she began to rush around gathering clothes trying to save the flowers theyd crushed ryan leaned his back against the wall and watched the show i cant find one of my socks he smiled as she stared down at him rumpled clothes pressed to her breasts youre still wearing it she glanced down saw the traditional argyle on her left foot oh its a cute look for you got a camera since the moment seemed to call for it she dumped the clothes on his head at ryans insistence they took a bottle of wine out to the cliffs and sat in the warm spring sun youre right he said its beautiful in the spring the water went from a pale blue at the horizon to a deeper hue where boats plied its surface then to a dark rich green near the shore where it spewed and beat against rock the wind was kind today a caress instead of a slap the pines that lined the side of the land and marched up the rise showed fresh and tender new growth the hardwoods showed the faintest blush of leaves to come no one walked the ragged sweep of beach below or disturbed the scatter of broken shells tossed up during a recent storm he was glad of it glad the boats were distant and toylike the buoys silent they were alone if he looked back toward the house he could just see the shape of the old south garden the worst of the deadwood and thorny brown weeds had been cleared away the dirt looked freshly turned and raked he could see small clusters of green she said she would garden he remembered and she was a woman who followed through hed like to watch her at work he realized hed very much enjoy seeing her kneeling there concentrating on bringing the old garden back to life making those sketches shed drawn a reality hed like to see what she made bloom there we should be in my office working she said as guilt began to prick through the pleasure of the afternoon lets consider this a field trip you need to see the final design for the exhibit miranda if i didnt trust you there completely you wouldnt have my property he sipped his wine and reluctantly shifted his thoughts to work in any case you sent my office daily reports on it i imagine ive got the picture working on its giving me some time to put other things in perspective i dont know what we can accomplish by all this other than the obvious benefit to your organization and mine and a hefty contribution to nea the other the others progressing ryan we should give all the information we can to the police ive thought about this its what should have been done right from the start i let myself get caught up my ego certainly and my feelings for you you havent told me what those are are you going to she looked away from him watched the tall iron buoys wave gently and without sound ive never felt for anyone what i feel for you i dont know what it is or what to do about it my family isnt good with personal relationships what does your family have to do with it the jones curse she sighed a little because she didnt have to glance back to know he smiled we always screw it up neglect apathy selfabsorption i dont know what it is but were just no good at being with other people so youre a product of your genes and not your own woman her head twisted sharply making him grin at the quick insult in her eyes then she controlled it and inclined her head that was very good but the fact remains that im nearly thirty years old and ive never had a serious longterm relationship i dont know if im capable of maintaining one first you have to be willing to find out are you yes she started to rub her nervous hand on her slacks but he took it held it then we start from there im as much out of my element as you are youre never out of your element she murmured you have too many elements he laughed and gave her hand a squeeze why dont we behave like a comfortable couple and ill tell you about my trip to san francisco you saw your brother yes he and his family will be coming out for the gala the rest of the family will come in from new york all of them all of your familys coming sure its a big deal anyway i should warn you youre going to be checked out thoroughly wonderful one more thing to be nervous about your mothers coming and your father which is a small dilemma as he thinks im someone else oh god i forgot what will we do we wont know what in the world hes talking about ryan merely grinned when she gaped rodneys british im not and hes not nearly as goodlooking as i am either do you really think my fathers going to fall for something like that of course he will because thats our story and were sticking to it he crossed his ankles drew in the cool moist air and realized he hadnt been completely relaxed for days why in the world would i have introduced myself to him as someone else particularly since i was in new york when he came to see you hell be confused but hes hardly going to stand there and call ryan boldari a liar she let it simmer a moment i dont see what choice we have and my father certainly doesnt pay close attention to people but just follow my lead there and smile a lot now when i was in san francisco i looked up harrison mathers you found harry i found his apartment he wasnt there but i spent an interesting half hour with the hooker across the hall she told me hes been gone a few days and that one moment she tugged her hand free of his and held up a single finger would you mind repeating that hed been gone a few days no there was something about you spending time with a prostitute it was well worth the fifty well hundred actually i gave her another fifty when we were done oh would that have been like a tip yeah he beamed at her jealous darling would jealousy be inappropriate a little jealousy is very healthy all right then she bunched her recently freed hand into a fist and rammed it into his stomach he wheezed out a breath sat up cautiously in case she decided to hit him again i stand corrected jealousy is definitely unhealthy i paid her to talk to me if i thought otherwise youd be well on your way to the rocks down below this time she smiled while he eyed her warily what did she tell you you know that yankee cool can be just a little frightening dr jones she told me that i was the second man whod come by that day looking for him she had a very large gun pointed at me at the time a gun she had a gun she didnt like the look of the first guy women in her line of work generally know how to size a man up quickly from her description id say she was right about him youd know that firsthand i think he was the one who attacked you her hand went quickly to her throat the man who was here who stole my purse he was in san francisco looking for young harry and my guess is your former student was lucky not to be home hes tied in miranda whoever he made the bronze for whoever he gave or sold it to doesnt want him around any longer if they find him i arranged for someone to keep an eye out for him well have to find him first maybe he ran away maybe he knew they were looking for him no i looked around his place he left all his art supplies a small stash of grass ryan leaned back on his elbows again and watched the clouds puff lazily across the sky i didnt get the impression hed left in a particular hurry the advantage is we know someones looking for him at this point no one knows we are the way the kids been living either he didnt get much for the forgery or he blew it fast and hasnt explored the wonderful world of blackmail would they have threatened him first what would be the point they didnt want him to run theyd want to eliminate him quick and quiet but there was something in her eyes why ive been getting communications it was a clean professional word and made her less jittery communications faxes for the most part for some time now theyve been coming daily since you left faxes one email here and at the office again he sat up this time his eyes were narrow and cool threats not exactly or not really threats until most recently why didnt you tell me i am telling you why the hell didnt you let me know this was going on all along the blank look she sent him had him getting to his feet so quickly he knocked the glass aside and sent it tumbling over the rocks it never occurred to you did it to tell me you were being stalked this way frightened this way dont tell me you werent frightened he tossed out before she could speak i can see it in your face he saw she thought entirely too much too easily what could you have done about it he stared at her eyes smoldering then jamming his hands in his pockets turned away what do they say various things some of them are very calm short and subtly threatening others are more disjointed rambles theyre more personal they talk about things that happened or little events in my life because a hunted feeling crept up her spine she got to her feet one came after giovanni after giovanni she repeated it said his blood was on my hands he had no choice but to put his own resentment and hurt aside it surprised him how much there was of both that she hadnt trusted him hadnt counted on him but now he turned back looked her straight in the eye if you believe that if you let some anonymous bastard push you into believing that youre a fool and youre giving them exactly what they want i know that ryan i understand that perfectly she thought she could say it calmly but her voice broke i know its someone who knows me well enough to use what would hurt me most he moved to her wrapped his arms tightly around her hold on to me come on hold on when her arms finally encircled him he rubbed his cheek over her hair youre not alone miranda but she had been for so long a man like him would never know what it was like to stand in a roomful of people and feel so alone so alien so unwanted giovanni he was one of the few people who made me feel normal i know whoever killed him is sending me the message i know that in my head ryan but in my heart ill always be to blame and they know it then dont let them use you or him this way shed closed her eyes so overwhelmed with the comfort hed offered now she opened them stared out toward the sea as his words struck home using him she murmured youre right ive been letting them use him to hurt me whoever it is hates me and made certain i knew it in the fax that came today you have copies of them all yes i want them when she started to pull away he held her in place stroked her hair didnt she feel herself trembling he wondered the email did you trace it i didnt have any luck the user name doesnt show up on the server its the server we use here and at standjo did you keep it on your machine yes then well trace it or patrick would he thought im sorry i wasnt here he drew back framed her face im here now miranda and no ones going to hurt you while i am when she didnt answer he tightened his grip looked carefully at her face i dont make promises lightly because i dont break them once i do im going to see this through with you all the way and i wont let anything happen to you he paused then took what he considered a dangerous step toward a nasty edge do you still want to talk to cook shed been so sure that was the right thing so sure until hed looked at her and promised until by doing so hed made her believe against all common sense that she could trust him well see it through ryan i guess neither one of us could swallow anything less put the base directly over the mark miranda stood back watching the two burly men from maintenance haul the threefoot marble stand to the exact center of the room she knew it was the exact center as shed measured it three times personally yes perfect good is that the last one dr jones in this area yes thank you she narrowed her eyes envisioning the donatello bronze of venus bathing in place on the column this gallery was devoted to works of the early renaissance a prized brunelleschi drawing was matted behind glass and two masaccio paintings were ornately framed and already hung along with a botticelli that soared twelve feet and showed the majestic ascension of the mother of god there was a bellini that had once graced the wall of a venetian villa with the donatello as the central point the display showcased the first true burst of artistic innovation that was not simply the foundation for the brilliance of the sixteenth century but a period of great art in itself true she considered the style of the period less emotional less passionate the figural representation even in masaccios work was somewhat static the human emotions more stylized than real but the miracle was that such things existed and could be studied analyzed centuries after their execution tapping her finger to her lips she studied the rest of the room shed had the tall windows draped in deep blue fabric that was shot with gold tables of varying heights were also spread with it and on the glittering fabric were the tools of artists of that era the chisels and palettes the calipers and brushes shed chosen each one herself from the museum display it was a pity they had to be closed under glass but even with such a rich and sophisticated crowd fingers could become sticky on an enormous carved wooden stand a huge bible sat open to pages painstakingly printed in glorious script by ancient monks still other tables were strewn with the jewelry favored by both men and women of the period there were embroidered slippers a comb a womans ivory trinket box each piece carefully chosen for just that spot huge iron candle stands flanked the archway very impressive ryan stepped between them nearly perfect art with its social economic political and religious foundations the midfourteen hundreds the birth of lorenzo the magnificent the peace of lodi and the resulting balance however precarious of the chief italian states she gestured to a large map dated on the wall florence milan naples venice and of course the papacy the birth too of a new school of thought in art humanism rational inquiry was the key arts never rational of course it is he only shook his head youre too busy looking into the work to look at it beauty he said gesturing to the serene face of the madonna is a most irrational thing youre nervous he added when he took her hands and felt the chill on her skin anxious she corrected have you seen the other areas i thought youd walk me through all right but i dont have much time im expecting my mother within the hour i want everything in place when she gets here she walked with him through the room ive left wide traffic patterns putting the sculptures with the donatello bronze as the centerpiece out into the room for a full circling view people should be free to wander then to move through this egress into the next gallery the largest which represents the high renaissance she stepped through well continue the theme here of showing not only the art itself but what surrounded it underlay it inspired it ive used more gold in here and red for power for the church royalty her heels clicked on the marble floor as she circled studying details looking for any slight adjustment that needed to be made this era was richer and had more drama so much energy it couldnt last but during its brief crest it produced the most important works of any era before or since saints and sinners im sorry the most popular models of art saints and sinners the raw yet elegant sexuality and selfishness of the gods and goddesses juxtaposed with the brutality of war and cheek by jowl with the grand suffering of the martyr he studied the beatific if somewhat baffled face of saint sebastian who was about lanced through with arrows i never got martyrs i mean what was the point their faith would be the obvious answer no one can steal your faith but they can sure as hell take your life and in nasty inventive ways he hooked his thumbs in his front pockets arrows for the ever popular sebastian roasting alive for good old saint lorenzo crucifixions body parts lopped off with glee and abandon lions tigers and bears oh my she chuckled in spite of herself that is why theyre martyrs exactly he turned away from sebastian and beamed at her so youre faced with the pagan horde and their primitive yet hideously efficient implements of torture why not just say sure no problem boys and girls what god would you prefer i worship today what you say doesnt change what you think or what you believe but they can certainly change your status of living he jerked a thumb toward the canvas just ask poor beleaguered sebastian i can see youd have prospered during persecutions damn right what about words like courage conviction integrity why die for a cause better to live for it while she pondered his philosophy and searched for the flaws in it he strolled over to study a table artfully crowded with religious artifacts silver crucifixes chalices relics youve done an amazing job here dr jones i think it works very well the titians will be the major focal point of this room along with your raphael its a magnificent piece ryan yes i like it quite a lot want to buy it he turned to grin at her the beauty of my business dr jones is that everything has a price meet it and its yours if youre serious about selling the raphael ill work up a proposal a great many of our pieces however are donated or on permanent loan not even for you darling she only moved her shoulders she hadnt expected anything else id put the dark lady there she said suddenly every time i imagined this room worked on the angles the flow the theme id see it standing on a white column with grapevines twining down right here she stepped forward under the light here where everyone could see it where i could see it well get it back miranda she said nothing annoyed with herself for daydreaming do you want to see the next room we have your vasaris up later he stepped to her it had to be done hed intended to tell her immediately but he hadnt been able to face putting that haunted look back into her eyes miranda i got a call from my brother in san francisco from michael a body was pulled out of the bay last night it was harry mathers she only stared her eyes locked on his for a long silent moment before she simply closed them and turned away it wasnt an accident it wasnt random the news reports my brothers heard dont give many details just that he was killed before he was dumped in the water his throat had been slit ryan thought but there was no reason to add that detail she already knew the who and why what good would it do for her to know the how three people now three people dead and for what with her back still to him she stared up at the glorious face of the madonna for money for art for ego maybe all three or maybe none of those not really maybe its you the quick stabbing pain in her heart had her shuddering once before she turned back he saw the fear in her eyes and knew that fear wasnt for herself because of me someone could hate me that much why i cant think of anyone ive had that kind of impact on anyone ive hurt so deeply they would murder to protect a lie that ruins my professional reputation for gods sake ryan harry was only a boy her voice was grim now sharp with the fury that rolled in behind the fear just a boy she repeated and he was snipped off like a loose thread just as carelessly as that who could i matter to so much they would have a boy killed that way ive never mattered to anyone that he thought was the saddest thing hed ever heard anyone say sadder still was the fact that she believed it you make more of an impact than you realize miranda youre strong youre successful youre focused on what you want and where you want to go and you get there i havent stepped over anyone on the way maybe you didnt see them patricks been working on tracing that email you received yes she pushed a hand through her hair didnt see them she wondered could she be that selfabsorbed that remote that cold did he manage it its been more than a week now i thought he must have given up he never does when he has his teeth into a computer puzzle what is it what are you trying not to tell me the user name was attached very briefly to an account put on and taken off and buried under a great deal of computer jargon she felt the cold ball form in her stomach it would be bad she knew very bad what was the account he laid his hands on her shoulders it was your mothers thats not possible the message was routed out of florence on that area code and under the account registered to elizabeth standfordjones and under her password im sorry it cant be she pulled away from him no matter how much how little no matter what she managed she couldnt do this she couldnt hate me this much i cant accept that she had access to both bronzes no one would question her she sent for you then she fired you and sent you home she pulled you away from the institute im sorry he put his hand to her cheek but youre going to have to consider the facts it was logical it was hideous she closed her eyes and let his arms come around her excuse me she jerked in his arms as if they were bullets and not words at her back very slowly she turned took a long bracing breath hello mother elizabeth didnt look as though shed spent the last several hours flying across an ocean and dealing with the small annoyances that come with international travel her hair was perfectly coiffed her steelblue suit showed not a single crease or wrinkle miranda felt as she always did when faced with her mothers unwavering perfection tousled awkward ungainly now suspicion was added to the mix could this woman whod preached integrity all of her life have betrayed her own daughter i apologize for interrupting your work too accustomed to parental disapproval to react miranda merely nodded elizabeth standfordjones ryan boldari mr boldari elizabeth assessed the situation decided that the gallery owner had demanded mirandas participation in the project for more reasons than her qualifications because the results benefited the institute she put warmth in her smile how nice to finally meet you a pleasure he crossed the room to take her hand noting that mother and daughter didnt even bother with the cool air kisses women often exchanged i hope your flight was uneventful it was thank you a beautiful face she thought and a smooth manner the photographs shed seen of him in art magazines over the years hadnt quite been able to capture the power of the combination i apologize for not being able to get away sooner as id planned i hope the project is progressing as you anticipated mr boldari ryan please and its already exceeded my expectations your daughter is everything i could wish for youve been busy she said to miranda very weve closed off the wing on this level to the public for the last two days the teams put in a lot of hours but its paying off yes i can see it is she scanned the room impressed and pleased but only said you have work to do yet of course youll be able to tap the talents of standjo now several staff members flew out today and a few others will be here by tomorrow they know theyre at your disposal elise and richard are here now along with vincente and his wife does andrew know elise is here elizabeth raised her eyebrows if he doesnt he will shortly and the warning in her tone was clear no personal family business was to be discussed or allowed to interfere your father is due in tonight hell be a tremendous help with the final selections of the artifacts ive already made the final selections miranda said flatly its rare that any project of this size cant benefit from a fresh eye are you planning to take me off this project too there was a moment when it appeared elizabeth would respond her lips trembled open but then firmed again as she turned to ryan id very much like to see your vasaris yes ryan show her the vasaris theyre in the next area if youll both excuse me i have an appointment i feel obliged to tell you elizabeth ryan began when miranda walked out that this very impressive exhibit wouldnt have been possible without your daughter she conceived it designed it and has implemented it im well aware of mirandas talents are you he said it mildly with a slight and deliberately mocking lift of brow obviously im mistaken then i assumed since you didnt comment on the results of four weeks of intense work on her part you found them lacking in some way something flickered in her eyes that might have been embarrassment he hoped it was not at all i have every confidence in mirandas capabilities if she has a flaw its overenthusiasm and the tendency to become too personally involved most would consider those assets rather than flaws he was baiting her but she couldnt see the reason for it in business objectivity is essential im sure youd agree i prefer passion in all things riskier but the benefits are much more rewarding miranda has passion but she tends to repress it hoping id guess for your approval do you ever give it temper showed coldly on her a chill in the eyes frost lining the voice my relationship with miranda isnt your concern mr boldari any more than your relationship with her is mine odd id say the opposite was true since your daughter and i are lovers her fingers tightened briefly on the strap of the slim leather attache case she carried miranda is an adult i dont interfere with her personal affairs just her professional ones then tell me about the dark lady i beg your pardon the dark lady he kept his eyes on hers where is she the fiesole bronze elizabeth said evenly was stolen from a storeroom at the bargello several weeks ago neither i nor the authorities have any idea of its current location i wasnt speaking of the copy but of the original original her face remained blank but he saw something behind it knowledge shock consideration it was difficult to be sure with a woman with such rigid control elizabeth a group of people came in with elise in the forefront ryan saw a small finely built woman with a pixie crop of hair and big brilliant eyes one step behind was a balding palefaced man he tagged as richard hawthorne then a lushly built sophia loren lookalike with her arm through that of a robust man with olive skin and glossy white hair the morellis he decided hovering over them beaming loving avuncular smiles was john carter excuse me elise linked her pretty hands together i didnt know you were busy more grateful for the interruption than she would allow to show elizabeth made introductions its so nice to meet you elise told him i was in your gallery in new york only last year its a treasure and this her eyes shone as she turned a circle this is glorious richard get your nose away from that map and look at the paintings he turned a sheepish smile on his face i can never resist a map its an excellent exhibit you must have worked like dogs vincente gave carter a hearty slap on the back i expected to be called on to scrub floors at any moment miranda had us jumping through hoops carter smiled sheepishly again the restoration on the bronzino was only finished yesterday i heard everyone in the department shuddered when they saw her coming every department heads been chugging maalox for the past two weeks doesnt seem to bother miranda womans got nerves of steel shes done a brilliant job elise glanced around again where is she she had an appointment elizabeth said ill catch up with her later i hope shell put us to work she knows youre available good i urn i thought id see if andrews free for a few moments she sent elizabeth an apologetic and wistful smile id like to see how hes doing if you dont need me just now no go ahead she glanced over with mild amusement as gina morelli exclaimed and cooed over the display of jewelry richard i know youve been chafing to visit the library im predictable enjoy yourself well know where to find him vincente said hell be buried in books me ill wait for gina to study and covet every bauble then shell drag me shopping he shook his head she too is predictable two hours elizabeth announced in the tone of the director then well meet back here and do what needs to be done elise hesitated outside the door of andrews office his assistant was away from her desk and she was grateful ms purdue was devoted to andrew and wouldnt approve of an exwifes unscheduled visit she heard his voice through the open door it was a strong voice and brought her an odd nostalgia shed always liked his voice the clear tone of it the uppercrust accent faintly kennedyesque she thought she supposed in her way shed seen him as a kind of scion of that type of highpowered successful new england family there had been such potential in their marriage she thought shed had such hopes but in the end thered been nothing to do but divorce and move on from what she knew she had moved on with considerably more success than andrew though she was aware of the regret in her eyes she fixed on a bright smile and rapped lightly on the jamb were expecting five hundred guests he said into the phone then glanced up and froze it all flooded back in individual drops of memory the first time hed seen her when she took over the job as assistant lab manager at his fathers recommendation in a lab coat and goggles the way shed pushed the goggles up to rest on her head when miranda introduced them the way shed laughed and told him it was about time when he finally worked up the nerve to ask her out the first time theyd made love and the last the way shed looked on their wedding day radiant delicate the way shed looked when she told him it was over so cold and distant and all the moods in between that had slipped from hope and happiness to dissatisfaction disappointment then lack of interest the voice on the phone was a buzzing in his ears his hand fisted under the desk he wished to god there was a drink in it ill need to get back to you on the rest but all the details are in the press release im sure we can arrange for a short interview tomorrow night during the event youre welcome im sorry drew she began when he hung up ms purdue isnt at her desk so i thought id take the chance its all right the foolish words scraped at his throat just another reporter the event is generating a lot of positive press we need it its been a difficult couple of months he didnt rise as she thought he would so she stepped into the room and faced him with his desk between them i thought it would be best easier for both of us if we had a few minutes i wouldnt have come but elizabeth insisted and i have to admit i would have hated to miss all of this he couldnt take his eyes off her no matter how it burned his heart we wanted all the key staff members here youre still so angry with me i dont know what i am you look tired putting this thing together hasnt left a lot of time for r and r i know this is awkward she reached out a hand then drew it back again as if realizing it wouldnt be welcomed the last time we saw each other was in a lawyers office he finished yes her gaze dropped i wish it could have been handled differently we were both so hurt and angry drew i was hoping by now we could at least be friends he let out a bitter laugh that didnt hurt nearly as much as the innocuous word hed forced through it no not friends those fabulous eyes of hers went soft and damp with emotion just something less than enemies it wasnt what shed expected this hardeyed cynical look shed expected regret unhappiness even a spurt of anger shed been prepared for any and all of that but not for this tough shield that bounced all her efforts back at her hed loved her she knew hed loved her and had held on to that even as she signed her name on the divorce papers we dont have to be enemies elise we dont have to be anything anymore all right this was a mistake she blinked once twice and the tears were gone i didnt want any difficulties to spoil tomorrows success if you were upset and started drinking ive quit drinking really her voice was cool again and the grim amusement in it sliced bloodlessly it was a talent of hers hed forgotten where have i heard that before the difference is it has nothing to do with you now and everything to do with me i emptied plenty of bottles over you elise and im done with it maybe that disappoints you maybe youre insulted that im not crawling not devastated to see you standing there youre not the center of my life anymore i never was her control cracked enough to let the words snap through if i had been youd still have me she spun around and rushed out by the time she got to the elevator tears were stinging her eyes she punched the button with her fist he waited until the rapid click of her heels had echoed away before lowering his head to the desk his stomach was in ragged knots and screaming for a drink just one drink to smooth it all away she was so beautiful how could he have forgotten how beautiful she was shed belonged to him once and hed failed to hold her to hold their marriage to be the man she needed hed lost her because he hadnt known how to give enough to love enough to be enough he had to get out get air he needed to walk to run to get the scent of her perfume out of his system he used the stairs avoiding the wing with all the bustle of work slipped through the thin earlyevening visitors in the public areas and walked straight out he left his car in the lot and walked walked until the worst of the burning in his gut had eased walked until he no longer had to concentrate to draw and release each breath evenly he told himself he was thinking clearly now perfectly clearly and when he stopped in front of the liquor store when he stared at the bottles promising relief enjoyment escape he told himself he could handle a couple of drinks not only could he handle them he deserved them hed earned them for surviving that facetoface contact with the woman hed promised to love honor and cherish whod promised him the same until death he stepped inside stared at the walls with bottles dark and light lining the shelves fifths and pints and quarts just waiting just begging to be selected try me and youll feel better youll feel fine again youll feel fanfuckingtastic glossy bottles with colorful labels smooth bottles with manly names wild turkey jim beam jameson he picked up a bottle of jack daniels running a finger over the familiar black label and sweat began to pool at the base of his spine good old jack dependable jack black he could taste it on his tongue feel the heat slide down his throat and fall welcome to warm his belly he took it to the counter and his fingers felt fat and clumsy as he reached for his wallet this be all the clerk rang up the bottle yes andrew said dully thats it for me he carried it with him tucked into its slim paper sack he felt the weight of it the shape of it as he walked a twist of the top and your troubles were over the nasty ball of pain in your gut forgotten as the sun set toward twilight and the air cooled he went into the park the yellow trumpets of the daffodils were rioting a small ocean of cheer backed by the more elegant red cups of tulips the first leaves were unfurling on the oaks and maples that would offer shade when the summer heat pounded during its short stay in maine the fountain trickled a musical dance at the center of the park over to the left swings and slides were deserted children were home being washed up for supper he thought hed wanted children hadnt he imagined making a family a real family where those in it knew how to love how to touch each other laughter bedtime stories noisy family meals hed never pulled that off either he sat on a bench staring at the empty swings listening to the fountain play and running his hand up and down the shape of the bottle in the thin paper bag one drink he thought just one pull from the bottle then none of this would matter quite so much two pulls and youd wonder why it ever had annie drew two drafts while the blender beside her whirled with the fixings for a pitcher of margaritas happy hour on friday nights was a popular sport it was mostly the business crowd but she had a couple of tables of college students taking advantage of the discount prices and free nibbles while they trashed their professors she arched her back trying to work out the vague ache at the base of her spine as she scanned the room to be certain her waitresses were keeping the customers happy she dressed the birdbath glasses with salt and lime one of her regulars was into a joke involving a man and a dancing frog she built him a fresh vodka collins and laughed at the punch line the tv above the bar was showcasing a night baseball game she saw andrew come in saw what he had in his hand her stomach took a slow nosedive but she kept working replaced crowded ashtrays with fresh empties mopped damp rings from the bar watched him walk to it take a seat on a vacant stool set the bottle on the bar their eyes met over the brown paper sack hers were carefully blank i didnt open it good thats good i wanted to i still want to annie signaled to her head waitress then tugged off her bar apron take over for me lets take a walk andrew he nodded but he took the bag with him when he followed her out i went to a liquor store it felt good to be in there the streetlights were shining now little islands of light in the dark endoftheweek traffic clogged the streets opposing radio stations warred through open car windows i walked to the park and sat on a bench by the fountain andrew shifted the bottle from hand to hand as if to keep it limber nobody much around i thought i could just take a couple of pulls from the bottle just enough to warm me up but you didnt no its hard what youre doing is hard and tonight you made the right choice whatever it is whatevers wrong you cant add drinking to it i saw elise oh shes here for the exhibit i knew she was coming but when i looked up and saw her it just slammed into me she was trying to make things better but i wouldnt let her annie hunched her shoulders jammed her hands into her pockets and told herself she was insane even pretending she and andrew stood a chance that she stood a chance you have to do what feels right to you there i dont know whats right i only know whats wrong he walked back to the same park sat on the same bench and set the bottle beside him i cant tell you what to do andrew but i think if you dont resolve this and let it go its going to keep hurting you i know it shes only going to be here a few days if you could make your peace with it and with her while shes here youd be better for it i never made peace with buster the son of a bitch she smiled hoping he would but he only continued to watch her with those steady serious eyes oh andrew she sighed looked away what i mean is i never made the effort so we could be civil and it still eats at me some he wasnt worth it god knows but it eats at me he hurt me in a lot of ways so all i wanted to do in the end was hurt him right back but worse of course i never did because he never gave a shit whyd you stay with him annie she pushed a hand through her hair because i told him i would taking vows at the courthouse on your lunch hours just the same as doing it in a big church in a fancy white dress yeah he gave the hand that now held his a squeeze i know it believe it or not i wanted to keep mine i wanted to prove that i could failing at it was like proving i wasnt any different from my father his father any of them youre yourself andrew thats a scary thought because he needed it and so did she she leaned forward laid her lips on his let them part when he reached for her took him in god help her she could feel the edge of desperation but he was careful with her shed known too many men who werent careful the hand on his face stroked felt the prickle of a dayold beard then the smooth skin of his throat the needs that kindled inside her were outrageous and she was afraid they wouldnt help either of them youre not like them she pressed her cheek to his before the kiss could weaken her too much well not tonight anyway he picked up the bottle handed it to her there thats a hundred percent profit for you there was a relief in it he realized the kind a man feels when he whips the wheel of his car just before plunging off a cliff im going to go to a meeting before i go home he puffed out a breath annie about tomorrow night it would mean a lot to me if youd change your mind and come andrew you know i dont fit in with all those fancy art people you fit with me always have saturday nights are busy excuses she thought coward ill think about it ive got to go ill walk you back he rose took her hand again annie come tomorrow ill think about it she repeated without any intention of doing so the last thing she wanted to do was go up against elise on the womans turf chapter twentyseven you need to get out of here miranda glanced up from her desk where she was buried in a sea of papers saw ryan watching her from the doorway at this moment i basically live here why do you feel you have to do all of this yourself she ran her pencil between her fingers is there something wrong with the way its being done thats not what i said he walked over laid his palms on the desk and leaned toward her you dont have to prove anything to her this isnt about my mother this is about making certain that tomorrow night is a success now i have several more details to see to he reached over plucked the pencil out of her hand and snapped it in two she blinked stunned by the ripe and ready temper in his eyes well that was mature its more mature than doing the same to that stiff neck of yours if shed held a silver shield and lowered it between them it would have been no less tangible a block than the way her face closed up dont you shut me out dont you sit there and play with one of your ubiquitous lists as if theres nothing more important to you than the next item to be crossed off im not a fucking item and i know just whats going on inside you dont swear at me he turned on his heel and started for the door she expected him to go straight through to keep going as others had instead he slammed the door locked it she got shakily to her feet i have no idea why youre so angry dont you you think i didnt see your face when i told you where that email had come from do you really believe youre so in control dr jones that the devastation doesnt show it was killing him her complexities and complications were killing him he didnt want them he thought furiously he didnt want to find himself constantly compelled to fight his way through to her i dont believe i in any way attempted to kill the messenger she began dont take that privateschool tone with me either it doesnt work i saw your face when your mother walked in how everything inside you went on hold cold storage that got through and stung brutally you asked me to accept the strong possibility that my mother used me betrayed me had me terrorized that shes involved in a major art theft thats already resulted in three deaths you asked me to do that then you criticize the way i choose to deal with it id rather have seen you shove her on her ass and demand an explanation that might work in your family were not quite so volatile in mine yeah yours prefers the carefully iced blade that slices bloodlessly i can tell you miranda heats cleaner in the end and a hell of a lot more human what did you expect me to do goddamn it what scream at her shout and rage and accuse she swept an arm over the desk sending neatly arranged papers and carefully sharpened pencils flying was i supposed to demand she tell me the truth confess or deny if she hates me enough to have done this she hates me enough to lie to my face she shoved her desk chair sent it crashing into the wall she never loved me never gave me one free gesture of affection neither of them not to me to andrew or to each other in my whole life neither of them ever said they loved me never even bothered to lie so i could have the illusion you dont know what its like never to be held never to be told and to ache for it she pressed her hands to her stomach as if the pain centered there was unbearable to ache so hard and long that you have to stop wanting it or just die no i dont know what its like he said quietly tell me it was like growing up in a fucking laboratory everything sterile and perfectly in place documented calculated but without any of the joy of discovery rules thats all rules of language conduct education do this and do it this way and no other because no other is acceptable no other is correct how many of those rules has she broken if shes done this her breath was heaving her eyes blazing her fists clenched hed watched hed listened and hadnt moved or raised his voice the only sound in the room now was her own ragged breathing as she looked around her office at the destruction shed caused stunned she shoved at her hair rubbed her hand over her hardpumping heart for the first time she became aware there were tears streaming down her cheeks so hot they should have burned her skin is that what you wanted me to do i wanted you to get it out i guess i did she pressed her fingers to her temples tantrums give me a headache that wasnt a tantrum she let out a weak laugh what would you call it honesty he smiled a little even in my line of work im vaguely acquainted with the concept youre not cold miranda he said gently youre just scared youre not unlovable just unappreciated she felt the tears stood helplessly as they overflowed i dont want it to be my mother who did this ryan he went to her nudged her fingers away and replaced them with his own we have a good chance of having the answers within the next couple of days this will be over but ill have to live with those answers he took her home and persuaded her to take a sleeping pill and go to bed early the fact that he barely had to bully her into it only proved to him that she was running on fumes now when he was certain she was asleep when andrew was closed off in his own wing ryan changed into the dark sweater and jeans he preferred for nighttime breaking and entering he slipped his tools into his pocket chose a softsided black briefcase with shoulder strap in the event he found something he needed to transport back with him he found mirandas keys efficiently zipped in the side pocket of her purse he walked quietly outside got behind the wheel of her car and adjusted the seat to suit him before putting it in neutral and releasing the brake the car coasted downhill with its headlights shut off he could have claimed to have been restless to have borrowed the car to take a drive had either she or andrew heard the engine but why lie when it wasnt necessary he waited until he was a quarter of a mile down the drive then turned on the ignition switched on the lights puccini was on the radio and though he shared mirandas fondness for opera it didnt quite suit his mood he noted the frequency then hit scan when he heard george thorogood belting out bad to the bone he grinned to himself and let it rip traffic thickened a little on the edge of town people heading to parties he thought to weekend dates or home from either because they werent quite interesting enough it was barely midnight a long way he thought from the city that never sleeps early to bed early to rise these yankees he decided such an admirable people he pulled into the hotel parking lot well away from the entrance he was fairly certain the same admirable trait would hold true for the visitors from florence the sevenhour time difference could be a killer the first couple of days hed stayed in the same hotel on his first trip and knew the layout perfectly hed also taken the precaution of getting the room numbers for all the parties he intended to visit that night no one took notice of him as he crossed the lobby and walked directly to the elevators like a man in a hurry to get to his bed elizabeth and elise were sharing a twobedroom suite on the top club level the level required a key to release the elevator and being a farsighted man and because it was an old habit hed kept the access key when he checked out of the hotel himself he saw no lights under any of the three doors of the suite heard no murmur of voices or television from inside he was inside the parlor himself in just under two minutes he stood still in the dark listening judging letting his eyes adjust as a precaution he unlocked the terrace doors giving himself an alternate route of escape should it become necessary then he got to work he searched the parlor first though he doubted either woman would have left anything vital or incriminating in that area in the first bedroom he was forced to use the penlight keeping it away from the bed where he could hear the soft steady sound of a woman breathing he took a briefcase and a purse back into the parlor with him to search it was elizabeth in the bed he noted as he flipped through the wallet he took everything out going through every receipt every scrap of paper reading the notations in her datebook he found a key just where her daughter kept hers inside zipper pocket a safedeposit box key he noted and pocketed it he checked her passport noting the stamps coincided with the dates his cousin had given him it was elizabeths first trip back to the states in more than a year but shed taken two quick trips into france in the last six months he put everything but the key back where hed found it repeated the same process on her luggage then while she slept he searched her closet the dresser the cosmetic case in the bathroom it took him an hour before he was satisfied and moved on to the second bedroom he knew andrews exwife very well by the time he was done she liked silk underwear and opium perfume though her clothes were on the conservative side she favored the top designers expensive taste required money to indulge it he made a note to check her income shed brought work with her if the laptop on her desk was any indication which made her in his mind either dedicated or obsessive the contents of her purse and briefcase were orderly with no stray wrappers or scraps of papers the small leather jewelry case he found contained a few good pieces of italian gold some wellchosen colored stones and an antique silver locket containing a picture of a man facing a picture of a woman they were faded blackandwhite and from the style he judged them to have been taken around world war ii her grandparents he imagined and decided elise had a quietly sentimental streak he left the two women sleeping and moved down the hallway to richard hawthornes room he too was fast asleep it took ryan ten minutes to find the receipt for a storage facility in florence which he pocketed it took him thirteen to find the that he left alone in twenty hed located the small notebook hidden inside a black dress sock scanning the cramped handwriting with his light ryan read quickly and at random his lips tightened on a grim smile he tucked the notebook in his pocket and let richard sleep he was ryan thought as he slipped out in for a rude awakening excuse me did you just say you broke into my mothers bedroom last night nothing was broken ryan assured her he felt as though hed been chasing after miranda for hours trying to steal a half hour alone with her her bedroom i went in through the parlor if it makes you feel any better there was hardly any point in getting them all here in one spot if i wasnt going to do something once they were i got a safedeposit key out of her purse i found it odd shed have one with her on a trip like this but its an american bank a maine bank with a branch in jones point miranda sat behind her desk the first time shed been off her feet since six that morning it was now noon and ryan had finally buttonholed her during her meeting with the florist and given her the choice of walking to her office or being carried there i dont understand ryan why would a key to a bank box be important people generally keep things there that are important or valuable to them and that they dont want other people to get their hands on in any case ill check it out he waited until miranda opened her mouth shut it again without saying a word i didnt find anything in elises room except for her laptop seemed strange to cart it all this way for a fourday trip when shed be spending most of her time here if i have time ill go back in and see if i can open it up while shes out of the room oh that would be best she said with a breezy wave of her hand exactly i found enough jewelry to break the back of an elephant in the morelli suite that woman has a serious glitter addiction and if i can access vincentes bank account well see just how deep in debt hes gone to pay for it now your father my father he didnt even get in until after midnight youre telling me i nearly bumped into him in the hall on my way out of your mothers suite handy of the hotel to put everyone on the same floor we had the rooms blocked that way she murmured in any case doing the other rooms first gave him time to settle in he was out like a light did you know your fathers been to the cayman islands three times in the last year the caymans she wondered her head didnt simply tumble off onto the floor by the way it was reeling popular spot the caymans good for scuba sunshine and money laundering now all that is idle speculation but i hit gold in hawthornes room you had a very full night while i was asleep you needed your rest i found this he took the storage receipt out of his pocket unfolded it he rented this space the day after the bronze was brought to standjo the day before your mother called and sent for you what did andrew say about coincidences there arent any people rent space for all sorts of reasons they dont generally rent a small garage just outside of the city when they dont own a car i checked and he doesnt then there was the gun gun the handgun dont ask me the make and model i try to avoid guns but it looked very efficient to me idly he took her coffeepot off the burner sniffed and was pleased to find what was left was still fresh i think theres a law about transporting weapons on airplanes he added as he poured a cup i doubt he went through the proper channels to get it here and why would a nice quiet researcher need a gun to attend an exhibit i dont know richard and a gun it doesnt make sense i think it might once you read this he took the notebook out of his pocket youll want to read it but ill give you the highlights it describes a bronze ninety point four centimeters twentyfour point sixtyeight kilograms a female nude it gives test results on said bronze dating it late fifteenth century in the style of michelangelo he watched her cheeks drain of color and her eyes go glassy then held out the coffee until shed wrapped both hands around the cup the date of the first test is at nineteen hundred hours on the date the dark lady was accepted and signed for at standjo i imagine the labs closed at eight most nights he ran tests on it on his own it lists them step by step giving times and results two solid nights work and it adds several points of research the documentation he found something you didnt and he didnt tell you about an old baptismal record from the convent of mercy written out by the abbess on a male child infant the mothers name was recorded as giulietta buonadoni she had a child id read there was a child possibly the illegitimate son of one of the medicis she sent him away most likely for his own protection as there was political tension during that period the child was baptized michelangelo he saw when the idea struck home one might speculate after his papa michelangelo never fathered a child he was by all accounts homosexual that doesnt make him incapable of conceiving a child but he shrugged doesnt mean the kid was his either but it does make the theory that they had a close personal relationship highly possible and if they did it helps support the likelihood that he would have used her as a model exactly hawthorne thought it was important enough to record it in his little book and to keep the information from you if they were lovers even once or if they had a close enough platonic relationship that she would name her only child after him it goes a long way toward concluding that he created the bronze of her it wouldnt be proof but yes it would add weight it makes it less and less likely that hed never used her and we have no documentation of any other sculpture or painting of michelangelos that uses giulietta as a model oh its good she murmured shutting her eyes if nothing else as a springboard to keep looking he didnt want you to look no and i stepped in line in that area i left nearly all of the research in his hands what i did came primarily from sources he gave me he recognized it exactly as i did probably the minute he saw it id say thats an accurate assumption dr jones she could see the sense of it now the logic and the steps richard stole the bronze and copied it and the david he had to have taken that as well her fisted hand pressed against her midriff he killed giovanni it wouldnt be proof ryan said laying the book on her desk but it would add weight we need to take this to the police not yet he laid his hand on the book before she could grab it id feel a lot more confident of the outcome if we had the bronzes in hand before we talk to cops ill go to florence tomorrow check out his garage if theyre not there theyll be in his apartment or the record of where they are will be once weve got them well work out what to tell the cops he has to pay for giovanni he will hell pay for it all give me fortyeight hours miranda weve come this far she pressed her lips together i havent lost sight of what this can do for my career or what it can mean to the art world and i know we made a deal but im asking you now to agree to promise that justice for giovanni will come first if hawthornes responsible for giovanni hell pay ill promise you that all right well wait until youre back from florence to go to the police but tonight how can we possibly go through with tonight hell be there hes here now tonight goes as scheduled you have hundreds of people coming he went on before she could object its all in place you just ride the current the institute and my galleries are too far into it to pull out youre too far in and we dont know if he acted alone she ran her hands up and down her arms it could still be my mother it could be any of them there was nothing he could do about the haunted look in her eyes you have to handle it miranda i intend to she dropped her hands i will hawthornes made a mistake now well see if he or someone else makes another one when i have the bronzes well give him to the cops i have a feeling he wont want to hang alone she jumped to her feet hang its an expression but prison or worse thats what this means years even a lifetime in prison or if its one of my family if its one of them ryan i cant no i cant handle it i was wrong miranda he reached for her hands but she tossed them up in panic no no im sorry its not right i know its not right giovanni and that poor man with his wife his children but if we find out its one of them i dont know if i can live with knowing i helped put them behind bars just a damn minute he grabbed onto her before she could evade surprising them both with the quick and hot spurt of temper whoevers responsible for this put your life on the line im going to see that they pay for that too no not my life my reputation the momentum of my career who hired that son of a bitch to terrorize you with a knife whos been sending you faxes to frighten you to hurt you it must have been richard misery swamped her eyes and if it wasnt i cant be responsible for sending one of my family to prison whats your alternative to let them walk to leave the dark lady wherever she is destroy that book forget whats been done i dont know but i need time too you asked for fortyeight hours im asking you to give me the same there has to be a middle ground somewhere i dont think so he picked up the book balancing it on his palm as if weighing it then he held it out you take it keep it she stared at it taking it gingerly as if the leather would burn how am i going to get through the rest of the day through tonight with that yankee spine of yours youll do just fine ill be with you were in this together she nodded put the book in a drawer and locked it fortyeight hours she thought that was all the time she had to decide whether to make the book public or to burn it its going to be perfect i know exactly how it will work now its all in place miranda put it all in place for me all those people will be there admiring the great art sliding champagne down their throats stuffing all the pretty canapes in their mouths shell move among them gracious and cool the brilliant dr jones the perfect dr jones the doomed dr jones shell be her own centerpiece basking in the compliments a brilliant exhibition dr jones a glorious display oh yes theyll say it and theyll think it and the mistakes she made the embarrassment she caused will fade into the background as if all my work was nothing her stars rising again tonight it falls ive planned my own exhibit for tonight one that will overshadow hers ive titled it death of a traitor i believe the reviews will be very strong chapter twentyeight no one knew her stomach was alive with manic butterflies wielding tiny scythes her hands were cool and steady her smile easy inside her mind she could see herself jittering with every step stuttering through every conversation but the shield was up the unflappable dr jones firmly in place shed chosen to wear a long column of midnight blue with a high banded collar and sleeves that ended in narrow cuffs she was grateful for the amount of flesh it covered because she felt cold so cold she hadnt been warm since ryan had given her the book she watched her mother elegant as an empress in a gown of petal pink working the crowd a touch on the arm there an offered hand or cheek always the right thing to say at the right time to the right person her husband was beside her of course dashing in his tuxedo the welltraveled adventurer with the interesting air of a scholar how handsome they looked together how perfect the joneses of jones point appeared on the surface not a flaw to mar the polish and no substance beneath the gloss how smoothly they worked as a team when they chose she thought they would choose for the institute for art for the jones reputation as they had never chosen for family she wanted to hate them for it but she thought of the book and all she felt was fear she turned away from them and moved through the archway you belong in one of those paintings behind you ryan took her hand shifting her around moments before she approached another small group you look magnificent im absolutely terrified then she laughed a little realizing that only a few months ago she wouldnt have been able to tell anyone what was inside her i always seem to be in crowds so well pretend its just you and just me but one things missing you need champagne im sticking with water tonight one glass one toast he handed her one of the flutes hed taken from a roaming waiter to the very successful results of your work dr jones its difficult to enjoy it fall into the moment he reminded her this is a good moment he touched his lips lightly to hers i find your shyness endearing he murmured it against her ear causing more than one eyebrow to rise and your skill in masking it admirable the clouds in her eyes lifted were you born with that talent or did you develop it which i have so many the talent of knowing exactly the right thing to say at precisely the right time maybe i just know what you need to hear theres dancing in the center hall youve never danced with me im a terrible dancer maybe youve never been properly led it made her eyebrows lift in mild disdain just as hed hoped lets find out he kept a hand at the small of her back as they maneuvered through the groups he knew how to work a crowd as well she noticed how to charm with a few words and keep moving she could hear the faint strains of a waltz piano and violin the murmur of conversation the occasional trill or rumble of laughter shed had the center hall decorated with trailing vines and potted palms all glittering with the tiny white italian lights that reminded her of stars fragrant white lilies and bloodred roses speared out of crystal vases draped in gold ribbon every individual drop of the antique chandelier had been handwashed in vinegar water for a brilliant waterfall sparkle couples circled pretty pictures in their formal dress or stood sipping wine others gathered on the staircase or sat in the chairs shed had dressed in rose damask at least a dozen times she was stopped congratulated if there were occasional murmurs about the fiesole bronze most people were discreet enough to wait until she was out of earshot theres mrs collingsforth miranda nodded to a woman with an amazing stack of white hair in a gown of maroon velvet of the portland collingsforths yes i want to make sure she has everything she needs and to introduce you shes very fond of attractive young men miranda wound her way through to where the widow was sitting keeping time to the music with her foot mrs collingsforth i hope youre enjoying yourself lovely music she said in a voice like the caw of a crow pretty lights its about time you put some punch into this place places that house art shouldnt be stuffy arts alive shouldnt be stored like corpses and who might this be ryan boldari he bent down to take her hand and kiss the gnarled knuckles i asked miranda to introduce us mrs collingsforth i wanted to thank you personally for your generosity in lending the institute so many wonderful pieces from your collection youve made the exhibit if the girl threw more parties instead of burying herself in a laboratory id have lent them to her sooner i couldnt agree more he beamed at mrs collingsforth making miranda feel superfluous art needs to be celebrated not simply studied keeps herself glued to a microscope where one often misses the big picture mrs collingsforth narrowed her eyes pursed her lips i like you thank you i wonder madam if i could impose on you for a dance well her eyes twinkled id enjoy that mr boldari please call me ryan he requested as he helped her to her feet he tossed miranda one wolfish grin over his shoulder as he led mrs collingsforth into the music that was smooth andrew murmured at mirandas shoulder as grease on a tree limb its a wonder he doesnt slide off and break his neck because the champagne was still in her hand she sipped did you meet his family are you kidding i think every other person here is related to him his mother collared me wanting to know if wed ever considered holding art classes for children here and why not didnt i like children and before i knew it she was introducing me to this child psychologist single female andrew added shes great the psychologist no well she seemed very nice and nearly as confused as i was ryans mother shes great his hands were in his pockets then out wrapped around the carved newel post fiddling with his tie miranda took one of them and squeezed i know this is hard for you all these people elise sort of a minor trial by fire elise the parents me and cases of free booze everywhere he glanced toward the entrance again annie hadnt come you need to keep busy do you want to dance you and me he shot her a stunned look then dissolved in easy and genuine laughter wed both end up in the er with broken toes ill risk it if you will his smile went tender miranda youve always been a high point in my life im okay lets just watch people who know what theyre doing then his smile stiffened miranda didnt have to shift her gaze to know hed seen elise she came up to them a sleek fairy in filmy white even as miranda wanted to resent she saw the nervousness in elises eyes i just wanted to congratulate you both of you on a wonderful and successful exhibit everyones raving about it youve done a fabulous job for the institute and the organization we had a lot of help miranda said the staff put in long hard hours to make this happen it couldnt be more perfect andrew she seemed to take a deep gulp of air i want to apologize for making things difficult i know my being here is awkward for you i wont be staying much longer tonight and ive decided to go back to florence tomorrow you dont have to change your plans for my benefit its for mine too she looked at miranda then struggled with a smile i didnt want to leave without taking a minute to tell you how much i admire what you accomplished here your parents are very proud miranda goggled before she could control it my parents yes elizabeth was just saying annie andrew said the name almost like a prayer and elise broke off to stare up at him excuse me he moved away making his way toward her she looked lost he thought in a sea of people and so lovely with her shining hair her red dress glowed like a flame throwing off heat and life among all the sober and conservative black im so glad you came he caught her hands like lifelines i dont know why i did i already feel ridiculous the dress was too short she thought it was too red it was too everything her department store earrings looked like cheap chandeliers and what had possessed her to buy shoes with rhinestone buckles she must look like a slutty pilgrim im so glad youre here he said again and ignoring the raised eyebrows kissed her why dont i just grab a tray pass drinks id fit in better that way you fit in fine come over and talk to miranda but when he turned his eyes locked with elises she stood exactly where hed left her he saw miranda touch her arm murmur something but elise only shook her head then hurried away your wife looked upset annie commented as acid churned in her stomach exwife andrew reminded her grateful to see miranda making her way toward them annie its so good to see you now i know who andrews been looking for all evening i wasnt going to come im glad you changed your mind it was rare for miranda to follow impulse but she did so now bending down to press her cheek to annies he needs you she whispered then straightened with a smile i see some people i think youd enjoy meeting andrew why dont you introduce annie to mr and mrs boldari he followed the direction of her nod and grinned yeah thanks come on annie youre going to love these people it lifted mirandas heart that warm glow shed seen in andrews eyes her spirits rose so much so that she allowed ryan to pull her into a dance when she caught a glimpse of richard his nose all but pressed to a painting of the holy family his eyes intent behind his glasses she simply turned away shed take ryans advice this time and live in the moment she was considering another glass of champagne and another dance when elizabeth found her miranda youre neglecting your duties ive spoken with several people who said theyve yet to have a word with you the exhibition isnt enough you have to follow through of course youre right she handed the champagne she hadnt yet sipped to her mother and their gazes held for one long moment ill do my duty ill do what has to be done for the institute she stepped back no she realized she was also going to do what needed to be done for herself you might have said just once tonight you might have said to me that id done a good job but i suppose it would have stuck in your throat she turned walked up the stairs to mingle with the guests on the second level is there a problem elizabeth she flicked a glance over at her husband as he came to her side then looked back up at miranda i dont know i suppose ill have to find out senator lamb would like to see you hes a big supporter of the nea yes i know who he is her voice was a shade too sharp deliberately she smoothed it out ill be happy to speak with him and then she thought she was going to deal with miranda she lost track of ryan assumed that andrew was making annie comfortable with the boldaris for an hour miranda concentrated on her role as hostess when she finally slipped off into the ladies room she was desperately relieved to find it empty too many people she thought leaning against the counter a moment she just wasnt good with so many people conversations small talk weak jokes her face was stiff from holding a smile in place then she shook herself she had nothing to whine about everything was perfect the exhibit the gala the press the response it would all go a long way to repairing the recent chinks in her reputation she should be grateful for it she would be grateful for it if she knew what to do next decisions were for tomorrow she reminded herself tomorrow after shed confronted her mother that was the only answer she decided the only logical step it was time the two of them faced off and if her mother was guilty part of a conspiracy of theft and murder she shook her head tomorrow she thought again and reached in her bag for her lipstick the explosion of sound had her hand jerking the slim gold tube clattered onto the counter her eyes locked on their twins in the mirror went wide with shock gunshots impossible even as the denial raced through her she heard the high horrified sound of a womans scream she rushed to the door knocking her bag off the counter and scattering its contents behind her outside people were shouting some were running she shoved through using hands and elbows she broke free and ran for the steps just as ryan rounded the lower landing it from upstairs it came from upstairs stay here he might have saved his breath she hiked up her skirt and was pounding up behind him he knocked aside the velvet rope that blocked the thirdfloor office level from the party area you check that way she began ill look down the hell you will if you wont stay put then youll come with me he took a firm hold of her hand doing his best to block her body with his as he started down the hall more footsteps sounded on the stairs behind them andrew leaped the last three that was a gun miranda go downstairs annie go down with her no since neither woman was going to listen ryan gestured to the left you check that way well go down here whoever fired the gun is probably long gone he said as he cautiously nudged open a door but you stay behind me what are you bulletproof she reached in under his arm and flicked on the light he simply shoved her back and stepped into the room himself to do a quick sweep satisfied it was empty he pulled her in use this office lock the door and call the police ill call them when i know what to tell them she elbowed him aside and strode down the hall to the next room he all but wrenched her arm out of its socket try to be a little less of a target dr jones they worked their way down until he spotted a faint light pooling under the door leading to her office you changed for the party here did you leave your light on no and the door should be locked its not quite closed take off your shoes excuse me take off your shoes he repeated i want you to be able to run if you have to not break an ankle in those heels saying nothing she leaned against him long enough to remove them it should have been funny she thought the way he took one holding it spike out like a weapon as they approached the door but her hand was going damp in his and she couldnt find the humor he eased to the side of the door nudged it it opened another two inches then bumped into an obstruction once again miranda reached under his arm to turn on the overheads oh my god she recognized the lower half of the filmy white gown the soft glitter of silver shoes dropping to her knees she pushed at the door with her shoulder until she could squeeze inside elise lay crumpled facedown blood trickled from a wound at the back of her head and slipped over her pale cheek shes alive miranda said quickly when she pressed her fingers to elises throat and found a fluttery pulse shes alive call an ambulance hurry here he shoved a handkerchief into her hand press that against it see if you can stop the bleeding just hurry she folded it into a pad wanting the thickness and applied pressure her gaze skimmed over rested on the bronze venus she kept in her office a copy of the donatello ryan coveted another bronze she thought dully another copy another victim miranda what andrew pushed in the door then jerked to a stop jesus oh jesus elise he was on his knees fumbling at the wound at her face is she dead oh sweet god no shes alive ryans calling for an ambulance give me your handkerchief i dont think its deep but i need to stop the bleeding she needs to be covered do you have a blanket some towels annie demanded you need to keep her warm in case shes in shock in my office theres a throw just through there annie stepped quickly over andrew i think we need to turn her over miranda pressed the fresh cloth firmly to make sure theres no other injury can you do it andrew yeah his mind had gone stone cold he reached out carefully supporting elises neck as he rolled her her eyelids fluttered i think shes coming around i dont see any blood except for the head wound he touched a finger gently to a bruise forming on her temple she must have hit her head there when she fell miranda annie stepped back into the room her eyes were dark her voice dull ryan wants you andrew and i will take care of her all right try to keep her calm if she comes around she got to her feet stopping only when annie squeezed her arm brace yourself she murmured then moved over to cover elise with the throw shell be all right andrew the ambulance is on its way miranda stepped into her office one ambulance wasnt going to be enough she thought dizzily a couple of handkerchiefs werent going to mop up all this blood it was pooling on her desk dripping down to soak into her carpet splatters of it were on the window behind her desk like sticky red rain on her desk flung onto his back with red spreading over his frilled white shirt was richard hawthorne security kept the press and the curious away from the third floor by the time the homicide team arrived the scene had been secured and elise was on her way to the hospital miranda gave her statement again and again going back over every step and lying lying she thought dully was becoming second nature no she had no idea why either richard or elise would have been in her office no she didnt know why anyone would have killed him when they finally told her she was free to leave she walked downstairs on legs that felt as fragile as glass annie sat on the bottom step hugging her elbows wont they let you leave annie yeah they said they were finished with me for now miranda glanced toward the guards flanking the archways the scatter of police roaming the hall and sat beside annie i dont know what to do with myself either i think theyre still talking to ryan i didnt see andrew they let him go with elise to the hospital oh he would have thought that was the right thing to do he still loves her i dont think so hes still hung up on her miranda why wouldnt he be then she pressed her hands to the sides of her head and im insane ashamed pitiful to be worrying about that when a mans been shot and elise is hurt you cant always control your feelings i didnt used to believe that but now i know and i used to have a good handle on mine well she sniffled rubbed her hands over her face then rose id better go home wait for ryan annie well drive you its okay ive got my heap out there ill be fine you tell andrew i hope elise is okay and ill see him around annie i meant what i said earlier he needs you annie dragged off her party earrings rubbed the blood back into her earlobes he needs to count on himself he needs to know who he is and what he wants i cant help him with that miranda and neither can you she couldnt seem to help anyone miranda thought when she was alone and staring down at her hands nothing shed touched nothing shed done over the last months had resulted in anything other than disaster she looked over her shoulder as she heard footsteps on the stairs ryan came down skirted around her then saying nothing brought her to her feet and into his arms oh god oh god ryan how many more ssh he stroked her back it was his own gun he murmured in her ear the same one i found in his room someone shot the poor bastard with his own gun there was nothing you could have done nothing i could have done she said it wearily but pulled back to stand on her own i want to go to the hospital check on elise andrews there he shouldnt be alone he wasnt it surprised miranda to see her mother in the waiting lounge staring out the window a paper cup of coffee in her hand andrew stopped pacing when she came in then shook his head and began again is there any word miranda asked him they stabilized her down in emergency x rays tests they havent come in to tell us the results the resident on duty downstairs thought concussion but they want to do a cat scan to rule out any brain damage she was out a long time she lost a lot of blood and some of it he noted stained the hem of mirandas dress you should go home andrew said ryan take her home im going to stay with you just the way youd stay with me okay okay he rested his brow against hers they stood linked while elizabeth turned from the window and studied them when she caught ryan watching her her cheeks pinkened slightly theres coffee its neither fresh nor palatable but its very strong and hot no miranda moved away from andrew stepped forward wheres father i dont know i believe he was going back to the hotel there was nothing for him to do here but youre here we need to talk excuse me dr jones all three of them turned made cooks mouth twitch guess thats pretty confusing detective cook mirandas stomach was quickly sheathed in ice i hope youre not ill ill oh oh hospital sick no i came down to talk to dr warfield once the doctors clear it to elise baffled andrew shook his head i thought you were with robbery nobody was robbed sometimes these things are connected the homicide boys will talk to her going to be a long night maybe you can tell me what you know give me a clearer picture before i talk to dr warfield detective cook is it elizabeth moved forward is it really necessary to hold an interrogation in a hospital waiting room while were waiting with some degree of distress for test results im sorry for your distress maam dr jones standfordjones yes elizabeth standfordjones youre the victims employer thats correct both richard and elise work for me in florence worked for me she amended with a faint change in color richard worked for me what did he do for you research primarily richard was a brilliant art historian he was a fount of facts and data but more he understood the spirit of the work he researched he was invaluable and dr warfield she is my lab director in florence shes a capable efficient and trustworthy scientist she used to be your daughterinlaw elizabeths gaze didnt waver nor did it flick toward her son yes weve retained a good relationship thats good most times exmothersinlaw tend to blame their sons wives for the trouble you dont see many who can work together and retain a good relationship were both professional women detective and i dont allow family difficulties to interfere with work or with my opinion of an individual im quite fond of elise anything going on between her and hawthorne going on it was said with such frigid disgust the temperature seemed to plummet what youre suggesting is insulting demeaning and inappropriate my information is that they were both single adults i dont mean any insult by asking if they were involved they were in a thirdfloor office together the party was downstairs i have no idea why either of them was in mirandas office but obviously they werent alone she moved past him when a doctor in green scrubs came to the doorway elise shes doing well he told them she has a fairly serious concussion some disorientation but the cat scan was clear and shes in stable condition elizabeth closed her eyes and the breath she released was shaky id like to see her i cleared the police in they wanted to question her as soon as possible and she agreed she became agitated when i suggested she wait until tomorrow it seemed to ease her mind to talk to them tonight im going to want some time with her cook took out his badge then nodded toward elizabeth and andrew ill wait ive got plenty of time he waited over an hour and wouldnt have gotten in to see her then if once again she hadnt insisted on making her statement cook saw a fragile woman with a livid bruise on her right temple that spread purple toward her eyes the eyes themselves were exhausted and rimmed with red but the flaws only added to her beauty her dark hair was swathed in white bandages he knew the blow had been to the back of her head and had bled profusely he imagined theyd shaved some of that glossy hair to sew her up seemed a shame youre detective im sorry i cant remember the name they gave me cook maam i appreciate you talking to me i want to help she winced as she shifted and the pain radiated through her head theyre going to give me drugs in a little while i wont be able to think clearly once they do ill try to make this fast mind if i sit here no please she looked up at the ceiling as if focusing on moving beyond the pain every time i begin i think its a bad dream it didnt really happen can you tell me what did happen everything you remember richard he shot richard he i dont even know that not for sure i didnt see i saw richard her eyes filled spilled over trailed tears down her cheeks hes dead they told me he was dead i thought maybe i dont know but they said hes dead poor richard what were you doing upstairs with him i wasnt with him i was looking for him she lifted her free hand to brush at the tears he said hed go back to the hotel whenever i wanted to leave richards not much on parties we were going to share a cab i wanted to leave dull party no she smiled a little it was a wonderful exhibit beautifully presented but i im sure you know the background by now andrew and i used to be married and it was awkward he had a date there excuse me dr warfield but my information was that you divorced him yes i did and it was final over a year ago but that doesnt stop you from feeling from feeling she ended it was awkward and depressing for me i felt obliged to stay for at least two hours elizabeths been very good to me and this was important to her miranda and i have remained somewhat cautious friends and i didnt want to leave the impression that her work didnt matter but i wanted to go and i didnt think anyone would notice by that time so you went looking for hawthorne yes he only knew a handful of people there and hes not a very social man wed agreed to leave around tenthirty so i tried to find him i expected to find him huddled in a corner or with his nose up against some map then i thought he might have gone upstairs to the library he wasnt there ah im sorry i keep losing my train of thought thats okay you take your time she closed her eyes i wandered around for a while and i saw the light in mirandas office i started to go back down but then i heard his voice i heard him shout something something like ive had enough her fingers began to tug at the sheet in agitated little plucks i walked over there were voices but i couldnt hear what they were saying was it a mans voice or a womans i dont know wearily she rubbed at the center of her forehead i just dont know it was very low only a murmur really i stood there a minute not quite sure what to do i suppose i thought he and miranda might have come up to discuss something and i didnt want to interrupt miranda it was her office so i just assumed i thought maybe id just go back alone and then i heard the shots they were so loud so sudden i was so shocked i didnt think i ran inside i think i called out i its just not clear thats all right just tell me what you remember i saw richard lying over the desk the blood everywhere the smell of it and what must have been gunpowder like a burn on the air i think i screamed i must have screamed then i turned i was going to run im so ashamed i was going to run and leave him there someone something hit me gingerly she reached around to press at the bandage on the back of her head i just remember this flash of light inside my head then nothing at all nothing until i woke up in the ambulance she was crying openly now and tried to reach the box of tissues on the table next to the bed cook handed it to her waited until shed wiped her face do you remember how long you looked for him ten or fifteen minutes i think i dont really know when you went into the office you didnt see anyone only richard she closed her eyes so that tears squeezed through her lashes only richard and now hes dead chapter twentynine it was nearly dawn when annie opened the door and found andrew in the hall he was sheetpale his eyes heavy with shadows he was still in his tux the tie loose around his neck the first stud missing the snowy shirt was marred by creases and blood elise shes going to be all right theyll keep her for observation but she was lucky concussion a few stitches theres no sign of intracranial bleeding come inside andrew sit down i needed to come to tell you i know come on in ive already made coffee she was bundled in a robe and had washed the makeup from her face but he saw how tired her eyes were have you been to bed i gave it a shot it didnt work ill make us some breakfast he closed the door watched her walk the short distance to the kitchen and open the undersized refrigerator she took out eggs bacon a frying pan she poured coffee into two thick blue mugs the early light played through the narrow windows made patterns on the floor the room smelled of coffee and carnations her feet were bare she laid bacon in the black iron skillet and soon the room was full of its scent and sound solid sunday morning sounds he thought easy homey scents annie sit down andrew youre asleep on your feet annie he took her by the shoulders turned her around i needed to go with elise tonight of course you did dont interrupt i needed to go to make sure she was all right she was my wife once so i owed her that i didnt handle the marriage well and handled the divorce less well i thought about that while i was waiting for the doctor to come out and tell us how she was i thought about that and what i might have done differently to make it work between us the answer is nothing he let out a short laugh running his hands up and down her arms nothing it used to be realizing that made me feel like a failure now it just makes me understand the marriage failed i didnt she didnt it did almost absently he bent to kiss the top of her head i waited until i was sure she was going to be all right then i came here because i had to tell you i know that andrew in support and with mild impatience she patted his arm the bacons going to burn i havent finished telling you i havent started to tell you tell me what my name is andrew and im an alcoholic he seemed to quiver once then steady ive been sober for thirty days im going to be sober for thirtyone i sat in the hospital tonight and i thought about drinking it just didnt seem to be the answer then i thought about you youre the answer i love you her eyes went damp but she shook her head im not your answer andrew i cant be she pulled away started to turn the bacon but he reached over and snapped off the flame i love you he cupped his hands over her face to hold her still part of me always has the rest of me had to grow up enough to see it i know what i feel and i know what i want if you dont have those same feelings for me and dont want what i want then you tell me you tell me straight its not going to send me out looking for a bottle but i need to know what do you want me to say she rapped one frustrated fist against his chest youre a phd im ged youre andrew jones of the maine joneses and im annie mclean from nowhere she put her hands over his but couldnt quite make herself draw his away from her face i run a bar you run the institute get a grip on yourself andrew im not interested in your snobbery right now snobbery her voice cracked with insult for gods sake you didnt answer my question he tugged until she was on her toes what do you feel for me and what do you want im in love with you and i want a miracle his smile spread slowly dimples deep in his cheeks she was quivering under his hands and his world had just gone rock steady i dont know if itll qualify as a miracle but ill do my best he picked her up what are you doing taking you to bed panic fluttered in her throat and curled all the way down to her toes i didnt say id go to bed with you you didnt say you wouldnt im taking a big chance here she grabbed the doorjamb and clung for dear life really is that so damn right you may not like my moves this time around if not youll probably turn me down when i ask you to marry me her fingers went limp as wax and slid off the wood you you could ask me now and save yourself the suspense no his eyes on hers he laid her on the bed after after annie he murmured and sank into her it was coming home it was finding treasure it was simple and it was extraordinary they werent innocent this time werent fumbling children eager and curious and all the years between then and now had given what was between them time to ripen now was like decanting wine of a fine vintage her arms came around him he was so gentle so careful so gloriously thorough his big hands smoothed over her tracing her throat her shoulders paving the way for his lips he murmured to her wonderful foolishness as he stripped out of his jacket let her help him out of his shirt then his flesh cruised along hers and made them both sigh dawn was breaking in the rosy red light that heralded storms but there in the narrow bed was peace and patience each touch each taste was taken was given with quiet joy even when she trembled when the need began to build to an ache inside her she smiled and brought his mouth to hers again he took his time stroking her body to life his own pacing it and the first time she crested arching up and up with a moan of delight he rolled with her for the sheer joy of it he traced kisses down her back over her shoulder blades down to her hips then shifted her over to nuzzle at her breasts her hands moved over him exploring testing arousing as breath thickened and the sun grew strong he slipped inside her a slow and steady rhythm savoring prolonging belonging she rose and fell with him making the climb twined with him as they reached the top holding tight when they trembled there falling with him was like drifting out of the clouds then he shifted his weight drew her against his side buried his face in her hair i still like your moves andrew she sighed against his shoulder i really like your moves he felt whole again healed i like your tattoo annie i really like your tattoo she winced oh god i forgot about it im never going to look at a butterfly in quite the same way again when she laughed and lifted her face he continued to smile its taken me a long time to figure out what i need what makes me happy give me a chance to make you happy i want to build a life and a family with you we both really screwed up the first time we werent ready no she touched his face it feels like we are now belong to me he pressed a kiss into her palm let me belong to you will you annie yes she laid her hand over his heart yes andrew i will ryan stood in mirandas office trying to picture it oh he could still imagine clearly enough the way it had looked the night before such things plant themselves on the brain and are rarely rooted out even with great effort there was a nasty stain on the carpet the windows were smeared and the dust from the crime scene investigation coated every surface how far would the bullet have propelled richards body he wondered how close to each other had he and his killer been standing close enough he thought for the bullets to have left powder burns on the tuxedo shirt close enough for hawthorne to have looked into his murderers eyes and have seen his death there ryan was damn sure of that he stepped back moved to the doorway scanned the room desk chairs window the lamp that had been switched on counter file cabinets he could see it all you shouldnt be in here mr boldari theyve taken the tape down ryan said without turning it seems the investigators got all they could from this area better we keep it closed off a while yet cook waited until ryan moved out of the doorway then shut the door no need to have dr jones see all that again is there no no need at all but you wanted to see it again i wanted to see if i could get it all clear in my mind and have you not entirely there doesnt appear to be any sign of a struggle does there detective no everything tidy but for the desk the victim and his killer would have been standing about as close as you and i are just now wouldnt you say give or take a few inches yeah he knew who pulled the trigger boldari youd met him hadnt you briefly when he arrived friday and again on the night he died never met him before that no i hadnt i wondered about that seeing as youre in art he was in art there are a great many people in various areas of the business i havent met yeah but you know its a small world you move around this place pretty tame as do you ryan murmured do you think i came up here last night and put two bullets into richard hawthorne no i dont weve got several witnesses who put you downstairs when the shots were fired ryan leaned back against the wall his skin felt sticky as if some of the nastiness in the next room had clung to him lucky for me im a sociable guy yeah of course a few of those people are related to you but there were those who werent so i figure youre clear nobody can seem to say where dr jones dr miranda jones was during the time in question ryan came off the wall quickly almost violently before he controlled it but the move had caused cooks eyes to flicker you two have gotten very friendly friendly enough that i know mirandas the last person who could kill idly cook took out a stick of gum offered it then unwrapped it for himself when ryan only continued to stare at him its funny what people can do with the right motivation and hers would be ive done a lot of thinking about that theres the bronze the one from here the one that got lifted out of a display case very slick very professional i tracked a number of burglaries with that pattern somebody knows what theyre doing somebodys damn good at their job somebody has connections so now mirandas a thief an expert art burglar or she knows one is friendly enough with one he added with a thin smile funny how the paperwork on that piece went away too even funnier how i did some checking with a foundry this place uses found out somebody else was doing some checking there somebody who claimed he was a student here at the institute gave a song and dance about checking on a bronze figure that was cast there about three years ago and that would have exactly what to do with this the name he gave at the foundry doesnt check with the records here and the bronze he was so interested in was a statue of david with sling seems he even had a sketch of it then that might have something to do with your burglary ryan inclined his head im delighted to know youre making some progress there oh i plod right along seems dr jones miranda jones taught a class on renaissance bronze figures being an expert in the field im sure shes taught several on the subject or related ones one of her students used the foundry to cast a bronze david long after the missing bronze arrived for her to test thats fascinating cook ignored the mild sarcasm in ryans tone yeah it means theres lots of little dangles wanting to be tied up the student he dropped out right after that bronze was cast and you know somebody checked with his mother said they were from here wanted to get in touch with him kid moved to san francisco a couple nights ago they fished him out of the bay im sorry to hear that youve got family in san francisco this time ryans eyes narrowed and sparked be careful detective just making a comment kid was an artist you got an art gallery out there i figured you might have known him name was mathers harrison mathers no i dont know a harrison mathers but i can check easily enough to see if we display any of his work might not be a bad idea is this mathers what youd call another dangle oh yeah just one of those things that make you scratch your head then i start thinking about that bigdeal bronze in florence the one that turned out not to be such a big deal id think dr jones would be pretty upset about that pretty pissed off at her mother too for kicking her off the project i found out somebody stole that piece went right into the storage area at the national museum over there and took it slick as spit now why would somebody want to take something risk that kind of theft for something that isnt worth more than the price of the metal arts a subjective mystery detective maybe someone took a liking to it could be but whoever did was a pro not some halfass thief pros dont waste their time unless theyve got good reason youd agree with that wouldnt you mr boldari being a professional yourself certainly damned if he didnt like this cop ryan mused i detest wasting time exactly makes me wonder what that bronze is worth to somebody if i see it detective ill do an appraisal and let you know but i can tell you if that bronze was real if it was worth millions miranda wouldnt kill for it and i think you agree ryan added being a professional yourself cook chuckled something wasnt square about the guy he thought but you had to like him no i dont think she killed anybody and i cant picture her dancing all over the world pinching pictures and statues womans got integrity pasted on her forehead thats why i know in my gut shes hiding something she knows more than shes saying and if youre friendly enough with her boldari youll convince her to tell me just what that is before somebody decides shes expendable she was asking herself just how much she could tell how much she could risk telling in the south gallery surrounded by the art of the masters she sat with her hands over her face and suffered she knew cook was upstairs shed seen him come in and like a child avoiding a lecture had slipped behind a doorway until hed passed by when her mother came in she let her hands fall into her lap i thought i might find you here oh yes miranda rose and picked up one of the champagne flutes from a huddle of them on a table reliving past glories where else would i be where else would i go i havent been able to find your brother i hope hes sleeping it was a difficult night she didnt add that he hadnt been sleeping at least not in his own bed when she left the house that morning yes for all of us im going to the hospital your fathers meeting me there hopefully elise is up to visitors and shed hoped they would release her by this afternoon give her my best ill try to stop by later this evening either the hospital or the hotel if theyve let her go please tell her shes welcome to stay at the house for as long as she likes it would be awkward yes but ill make the offer nonetheless its generous of you she it was fortunate she wasnt hurt more seriously it could have been we might have found her like richard i know youre very fond of her miranda set down the glass in the precise spot where it had been she was careful to make certain the stem of the glass fit exactly on the outline it had left on the cloth fonder i think than you ever were of your own children this is hardly the occasion for pettiness miranda she looked up then do you hate me what a ridiculous thing to say and what an inappropriate time to say it when would be an appropriate time for me to ask my mother if she hates me if this stems from the business in florence oh it goes back much farther in much deeper than what happened in florence but thatll do for now you didnt stand by me you never have all of my life ive waited for it that moment when youd finally be there why the hell werent you ever there for me i refuse to indulge you in this behavior with an icy stare elizabeth turned and started out shed never know what prompted her to ignore a lifetime of training but miranda was across the room grabbing elizabeths arm whirling her around with a violence that stunned both of them you will not walk out on me until i have an answer im sick to death of having you walk literally and figuratively away from me why couldnt you ever be a mother to me because youre not my daughter elizabeth snapped it out her eyes flaring to a blue burn you were never mine she wrenched her arm free her breath coming fast and hard as control frayed dont you dare stand there and demand from me after all ive sacrificed all ive endured because your father elected to pass his bastard off as mine bastard her world already shaky tilted away under her feet im not your daughter no you are not i gave my word that i would never tell you infuriated that shed allowed temper and fatigue to undermine her control elizabeth strode to the window stared out well youre a grown woman and perhaps you have a right to know i miranda pressed a hand to her heart because she wasnt sure it continued to beat she could only stare at the rigid back of the woman whod so suddenly become a stranger who is my mother where is she she died several years ago she was no one elizabeth added turning back the sun wasnt kind to women of a certain age in its glare miranda saw that elizabeth looked haggard almost ill then a cloud rolled over the sun and the moment was gone one of your fathers shortterm interests he had an affair his name is jones isnt it elizabeth said bitterly then waved a hand as if annoyed in this case he was careless and the woman became pregnant she was not apparently as easily shaken off as most charles had no intention of marrying her of course and when she realized that she insisted he deal with the child it was a difficult situation a quick nasty stab of pain lanced through the shock she didnt want me either with the faintest of shrugs elizabeth walked back and sat i have no idea what the woman wanted but what she chose to do was demand that charles raise you he came to me and outlined the problem my choices were to divorce him live with the scandal lose what i had begun to build here at the institute and give up my plans for my own facility or you stayed with him beneath the shock the hot edge of hurt was a simmering outrage after a betrayal like that you stayed with him i had a choice i made the one that was best for me it was not without sacrifice i had to go into seclusion lose months while i waited for you to be born the memory of that could still swim to the surface like acid when you were i had to present you as mine i resented the fact of you miranda she said evenly perhaps thats unfair but its accurate yes lets be accurate unable to bear it she turned away lets stick with the facts im not a maternal woman nor do i pretend to be elizabeth gestured again with some impatience in her voice after andrew was born i had no intention of having another child ever then through circumstances that were none of my doing i was given the responsibility of raising my husbands child as my own you were a reminder of his carelessness to me of his lack of marital integrity for charles you were a reminder of a serious miscalculation miscalculation miranda said quietly yes i suppose thats accurate too its hardly a mystery now why neither one of you could ever love me love at all if it comes to that you dont have it inside you you were well taken care of given a good home a fine education and never a moment of true affection miranda finished turning back what she saw was a woman of rigid control towering ambition who had traded emotion for advancement i beat myself up all of my life to be worthy of your affection i was wasting my time elizabeth sighed got to her feet im not a monster you were never harmed never neglected never held i did my best by you and gave you every opportunity to prove yourself in your field up to and including the fiesole bronze she hesitated then rose to open one of the bottles of water the cleaning staff had yet to clear i took your reports the x rays the documents home after id calmed down after the worst of the embarrassment faded i wasnt quite sure you could have made such blatant mistakes or that you would skew test results honesty has never been something i doubted in you oh thank you very much miranda said dryly the reports the documents were stolen out of my home safe i might not have known but i wanted something before i left to come here and i saw they were gone she poured water into a glass recapped the bottle then sipped i wanted to get your grandmothers pearls to bring them here and put them in the safedeposit box i keep at the local bank i was going to give them to you before i left why perhaps because while you were never mine you were always hers she set the glass aside i wont apologize for what ive done or the choices ive made i dont ask you to understand me any more than i have ever been able to understand you so i just live with it miranda demanded and elizabeth lifted a brow i have i will ask you to keep what weve spoken of in this room you are a jones and as such have a responsibility to uphold the family name oh yes one hell of a name it is but she shook her head i know my duties yes im sure you do i have to meet your father she picked up her bag i will discuss this with him if you like for what purpose suddenly miranda was weary too weary to worry to wonder or to care nothings really changed at all has it no when she was gone miranda let out a halflaugh and walked to the window the storm that had been threatening all day was rolling in on a blistered sky you okay she leaned back as ryan laid his hands on her shoulder how much did you hear most of it eavesdropping again she murmured sneaking in on little cats paws i dont know how to feel whatever you feel its right youre your own woman miranda you always have been i guess i have to be will you talk to your father about this what would be the point hes never seen me hes never heard me and now i know why she closed her eyes turned her cheek into his hand what kind of people are they ryan that i come from my father elizabeth the woman who gave me to them i dont know them gently he turned her until they were facetoface but i know you i feel she drew a long breath and let it come relieved for as long as i can remember ive been afraid i was like her had no real choice about being like her but im not im not shuddering once she laid her head on his shoulder i dont ever have to worry about that again im sorry for her he murmured for closing herself off to you to love miranda knew what love was now the terror and thrill of it whatever happened she was grateful that part of herself had been opened even if the lock had been picked by a thief yes so am i she held on one last moment then drew away to stand on her own im going to go to cook with richards book give me time to get to florence i didnt want to leave today not when you had all this on your mind ill leave tonight if i can manage it or first thing in the morning well cut it back to thirtysix hours that should do it i cant give you more than that i need this to be over it will be she smiled found it easier than shed imagined and no sneaking into bedrooms no riffling through jewelry boxes or safes absolutely not as soon as im finished with the carters oh for gods sake i wont steal a thing didnt i resist those pearls of your grandmothers all that lovely italian gold of elises even the pretty little locket i could have given one of my nieces id have been a hero your nieces are too young for lockets she let out a sigh and leaned her head on his shoulder again i didnt get mine until i was sixteen my grandmother gave me a very pretty heartshaped one that her mother had given to her and you put a lock of your boyfriends hair in it hardly i didnt have boyfriends shed already put her picture in it anyway and my grandfathers it was to help me remember my roots did it of course good new england stock always remembers roots im a jones she said quietly and elizabeth was right i might never have been hers but i was always my grandmothers youll have her pearls now yes and ill treasure them i lost the locket a few years ago broke my heart feeling better she straightened i need to get maintenance in here we have to put this place back in order im hoping we can open the exhibit to the public tomorrow you do that he murmured ill meet you back at the house later go straight there will you so i dont have to search you out where else would i go chapter thirty andrew whistled as he walked into the house he knew a grin was plastered on his face it had been there all day it wasnt just the sex well he thought jogging up the stairs the sex hadnt hurt it had been a long dry spell for old andrew j jones but he was in love and annie loved him back spending the day with her had been the most exciting the most peaceful the most amazing experience hed ever known it had been almost spiritual he decided with a chuckle theyd cooked breakfast together and had eaten it in bed theyd talked until his throat was raw so many words so many thoughts and feelings bursting to get out hed never been able to talk to anyone the way he could talk to annie except miranda he couldnt wait to tell miranda they were going to be married in june not a big formal wedding nothing like what he and elise had done something simple and sweet thats what annie wanted right in the backyard with friends and music he was going to ask miranda to be his best man shed get such a kick out of that he stepped into his bedroom he wanted to get out of the wrinkled mess of the tuxedo he was taking annie out to dinner and tomorrow he was buying her a ring she said she didnt need one but on that one issue he was going into override he wanted to see his ring on her finger he shrugged out of his jacket tossed it aside he vowed to shovel out his room sometime that week he and annie wouldnt be moving in after they were married the house was mirandas now the new dr and mrs jones were going house hunting as soon as they got back from their honeymoon he was going to take her to venice he was still grinning as he struggled to tug out his studs out of the corner of his eye he caught a blur of motion pain exploded in his head a burst of red light behind his eyes his knees buckled as he tried to turn tried to strike out the second blow had him crashing into a table and falling into the black the storm broke miranda was still a mile from home when the rain flooded over her windshield lightning slashed so close that its companion burst of thunder shook the car it was going to be a mean one she forced herself to slow her speed though she wanted nothing more at that moment than to be home to be dry and warm and inside fog was sneaking along the ground masking the shoulder of the road to narrow her concentration she switched off the radio shifted forward in her seat but her mind played it all back the call from florence then the mugging john carter flying out while she was delayed the bronze had been in the safe in her mothers office who had access to the safe only elizabeth but if mirandas association with ryan had taught her anything it was that locks were made to be picked richard had run tests therefore he had gained access to the bronze who had worked with him who had brought the gun to the institute and used it john she tried to imagine it but kept seeing his homely concerned face vincente loud friendly avuncular vincente could either of them have pumped two bullets into richard have struck elise and why in her office why at an event with hundreds of people wandering the lower levels why take such a risk because it had impact miranda realized because it once again put her name in the paper in a scandal because it had ruined the opening of the exhibit and overshadowed all the effort shed put into it it was personal it had to be but what had she done to create that kind of animosity and obsession who had she harmed john she thought if she was disgraced beyond repair if she was forced to resign from the institute he would be the logical choice for her replacement it would mean a promotion a larger salary more power and prestige could it be that simple or vincente hed known her the longest been the closest to her was there something shed done to cause resentment envy was it a matter of money to buy the jewels the clothes the big splashy trips that made his young wife happy who else was left giovanni and richard were dead elise was in the hospital elizabeth could that lifetime of resentment have bloomed into this kind of hate leave it for the police she told herself and rolled the worst of the tension out of her shoulders when she pulled the car to the front of the house in less than thirtysix hours she would pass this nasty ball over to cook it meant spending most of her evening working out every step she could tell him and all the steps she couldnt she picked up her briefcase richards book was inside it and she intended to read it cover to cover tonight maybe shed missed something on the one quick skim shed had time for the fact that her umbrella was in the trunk rather than on the seat beside her only proved her thoughts were too scattered and distracted for logical reasoning she used the briefcase as a shield holding it over her head as she made a dash to the porch she was soaked through anyway inside she dragged a hand through her hair to scatter the rain and called out for andrew she hadnt seen him since she left the hospital the night before but his car was parked in its usual spot it was time shed decided they too had a talk it was time she told him everything trusted him enough for that she called out again as she started upstairs damn it she wanted to get out of her wet clothes take a hot bath why wouldnt he at least answer probably sleeping she thought the man slept like the dead well he was going to have to do a lazarus because she wanted to tell him everything she could before their mother arrived andrew his door wasnt quite closed but she gave it a perfunctory knock before nudging it open the room was pitchdark and though she imagined he would curse viciously she reached for the light switch that would turn on the floor lamp she muttered an oath of her own when the lamp stayed dark the power was still on damn it he hadnt replaced the bulb again she started forward intending to give him a good shake and tripped over him andrew for gods sake in a brilliant flash of lightning she saw him at her feet still wearing the tux hed put on the night before it wasnt the first time shed come across him passed out in his clothes sprawled on the floor and stinking of liquor the anger came first one hot spurt of it that pushed her to just turn around just walk out and leave him where hed fallen then the disappointment the grief flooded in how could you do this to yourself again she murmured she crouched down hoping he wasnt so far gone that she couldnt rouse him and get him into bed it struck her suddenly that she didnt smell whiskey or the sick sweat that carried it she reached down shook him then with a sigh laid a hand on his head and felt the sticky warmth blood oh god andrew no oh please her smeared and trembling fingers probed for a pulse and the bedside lamp switched on hes not dead yet the voice was soft with a light laugh at the edges would you like to keep him alive miranda normally ryan hated to repeat himself but he let himself into elizabeths suite exactly as hed done before it wasnt the time for fancywork the rooms were silent and empty but that didnt matter to him hed have found a way around or through any occupant in the bedroom he took out the jewelry case precisely as he had two nights ago and removed the locket it was only a hunch just a kernel of ice in his gut but hed learned to follow his instincts he studied the old photographs saw no particular resemblance then again perhaps around the eyes maybe there was something around the womans eyes using a small probe he popped the elegant little oval out shed had it inscribed under her photo not her husbands hed thought she would and his blood was cool and steady as he read it miranda on the occasion of your sixteenth birthday never forget where you come from or where you wish to go gran weve got you he said quietly and slipped the locket into his pocket he was already pulling his phone out as he hurried back out to the corridor elise miranda forced herself to speak calmly to keep her eyes on elises face and not on the gun that was pointed deadcenter at her chest hes badly hurt i need to call an ambulance hell keep for a while with her free hand she tapped the neat bandage on the back of her own head i did its amazing how quickly you can bounce back from a good bash on the head you thought he was drunk didnt you her eyes glittered with delight at the thought thats really perfect if id thought of it and had time id have gotten a bottle and poured it over him just to set the scene dont worry i only hit him twice not nearly as often or as hard as i hit giovanni but then andrew didnt see me giovanni did terrified andrew would bleed to death while she did nothing miranda snatched up a tshirt from the littered floor balled it and pressed it to the wound giovanni was your friend how could you have killed him i wouldnt have had to if youd left him out of it his bloods on your hands just like andrews is right now miranda curled her fingers into her palm and richard oh richard he killed himself a faint line of irritation dug between her eyebrows he started falling apart right after giovanni falling apart piece by piece cried like a baby told me it had to stop no one was supposed to die he said well she moved her shoulders plans changed the minute he sent you that ridiculous email he was dead but you sent the others the faxes oh yes with her free hand elise twisted the delicate gold chain draped around her neck did they frighten you miranda confuse you make you wonder yes keeping her movements slow she tugged a blanket from the foot of the bed and settled it over her brother you killed rinaldi too that man was a constant annoyance he kept insisting the bronze was real as if a plumber would know anything about it he even stormed into elizabeths office babbling rambling but it made her start thinking i could tell you have the bronze but youll never be able to sell it sell it why should i want to sell it do you think this is about money she pressed a hand to her stomach as she laughed its never been about money its you its you and me miranda like its always been lightning shimmered against the glass of the window behind elise ragged forks of it digging into the sky ive never done anything to you you were born you were born with everything right at your fingertips the prized daughter of the house the eminent dr jones of the maine joneses with your highly respected parents your fucking bloodline your servants your snooty grandmother in her big house on the hill she gestured wildly turning mirandas stomach to a greasy wave as the gun swung in every direction you know where i was born in a charity ward and i lived in a lousy tworoom apartment because my father wouldnt acknowledge me wouldnt accept the responsibility i deserved everything you had and i got it but i had to work for it to beg for scholarships i made sure i went to the same colleges as you did i watched you miranda you never even knew i was there no miranda removed the cloth from andrews head she thought the flow of blood was slowing she prayed it wasnt wishful thinking then again you didnt do much socializing did you amazing how all this money made you so boring and i had to scrimp and save while all the time you were living in a nice house being waited on reaping in glory let me call an ambulance for andrew shut up shut the hell up im not finished she stepped forward jabbing with the gun you shut the hell up and listen to me or ill shoot the sorry son of a bitch here and now dont instinctively miranda shifted her body between the gun and andrew dont hurt him elise ill listen and keep your mouth shut jesus i hate that mouth of yours you talk and everybody listens like you spit gold coins she kicked a discarded shoe across the floor until it rapped solidly into the wall it should have been me it should always have been me and it would have been if the son of a bitch who got my mother pregnant who promised her everything hadnt been married to your grandmother my grandmother miranda shook her head even as her fingers slid slowly down to check andrews pulse youre trying to tell me my grandfather was your father the old bastard just couldnt keep his zipper up even into his sixties my mother was young and stupid and she thought hed ditch his ice bitch of a wife and marry her stupid stupid stupid to punctuate her feelings she snatched up an agate paperweight from the occasional table and winged it over mirandas head it boomed against the wall like a cannonball she let herself be used let him get away without paying never did one goddamn thing to make him pay so we lived hand to mouth her eyes glittered with fury as she shoved the table over another jones miranda thought frantically another careless liaison and inconvenient pregnancy she shifted to the balls of her feet braced but the gun swung back its barrel aimed toward the center of her body and elise smiled beautifully i watched you i watched you for years i planned for years you were my goal as long as i can remember i went into the same field i was every bit as good as you better i went to work for you i married your useless brother i made myself invaluable to your mother im more of a daughter to her than youve ever been oh yes miranda said with perfect sincerity you are believe me i mean nothing to her youre the centerpiece id have had your position sooner or later youd have been the one scrambling for scraps remember the david that was quite a coup for you wasnt it so you stole it had harry copy it harry was very enthusiastic its so pitifully easy to manipulate men they look at me and they think shes so delicate so lovely and all they want to do is fuck and protect she laughed again sliding her gaze down to andrew ill say this for your brother he had some good moves in bed it was a nice side benefit but breaking his heart was better watching him slide into the bottle because he couldnt figure out what hed done to turn me away poor poor andrew then her expression changed again as capricious as the lightning outside and just as volatile i was going to reel him back eventually after id finished everything finished you what a beautiful irony that would be i still will she added with a smile blooming again that cheap little number hes screwing now wont even be a memory when i move back to maine that is if i let him live theres no need to hurt him its not him elise let me call an ambulance you can keep the gun on me i wont try to get away just let me call an ambulance for him not used to begging are you but you do it well you do everything so well miranda ill think about it she cocked her head in warning as miranda rose careful i wouldnt kill you not at first but id cripple you what do you want miranda demanded what the hell do you want i want you to listen she shouted it waving the gun so that the barrel jumped from mirandas heart to her head and back again i want you to stand there and listen to what i say to do what i tell you to crawl when im finished i want it all all right how much time miranda thought frantically how much time was left before elise snapped before the gun went off im listening the david was really only practice wasnt it oh youre smart always so smart it was backup i knew i could put a chink in your reputation with it but im patient there was bound to be something bigger with the way your star was rising there was going to be something more important then there was the dark lady i knew as soon as elizabeth told me she was sending for you that there was an important piece coming in i knew this would be the one she trusted me i made certain she trusted me kowtowing to her every whim for years standjos going to be mine too she added matteroffactly ill be in the directors chair by the time im forty miranda slid her gaze to the side scanning for a weapon you look at me you look at me when i talk to you im looking at you elise im listening it was the dark lady have you ever seen a more magnificent piece anything quite so powerful no the rain was pounding like battle drums against the window no i havent you wanted her i cant blame you but you couldnt do it alone so you had richard richard was in love with me i was very fond of richard she said almost dreamily i might have married him for a while at least he was useful he could have continued to be very useful we ran the tests at night i had the combination to elizabeths safe it was ridiculously easy all i had to do was arrange for you to be delayed i did specify that you werent to be seriously hurt i wanted to keep you healthy until i could ruin you richard made the copy as i said he was very useful i did some of the work myself we wanted it to pass basic tests even to fool some of the more involved ones you were perfect miranda you knew when you saw it just as i did it was unmistakable you could feel it couldnt you the power of that piece the glory in it yes i could feel it she thought she heard andrew stir but couldnt be sure you leaked the project to the press elizabeth is so strict about such things rules and regulations proper channels integrity she reacted exactly as expected it didnt hurt that i gave her subtle little nudges all the while claiming that i was sure you didnt mean it youd just gotten caught up you were so enthusiastic i was your champion miranda i was brilliant the phone rang while they stared at each other and elise smiled slowly well just let the machine pick that up shall we we have so much more to talk about why the hell didnt she answer ryan fought his way through the storm tires skidding on wet pavement as he pushed for speed shed left the institute to go home she wasnt picking up her cell phone or the phone at the house steering onehanded he punched in information and got the number for the hospital elise warfield he demanded shes a patient dr warfield was released this evening ice gathered in his gut again he punched the accelerator sending the car into a violent fishtail going against a lifetime of habit he called the police get me detective cook im going to need the copies miranda where are they i dont have them now you know thats a lie and you lie so poorly i really need those copies this time elise stepped forward we want this all tidy in the end dont we why should i give them to you youre going to kill me either way of course i am its the only logical step isnt it but she shifted the gun and stopped mirandas heart i wouldnt have to kill andrew dont quickly miranda held up her hands a gesture of surrender please give me the copies and i wont theyre hidden out in the lighthouse away from andrew she thought oh perfect can you guess where i was conceived elise laughed until tears swam in her eyes my mother told me how he took her there to paint her then seduced her how wonderful that it all ends where it really began elise gestured with the gun after you niece miranda with one last glance at her brother she turned she knew the gun was aimed at her back at her spine she imagined in a larger space she might have a chance if she could distract elise for just an instant she could try she was bigger stronger and she was sane the police are closing in she told elise keeping her eyes straight ahead cooks determined to close this case he wont give up after tonight the case will be closed keep moving you always walk with such a purposeful stride miranda lets be consistent if you shoot me how will you explain it im hoping that wont be necessary but if it is ill put the gun in andrews hand his finger on the trigger and fire it again itll be messy but in the end the logical conclusion would be you argued over this business you struck him he shot you its your gun after all yes i know it couldnt have been easy for you to hit yourself give yourself a concussion after you killed richard a bump on the head a few stitches i got a lot of sympathy out of it and it goes a long way to putting me in the clear how could a fragile little thing like me work up the guts to fake an attack like that she jabbed the gun into the base of mirandas spine but you and i know i can do a lot more yes we do well need a flashlight get it you still keep it in the second drawer on the left i imagine such a creature of habit miranda removed the flashlight flicking it on while testing its weight it could be a weapon all she needed was the opportunity she opened the back door and stepped out into the driving rain she thought of running of taking a leap into the gathering fog but the gun was still pressed into her back shed be dead before she took the first step looks like were about to get very wet keep going hunched against wind and rain she walked steadily toward the point distance was imperative now she could hear the waves crashing wildly stirred by the storm every slash of lightning threw the cliffs into sharp relief your plan wont work out here elise keep going keep going it wont work if you use that gun on me now theyll know there was someone else here theyll know it couldnt have been andrew and theyll find you shut up what do you care youll be dead anyway youll never have everything i have thats really what you want isnt it the name the pedigree the position itll never be yours youre wrong ill have it all instead of just being ruined youll be dead richard kept a book she used the circling stream of light from the tower on the point to guide her now shifting her grip on the flashlight he wrote it all down everything he did liar everything elise its all recorded theyll know i was right dead or alive ill still have the glory so everything youve done is for nothing bitch you lying bitch but i lie so poorly teeth gritted she swung around the force of the blow struck elise on an upflung arm and sent her sprawling miranda leaped on her grabbing for the gun shed been wrong she realized sanity wasnt an advantage elise fought like an animal teeth snapping nails gouging she felt hot pain on her throat a spurt and trickle of blood as they rolled over the rocky ground toward the edge of the cliffs ryan shouted her name as he ran into the house shouting it again and again as he pounded up the stairs when he found andrew terror squeezed his heart into a hot ball he heard the crash of thunder then the echoing blast of gunshots with fear drenching his skin he shoved through the terrace doors there silhouetted by the fire flash of lightning he saw two figures tangled on the cliffs even as he offered up the first prayer as he climbed over the rail to leap down he saw them go off her breath was sobbing burning her throat there was pain everywhere the stench of blood and fear she gripped the slippery butt of the gun tried to twist it away it bucked in her hand once twice and the fury of sound punched pain in her ears someone was screaming screaming screaming she tried to dig her heels in for purchase and found her legs dangling in space in the blasts and jolts of light she could see elises face over hers contorted mouth wide teeth bared eyes blind with madness in them for one horrified second she saw herself from somewhere she heard her name a desperate call as if in answer she twisted shoved viciously with elise clawing at her they tumbled over the edge she could hear a woman laughing or perhaps it was weeping as she tore at rock and dirt with her fingers felt herself dragged down a thousand prayers babbled in her mind a thousand jumbled images rock bit at her skin as her body fought to cling to the wall of the cliff panting wild with fear she looked over her shoulder saw elises white face dark eyes saw her even now release her hold on rock to aim the gun and then she fell trembling sobbing miranda pressed her cheek against the cold face of the cliff her muscles were screaming her fingers burning below her the sea she had always loved crashed impatiently and waited her stomach shuddered spewing a dizzying nausea into her throat fighting it back she lifted her face to the pounding rain again stared at the edge just a foot above her head watched the shaft of light from the old tower slice through the dark as if to guide her she would not die this way she would not lose this way she kept her eyes focused on the goal and fought to find some small purchase with her feet she clawed her way up one sweaty inch then another before her feet slid free she was dangling by bloody fingertips when ryan bellied over the edge jesus sweet jesus miranda hang on look at me miranda look at me take my hand im slipping take my hand you have to reach up just a little he braced himself on the slick rocks and held both hands down to her i cant let go my fingers are frozen i cant let go ill fall no you wont sweat slid down his face along with the rain take my hand miranda while his head screamed with panic he grinned at her come on dr jones trust me her breath came out on a wild broken sob she pried her numb fingers from the rock and reached for his for a gutwrenching instant she felt herself hang a fingertip away from death then his hand clamped firm over hers now the other one i need both your hands oh god ryan blind now she let go when her full weight locked his arms he thought they might both go over he inched back cursing the rain that made their hands slip that seemed to turn the rock into sheer glass but she was helping him boosting herself with her feet her breath hissing with the effort as they worked she used her elbows on the ledge pressing down scraping them raw as he dragged her the last few inches over the top when she collapsed on him he wrapped her in his arms cradled her on his lap and rocked them both in the rain i saw you go over i thought you were dead i would have been her face was buried against his chest where his heart beat in hard jerky pulses from somewhere in the distance came the high pitched whine of sirens if you hadnt come i couldnt have held on much longer youd have held on he tipped her head back looked into her eyes there was blood on her face youd have held on he repeated now you can hold on to me he picked her up to carry her into the house dont let go for a while i wont epilogue but he did she should have known he would the thieving son of a bitch trust me he said and she had hed saved her life only to carelessly leave it in shambles oh hed waited miranda thought as she paced her bedroom hed stuck by her until her cuts and bruises were treated hed stayed by her side until they were sure andrew was out of danger his arms had been around her protective supportive when she related the nightmare shed been through with elise hed even held her hand while they gave cook ryans slightly edited version of events and shed let him she corroborated everything he said amended pertinent details to keep him out of a prison cell hed saved her life after all the worm then hed vanished without a word without a warning hed packed up and left she knew just where hed gone he was the only other person who knew about the storage garage hed gone after the dark lady she didnt doubt he had it by now that and the david hed probably already passed them along to one of his clients for a fat fee and was basking on some beach in the tropics sipping rum punch and oiling some blondes butt if she ever saw him again but of course she wouldnt all the business they had the legal end of business was being handled by his gallery manager the exhibit was a raging success hed benefited from that and from his involvement in helping to solve several murders she had her reputation the international press was raving about her the brave and brilliant dr jones elise had wanted to destroy her and in the end had made her but she didnt have the bronze and she didnt have ryan she had to accept she would never have either now she was alone in a big empty house with andrew being fussed over by his fiancee as he recovered he was happy and healing and she was glad of it and she was miserably envious she had her reputation all right she thought she had the institute and perhaps finally the full knowledge of her parents respect if not their love she had no life whatsoever so she would make a new one she dragged an impatient hand through her hair she would take the advice everyone was peppering her with and go on a long welldeserved vacation shed buy a bikini get a tan and have a fling oh yes thats going to happen she thought with a scowl and shoved open her terrace doors to step out into the warm spring night the flowers shed planted in big stone urns filled the air with scent the sweetness of stock the spice of dianthus the charm of verbena yes she was learning about some small and lovely things taking the time to learn to enjoy to fall into the moment white and full the moon rose over the sea cruised among the stars and gave the seascape she loved a mystic intimate glow the sea sang its rough song with an arrogance that made her yearn hed been gone for two weeks she knew he wasnt coming back in the end it was as it had always been there was something more important than miranda still shed get over it she was already on her way she would take that vacation but shed use the time right here it was here she needed to be home making the home she had never been given shed finish the garden shed have the house painted shed buy new curtains and while she would never trust another man in this lifetime at least she knew she could trust herself this moment would be more atmospheric if you were wearing a long flowing robe she didnt whirl she still had enough control for that she turned slowly he was grinning at her dressed in thiefs black and standing in her bedroom grinning jeans and a tshirt he continued though you fill them out nicely they lack the romance of a silk robe the breeze could flutter around you he stepped out on the terrace hello dr jones she stared felt his fingertips brush her cheek where a bruise had yet to fade you son of a bitch she said and rammed her fist full out into his face it knocked him back several steps had his vision wavering but his balance was good he shifted his jaw gingerly dabbed at the blood on his mouth well thats one way to say hello obviously youre not entirely pleased to see me the only way id be pleased to see you is through steel bars you bastard you used me you lied to me trust me you said and all the time you were after the bronze he worked his tongue over his gums tasted blood damn the woman had a straighton right jab thats not entirely accurate she balled her fist more than ready to use it again you went to florence didnt you you walked out of here got on a plane and went to florence for the statues of course i told you i was going to miserable thief im an excellent thief even cook thought so though hell never prove it he smiled again combed his fingers through the thick dark hair the breeze blew into sexy disorder now im a retired thief she folded her arms her left shoulder was still sore from the night on the cliffs and the ache eased when she supported it i imagine you can live very well in retirement for what you sold the bronzes for a man wouldnt have to work again in several lifetimes for what the michelangelo is worth while she clenched her fists he watched her warily as he took out a cigar shes the most exquisite thing ive ever seen the copy was good it hinted at the power of her but it couldnt capture her heart her mind her essence im amazed anyone whod seen both could mistake one for the other the dark lady sings miranda she is incomparable she belongs to the italian people she belongs in a museum where she can be seen and studied you know thats the first time youve referred to her that way before you always said it or the bronze but never her she turned to look out over the lawn where the garden hers now was glowing in the moonlight im not going to discuss pronouns its more than that and you know it youve learned something you neglected all these years in your quest for knowledge art lives he blew out a stream of smoke hows andrew now you want to discuss my family fine hes doing very well so are elizabeth and charles it was how she thought of them now theyre back to their separate lives and though elizabeth mourns the loss of the dark lady shes well enough elise hurt her more the breach of trust and affection she turned away i know how she feels i know exactly what it is to be used and discarded like that he started to step forward then changed his mind and leaned back against the wall seductions apologies cooing words werent the way with miranda in her current mood we used each other he corrected and did a damn good job of it and now were done she said flatly what do you want here i came to offer you a deal did you really why would i deal with you several reasons come to mind tell me this first why havent you given me up to the police because i keep my word is that it when she didnt answer he shrugged but it bothered him okay then on to business i have something youd like to see after tossing the cigar high over the rail he turned back into the bedroom he brought out his bag took out the carefully wrapped contents even before he uncovered it she knew and was too stunned to speak gorgeous isnt she he held the figure as a man holds a lover with great care and possessiveness it was love at first sight for me shes a woman who brings men to their knees and knows it she isnt always kind but she fascinates its no wonder murder was done for her he looked over at miranda studied the way she looked with the moonlight sprinkling over her hair and shoulders do you know when i found her stored in a metal box locked into a chest in that dusty garage where elises car was hidden by the way when i took her out and held her like this for the first time i would have sworn i heard harpsong do you believe in such things dr jones she could almost hear it herself as she had in her dreams why did you bring her here i imagined youd want to see her again youd want to be sure i had her i knew you had her she couldnt help herself moving closer she ran a fingertip over the smiling face ive known for two weeks as soon as i realized youd gone i knew she lifted her gaze from the bronze to his face his beautiful treacherous face i didnt expect you to come back actually to be honest neither did i he set the bronze on the stone table wed both gotten what wed wanted youve got your reputation youre quite a celebrity these days youve been vindicated more than vindicated youve been lauded i imagine youve had offers from book publishers and hollywood to sell your story she had and it continued to embarrass her you havent answered the question im getting to it he muttered i kept the deal i never agreed to give the david back and as to her i never agreed to anything but to find her i found her and now shes mine so theres a new deal on the table how bad do you want her it took all her willpower not to gape you mean to sell her to me you want me to buy stolen property actually i was thinking of a trade a trade she thought of the cellini he coveted and the donatello her palms began to itch what do you want for her you her rapid thoughts screeched to a halt excuse me a lady for a lady it seems fair she paced to the end of the terrace back again oh he was worse than a worm she decided you expect me to have sex with you in exchange for a michelangelo dont be stupid youre good but nobodys that good i want the whole package shes mine miranda i might even be able to claim finders privilege though its dicey but i have her and you dont in the past few days it occurred to me much to my discomfort that i want you more than i want her im not following you yes you are youre too bright not to you can have her you can put her on the mantel or give her back to florence you can use her for a doorstop i wont give a damn but youll have to give me what i want for her ive got a yen to live in this house there was such a terrible pressure in her chest you want to live here he narrowed his eyes you know dr jones i dont think youre pretending to be thick you just dont get it yes i want to live in this house its a good spot to raise children look at that you went white as a ghost god thats one of the things i love about you youre always so shocked when someone interrupts the logic and i love you miranda beyond sense she made some sound it couldnt be construed as words as her heart staggered in her chest stumbled fell he crossed to her amused now rather than panicked she hadnt moved a muscle i really have to insist on children miranda im irish and italian what else would you expect youre asking me to marry you im working my way up to it it might surprise you that its not any easier for me than it is for you i said i love you i heard you damn stubborn he cut himself off inhaled sharply you want the bronze dont you before she could answer he caught her chin in his hand youre in love with me when her brows came together he grinned dont bother to deny it if you werent youd have turned me over in a heartbeat when you realized id gone after her for myself ive gotten over it liar he lowered his mouth just to nibble at hers take the deal miranda you wont regret it youre a thief retired he molded her hip with one hand reached into his pocket with the other here lets make it official she struggled out of the kiss and jerked her hand free when he started to slip the ring onto it the ring she noted with surprise and delight hed given her once before dont be so pigheaded he took her hand uncurled her fingers and pushed the ring into place take the deal now she recognized the pressure in her chest it was her heart beating again did you pay for the ring jesus yes i paid for the ring she let herself consider it watched it wink and sparkle and let him sweat she thought she hoped ill give her back to italy explanations of how i came by her might be awkward well think of something take the deal damn it how many children his smile spread slowly five she snorted out a laugh please two three with an option three final done he started to lower his head but she slapped a hand on his chest im not finished you would be honey if i kissed you he said with just enough arrogance to make her fight back a grin no side work she said primly whatsoever for any reason he winced for any reason there might be a good one for any reason im retired he muttered but had to rub the ache in his chest no side work you hand over to me any and all fake identification youve accumulated over your checkered career all but he caught himself fine he could always get more should circumstances call for it next that should do it she touched his cheek then framed his face i love you beyond sense she murmured cherishing his words enough to give them back to him ill take the deal ill take you but that means youre taking me the jones curse im bad luck dr jones he turned his lips into her palm your lucks about to change trust me
